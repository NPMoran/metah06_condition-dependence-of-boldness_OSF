Fish were confined to the pool where they were released, and acclimated to the tank for at least 8 h before an experimental trial, allowing recovery from any stress caused by the transfer (Barton & Iwana 1991)....During an experimental trial, screens were removed so that one individual could move among all habitat patches except the pool containing the other fish. If the individual entered a riffle-pool complex, five tubifex worms were immediately released overhead and approximately 0.1m upstream ofthe fish. As long as the individual remained in the riffle-pool complex, five tubifex worms were released into the patch at 5-min intervals. This simulated an environment where unique microhabitat characteristics were strongly associated with foraging success (no food was available in pools or mazes). An observer recorded the amount of time (min) juveniles spent in each patch and where theymoved to when they abandoned a patch.",8,25.1,18.47,,,11,0.4,0.67,,,,,,,S0951,NA,NA,NA,positive,no,Table 1,table,,,

Such open-field tests were originally developed to determine the locomotor activity levels, exploration willingness, and anxiety of vertebrates (Denenberg 1969; Prut and Belzung 2003). Motion detector software (CamAlert 2.9.23, Max Christian Pohle) screened for movements once per second, and whenever movement was detected a picture was taken. Conversion
software (PowerBatch 6.1.2.2, UniDream Marketing Technologies Inc) was used to convert the pictures taken into a video file. Using Bug Tracer Program (Version C, Robert Winkler, based on a MATLAB motion detection script by Lokesh Peddireddi), we reconstructed the path of the beetle to derive 1) the distance a beetle covered (referred to as covered distance hereafter), 2) the relative amount of movements, 3) the number of turning angles <90°, 4) the variance of turning angles, and 5) the relative amount of movements in the inner area of a Petri dish (inner area movements) within 1 h.
