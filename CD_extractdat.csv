Fish were confined to the pool where they were released, and acclimated to the tank for at least 8 h before an experimental trial, allowing recovery from any stress caused by the transfer (Barton & Iwana 1991)....During an experimental trial, screens were removed so that one individual could move among all habitat patches except the pool containing the other fish. If the individual entered a riffle-pool complex, five tubifex worms were immediately released overhead and approximately 0.1m upstream ofthe fish. As long as the individual remained in the riffle-pool complex, five tubifex worms were released into the patch at 5-min intervals. This simulated an environment where unique microhabitat characteristics were strongly associated with foraging success (no food was available in pools or mazes). An observer recorded the amount of time (min) juveniles spent in each patch and where theymoved to when they abandoned a patch.",8,25.1,18.47,,,11,0.4,0.67,,,,,,,S0951,NA,NA,NA,positive,no,Table 1,table,,,

Indices of general motor activity were calculated by following the movements of a single fish and counting the number of times it moved from one block to another over a 5 min period.

Ambit values could range from 3 (the fish remained in the same block for 5 min) to 16 (the fish visited each block in the tank at least once during 5 min). Activity levels and activity ambits of 2 individuals were measured in conjunction with each 10 min set of fish location data. Activity scores and spatial positions were measured during both isothermal and stratified conditions. For Expts 1 and 2, pollock behavior was monitored for 4 d.

Such open-field tests were originally developed to determine the locomotor activity levels, exploration willingness, and anxiety of vertebrates (Denenberg 1969; Prut and Belzung 2003). Motion detector software (CamAlert 2.9.23, Max Christian Pohle) screened for movements once per second, and whenever movement was detected a picture was taken. Conversion
software (PowerBatch 6.1.2.2, UniDream Marketing Technologies Inc) was used to convert the pictures taken into a video file. Using Bug Tracer Program (Version C, Robert Winkler, based on a MATLAB motion detection script by Lokesh Peddireddi), we reconstructed the path of the beetle to derive 1) the distance a beetle covered (referred to as covered distance hereafter), 2) the relative amount of movements, 3) the number of turning angles <90°, 4) the variance of turning angles, and 5) the relative amount of movements in the inner area of a Petri dish (inner area movements) within 1 h.

into a labelled plastic bag containing sea water and photographed
against a 1 cm grid for the measurement of body
size. Fish were then released onto individual patch reefs
(25   20   15 cm) positioned 3 m from the reef edge (2 m
apart) within 2 h of conditioning. Patch reefs were composed
of a combination of live and dead Pocillopora damicornis, a
bushy hard coral. A fine mesh cage was placed over the
patch reef for 4060 min to prevent predation during
acclimation to their new habitat.
(c) Behavioural assessment
Following acclimation, the behaviour of fish was quantified for
3 min following previously developed protocols [17,28,33,34].
Briefly, the behaviour of each fish was assessed by a scuba
diver positioned approximately 1 m away from the patch. A
magnifying glass (4 ) aided the assessment of bite rates and
space use over the 3 min focal animal sampling period for
each fish. Four aspects of activity and behaviour were assessed:
(i) bite rate; (ii) total distance moved (cm); (iii) maximum
distance ventured from the habitat patch (cm); and (iv) boldness
(recorded as a variable on a continuous scale from 0 to 3,
where 0 was hiding in hole and seldom emerging; 1 was
retreating to a hole when scared and taking more than 5 s to
re-emerge, weakly or tentatively striking at food; 2 was
shying to shelter when scared but quickly emerging, with purposeful
strikes at food; and 3 was not hiding when scared,
exploring around the coral patch and striking aggressively at
food). At the end of the 3 min observation period, the fish
were approached with a pencil, and the fishs reaction and
latency to emerge from shelter was taken into account in the
assessment of boldness. This measure of boldness has been
found to be repeatable between observers, consistent in the
short term for newly settled damselfish and related to survival
in the field ([17]; M. I. McCormick 2009, unpublished data).",101,2.211931,0.686979348,0.068357,,103,1.936305,0.687851275,0.067776,,,,,,S1392,NA,NA,NA,positive,no,"Lonnstedt, O.; McCormick, M.
