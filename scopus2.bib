abstract={Diabetes is one of the most common metabolic disorders in the world and the prevalence of diabetes in adults has been increasing in the last decades. In particular, urbanization in developing countries has driven dramatic changes in lifestyle and these rapid transitions are accompanied by increases in risk factors for noncommunicable diseases including type-2 diabetes (T2DM). Although the changes in prevalence result in part from increased rates of obesity in those individuals with a genetic predisposition to T2DM, the recent increases in T2DM rates suggests that other environmental factors are key contributors to disease susceptibility. In this context, extensive evidence from human cohorts and experimental animal models has now clearly established a link between the early life nutritional environment and later risk in offspring for a range of cardiometabolic disorders. This process, preferentially called developmental programming, has shown that maternal, and more recently paternal nutrition, plays a key role in metabolic programming of the offspring. Although the mechanisms remain poorly defined, they likely involve epigenetics, as epigenetic dysregulation is associated with several components of T2DM risk, including altered feeding behavior and insulin secretion and action and may also contribute to transgenerational transmission of T2DM risk. This review will cover the current human and experimental evidence, potential mechanisms for programming of T2DM, and interventions strategies during the early period of developmental plasticity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved..},

abstract={Physiology, lifestyle choices, and maternal nutrition before and during pregnancy have long been known to mediate fetal growth, development, and future health (. fetal programming of adult disease). Postnatal environmental cues, including infant nutrition, have also been demonstrated to induce powerful, lasting programming effects on growth trajectories, body composition, tissue differentiation, and functional development, as well as long-term health, performance, and disease risks until old age. Hence, improvements of nutrition and metabolism during the first 1000days of life, including the 270days of pregnancy and two times 365days of first two postnatal years, offer particular opportunities for preventive metabolic programming through dietary intervention because of a high degree of developmental plasticity during this early developmental period. However, preventive opportunities are not strictly limited to this 1000day window, since there is evidence for lasting programming effects of nutrition, before pregnancy as well as after the age of 2years. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved..},

abstract={Summary: Social learning-learning influenced by observation of, or interaction with, other animals -allows individuals to acquire information, concerning, for instance, the location and quality of food, mates, predators, rivals, and pathways, as well as foraging techniques, vocalizations and a variety of social behavior. Intelligence can be broadly defined as a cross-domain measure of cognitive ability in learning, problem-solving and abstract reasoning, characterized by behavioral flexibility. Trends in vertebrate brain size evolution commonly follow simple allometric scaling rules, with individual brain regions evolving in concert with each other. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that cumulative culture and high-fidelity copying are mutually reinforcing. Currently, the nature of the relationship between social learning, brain size, and cognition is poorly understood. Theoretical models have shown that social learning is not always beneficial and can be costly, due to the risks of copying errors, receiving bad information, and information becoming outdated in a changing environment. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

abstract={Clinical and epidemiological evidence suggests that lifestyle factors, including nutrition, may influence the chances of developing of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and also likely affect the aging process. Whereas it is clear that high-fat diets are increasing both body weight and the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, to date, there have been very few studies comparing diets high with different sources of calories (i.e., high fat versus high protein versus high carbohydrates) to determine whether dietary composition has importance beyond the known effect of high caloric intake to increase body weight, AD pathology and cognitive deficits. In the current study we examined the effects that different diets high in carbohydrate, protein or fat content, but similar in caloric value, have on the development of cognitive impairment and brain pathology in wild-type and Tg AD model mice. The results demonstrate that long term feeding with balanced diets similar in caloric content but with significant changes in the source of calories, all negatively influence cognition compared to the control diet, and that this effect is more pronounced in Tg animals with AD pathology. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Individual nutritional status may increase marginal foraging costs and potentially drive animal foraging strategies. Here, we investigated how it might affect foraging strategies of the shelter-building spider Hingstepeira folisecens (Hingston 1932) (Araneidae). This spider can catch prey using two strategies with different relative costs: ‘pulling’ (higher energy expenditure) and ‘pursuing’ (lower energy expenditure). We conducted experiments by offering prey at a fixed distance from the shelter entrance to investigate if spiders with lower nutritional status would exhibit riskier but less costly foraging behaviours more frequently than spiders with better status. The nutritional status did not affect the foraging behaviours adopted by H. folisecens. Additionally, the frequency of both foraging behaviours was similar. Therefore, our results did not provide any evidence that individual nutritional status is a factor driving the selection of foraging behaviours in H. folisecens. We suggest that the malnourished spiders should adopt additional strategies to compensate for the costs of pulling behaviour, especially when prey is far from the shelter. Furthermore, it is possible that other factors, like relative prey size in relation to web size, can help us to understand the threshold that determines when such individuals must adopt one of two possible behaviours. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Nutritional ketosis has been proven effective for seizure disorders and other neurological disorders. The focus of this study was to determine the effects of ketone supplementation on anxiety-related behavior in Sprague-Dawley (SPD) and Wistar Albino Glaxo/Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats. We tested exogenous ketone supplements added to food and fed chronically for 83 days in SPD rats and administered sub-chronically for 7 days in both rat models by daily intragastric gavage bolus followed by assessment of anxiety measures on elevated plus maze (EPM). The groups included standard diet (SD) or SD + ketone supplementation. Low-dose ketone ester (LKE; 1,3-butanediol-acetoacetate diester, ~10 g/kg/day, LKE), high dose ketone ester (HKE; ~25 g/kg/day, HKE), beta-hydroxybutyrate-mineral salt (βHB-S; ~25 g/kg/day, KS) and βHB-S + medium chain triglyceride (MCT; ~25 g/kg/day, KSMCT) were used as ketone supplementation for chronic administration. To extend our results, exogenous ketone supplements were also tested sub-chronically on SPD rats (KE, KS and KSMCT; 5 g/kg/day) and on WAG/Rij rats (KE, KS and KSMCT; 2.5 g/kg/day). At the end of treatments behavioral data collection was conducted manually by a blinded observer and with a video-tracking system, after which blood βHB and glucose levels were measured. Ketone supplementation reduced anxiety on EPM as measured by less entries to closed arms (sub-chronic KE and KS: SPD rats and KSMCT: WAG/Rij rats), more time spent in open arms (sub-chronic KE: SPD and KSMCT: WAG/Rij rats; chronic KSMCT: SPD rats), more distance traveled in open arms (chronic KS and KSMCT: SPD rats) and by delayed latency to entrance to closed arms (chronic KSMCT: SPD rats), when compared to control. Our data indicates that chronic and sub-chronic ketone supplementation not only elevated blood βHB levels in both animal models, but reduced anxiety-related behavior. We conclude that ketone supplementation may represent a promising anxiolytic strategy through a novel means of inducing nutritional ketosis. © 2016 Ari, Kovács, Juhasz, Murdun, Goldhagen, Koutnik, Poff, Kesl and D’Agostino.},

abstract={Abstract: Animals generally adjust their behavior in response to bodily state (e.g., size and energy reserves) to optimize energy intake in relation to mortality risk, weighing predation probability against the risk of starvation. Here, we investigated whether brown trout Salmo trutta adjust their behavior in relation to energetic status and body size during a major early-life selection bottleneck, when fast growth is important. Over two consecutive time periods (P1 and P2; 12 and 23 days, respectively), food availability was manipulated, using four different combinations of high (H) and low (L) rations (i.e., HH, HL, LH, and LL; first and second letter denoting ration during P1 and P2, respectively). Social effects were excluded through individual isolation. Following the treatment periods, fish in the HL treatment were on average 15–21 % more active than the other groups in a forced open-field test, but large within-treatment variation provided only weak statistical support for this effect. Furthermore, fish on L-ration during P2 tended to be more actively aggressive towards their mirror image than fish on H-ration. Body size was related to behavioral expression, with larger fish being more active and aggressive. Swimming activity and active aggression were positively correlated, forming a behavioral syndrome in the studied population. Based on these behavioral traits, we could also distinguish two behavioral clusters: one consisting of more active and aggressive individuals and the other consisting of less active and aggressive individuals. This indicates that brown trout fry adopt distinct behavioral strategies early in life. Significance statement: This paper provides information on the state-dependence of behavior in animals, in particular young brown trout. On the one hand, our data suggest a weak energetic state feedback where activity and aggression is increased as a response to short term food restriction. This suggests a limited scope for behavioral alterations in the face of starvation. On the other hand, body size is linked to higher activity and aggression, likely as a positive feedback between size and dominance. The experiment was carried out during the main population survival bottleneck, and the results indicate that growth is important during this stage, as 1) behavioral compensation to increase growth is limited, and 2) growth likely increases the competitive ability. However, our data also suggests that the population separates into two clusters, based on combined scores of activity and aggression (which are positively linked within individuals). Thus, apart from an active and aggressive strategy, there seems to be another more passive behavioral strategy. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={Antipredator responses often involve changes in several phenotypic traits and these changes interactively influence fitness. However, gaining insight into how the overall fitness effect of the overall response comes about is notoriously difficult. One promising avenue is to manipulate a single defensive trait and observe how that modifies fitness as well as the expression of other inducible responses. In chemically-defended animals, toxins are likely to be costly to produce but it is still unknown how their depletion influences other characteristics. In the present study, we artificially depleted bufadienolide toxin stores in common toad (Bufo bufo) tadpoles, and assessed the effect of this with respect to the interaction with predator presence and limited food availability. We found that toxin depletion in tadpoles did not significantly affect any of the measured life-history traits. Tadpoles in the predator treatment exhibited an elevated development rate, although this was only apparent when food availability was limited. Also, body mass at metamorphosis was lower in tadpoles exposed to chemical cues indicating a predation threat and when food availability was limited. These results provide evidence that, in larval common toads, the expression of inducible defences may incur fitness costs, whereas chemical defences are either expressed constitutively or, if inducible, elevated toxin production has negligible costs. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London},

abstract={Avoiding predators most often entails a food cost. For the Scandinavian brown bear (Ursus arctos), the hunting season coincides with the period of hyperphagia. Hunting mortality risk is not uniformly distributed throughout the day, but peaks in the early morning hours. As bears must increase mass for winter survival, they should be sensitive to temporal allocation of antipredator responses to periods of highest risk. We expected bears to reduce foraging activity at the expense of food intake in the morning hours when risk was high, but not in the afternoon, when risk was low. We used fine-scale GPS-derived activity patterns during the 2 weeks before and after the onset of the annual bear hunting season. At locations of probable foraging, we assessed abundance and sugar content, of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), the most important autumn food resource for bears in this area. Bears decreased their foraging activity in the morning hours of the hunting season. Likewise, they foraged less efficiently and on poorer quality berries in the morning. Neither of our foraging measures were affected by hunting in the afternoon foraging bout, indicating that bears did not allocate antipredator behavior to times of comparably lower risk. Bears effectively responded to variation in risk on the scale of hours. This entailed a measurable foraging cost. The additive effect of reduced foraging activity, reduced forage intake, and lower quality food may result in poorer body condition upon den entry and may ultimately reduce reproductive success. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={Aggressive interactions, and their consequences, are the most important causes of poor welfare in piglets. Aggressive behaviour can be modulated by the prenatal and neonatal environment in several species. Commercially kept pregnant sows are often subjected to food restriction, which can compromise their welfare. Limited information is available on the consequences of sow hunger during pregnancy on welfare outcomes for their piglets. High fibre diets can mitigate the feeling of hunger and, consequently, it may improve welfare and productivity measures. The aim of this study was to assess the consequences of feeding pregnant gilts with high fibre diets (HFD) on agonistic behaviour, as manifested by skin lesions, and indicators of fear in their piglets at weaning. Twenty-two pregnant gilts were fed either HFD, 12.86% of crude fibre, 2.4 kg per day (N = 14), or low fibre diet (LFD), 2.53% of crude fibre, 2.0 kg per day (N = 8). During lactation, both treatments received the same diet, ad libitum. We investigated the impact of HFD on behaviour and performance measures (birth weight, average daily gain, weaning weight, see S3 File) in the offspring. Skin lesions were evaluated before and after weaning in 156 piglets (100 HFD and 56 LFD), and 142 piglets were subjected to an open field test and a novel object test (87 HFD and 55 LFD). We found no treatment effect on the performance measures. Piglets born from gilts that received HFD had fewer skin lesions before weaning (D28) than the offspring of LFD gilts, while no difference was found during days 29 and 30. In the open field and novel object tests, there was no treatment effect on the behaviour of piglets. The improved skin health at weaning in piglets of sows fed HFD suggests less agonistic interactions amongst these littermates than in piglets of sows fed LFD. © 2016 Bernardino et al.

abstract={Circadian time-place learning (TPL) is the ability to remember both the place and biological time of day that a significant event occurred (e.g., food availability). This ability requires that a circadian clock provide phase information (a time tag) to cognitive systems involved in linking representations of an event with spatial reference memory. To date, it is unclear which neuronal substrates are critical in this process, but one candidate structure is the hippocampus (HPC). The HPC is essential for normal performance on tasks that require allocentric spatial memory and exhibits circadian rhythms of gene expression that are sensitive to meal timing. Using a novel TPL training procedure and enriched, multidimensional environment, we trained rats to locate a food reward that varied between two locations relative to time of day. After rats acquired the task, they received either HPC or SHAM lesions and were re-tested. Rats with HPC lesions were initially impaired on the task relative to SHAM rats, but re-attained high scores with continued testing. Probe tests revealed that the rats were not using an alternation strategy or relying on light-dark transitions to locate the food reward. We hypothesize that transient disruption and recovery reflect a switch from HPC-dependent allocentric navigation (learning places) to dorsal striatum-dependent egocentric spatial navigation (learning routes to a location). Whatever the navigation strategy, these results demonstrate that the HPC is not required for rats to find food in different locations using circadian phase as a discriminative cue. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={We refer to hospitalized convicted hunger strikers in Padua Hospital who decided to fast for specific reasons, often demanding, to be heard by the judge, to complain about the existing custodial situation or to claim unjust treatment. The medical ethics of hunger strikers are debated because the use of force feeding by physicians is widely condemned as unethical, but courts, in Italy, sometimes order to transfer the convicted person to hospital and oblige healthcare practitioners to perform forcible feeding. This can engender a profound insecurity for the physicians taking action on the one hand, while preventing patients from fully availing themselves of this principle of self-determination on the other. Physicians are mainly concerned about how to manage this situation and they may request ethical consultation. When it comes to managing hospitalized hunger strikers, the ethics consultant may be able to facilitate the relationship between physicians and hunger strikers, enhance the latter’s trust in the former, ensuring that strikers are aware of the risks associated with their fasting, and helping them to arrive of their own free will at the right decision concerning their behavior and their demands. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Riparian disturbance often yields stream amphibian declines, yet some populations persist at low densities in impaired ecosystems. Understanding behaviors of individuals that select to occupy degraded habitat provides important insight into amphibian declines and may identify effective targets for management. Our objective was to evaluate whether fine-scale habitat selection behaviors and responses to environmental cues differed between individuals inhabiting disturbed versus undisturbed habitats. Specifically, we evaluated habitat selection and movement biases by larval Desmognathus quadramaculatus (Black-bellied Salamanders) from streams with and without riparian forest cover to different habitat cues. In a laboratory setting, we observed habitat selection with respect to light, a potential predator, and refuge, and also recorded exploratory movement to determine if salamanders occupying deforested stream reaches exhibited bold behavioral syndromes. We found that salamanders did not exhibit correlated behaviors indicative of bold or shy behavioral syndromes, but individuals from deforested stream reaches were less responsive to light. Secondly, we evaluated reactive behaviors by exposing salamanders to different light regimes. Individuals from deforested reaches exhibited greater reactivity to match their habituated light regime. Individuals originating from deforested habitats had relatively poor body conditions, indicating that individuals from deforested streams may experience additional costs relative to those from forested habitats. Despite demonstrated declines in abundance of aquatic salamanders following riparian disturbance, our results indicated that individuals that exhibit high behavioral plasticity are capable of inhabiting altered stream habitats and may represent the future of populations in disturbed areas. © 2015.

Metacognition refers to the processes which enable individuals to access, understand, and integrate their ideas about the mental states of themselves and others, and then use that information to recognize and respond adaptively to psychological challenges. Borderline personality disorder is believed to be amenable to psychotherapy, but few of the established treatment protocols specifically target metacognitive capacity.

abstract={Background/Aims: Prolonged fasting (PF) was shown to be of great potency to promote optimal health and reduce the risk of many chronic diseases. This study sought to determine the effect of PF on the endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-mediated angiogenesis in the ischemic brain and cerebral ischemic injury in mice. Methods: Mice were subjected to PF or periodic PF after cerebral ischemia, and histological analysis and behavioral tests were performed. Mouse EPCs were isolated and examined, and the effects of EPC transplantation on cerebral ischemic injury were investigated in mice. Results: It was found that PF significantly increased the EPC functions and angiogenesis in the ischemic brain, and attenuated the cerebral ischemic injury in mice that was previously subjected to cerebral ischemia. Periodic PF might reduce cortical atrophy and improve long-term neurobehavioral outcomes after cerebral ischemia in mice. The eNOS and MnSOD expression and intracellular NO level were increased, and TSP-2 expression and intracellular O2 - level were reduced in EPCs from PF-treated mice compared to control. In addition, transplanted EPCs might home into ischemic brain, and the EPCs from PF-treated mice had a stronger ability to promote angiogenesis in ischemic brain and reduce cerebral ischemic injury compared to the EPCs from control mice. The EPC-conditioned media from PF-treated mice exerted a stronger effect on cerebral ischemic injury reduction compared to that from control mice. Conclusion: Prolonged fasting promoted EPC-mediated ischemic angiogenesis and improved long-term stroke outcomes in mice. It is implied that prolonged fasting might potentially be an option to treat ischemic vascular diseases. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract={Behavioral plasticity is a key feature allowing animals to broaden their dietary niche when novel food resources become available, and long-fingered bats provide an appropriate model system to study the underpinnings of behavioral plasticity, since although generally being an insectivorous species, some individuals have been reported to catch fish. Aiming to get insight into the origin of fishing behavior in long-fingered bats, we studied in the field the differences in sensorial and mechanical reactions to insect-like (stationary) and fish-like (temporary) prey stimuli between well-known piscivorous and strictly insectivorous individuals. Both piscivorous and insectivorous individuals exhibited a qualitatively similar reaction to temporary target stimuli (longer and deeper dips and terminal echolocation phase skewed towards buzz I compared to stationary stimuli). Nevertheless, the quantitative differences observed in the sensorial and mechanical features (the intensity of the shift was significantly greater in piscivorous than in insectivorous individuals) show that piscivorous individuals have honed their capture technique likely enhancing the fishing success. Thus, our results suggest that the fishing technique was developed from a primary reaction shared by all long-fingered bats. All individuals seem to be mechanically and sensorially adapted to detect and capture fish, although under appropriate environmental conditions, they would further improve their technique by experience and/or social learning. © 2016 Aizpurua et al.

abstract={Chill susceptible insects like Drosophila lose the ability to regulate water and ion homeostasis at low temperatures. This loss of hemolymph ion and water balance drives a hyperkalemic state that depolarizes cells, causing cellular injury and death. The ability to maintain ion homeostasis at low temperatures and/or recover ion homeostasis upon rewarming is closely related to insect cold tolerance. We thus hypothesized that changes to organismal ion balance, which can be achieved in Drosophila through dietary salt loading, could alter whole animal cold tolerance phenotypes. We put Drosophila melanogaster in the presence of diets highly enriched in NaCl, KCl, xylitol (an osmotic control) or sucrose (a dietary supplement known to impact cold tolerance) for 24 h and confirmed that they consumed the novel food. Independently of their osmotic effects, NaCl, KCl, and sucrose supplementation all improved the ability of flies to maintain K+ balance in the cold, which allowed for faster recovery from chill coma after 6 h at 0 °C. These supplements, however, also slightly increased the CTmin and had little impact on survival rates following chronic cold stress (24 h at 0 °C), suggesting that the effect of diet on cold tolerance depends on the measure of cold tolerance assessed. In contrast to prolonged salt stress, brief feeding (1.5 h) on diets high in salt slowed coma recovery, suggesting that the long-term effects of NaCl and KCl on chilling tolerance result from phenotypic plasticity, induced in response to a salty diet, rather than simply the presence of the diet in the gut lumen. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Many gregarious species display rapid fission-fusion dynamics with individuals frequently leaving their groups to reunite or to form new ones soon after. The adaptive value of such ephemeral associations might reflect a frequent tilt in the balance between the costs and benefits of maintaining group cohesion. The lack of information on the short-term advantages of group fission, however, hampers our understanding of group dynamics. We investigated the effect of group fission on area-restricted search, a search tactic that is commonly used when food distribution is spatially autocorrelated. Specifically, we determine if roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) improve key aspects of their extensive search mode immediately after fission. We found that groups indeed moved faster and farther over time immediately after than before fission. This gain was highest for the smallest group that resulted from fission, which was more likely to include the fission's initiator. Sex of group members further mediated the immediate gain in search capacity, as post-fission groups moved away at farthest rate when they were only comprised of males. Our study suggests that social conflicts during the extensive search mode can promote group fission and, as such, can be a key determinant of group fission-fusion dynamics that are commonly observed in gregarious herbivores. © 2016 Lardy et al.

abstract={Anxiety disorders and obesity are both common in youth and young adults. Despite increasing evidence that over-consumption of palatable high-fat/high-sugar “junk” foods leads to adverse neurocognitive outcomes, little is known about the effects of palatable diets on emotional memories and fear regulation. In the present experiments we examined the effects of daily 2 h consumption of a high-fat/high-sugar (HFHS) food across adolescence on fear inhibition and anxiety-like behaviour in young adult rats. Rats exposed to the HFHS diet exhibited impaired retention of fear extinction and increased anxiety-like behaviour in an emergence test compared to rats fed a standard diet. The HFHS-fed rats displayed diet-induced changes in prefrontal cortex (PFC) function which were detected by altered expression of GABAergic parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons and the stable transcription factor ΔFosB which accumulates in the PFC in response to chronic stimuli. Immunohistochemical analyses of the medial PFC revealed that animals fed the HFHS diet had fewer parvalbumin-expressing cells and increased levels of FosB/ΔFosB expression in the infralimbic cortex, a region implicated in the consolidation of fear extinction. There was a trend towards increased IBA-1 immunoreactivity, a marker of microglial activation, in the infralimbic cortex after HFHS diet exposure but expression of the extracellular glycoprotein reelin was unaffected. These findings demonstrate that a HFHS diet during adolescence is associated with reductions of prefrontal parvalbumin neurons and impaired fear inhibition in adulthood. Adverse effects of HFHS diets on the mechanisms of fear regulation may precipitate a vulnerability in obese individuals to the development of anxiety disorders. © 2016},

abstract={We have previously showed that lifetime exposure to aspartame, commencing in utero via the mother's diet, may impair insulin tolerance and cause behavioral deficits in adulthood via mechanisms which are incompletely understood. The role of the CNS in regulating glucose homeostasis has been highlighted by recent delineation of the gut-brain axis, in which N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) are important in maintaining glucose homeostasis, in addition to regulating certain aspects of behavior. Since the gut-brain axis can be modulated by fetal programming, we hypothesized that early-life NMDAR antagonism may affect aspartame-induced glucose deregulation in adulthood, and may alter the aspartame behavioral phenotype. Accordingly, C57Bl/6J mice were chronically exposed to aspartame commencing in utero, in the presence and absence of maternal administration of the competitive NMDAR antagonist CGP 39551, from conception until weaning. Drug/diet interactions in adulthood glucocentric and behavioral parameters were assessed. Aspartame exposure elevated blood glucose and impaired insulin-induced glucose disposal during an insulin tolerance test, which could be normalized by NMDAR antagonism. The same effects were not observed in control diet mice, suggesting an early-life drug/diet interaction. Behavioral analysis of adult offspring indicated that NMDAR antagonism of control diet mice caused hyperlocomotion and impaired spatial navigation. Conversely hypolocomotion, reduced exploratory activity and increased anxiety-related behavior were apparent in aspartame diet mice with early-life NMDAR antagonism. Conclusion: significant drug/diet interactions in glucocentric and behavioral parameters were identified in aspartame-exposed mice with early-life NMDAR antagonism. This suggests a possible involvement of early NMDAR interactions in aspartame-impaired glucose homeostasis and behavioral deficits. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The role of endogenous vitamin C (VC) in emotion and psychiatric measures has long been uncertain. We aimed to investigate how an individual's VC status impacts his or her mental health. Our hypothesis is that body VC levels modulate anxiety, anorexia, and depressive phenotypes under the influence of psychosocial rearing environments and sex. The VC status of senescence marker protein–30/gluconolactonase knockout mice, which lack the ability to synthesize VC, were continuously shifted from adequate (VC+) to depleted (VC−) by providing a water with or without VC. Despite weight loss in both sexes, suppressed feeding was specifically seen in males only during the VC− phase. Anxiety responses in the novelty-suppressed feeding paradigm were worse during the VC−, especially in females. Sensitivity to the forced swim test as determined by the initial latency was significantly shorter in the socially stable animals compared with socially unstable animals during the VC+ condition. The stress coping underlying depressive phenotypes was assessed by immobility duration in a series of forced swim tests. No significant differences were apparent between contrasting VC status. Homeostatic symptoms following stressful behavioral tests consisted of a great loss of appetite during the VC−. It should be noted that anorexia is extremely serious for the females. We conclude that endogenous VC status is critical for determining vulnerability to anxiety and anorexia in a sex-specific manner. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Individuals can respond to predation risk by building morphological defenses or by altering their behavior. We tested whether freshwater Physa acuta (Draparnaud, 1805) snails with better morphological defenses against predation risk displayed lower or higher behavioral responses to predator cues compared to more poorly defended snails. We examined how the morphological traits of snails influence their risk of predation by crayfish, inferred by crush resistance, and how those same traits also influence their patch use in the absence and presence of predator cues. Using model selection, we found that a large shell width increased crush resistance. We also found that other morphological traits interacted with predator cues to influence the use of high resource patches, however shell width had almost no influence. Aperture length and aperture width both strongly interacted with cue: larger aperture length and larger aperture width snails decreased their use of the high resource patch substantially. Additionally we used a composite model to test whether estimated crush resistance, predator cue, or their interaction best predicted space use, and found no support that our estimate for crush resistance affected space use. Generally we found strong support that morphology effects crush resistance and also that morphology influences snail space use. However, crush resistance and space use are influenced by very different morphological traits.},

abstract={Rational: Prefrontal cortical (PFC)–hippocampal–striatal circuits, interconnected via glutamatergic signaling, are dysfunctional in mental illnesses that involve addiction vulnerability. Objectives: In healthy and neurodevelopmentally altered rats, we examined how Radial Arm Maze (RAM) performance estimates addiction vulnerability, and how starting a glutamatergic modulating agent, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) in adolescence alters adult mental illness and/or addiction phenotypes. Methods: Rats with neonatal ventral hippocampal lesions (NVHL) vs. SHAM-operated controls were randomized to NAC vs. saline in adolescence followed by cognitive testing (RAM) in early adulthood and then cocaine behavioral sensitization (experiment 1; n = 80) or nicotine self-administration (experiment 2; n = 12). Results: In experiment 1, NVHL rats showed over-consumption of food (Froot-Loops (FL)) baiting the RAM with poor working memory (low-arm entries to repeat (ETR)), producing an elevated FL to ETR ratio (“FLETR”; p &lt; 0.001). FLETR was the best linear estimator (compared to FL or ETR) of magnitude of long-term cocaine sensitization (R2 = 0.14, p &lt; 0.001). NAC treatment did not alter FL, ETR, FLETR, or cocaine sensitization. In experiment 2, FLETR also significantly and uniquely correlated with subsequent drug seeking during nicotine-induced reinstatement after extinction of nicotine self-administration (R2 = 0.47, p &lt; 0.01). NAC did not alter RAM performance, but significantly reversed NVHL-induced increases in nicotine seeking during extinction and reinstatement. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the utility of animal models of mental illness with addiction vulnerability for developing novel diagnostic measures of PFC–hippocampal–striatal circuit dysfunction that may reflect addiction risk. Such tests may direct pharmacological treatments prior to adulthood and addictive drug exposure, to prevent or treat adult addictions. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={The home environment is likely to influence children's diet and activity patterns and ultimately, their weight trajectories. Identifying family characteristics associated with a more ‘obesogenic’ home can provide insight into the determinants, and has implications for targeting and tailoring strategies to promote healthier lifestyles. The present study examined maternal characteristics associated with a more obesogenic home environment in 1113 families with preschool children. Primary caregivers (99% mothers) from the Gemini cohort completed the Home Environment Interview (HEI) when their children were 4 years old. Maternal demographics and BMI were assessed in the Gemini baseline questionnaire when the children were on average 8 months old. Maternal eating style was assessed when the children were on average 2 years old, using the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ). Responses to the HEI were standardised and summed to create a composite score of the obesogenic quality of the home; this was categorised into tertiles. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression showed that mothers who were younger (adjusted OR; 95% CI = 0.96; 0.94–0.98), less educated (1.97; 1.40–2.77), and had lower incomes (1.89; 1.43–2.49) at baseline were more likely to live in an obesogenic home environment at 4 years, as were mothers who scored higher on the DEBQ External Eating scale (1.40; 1.16–1.70) at 2 years, and had a higher baseline BMI (1.05; 1.02–1.08). Using a novel, composite measure of the home environment, this study finds that families who are more socio-economically deprived, and where the mothers are themselves heavier and have a more food responsive eating style, tend to provide a home environment with the hallmarks of a higher risk of weight gain. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare genetic and neurological disorder presenting with seizures, developmental delay, ataxia, and lack of speech. Previous studies have indicated that oxidative stress-dependent metabolic dysfunction may underlie the phenotypic deficits reported in the AS mouse model. While the ketogenic diet (KD) has been used to protect against oxidative stress and has successfully treated refractory epilepsy in AS case studies, issues arise due to its strict adherence requirements, in addition to selective eating habits and weight issues reported in patients with AS. We hypothesized that ketone ester supplementation would mimic the KD as an anticonvulsant and improve the behavioral and synaptic plasticity deficits in vivo. AS mice were supplemented R,S-1,3-butanediol acetoacetate diester (KE) ad libitum for eight weeks. KE administration improved motor coordination, learning and memory, and synaptic plasticity in AS mice. The KE was also anticonvulsant and altered brain amino acid metabolism in AS treated animals. Our findings suggest that KE supplementation produces sustained ketosis and ameliorates many phenotypes in the AS mouse model, and should be investigated further for future clinical use. © 2016 The Authors},

abstract={The importance of Zn ions (Zn) in regulating development and functions of the immune system is well established. However, recent years have witnessed a surge in our knowledge of how immune cells choreograph Zn regulatory mechanisms to combat the persistence of pathogenic microbes. Myeloid and lymphoid populations manipulate intracellular and extracellular Zn metabolism via Zn binding proteins and transporters in response to immunological signals and infection. Rapid as well as delayed changes in readily exchangeable Zn, also known as free Zn and the Zn proteome are crucial in determining activation of immune cells, cytokine responses, signaling and nutritional immunity. Recent studies have unearthed distinctive Zn modulatory mechanisms employed by specialized immune cells and necessitate an understanding of the Zn handling behavior in immune responses to infection. The focus of this review, therefore, stems from novel revelations of Zn intoxication, sequestration and signaling roles deployed by different immune cells, with an emphasis on innate immunity, to challenge microbial parasitization and cope with pathogen insult. © 2016},

abstract={Aging is considered as one of the most important developmental processes in organisms and is closely associated with global deteriorations of epigenetic markers such as aberrant methylomic patterns. This altered epigenomic state, referred to 'epigenetic drift', reflects deficient maintenance of epigenetic marks and contributes to impaired cellular and molecular functions in aged cells. Epigenetic drift-induced abnormal changes during aging are scantily repaired by epigenetic modulators. This inflexibility in the aged epigenome may lead to an age-related decline in phenotypic plasticity at the cellular and molecular levels due to epigenetic drift. This perspective aims to provide novel concepts for understanding epigenetic effects on the aging process and to provide insights into epigenetic prevention and therapeutic strategies for age-related human disease. © 2016 Trygve O Tollefsbol.},

abstract={Objective: Food reinforcement refers to how hard someone is motivated to work to gain access to food. Infant temperament is defined as behavioral styles, or constitutionally based individual differences in reactive and regulatory aspects of behavior. Identifying correlates of food reinforcement, such as infant temperament, may help identify infants at risk for future negative health consequences (e.g., overweight or obesity) of high food reinforcement. Methods: This study tested aspects of parent-reported negative reactivity and regulation and their associations with relative food reinforcement in a cross-sectional sample of 105 9- to 18-month-old infants. Hierarchical linear regression models were then used to predict infant food reinforcement for the temperament dimensions that were significantly related to it. Results: Two temperament dimensions, cuddliness (regulatory aspect) (B = -0.050, ΔR2 = 0.074, p = 0.005) and rate of recovery from distress and arousal (reactive aspect) (B = -0.040, ΔR2 = 0.045, p = 0.031), were inversely associated with relative food reinforcement. Conclusion: Clarifying the nature of relationships between these two behavioral predictors, infant temperament and relative food reinforcement, and early obesity can elucidate the role of individual differences in early obesity risk and can further inform targets for early behavioral obesity preventive interventions. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={The origin and evolution of manual grasping remain poorly understood. The ability to cling requires important grasping abilities and is essential to survive in species where the young are carried in the fur. A previous study has suggested that this behaviour could be a pre-adaptation for the evolution of fine manipulative skills. In this study we tested the co-evolution between infant carrying in the fur and manual grasping abilities in the context of food manipulation. As strepsirrhines vary in the way infants are carried (mouth vs. fur), they are an excellent model to test this hypothesis. Data on food manipulation behaviour were collected for 21 species of strepsirrhines. Our results show that fur-carrying species exhibited significantly more frequent manual grasping of food items. This study clearly illustrates the potential novel insights that a behaviour (infant carrying) that has previously been largely ignored in the discussion of the evolution of primate manipulation can bring. © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Developmental origins of cardiometabolic diseases have been related to maternal nutritional conditions. In this context, the rising incidence of arterial hypertension, diabetes type II, and dyslipidemia has been attributed to genetic programming. Besides, environmental conditions during perinatal development such as maternal undernutrition or overnutrition can program changes in the integration among physiological systems leading to cardiometabolic diseases. This phenomenon can be understood in the context of the phenotypic plasticity and refers to the adjustment of a phenotype in response to environmental input without genetic change, following a novel, or unusual input during development. Experimental studies indicate that fetal exposure to an adverse maternal environment may alter the morphology and physiology that contribute to the development of cardiometabolic diseases. It has been shown that both maternal protein restriction and overnutrition alter the central and peripheral control of arterial pressure and metabolism. This review will address the new concepts on the maternal diet induced-cardiometabolic diseases that include the potential role of the perinatal malnutrition. © 2016 Costa-Silva, Simões-Alves and Fernandes.},

abstract={Background Early childhood malnutrition affects 113 million children worldwide, impacting health and increasing vulnerability for cognitive and behavioral disorders later in life. Molecular signatures after childhood malnutrition, including the potential for intergenerational transmission, remain unexplored. Methods We surveyed blood DNA methylomes (~483,000 individual CpG sites) in 168 subjects across two generations, including 50 generation 1 individuals hospitalized during the first year of life for moderate to severe protein-energy malnutrition, then followed up to 48 years in the Barbados Nutrition Study. Attention deficits and cognitive performance were evaluated with the Connors Adult Attention Rating Scale and Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. Expression of nutrition-sensitive genes was explored by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in rat prefrontal cortex. Results We identified 134 nutrition-sensitive, differentially methylated genomic regions, with most (87%) specific for generation 1. Multiple neuropsychiatric risk genes, including COMT, IFNG, MIR200B, SYNGAP1, and VIPR2 showed associations of specific methyl-CpGs with attention and IQ. IFNG expression was decreased in prefrontal cortex of rats showing attention deficits after developmental malnutrition.

abstract={The high prevalence of obesity and related metabolic diseases calls for greater understanding of the factors that drive excess energy intake. Calorie-dense palatable foods are readily available and often are paired with highly salient environmental cues. These cues can trigger food-seeking and consumption in the absence of hunger. Here we examined the effects of palatable food-paired environmental cues on control of instrumental food-seeking behavior. In Experiment 1, adult male rats received exposures to one context containing three “junk” foods (JFs context) and another containing chow (Chow context). Next, rats were food-deprived and trained to perform instrumental responses (lever-press) for two novel food rewards in a third, distinct context. Contextual influences on flexible control of food-seeking behavior were then assessed by outcome devaluation tests held in the JF, chow and training contexts. Devaluation was achieved using specific satiety and test order was counterbalanced. Rats exhibited goal-directed control over behavior when tested in the training and chow-paired contexts. Notably, performance was habitual (insensitive to devaluation) when tested in the JF context. In Experiment 2 we tested whether the impairment found in the JF context could be ameliorated by the presentation of a discrete auditory cue paired with the chow context, relative to a second cue paired with the JF context. Consistent with the results of Experiment 1, the devaluation effect was not significant when rats were tested in the JF context with the JF cue. However, presenting the chow cue increased the impact of the devaluation treatment leading to a robust devaluation effect. Further tests confirmed that performance in the chow context was goal-directed and that sensory-specific satiety in the JF context was intact. These results show that environments paired with palatable foods can impair goal-directed control over food-seeking behavior, but that this deficit was improved by a cue paired with chow. This has promising implications for assisting individuals in controlling their eating behavior in environments designed to dysregulate it. © 2016 Kendig, Cheung, Raymond and Corbit.},

abstract={According to dual-system theory, instrumental learning and performance depend on the balance between goal-directed and habitual action control. Overreliance on habits has been argued to characterize clinical conditions such as drug addiction or obsessive-compulsive disorder as well as obesity and excessive impulsivity. A tendency toward habitual action control in obesity has already been indicated in the food domain. However, impairments might not be restricted to eating behavior. This has been suggested by domain-general obesity-associated disturbances in executive function as well as alterations in corticostriatal circuits underlying the goal-directed and habitual systems. In this study we examined the balance of goal-directed and habitual action control in a sample of normal-weight, overweight, and obese participants (n = 105) using the slips-of-action test in a non-food context. We tested for continuous or group-based associations between body weight status (BMI) and the devaluation sensitivity index (DSI), a parameter representing the balance of the goal-directed and habitual systems in action control. As personality differences in the domain of impulsivity might affect this relationship, we also examined whether the interaction between BMI and self-reported impulsivity, based on the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale, was related to the DSI. In addition to that, we tested for direct, i.e., weight status independent, relationships between UPPS subdomains of impulsivity and the DSI. We failed to find evidence for a relationship between weight status and sensitivity to devaluation as indexed by the DSI. However, independent of weight status, we observed lower sensitivity to devaluation in sensation seekers, a subtype of impulsivity. To conclude, behavioral flexibility in the sense of disturbances in the balance between the habitual and goal-directed systems seems to be unaffected by weight status in a non-food context. Consequently, stimuli and behavior might not be generally excessively linked in overweight or obesity. However, according to ceiling effects we cannot rule out subtle effects the paradigm was not able to disentangle. Further, future studies are needed to clarify the role of specific subtypes of obesity (e.g., food addiction). The indicated habit propensity in sensation seekers may account for previous reports of weak avoidance behavior and risky decision making. © 2016 Dietrich, de Wit and Horstmann.},

abstract={Background: Although various physical risk factors for delirium have been identified, the effect of psychological aspects is currently unknown. This study aimed to examine psychological risk factors for postoperative delirium and to identify hidden subgroups of delirium in clinical and psychological feature space. Methods: Among 200 patients with hip fracture, 78 elderly patients were prospectively evaluated for clinical and psychological assessments before surgery. As delirium was assessed from the next day to the 7th day after surgery, postoperative delirium was found in 40 patients, but not in 38 patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore risk factors for postoperative delirium. Phenotypic subgroups of delirium were assessed using Topological Data Analysis, in which the significant risk factors were used for evaluating filter and distance metrics. Results: Mini-Mental State Examination, neuroticism, conscientiousness, and regional anesthesia were identified as a predictive risk factor for postoperative delirium. The filter metric showed significant negative correlations with nutrition-related factors such as total protein and albumin. When filter metric and Euclidean distances were entered, delirious patients were bifurcated as a function of personality traits and anesthesia method in the patient-patient network. Conclusions: A personality trait of neuroticism and conscientiousness may predispose elderly patients to postoperative delirium and this influence may be amplified by regional anesthesia. This study verifies the contribution of psychological risk factors to delirium and provides new insight for complex etiologies of delirium by mapping various clinical variables in the topological space. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Abstract: Variation in state, which is any factor that alters the value of decision options, is likely one of the most common drivers of personality differences. However, the general relationship between individuals’ body state and various personality metrics/average behavioral type, repeatability of behavior, and behavioral syndrome structure is still poorly resolved. Here, we manipulate body condition in three spider species (Agelenopsis aperta, Latrodectus hesperus, and Anelosimus studiosus) using contrasting feeding schedules. We then assessed the effects of historic feeding regime on individuals’ body condition, boldness, and foraging aggressiveness. We further assessed the effects of feeding regimes on the repeatability of boldness and aggressiveness and the presence/absence of correlations between these two traits. We found that feeding treatment impacted individuals’ average boldness and aggressiveness in two species (A. aperta and A. studiosus). We also noted that among-individual variance in both boldness and aggressiveness was severely reduced when A. aperta and A. studiosus were subjected to prolonged food restriction, steeply reducing repeatability in these traits. Finally, we noted that correlations between boldness and foraging aggressiveness were detectable only in one case, revealing no compelling relationship between food restriction and the presence/absence of behavioral correlations. Taken together, our results suggest that food restriction has only weak, circumstantial effects on individuals’ average personality type and the correlations between behavioral traits. However, there appears to be a robust positive relationship between food availability and the signature of consistent individual differences in behavior. Significance statement: Under laboratory conditions, we found that lower feeding rates sharply decreased the repeatability of aggressiveness and boldness in two spider species. In doing so, we provide the second body of evidence suggesting that a highly prevalent and ecologically relevant state variable, higher body condition, can increase the repeatability of foraging-related behavioral traits. Additionally, under some feeding regimes, we found that hunger levels could alter the average individual aggressiveness and boldness but not correlations between these traits. This work highlights the importance of state variables such as hunger in eroding behavioral repeatability, the defining trait of personality. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In this study, the following hypotheses were explored using zebrafish Danio rerio: (1) individuals from the same cohort differ consistently in activity and risk-taking and (2) variation in activity and risk-taking is linked to individual differences in metabolic rate, body length and body condition. To examine these hypotheses, juvenile D. rerio were tested for routine metabolic rate and subsequently exposed to an open field test. Strong evidence was found for consistent among-individual differences in activity and risk-taking, which were overall negatively correlated with body length, i.e. larger D. rerio were found to be less active in a potentially dangerous open field and a similar trend was found with respect to a more direct measure of their risk-taking tendency. In contrast, routine metabolic rate and body condition were uncorrelated with both activity and risk-taking of juvenile D. rerio. These findings suggest that body length is associated with risk-related behaviours in juvenile D. rerio for which larger, rather than smaller, individuals may have a higher risk of predation, while the role for routine metabolic rate is relatively limited or non-existent, at least under the conditions of the present study. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Background: Dropout rates in binge eating disorder (BED) treatment are high (17–30%), and predictors of dropout are unknown. Method: Participants were 376 patients following an intensive outpatient cognitive behavioural therapy programme for BED, 82 of whom (21.8%) dropped out of treatment. An exploratory logistic regression was performed using eating disorder variables, general psychopathology, personality and demographics to identify predictors of dropout. Results: Binge eating pathology, preoccupations with eating, shape and weight, social adjustment, agreeableness, and social embedding appeared to be significant predictors of dropout. Also, education showed an association to dropout. Discussion: This is one of the first studies investigating pre-treatment predictors for dropout in BED treatment. The total explained variance of the prediction model was low, yet the model correctly classified 80.6% of cases, which is comparable to other dropout studies in eating disorders.

abstract={Impulsivity is a major component of mania in bipolar disorder (BD), and patients also show impairments in decision-making involving risk on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Similar deficits are observed in some patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and incidence of problem gambling is higher in both these populations. Anticonvulsant drugs are widely used in the treatment of epilepsy, but also as mood stabilizers and prophylaxis for the management of BD. Unfortunately, little is still known about the precise mechanisms of action underlying their efficacy, and the specific behavioral aspect targeted by these drugs. This project explored the effect of the three anticonvulsant drugs currently also used as mood stabilizers- carbamazepine, valproate and lamotrigine on aspects of decision-making using a rat analogue of the IGT, the rat Gambling Task (rGT). In this task, rats choose between four distinct, probabilistic reinforcement schedules. Sugar pellet profits are maximized by adopting a conservative strategy, avoiding tempting high-risk, high-reward options. Effects of the anticonvulsant agents were assessed on baseline performance and also in conjunction with amphetamine administration, in order to approximate a “mania-like” state. Carbamazepine appeared to slow processing speed, decreasing premature responses and increasing choice latency, whereas valproate and lamotrigine had no effect. When administered prior to amphetamine, lamotrigine was the only drug that failed to attenuate the pro-impulsive effect of the psychostimulant. Further studies looking at chronic administration of anticonvulsants may help us understand the impact of this medication class on decision-making and impulsivity in healthy rats and disease models. © 2016},

abstract={Background: Increasing competitive ability of individuals can create a Tragedy of the Commons ending in extinction. Theory has not yet evaluated what role adaptive habitat selection might play in the tragedy and its outcome. Methods: We used modified Ricker population models to simulate the long-term population dynamics emerging from a pure strategy of despotic habitat choice versus a mixed strategy of despotic and ideal-free habitat selection. Density in the better of two habitats was reduced by the threat of dominance in the pure strategy. Habitat selection switched to an ideal-free distribution at low densities in the mixed strategy. We used patterns of density and dispersal, giving-up densities, personalities and condition of meadow voles to search for the predicted switch in habitat selection. Results: Extinction probabilities in simulated stochastic environments were always higher for pure than for mixed strategies. Experiments on meadow voles were only partially consistent with a density-dependent transition from ideal-free to despotic habitat selection. Densities and giving-up densities of voles in adjacent habitats were nearly identical when resources were equal and population size was small. Giving-up densities diverged dramatically when supplemental food was added to one habitat and not to the other. Despite biased dispersal from high- to low-quality habitat, there was no associated difference in population density, personality or body condition. Conclusions: Pure habitat selection based on dominance places populations at greater risk of extinction than does a mixed strategy in which dominance disappears at low population sizes. Experiments on meadow voles yielded limited but nevertheless tantalizing support for such a density-dependent switch in habitat selection. © 2016 Douglas W. Morris.},

abstract={We conducted three studies to examine the relationship between spicy tastes and risk seeking. In Study 1, results from a personality judgment task indicated that people were more inclined to attribute a higher level of risk seeking to individuals who enjoy spicy foods. The second study examined whether people who like spicy foods are actually more risk seeking. In fact, people who reported a preference for spicy tastes scored higher on risk taking, as assessed via the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking Scale (Chinese version). Finally, Study 3 employed an experimental design to manipulate risk-seeking tendencies by having participants experience spicy food tastes in the lab. Momentarily savoring spicy foods increased participants’ risk taking in the Iowa Gambling Task. The present findings suggest that preferences for spicy tastes could relate to risk-seeking tendencies and subsequent risk-seeking behaviors. © 2016.},

abstract={Maternal nutrition can have long-term effects on offspring morphology, physiology and behaviours. However, it is unclear whether mothers ‘program’ offspring behavioural coping strategy (proactive/reactive) according to the predicted nutritional quality of their future environment. We conducted a systematic review on this topic and meta-analytically synthesized relevant experimental data on mice and rats (46 studies). We included data from experiments where dams were subjected to caloric restriction, protein restriction or overfeeding around gestation and subsequently measured offspring activity, exploration, or anxiety. Overall, little evidence existed for effects of maternal nutrition on the three investigated behavioural traits. The high heterogeneity observed in the data set suggests that maternal programming may sometimes occur. However, because offspring had access to a balanced diet before testing, behaviours may have been reprogrammed. Our results may indicate that reprogrammed behaviours could ameliorate negative effects associated with sub-optimal nutrition in early life. Further, our systematic review revealed clear knowledge gaps and fruitful future research avenues. © 2015 Cambridge Philosophical Society},

abstract={The human dopamine D4 receptor (hD4R) variants with long tandem repeats in the third intracellular loop have been strongly associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and risk taking behaviors. To understand the potential molecular mechanism underlying the connection, we have investigated the synaptic function of human D4R polymorphism by virally expressing the ADHD-linked 7-repeat allele, hD4.7, or its normal counterpart, hD4.4, in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of D4R knockout mice. We found that hD4R bound to the SH3 domain of PSD-95 in a state-dependent manner. Activation of hD4.7 caused more reduction of NR1/PSD-95 binding and NR1 surface expression than hD4.4 in PFC slices. Moreover, the NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (NMDAR-EPSC) in PFC pyramidal neurons were suppressed to a larger extent by hD4.7 than hD4.4 activation. Direct stimulation of NMDARs with the partial agonist D-cycloserine prevented the NMDAR hypofunction induced by hD4.7 activation. Moreover, hD4.7-expressing mice exhibited the increased exploratory and novelty seeking behaviors, mimicking the phenotypic hallmark of human ADHD. D-cycloserine administration ameliorated the ADHD-like behaviors in hD4.7-expressing mice. Our results suggest that over-suppression of NMDAR function may underlie the role of hD4.7 in ADHD, and enhancing NMDAR signaling may be a viable therapeutic strategy to ADHD humans carrying the D4.7 allele. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Perinatal development represents a critical period in the life of an individual. A common cause of poor development is that which comes from undernutrition or malnutrition. In particular, protein deprivation during development has been shown to have deep deleterious effects on brain's growth and plasticity. Early-life stress has also been linked with an increased risk to develop different psychopathologies later in life. We have previously shown that perinatal protein malnutrition in mice leads to the appearance of anxiety-related behaviors in the adulthood. We also found evidence that the female offspring was more susceptible to the development of depression-related behaviors. In the present work, we further investigated this behavior together with its molecular bases. We focused our study on the hippocampus, as it is a structure involved in coping with stressful situations. We found an increase in immobility time in the forced swimming test in perinatally malnourished females, and an alteration in the expression of genes related with neuroplasticity, early growth response 1, calcineurin and c-fos. We also found that perinatal malnutrition causes a reduction in the number of neurons in the hippocampus. This reduction, together with altered gene expression, could be related to the increment in immobility time observed in the forced swimming test. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society},

abstract={Fish is a major source of nutrients critical for brain development during early life. The importance of childhood fish consumption is supported by several studies reporting associations of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) supplementation with better behavior and school performance. However, fish may have a different effect than n-3 PUFA alone due to the neurotoxic effects of methylmercury, a frequent contaminant. We investigated associations of childhood fish consumption with learning and behavioral disorders in birth cohort study of the neurotoxic effects of early life exposure to solvent-contaminated drinking water. Childhood (age 7-12 years) fish consumption and learning and behavioral problems were reported in self-administered questionnaires (age 23-41 at questionnaire completion). Fish consumption was not meaningfully associated with repeating a grade, tutoring, attending summer school, special class placement, or low educational attainment. However, participants who ate fish several times a week had an elevated odds of Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (odds ratio: 5.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.5-18) compared to participants who did not eat fish. While these findings generally support the safety of the observed level of fish consumption, the absence of a beneficial effect may be attributed to insufficient fish intake or the choice of relatively low n-3 PUFA fish. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Sensitization is a basic property of the nervous system whereby repeated exposure to a stimulus results in an increase in responding to that stimulus. This increase in responding contributes to difficulty with treatment of drug abuse, as stimuli associated with substance use become signals or triggers for drug craving and relapse. Our work over the past decade has applied the theoretical framework of incentive sensitization to overeating. We have shown, in several studies, that lean adults do not commonly demonstrate behavioral sensitization after repeated exposure to snack food, but a subset of obese adults reliably does. This review will discuss this change in behavioral response to repeated consumption of snack food in obese individuals and apply the theoretical framework of incentive sensitization to drugs of abuse to high fat/high sugar snack foods. We will also show data that suggest that behavioral sensitization to repeated administration of snack food is predictive of weight gain, which may enhance its utility as a diagnostic tool for identifying at-risk individuals for obesity. Finally, we will discuss the future directions of this line of research, including studying the phenomenon in children and adolescents and determining if similar principles can be used to increase motivation to eat healthier food. A combination of reductions in unhealthy food intake and increases and healthy food intake is necessary to reduce obesity rates and improve health. © 2016},

abstract={Maternal obesity induces chronic inflammatory responses that impact the fetus/neonate during the perinatal period. Inflammation, iron regulation, and myelination are closely interconnected and disruptions in these processes may have deleterious effects on neurodevelopment. Hepcidin levels are increased in response to inflammation causing subsequent decreases in ferroportin and available iron needed for myelination. Our current studies were designed to test the hypotheses that: 1) maternal high fat diet (HFD) prior to and during pregnancy is sufficient to induce inflammation and alter iron regulation in the brain of the offspring, and 2) HFD exposure is associated with altered myelination and neurobehavioral deficits in the offspring. Our data revealed modest increases in inflammatory cytokines in the serum of dams fed HFD prior to pregnancy compared to dams fed a control diet (CD). Early increases in IL-5 and decreases in IL-10 were observed in serum at PN7 while IL-5 remained elevated at PN21 in the HFD-exposed pups. At PN0, most cytokine levels in whole brain homogenates were higher in the pups born to HFD-fed dams but were not different or were lower than in pups born to CD-fed dams at PN21. Conversely, the inflammation mediated transcription factor Nurr77 remained elevated at PN21. At birth, brain hepcidin, ferroportin, and L-ferritin levels were elevated in pups born to HFD-fed dams compared to pups born to CD-fed dams. Hepcidin levels remained elevated at PN7 and PN21 while ferroportin and L-ferritin levels were lower at PN7 and were not different at PN21. Decreases in myelination in the medial cortex were observed in male but not in female pups born to maternal HFD-fed dams at PN21. These structural changes correlated with changes in behavior (novel object recognition) in at 4 months in males only. Our data indicate that maternal obesity (HFD) results in disruption of iron regulation in the brains of the offspring with structural and neurobehavioral deficits in males. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Here, we report regioselectively functionalized synthesis, as well as photo physical, electrochemical, and thermal, of a novel water-soluble conjugated polymer. For this purpose, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-catalyzed polymerization of a multifunctional monomer, 7-amino-4-hydroxy-2-naphthalene sulfonic acid (AHNAPSA) was carried out by using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant at room temperature for 24 h under air. The structure of poly(7-amino-4-hydroxy-2-naphthalene sulfonic acid), (PAHNAPSA) was identified by using nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared and ultraviolet-visible. Further characterization was performed by means of gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermogravimetry (TG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), cyclic voltammetry (CV), photoluminescence (PL), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and solid state conductivity measurements. The spectral analysis results exhibited functional group selective polymerization of the monomer containing a multi-active center. Solvent effects on the optical, electrochemical and photo physical properties of PAHNAPSA were investigated by using five different solvents. PAHNAPSA presented an irreversible redox characterization at different scan rates. Optical band gap of PAHNAPSA is also found in the range of 3.18 eV to 3.55 eV. The fluorescence measurements were utilized to investigate the photochemical behaviors of PAHNAPSA in selected polar solvents. Accordingly, PAHNAPSA surprisingly presented multicolor emission behavior with relatively high quantum yield in all selected solvents. In addition, PAHNAPSA presented a reversible pH-responsive behavior and also had high selectivity and sensitivity towards chromium ions. Finally, the kinetic parameters associated with the solid state thermal degradation of PAHNAPSA were calculated from isoconversional methods. The TG/DTG analysis showed that PAHNAPSA followed a diffusion controlled degradation mechanism in N2. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objective The aim of this study was to examine bidirectional associations between overweight and behavior problems during early childhood taking into account the adiposity rebound, which is the turning point in the nonlinear development of Body Mass Index in early childhood. Methods Longitudinal data from 6624 Dutch children in the Generation R Study were used to analyze the association between measured overweight and scores on the internalizing and externalizing scale of the Child Behavior Checklist between one-and-a-half, three and six years. The adiposity rebound was determined for each child by estimating the lowest point in their growth curve. Cross-lagged modeling was used to test (bi)directional associations. Results Both body mass and behavior problems were modest to highly stable from age one-and-a-half to six years. Externalizing and internalizing behavior were both associated with later overweight, although effect sizes were small (βs ranged between 0.06 and 0.07, ps < 0.05). No significant associations in the other direction were found. Controlling for adiposity rebound did not change the pattern of associations. There was a moderating effect of gender, and ethnicity, and timing of adiposity rebound. Conclusion Behavior problems in early childhood may put children at risk for overweight at a later age. This implies that young children with behavior problems may benefit from careful monitoring of eating behavior and weight development. Future studies should take the adiposity rebound into account. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Scatter-hoarding rodents can act as both predators and dispersers for many large-seeded plants because they cache seeds for future use, but occasionally forget them in sites with high survival and establishment probabilities. The most important fruit or seed trait influencing rodent foraging behavior is seed size; rodents prefer large seeds because they have higher nutritional content, but this preference can be counterbalanced by the higher costs of handling larger seeds. We designed a cafeteria experiment to assess whether fruit and seed size of Myrcianthes coquimbensis, an endangered desert shrub, influence the decision-making process during foraging by three species of scatter-hoarding rodents differing in body size: Abrothrix olivaceus, Phyllotis darwini and Octodon degus. We found that the size of fruits and seeds influenced foraging behavior in the three rodent species; the probability of a fruit being harvested and hoarded was higher for larger fruits than for smaller ones. Patterns of fruit size preference were not affected by rodent size; all species were able to hoard fruits within the entire range of sizes offered. Finally, fruit and seed size had no effect on the probability of seed predation, rodents typically ate only the fleshy pulp of the fruits offered and discarded whole, intact seeds. In conclusion, our results reveal that larger M. coquimbensis fruits have higher probabilities of being harvested, and ultimately of its seeds being hoarded and dispersed by scatter-hoarding rodents. As this plant has no other dispersers, rodents play an important role in its recruitment dynamics. © 2016 Maccarone et al.

abstract={Background: Ecological and evolutionary model organisms have provided extensive insight into the ecological triggers, adaptive benefits, and evolution of life-history driven developmental plasticity. Despite this, we still have a poor understanding of the underlying genetic changes that occur during shifts towards different developmental trajectories. The goal of this study is to determine whether we can identify underlying gene expression patterns that can describe the different life-history trajectories individuals follow in response to social cues of competition. To do this, we use the Australian black field cricket (Teleogryllus commodus), a species with sex-specific developmental trajectories moderated by the density and quality of calls heard during immaturity. In this study, we manipulated the social information males and females could hear by rearing individuals in either calling or silent treatments. We next used RNA-Seq to develop a reference transcriptome to study changes in brain gene expression at two points prior to sexual maturation. Results: We show accelerated development in both sexes when exposed to calling; changes were also seen in growth, lifespan, and reproductive effort. Functional relationships between genes and phenotypes were apparent from ontological enrichment analysis. We demonstrate that increased investment towards traits such as growth and reproductive effort were often associated with the expression of a greater number of genes with similar effect, thus providing a suite of candidate genes for future research in this and other invertebrate organisms. Conclusions: Our results provide interesting insight into the genomic underpinnings of developmental plasticity and highlight the potential of a genomic exploration of other evolutionary theories such as condition dependence and sex-specific developmental strategies. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Internal states can profoundly alter the behavior of animals. A quantitative understanding of the behavioral changes upon metabolic challenges is key to a mechanistic dissection of how animals maintain nutritional homeostasis. We used an automated video tracking setup to characterize how amino acid and reproductive states interact to shape exploitation and exploration decisions taken by adult Drosophila melanogaster. We find that these two states have specific effects on the decisions to stop at and leave proteinaceous food patches. Furthermore, the internal nutrient state defines the exploration-exploitation trade-off: nutrient-deprived flies focus on specific patches while satiated flies explore more globally. Finally, we show that olfaction mediates the efficient recognition of yeast as an appropriate protein source in mated females and that octopamine is specifically required to mediate homeostatic postmating responses without affecting internal nutrient sensing. Internal states therefore modulate specific aspects of exploitation and exploration to change nutrient selection. © Corrales-Carvajal et al.},

abstract={The prevalence of consistent among-individual differences in behaviour, or personality, makes adaptive sense if individuals differ in stable state variables that shift the balance between the costs and benefits of their behavioural decisions. These differences may give rise to both individual differences in, and covariance among, behaviours that influence an individual's exposure to risks. We here study the link between behaviour and a candidate state variable previously overlooked in the study of state-dependent personality variation: telomere length. Telomeres are the protective endcaps of chromosomes and their erosion with age is thought to play a crucial role in regulating organismal senescence and intrinsic lifespan. Following evidence that shorter telomeres may reduce the lifespan of animals in a wide range of taxa, we predict individuals with shorter telomeres to behave more boldly and aggressively. In order to test this, we measured telomere length and behaviour in wild juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta). We found individuals with shorter fin telomeres to behave consistently more boldly and aggressively under controlled conditions in the laboratory. No such relationship was found with muscle telomere length 3–4 months after the behavioural assays. We suggest that telomere dynamics are an important factor integrating personality traits with other state variables thought to be important in the regulation of behaviour, such as metabolism, disease resistance and growth. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Stress influences numerous psychological and physiological processes, and its effects have practical implications in a variety of professions and real-world activities. However, few studies have concurrently assessed multiple behavioral, hormonal, nutritional and heart-rate responses of humans to acute, severe stress. This investigation simultaneously assessed cognitive, affective, hormonal, and heart-rate responses induced by an intensely stressful real-world environment designed to simulate wartime captivity. Sixty males were evaluated during and immediately following participation in U.S. Army Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) school, three weeks of intense but standardized training for Soldiers at risk of capture. Simulated captivity and intense mock interrogations degraded grammatical reasoning (p < 0.005), sustained-attention (p < 0.001), working memory (p < 0.05) and all aspects of mood assessed by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire: Tension/Anxiety, Depression/Dejection, Anger/Hostility, Vigor/Activity, Fatigue/Inertia; Confusion/Bewilderment, and Total Mood Disturbance (p < 0.001) It also elevated heart rate (p < 0.001); increased serum and salivary cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-s) (p < 0.01); elevated serum epinephrine, norepinephrine, and soluble transferrin receptors (sTfR) (p < 0.01); increased salivary neuropeptide-Y (NPY) (p < 0.001); and decreased serum prolactin and serum and salivary testosterone (p < 0.001). Partial recovery was observed immediately after training, but stress-induced changes, particularly in body weight and several of the biomarkers, persisted. This study demonstrates that when individuals were exposed to realistic and controlled simulated captivity, cognition, mood, stress hormones, nutritional status and heart rate are simultaneously altered, and each of these subsequently recovers at different rates. © 2016},

abstract={The cholinergic and dopaminergic innervation of the amygdala plays an important role in attention, emotional arousal, aversive forms of associative learning, conditioned responses, and stress responsivity. Roman High- (RHA) and Low-Avoidance (RLA) rats are an ideal model to study the potential impact of this innervation on behavioral responses, because they were selected bidirectionally for differences in their two-way active avoidance performance. RHA rats are known to quickly acquire two-way active avoidance and show indications of enhanced impulsive behavior, novelty seeking, and vulnerability to substance abuse, whereas RLA rats exhibit a passive coping style with high levels of immobility and enhanced stress responsivity. In the present study, the density of acetylcholine esterase (AchE)-positive cholinergic fibers and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive (TH-ir) fibers were analyzed in various amygdala nuclei. In comparison to RLA rats, RHA rats displayed a significantly higher density of AchE-positive fibers in the lateral nucleus (La), the major sensory input area of the amygdala. In contrast, RLA rats showed a higher density of TH-ir fibers in the lateral division of the central nucleus (CeL), which modulates amygdala output and is known to contain more corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) positive neurons in RLA than in RHA rats. The findings suggest that a higher density of AchE-positive fibers in the La of RHA rats may facilitate attentional mechanisms and aversive forms of associative learning in RHA rats, whereas the increased density of TH-ir fibers in the CeL of RLA rats may be involved in the regulation of enhanced CRH expression and stress responsivity. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd},

abstract={In mammals, olfactory subsystems have been shown to express seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in a one-receptor-one-neuron pattern, whereas in Caenorhabditis elegans, olfactory sensory neurons express multiple G-protein coupled odorant receptors per olfactory sensory neuron. In both mammalian and C. elegans olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), the process of olfactory adaptation begins within the OSN; this process of negative feedback within the mammalian OSN has been well described in mammals and enables activated OSNs to desensitize their response cell autonomously while attending to odors detected by separate OSNs. However, the mechanism that enables C. elegans to adapt to one odor and attend to another odor sensed by the same olfactory sensory neuron remains unclear. We found that the cyclic nucleotide gated channel subunit CNG-1 is required to promote cross adaptation responses between distinct olfactory cues. This change in sensitivity to a pair of odorants after persistent stimulation by just one of these odors is modulated by the internal nutritional state of the animal, and we find that this response is maintained across a diverse range of food sources for C. elegans. We also reveal that CNG-1 integrates food related cues for exploratory motor output, revealing that CNG-1 functions in multiple capacities to link nutritional information with behavioral output. Our data describes a novel model whereby CNG channels can integrate the coincidence detection of appetitive and olfactory information to set olfactory preferences and instruct behavioral outputs. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd},

abstract={Behavioral choice is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom and is central to goal-oriented behavior. Hypothalamic Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons are critical regulators of appetite. Hungry animals, bombarded by multiple sensory stimuli, are known to modify their behavior during times of caloric need, rapidly adapting to a consistently changing environment. Utilizing ARCAgRP neurons as an entry point, we analyzed the hierarchical position of hunger related to rival drive states. Employing a battery of behavioral assays, we found that hunger significantly increases its capacity to suppress competing motivational systems, such as thirst, anxiety-related behavior, innate fear, and social interactions, often only when food is accessible. Furthermore, real-time monitoring of ARCAgRP activity revealed time-locked responses to conspecific investigation in addition to food presentation, further establishing that, even at the level of ARCAgRP neurons, choices are remarkably flexible computations, integrating internal state, external factors, and anticipated yield.

abstract={Intake of energy-dense snack foods is high among US children. Although the use of restrictive feeding practices has been shown to be counterproductive, there is very limited evidence for effective alternatives to restriction that help children moderate their intake of these foods and that facilitate the development of self-regulation in childhood. The developmental literature on parenting and child outcomes may provide insights into alternatives to restrictive feeding practices. This review paper uses a model of parental control from the child development and parenting literatures to (i) operationally define restrictive feeding practices; (ii) summarize current evidence for antecedents and effects of parental restriction use on children's eating behaviours and weight status, and (iii) highlight alternative feeding practices that may facilitate the development of children's self-regulation and moderate children's intake of palatable snack foods. We also discuss recent empirical evidence highlighting the role of child temperament and food motivation related behaviours as factors that prompt parents to use restrictive feeding practices and, yet, may increase children's dysregulated intake of forbidden foods. © 2015 World Obesity},

abstract={Animals face stressful situations to which they can respond by mounting a physiological response. Few studies have compared the relative effects of two or more stressors on this response. We compared how low food abundance and hunting affected levels of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM), an indicator of stress, in Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) on the Haida Gwaii archipelago (Canada). We monitored monthly FGM levels over a year on three islands: on two, there was no hunting but deer were exposed to increased risk of severe food depletion; and on one, deer had access to abundant food but were exposed to a few days of hunting each year. Based on the context of the study, we tentatively predicted that FGM levels would be higher in low food abundance/safe islands. We also predicted that FGM levels would be higher in winter when food is rarer, particularly in low food abundance/safe islands. The three deer populations presented similar average FGM levels and seasonal variations. Our predictions were therefore not supported. Our results rather suggested that environmental contrasts, perceived by us as large (increased risk of starvation on ELI and Kunga islands) or associated with differences in animal behavior (human avoidance on Reef island), did not lead to increased stress responses. We discuss plausible explanations, including the down-regulation of the stress response in depleted environments and the lack of stress response to low hunting pressure when behavioral responses to risk are unlikely to be costly. © 2016, Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Białowieża, Poland.},

abstract={The autophagy pathway is critical for the long-term homeostasis of cells and adult organisms and is often activated during periods of stress. Reduced pathway efficacy plays a central role in several progressive neurological disorders that are associated with the accumulation of cytotoxic peptides and protein aggregates. Previous studies have shown that genetic and transgenic alterations to the autophagy pathway impacts longevity and neural aggregate profiles of adult Drosophila. In this study, we have identified methods to measure the acute in vivo induction of the autophagy pathway in the adult fly CNS. Our findings indicate that the genotype, age, and gender of adult flies can influence pathway responses. Further, we demonstrate that middle-aged male flies exposed to intermittent fasting (IF) had improved neuronal autophagic profiles. IF-treated flies also had lower neural aggregate profiles, maintained more youthful behaviors and longer lifespans, when compared to ad libitum controls. In summary, we present methodology to detect dynamic in vivo changes that occur to the autophagic profiles in the adult Drosophila CNS and that a novel IF-treatment protocol improves pathway response in the aging nervous system. © 2016 Ratliff et al.

abstract={Several studies have shown that individuals with higher metabolic rates (MRs) feed at higher rates and are more willing to forage in the presence of predators. This increases the acquisition of resources, which in turn, may help to sustain a higher MR. Elevated predation danger may be expected to result in reduced MRs, either as a means of allowing for reduced feeding and risk-taking, or as a consequence of adaptively reducing intake rates via reduced feeding and/or risk-taking. We tested this prediction in free-living great tits (Parus major) using a playback experiment to manipulate perceived predation danger. There was evidence that changes in body mass and BMR differed as a function of treatment. In predator treatment plots, great tits tended to reduce their body mass, a commonly observed response in birds to increased predation danger. In contrast, birds from control treatment plots showed no overall changes in body mass. There was also evidence that great tits from control treatment plots increased their basal metabolic rate (BMR) over the course of the experiment, presumably due to decreasing ambient temperatures over the study period. However, there was no evidence for changes in BMR for birds from predator treatment plots. Although the directions of these results are consistent with the predicted directions of effects, the effects sizes and confidence intervals yield inconclusive support for the hypothesis that great tits would adaptively suppress BMR in response to increased perceived predation risk. The effect size observed in the present study was small (~ 1%) and would not be expected to result in substantive reductions in feeding rate and/or risk-taking. Whether or not ecological conditions that generate greater energetic stress (e.g. lower food availability, lower ambient temperatures) could produce an effect that produces biologically meaningful reductions in feeding activity and/or risk-taking remains an open question. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Little egrets (Egretta garzetta) and common goldfish (Carassius auratus) interacted in experimental theaters that challenge them with a behavioral game. We studied the behavioral tactics of both players. The experimental theaters consist of three equally spaced pools, each with a shelter in its center. The fish can take shelter in a safe but foodless habitat, or swim exposed in the open that contains food. The egrets can move among the pools to catch the exposed fish. We investigated the importance of non-lethal effects versus lethal effects on predator–prey interactions. We created a variance in predation pressure by keeping the number of egrets fixed but varying the number of pools of the experimental theater between 1 and 3 pools. In all treatments, even when the egret was present, individual goldfish emerged from protected cover occasionally, exposing at least their heads and sometimes their entire bodies in apparent disregard for the possibly lethal consequences. We assumed that this behavior stems from the fish's constant need to collect information about its surroundings. The fish responded appropriately to the variations in predation pressure by changing their activity level outside the cover, i.e., the fish drastically and significantly reduced their exposure outside the cover, as well as the rate of peeping, as predation pressure increased. The results demonstrate the importance role of non-lethal effects, and how they drive the behavior of prey in response to predation risk, which in turn, drives the action of the predator in an asymmetric two-player game of stealth and fear. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Previous studies have shown that domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, trained in a competitive foraging condition would subsequently develop a high degree of impulsiveness in an intertemporal choice paradigm. Competition inevitably causes variance in the amount of food that the foragers gain. However, it is not known whether the food variance is causally linked with the impulsiveness. In experiment 1, we compared four groups of chicks trained in combinations of two social conditions (pseudocompetition or isolated) and two food conditions (variable or constant food). The food variance was introduced by varying the number of grains in each trial according to a binomial distribution. The subject chick was separated from the competitors by a transparent wall, and no actual interference occurred. Chicks were subsequently tested in binary choices between a small reward after a short delay (SS) and a large reward after a long delay (LL) in an isolated and constant food condition. If chicks had been trained under the pseudocompetition and variable food, they chose LL significantly less frequently than the other three groups. The effect disappeared when the LL delay was omitted, suggesting that chicks accurately memorized the food amount. The food variance is thus a necessary condition for the stronger temporal discounting. Otherwise, the observed effect could be ascribed to a paradoxical risk proneness associated with the variable option. In experiment 2, we compared four groups of chicks in which food amount varied either in SS or LL, or both. The subsequent binary choice tests revealed that the chicks chose SS irrespective of whether SS or LL had varied. These results cannot be explained in terms of a greater risk-prone choice of the variable option. Coincidence of perceived competition and food variance, at least in one option, is sufficient for chicks to develop choice impulsiveness. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Fission–fusion dynamics, consisting of regular shifts in the size and composition of social groups, are prevalent in animal societies and have implications for foraging success, disease and information transfer, and the fitness of individuals. Thus, the individual and environmental factors that drive social dynamics have become a focus of recent investigations. River otters, Lontra canadensis, in coastal Alaska have a plastic social system, influenced by forage fish availability. These carnivores also regularly frequent terrestrial latrine sites, where they associate and communicate through deposition of odorous substances. To investigate fission–fusion dynamics in this system we (1) deployed camera traps to record social behaviours at latrine sites and (2) attached proximity tags to quantify encounter rates among individuals. Camera detections demonstrated that most latrine visits were of single otters and small groups (2–8 individuals). Fusion events into large groups (up to 18 individuals) were infrequent. Larger groups were recorded at crossover latrines, where trails connected bodies of water, whereas social behaviour was more frequent at spatially central latrines. Visiting otters performed signalling behaviours more frequently than social behaviours, especially at crossover sites. Proximity tag data revealed that the timing of fission and fusion events coincided with latrine visits and that spatial overlap was a good predictor of social interaction. Thus, the structural and spatial features of latrines influence their function as centres of information exchange, social activity hubs and meeting places among small social units, with implications for river otter group dynamics. We conclude that shifting social and environmental conditions may lead to high communication complexity. This unique social system provides novel evidence of the role of olfactory communication in mediating social decisions. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Animals make use of contact chemoreception structures to examine the quality of potential food sources. During this evaluation they can detect nutritious compounds that promote feeding and recognize toxins that trigger evasive behaviors. Although animals can easily distinguish between stimuli of different gustatory qualities (bitter, salty, sweet, etc.), their ability to discriminate between compounds of the same quality may be limited. Numerous plants produce alkaloids, compounds that elicit aversive behaviors in phytophagous insects and almost uniformly evoke a bitter taste for man. In hematophagous insects, however, the effect of feeding deterrent molecules has been barely studied. Recent studies showed that feeding in Rhodnius prolixus can be negatively modulated by the presence of alkaloids such as quinine (QUI) and caffeine (CAF), compounds that elicit similar aversive responses. Here, we applied associative and non-associative learning paradigms to examine under two behavioral contexts the ability of R. prolixus to distinguish, discriminate and/or generalize between these two bitter compounds, QUI and CAF. Our results show that bugs innately repelled by bitter compounds can change their behavior from avoidance to indifference or even to preference according to their previous experiences. After an aversive operant conditioning with QUI or CAF, R. prolixus modified its behavior in a direct but also in a cross-compound manner, suggesting the occurrence of a generalization process between these two alkaloids. Conversely, after a long pre-exposure to each alkaloid, bugs decreased their avoidance to the compound used during pre-exposure but still expressed an avoidance of the novel compound, proving that QUI and CAF are detected separately. Our results suggest that R. prolixus is able to discriminate between QUI and CAF, although after an associative conditioning they express a symmetrical cross-generalization. This kind of studies adds insight into the gustatory sense of a blood-sucking model but also into the learning abilities of hematophagous insects. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Exceptional conditions in 2015 resulted in almost no reproductive effort or success in that year, so captured geese of all three species were likely to have been non-breeding individuals that initiated moult early, whereas there were almost no failed or successful breeders, which would normally moult later. This suggests that in a non-breeding year (i.e. in the absence of competition from large numbers of goslings), locally moulting geese can obtain sufficient exogenous energy to meet their needs during the flightless wing moult period without losing body mass. This also is consistent with the hypothesis that in other species of geese, accumulation of fat stores prior to, and depletion of such stores during, wing moult is adaptive and likely to be a feature of individual plasticity to meet particular needs, such as undertaking moult migration to remote sites where precise foraging and predation conditions cannot be anticipated, or where competition from more dominant individuals may restrict their access to a reliable food supply. © 2016 British Ornithologists’ Union},

abstract={The zebrafish has been gaining prominence in the field of behavioural brain research as this species offers a good balance between system complexity and practical simplicity.

Here we describe and utilize a novel visual discrimination task with which we evaluated acquisition of CS (colour)-US (sight of conspecifics) association in adult zebrafish. We report significant acquisition of CS-US association indicated by the increased time the fish spent in and the increased frequency of visits of the target chamber during a probe trial in the absence of reward. Given the simplicity of the apparatus and procedure, we conclude that the new task may be employed to assay learning and memory in adult zebrafish in an efficient manner. © 2016},

abstract={Risk attitude is often regarded as an intrinsic parameter in the individual personality. However, ethological studies reported state-dependent strategy optimization irrespective of individual preference. To synthesize the two contrasting literatures, we developed a novel gambling task that dynamically manipulated the quota severity (required outcome to clear the task) in a course of choice trials and conducted a task-fMRI study in human participants. The participants showed their individual risk preference when they had no quota constraint (‘individual-preference mode’), while they adopted state-dependent optimal strategy when they needed to achieve a quota (‘strategy-optimization mode’). fMRI analyses illustrated that the interplay among prefrontal areas and salience-network areas reflected the quota severity and the utilization of the optimal strategy, shedding light on the neural substrates of the quota-dependent risk attitude. Our results demonstrated the complex nature of risk-sensitive decision-making and may provide a new perspective for the understanding of problematic risky behaviors in human. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Introduction Fractures are known sequelae of seizures. We present a young male with bilateral acetabula and surgical neck of humerus (SNOH), right neck of femur (NOF) and thoracolumbar fractures in the context of a hypocalcaemic seizure secondary to severe malnutrition, secondary hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency. The authors believe that numerous severe injuries in a single patient secondary to seizure are extremely rare and have not been seen in the literature. Case report A 25-year-old male presented to A&E following a collapse. He described limited movement and pain in all four limbs and collateral history described a generalised tonic–clonic seizure. XR and CT identified pelvic, femoral and humeral fractures, as well as compression fractures of T11, T12 and L1 vertebrae. His pelvic, femoral and SNOH fractures all required ORIF with intra-operative biopsy revealing abnormal bone quality. His spinal fractures did not require management. His young age and severe injuries prompted endocrinology and neurological evaluation. These revealed severe malnutrition secondary to behavioural and dietary factors with severe hypocalcaemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency. His metabolic and nutritional deficits were replaced intravenously and orally and his seizure attributed to hypocalcaemia. Discussion and conclusion Clinical suspicion for fractures should be high as the rate of fracture following seizure is approximately 6% [1]. Close evaluation and tertiary survey should be completed as missed musculoskeletal injury has been reported to be over 10% [2] and pre-existing medical and social risk factors may increase the incidence of these injuries [3–4]. Given the young man's presentation, a high clinical suspicion was held for an underlying syndrome such as osteomalacia. Secondary to early aggressive treatment, a biopsy performed was non-diagnostic and features of osteomalacia were not present. Due to the potential consequences of a seizure, the authors recommend individuals who present with seizure or collapse be thoroughly examined and investigated to ensure no co-existing injury or pathology. © 2016 The Authors},

Correlations, repeated measures ANOVAs and regressions were performed to examine the validity of MRO variables and their stability across both time points. Validation analysis showed the MRO coding system performed as expected: dyads with higher MRO scores expressed lower control/power assertion, lower child non-compliance, and greater committed compliance. The measure demonstrated sensitivity to specific contexts: maternal responsiveness, mother and child positive affect were higher during food consumption compared to food preparation. Coded dimensions were stable across time points, with the exception of decreases in maternal responsiveness in food consumption and child non-compliance in food preparation. MRO and maternal dimensions were correlated with maternally reported parenting and feeding measures. Maternal responsiveness (inversely) and child responsiveness (positively) were concurrently associated with child fussy eating, and child refusal was prospectively and inversely associated with child fussy eating. Findings suggest the adapted MRO coding system is a useful measure for examining observed parent-child mealtime interactions potentially implicated in preschoolers’ eating and weight development. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Objective: To investigate the interactions between low parental warmth and monitoring at age 13-14 years and disordered eating attitudes and behaviours at age 15-16 years. Method: Data on 1300 (667 females) adolescents and their parents were drawn from The Australian Temperament Project (ATP), a 30 year (15 wave) population based longitudinal study of social-emotional development. Parent participants completed surveys on parenting practices in late childhood, and adolescent participants reported disordered eating using the drive for thinness and bulimia subscales of the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) and an additional body dissatisfaction scale. Interaction was examined on the additive scale by estimating super-additive risk; i.e., risk in excess of the sum of individual risks. Results: For boys, neither parental warmth or monitoring, nor their interaction, was related to disordered eating. For girls, low parental warmth (alone) was associated with bulimic behaviours. In contrast, exposure to both low monitoring and warmth was associated with ~31/2-fold, ~4-fold and ~5-fold increases in the odds of reporting body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness and bulimia, respectively. For body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness, risk associated with joint exposure exceeded the sum of individual risks, suggesting an additive interaction between parenting styles. Conclusion: Further investment in family-level interventions that focus on promoting parental monitoring behaviour and a warm parent-child relationship remain important strategies for preventing a range of disordered eating behaviours in adolescents. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The stress associated with starvation is accompanied by compensatory behaviours that enhance foraging efficiency and increase the probability of encountering food. However, the molecular details of how hunger triggers changes in the activity of neural circuits to elicit these adaptive behavioural outcomes remains to be resolved. We show here that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates neuronal activity to elicit appropriate behavioural outcomes in response to acute starvation, and this effect is mediated by the coordinated modulation of glutamatergic inputs. AMPK targets both the AMPA-type glutamate receptor GLR-1 and the metabotropic glutamate receptor MGL-1 in one of the primary circuits that governs behavioural response to food availability in C. elegans. Overall, our study suggests that AMPK acts as a molecular trigger in the specific starvation-sensitive neurons to modulate glutamatergic inputs and to elicit adaptive behavioural outputs in response to acute starvation. © Ahmadi and Roy.},

abstract={Food neophobia is a personality trait that can influence children's food preferences and, therefore, their intake of different food groups. The association between food neophobia and nutritional status (both anthropometric and body composition measures) remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine whether Spanish children and adolescents with food neophobia show a different Mediterranean diet quality and different body composition measures compared with their non-neophobic peers. A community sample of 831 participants (368 males and 463 females) aged between 8 and 16 years were classified into three groups based on scores obtained on the Spanish Child Food Neophobia Scale. The results showed that food neophobia was not related to either BMI or body fat percentage, although neophobic children did have slightly lower weight and skeletal muscle mass than their neophilic counterparts. The KidMed index showed that neophobic children and adolescents presented a poorer quality of Mediterranean diet, due to a lower intake of fruit, vegetables, and fish, a higher intake of sweets or candy, and by reason of having an unbalanced breakfast. Neophobia was more common among females than males, but its occurrence was similar across age groups. These findings support previous research suggesting that neophobia impacts on diet quality. However, no relationship between diet and BMI was found. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Behavioral traits and diet were traditionally thought to be highly plastic within individuals. This view was espoused in the widespread use of optimality models, which broadly predict that individuals can modify behavioral traits and diet across ecological contexts to maximize fitness. Yet, research conducted over the past 15 years supports an alternative view; fundamental behavioral traits (e.g., activity level, exploration, sociability, boldness and aggressiveness) and diet often vary among individuals and this variation persists over time and across contexts. This phenomenon has been termed animal personality with regard to behavioral traits and individual specialization with regard to diet. While these aspects of individual-level phenotypic variation have been thus far studied in isolation, emerging evidence suggests that personality and individual specialization may covary, or even be causally related. Building on this work, we present the overarching hypothesis that animal personality can drive specialization through individual differences in various aspects of consumer foraging behavior. Specifically, we suggest pathways by which consumer personality traits influence foraging activity, risk-dependent foraging, roles in social foraging groups, spatial aspects of foraging and physiological drivers of foraging, which in turn can lead to consistent individual differences in food resource use. These pathways provide a basis for generating testable hypotheses directly linking animal personality to ecological dynamics, a major goal in contemporary behavioral ecology. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

It has now established in a large region of Japan following accidental translocation. Although large water bodies with abundant food resources were long considered essential for establishing this species, the chub has settled in small irrigation ditches in Kyushu. In this study, we explored the phenotypic responses of the chub in these small water bodies by comparing life history traits and morphology with those of chub inhabiting a native lake. Growth rate, fecundity-related traits, and trunk length shifted markedly following translocation to the new habitat. These phenotypic shifts were typical reactions to characteristic conditions of irrigation ditches, such as habitat instability, lotic conditions, and limited food. Adaptability via a rapid phenotypic shift by the chub may have facilitated establishment of populations in small irrigation ditches. © 2016, The Ecological Society of Japan.},

abstract={In marine ecosystems, primary productivity and consequently food availability for higher trophic levels are often strongly affected by the water temperature. Thus, differences in sea surface temperatures (SST) may lead to differences in the diet composition of predators, but this link is still unknown in many species. By combining GPS tracking and dive analyses on chick-rearing southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) with stable isotope analyses and monitoring of chick growth rates and chick survival, we here attempted a comprehensive assessment of the effects of inter-annual environmental variability as indicated by SST and chlorophyll a (reflecting primary productivity) data. Inter-annual differences in environmental variables around our study colony on New Island, Falkland/Malvinas Islands, contradicted the general expectation, with higher chlorophyll a concentrations coinciding with higher spring SST in 2010/2011 compared to 2009/2010. Penguins foraged further away from the colony during guard and crèche in 2010/2011 compared to 2009/2010, while performing deeper dives in 2009/2010. Stable isotope mixing models suggested a crustacean-dominated chick diet in 2009/2010, compared to a mixture of squid and fish in 2010/2011. These differences in foraging behaviour and diet, however, had no consequences for chick growth rates or chick survival and thus had no apparent effect on population trajectories. Potentially, environmental conditions in both years could still be seen as favourable compared to other years and breeding sites, enabling the parental birds to buffer the environmental differences by plastic foraging behaviour. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Different phenological responses to climate changes by species representing preys and predators may lead to mismatch between functionally dependent components of an ecosystem, with important effects on its structure and functioning. Here, we investigate within-season variation in zooplankton availability, chick diet composition and breeding performance of a small planktivorous seabird, the little auk (Alle alle) in two large colonies in Hornsund and Magdalenefjorden, Spitsbergen, differing in synchrony of breeding (11-day vs. 22-day hatching period, respectively). Assuming similar zooplankton phenology and existing differences in duration of the little auk breeding period, we expected lower availability of the preferred food in the less synchronized colony in Magdalenefjorden and in consequence a negative effect on nestling body mass and survival. We found that in both colonies Calanus glacialis (copepodite stage CV) was the most important prey item in the chick diet making up 68–87 % of the biomass and energy of all prey items. The only exception was the end of the chick-rearing period in Magdalenefjorden, when contribution of this prey item was significantly lower (24–26 %). Thus, late breeders in Magdalenefjorden were apparently mismatched regarding C. glacialis CV availability. However, the hatching date did not affect birds fitness (reproductive output and chick pre-fledging mass) significantly. Results of our study indicate that little auks breeding on Spitsbergen can respond to a wide range of environmental conditions and prey availabilities through the plasticity of their foraging behaviour, which may help them to maintain their optimum fitness level in changing and unpredictable environments. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a trauma and stressor-related disorder that results in a prolonged stress response. It is associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HC). The only approved therapy for PTSD is selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but their efficacy is marginal. Recently, we demonstrated that over-production of norepinephrine (NE) as the possible reason for the lack of efficacy of SSRIs. Hence, there is a need for novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of PTSD. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory role of blueberries in modulating inflammatory markers and neurotransmitter levels in PTSD. Rats were fed either a blueberry enriched (2%) or a control diet. Rats were exposed to cats for one hour on days 1 and 11 of a 31-day schedule to simulate traumatic conditions. The rats were also subjected to psychosocial stress via daily cage cohort changes. At the end of the study, the rats were euthanized and the PFC and HC were isolated. Monoamines were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), gene and protein expression levels of inflammatory cytokines were also measured. In our PTSD model, NE levels were increased and 5-HT levels were decreased when compared to control. In contrast, a blueberry enriched diet increased 5-HT without affecting NE levels. The rate limiting enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase were also studied and they confirmed our findings. The enhanced levels free radicals, gene and protein expression of inflammatory cytokines seen in the PTSD group were normalized with a blueberry enriched diet. Decreased anxiety in this group was shown by improved performance on the elevated plus-maze. These findings indicate blueberries can attenuate oxidative stress and inflammation and restore neurotransmitter imbalances in a rat model of PTSD.},

abstract={Starvation is defined as a failure to consume food following an extrinsic limitation. By focusing on arthropods, I provide here a detailed review of how starvation affects foraging behaviour, predation avoidance, aggressive interactions and reproductive behaviour. Behaviour following starvation is shaped by the trade-off between the value of food, which increases with hunger level, and other vital needs, such as reproduction and avoiding ending up as prey. Foraging should take place as long as its marginal benefit outweighs the associated costs, including the avoidance of other important activities. Because starvation affects both the benefit and cost of foraging, it has various effects on behaviour. Most of the behaviours of hungry animals are selected to increase the likelihood of detecting food and better exploit it. The effect of starvation on foraging has usually revealed an increase in activity, albeit also occasionally a decrease, possibly due to a lowered metabolic rate or exhaustion. Predation avoidance becomes compromised when arthropods are hungry. Such hunger is also expressed in choosing riskier but prey-richer habitats and in not avoiding dangerous behaviours. Starvation elevates aggression and competition, as well as cannibalism. However, starved individuals are not necessarily more often victorious in such conflicts. Reproductive activities, such as male courting, female responsiveness and mating duration, decrease under starvation. An exception to this are females that gain material benefits, such as nuptial gifts, and which often increase their sexual activity in the face of starvation. I suggest that several behavioural responses to starvation follow a hump-shaped pattern, such as an increase followed by a decrease in foraging and aggression intensities with increasing hunger level. I highlight several research approaches, such as uncovering the link between starvation-induced changes in behaviour and fitness, and their underlying physiological mechanisms. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Ontogenetic colour changes in animals generally involve cryptic juveniles developing conspicuous coloration when they achieve sexual maturity. However, there are several species in which juveniles develop conspicuously coloured tails that become cryptic in adults. In lizards, colourful tails may act as an antipredator mechanism, either by diverting predator attacks from vital body parts to the expendable tail (decoy hypothesis) or, when associated with tail movements, by signalling to the potential predator that it has been spotted and an attack will probably not succeed (pursuit deterrent hypothesis). In both cases, the antipredator function would allow lizards with colourful tails to show more risk-taking behaviours. The aim of this study was to test whether conspicuous coloration was related to risk behaviours in spiny-footed lizards, Acanthodactylus erythrurus, a species with red-tailed juveniles. Behaviour was recorded in free-ranging lizards and several risk-related behavioural indices were calculated. As predicted, risk behaviour and tail coloration were found to be related, as redder (less orange) lizards stayed further from refuge, maybe because redder coloration was associated with a perception of lower predation risk. Coloration was not related to any other behavioural index, including tail displays, but the level of activity was negatively related to lizard size, suggesting a change towards less active behaviour associated with growth, probably because energy and thermoregulatory requirements depend on body size. In conclusion, the link between red coloration and risk-taking behaviour in spiny-footed lizards supports the antipredator function of this coloration that enables more colourful lizards to take more risks when necessary. Moreover, the nonsignificant association between coloration and tail displays is not consistent with the pursuit deterrent hypothesis, thus making the decoy hypothesis more probable. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Ghrelin, a peptide hormone produced by the stomach, is the endogenous ligand for the Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor (GHSR). Ghrelin acts on the GHSR to increase food intake, appetitive behaviors, and adiposity. Recently, a rat model with a null mutation to the GHSR gene (FHH-GHSRm1/Mcwi) was generated and used in behavioral studies, but the basic metabolic phenotype of this strain as well as that of the background strain (Fawn Hooded Hypertensive, FHH) has not been characterized in detail. Here we compared male FHH-GHSRm1/Mcwi rats with their wild-type littermates (FHH-WT) in a number of metabolic parameters. In the 24 h of recovery following an acute overnight fast, FHH-GHSRm1/Mcwi rats consumed less food than FHH-WT animals, and relative to their body weights, adult FHH-GHSRm1/Mcwi rats consumed fewer calories when placed on a high-fat diet. Despite this, FHH-GHSRm1/Mcwi rats did not show a difference in diet-induced obesity or weight gain. Fasted FHH-GHSRm1/Mcwi rats exhibited increased Agouti-Related Peptide (AgRP) and Neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression in the Arcuate Nucleus (ARC), indicative of altered central regulation of feeding and energy balance. FHH-GHSRm1/Mcwi rats exhibited lower levels of home cage locomotor behavior over the entire light/dark cycle, and reduced levels of food anticipatory activity when placed on a restricted feeding schedule. Finally, FHH-GHSRm1/Mcwi rats consumed less of a palatable dessert (cookie dough) given after the completion of the scheduled meal. Altogether, our data show that rats lacking a functional GHSR tend to eat less than their wild-type counterparts in the face of acute fasts, chronic high-fat diet exposure, and exposure to a palatable dessert, despite not showing differences in body weight and glucose homeostasis that are characteristic of GHSR null mice. These data indicate that many, but not all responses to GHSR ablation are conserved between rats and mice. The FHH-GHSRm1/Mcwi rat thus represents a novel and useful model for studying GHSR function in rats. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Environmental constraints are strong in migratory species that breed in the Arctic. In addition to breeding, Anatidae have to renew all their flight feathers during the short arctic summer. We examine how temporal constraints and climate affect the phenology of flight feather moult in the greater snow goose Chen caerulescens atlantica, a High Arctic nesting species. We used a database of 1412 moulting adult females measured over 15 yr on Bylot Island, Nunavut. Ninth (9th) primary length was used to determine the moult stage and speed of feather growth. We found a positive relationship between median annual hatching and moult initiation dates and the slope did not differ from 1. The interval between hatching and moult initiation was thus rather fixed and geese did not initiate moult earlier when reproductive phenology was delayed. Nonetheless, there was no relationship between median hatching date and the date at which birds regained flight capacity, suggesting that date of end of moult is independent of the reproductive phenology. There was a trend for an increase in the speed of flight feather growth in years with delayed hatching date. This is the most likely mechanism that could explain moult phenology adjustment in this species. Finally, we found a positive relationship between 9th primary length (corrected for inter-annual variations) and body condition, suggesting a delay in moulting for individuals in poor condition. These results suggest that moult plasticity is primarily governed by variations in feather growth speed. This phenotypic plasticity could be necessary to complete flight feather renewal before the end of the arctic summer, independently of reproductive phenology and spring environmental conditions. Our novel results suggest possible phenological adjustments through moult speed, which was considered constant in geese until now. © 2016 The Authors},

abstract={Introduction The Safety Pharmacology Society (SPS) and National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement & Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs) conducted a survey and workshop in 2015 to define current industry practices relating to housing of non-rodents during telemetry recordings in safety pharmacology and toxicology studies. The aim was to share experiences, canvas opinion on the study procedures/designs that could be used and explore the barriers to social housing. Methods Thirty-nine sites, either running studies (Sponsors or Contract Research Organisations, CROs) and/or outsourcing work responded to the survey (51% from Europe; 41% from USA). Results During safety pharmacology studies, 84, 67 and 100% of respondents socially house dogs, minipigs and non-human primates (NHPs) respectively on non-recording days. However, on recording days 20, 20 and 33% of respondents socially house the animals, respectively. The main barriers for social housing were limitations in the recording equipment used, study design and animal temperament/activity. During toxicology studies, 94, 100 and 100% of respondents socially house dogs, minipigs and NHPs respectively on non-recording days. However, on recording days 31, 25 and 50% of respondents socially house the animals, respectively. The main barriers for social housing were risk of damage to and limitations in the recording equipment used, food consumption recording and temperament/activity of the animals. Conclusions Although the majority of the industry does not yet socially house animals during telemetry recordings in safety pharmacology and toxicology studies, there is support to implement this refinement. Continued discussions, sharing of best practice and data from companies already socially housing, combined with technology improvements and investments in infrastructure are required to maintain the forward momentum of this refinement across the industry. © 2016 The Authors},

abstract={The evolution of sociality is often accompanied by nutritional conflicts and the evolution of mechanisms to resolve them. The foraging behaviour of eusocial animals such as the honeybee, Apis mellifera, is generally considered to be largely regulated by the colony nutritional state. Previous work based on the information primacy hypothesis has however found that honeybee foragers explore (sample resources) and exploit (consume resources) in accordance with their individual nutritional state. We therefore hypothesized that individual and colony nutritional states differ in their influence on individuals of different behavioural phenotypes such as dancers and followers, who are akin to producers and scroungers, respectively. This leads to the prediction that these two behavioural groups will differ with respect to their exploration–exploitation trade-off and in terms of how they prioritize individual and colony nutritional states. We tested our predictions by creating a mismatch between individual and colony nutritional states. Our results show that dancers and followers do not differ in their levels of exploration and exploitation, but dancers are more responsive to colony nutritional state than are followers with regard to managing their exploration–exploitation trade-off. We discuss these results in the context of how these two behavioural phenotypes may differ in their sensitivity to the different nutritional pathways regulating worker behaviour in a eusocial colony and the evolution of sociality in general. © 2016},

abstract={Conifer bark beetles attack and kill mature spruce and pine trees, especially during hot and dry conditions. These beetles are closely associated with ophiostomatoid fungi of the Ascomycetes, including the genera Ophiostoma, Grosmannia, and Endoconidiophora, which enhance beetle success by improving nutrition and modifying their substrate, but also have negative impacts on beetles by attracting predators and parasites. A survey of the literature and our own data revealed that ophiostomatoid fungi emit a variety of volatile organic compounds under laboratory conditions including fusel alcohols, terpenoids, aromatic compounds, and aliphatic alcohols. Many of these compounds already have been shown to elicit behavioral responses from bark beetles, functioning as attractants or repellents, often as synergists to compounds currently used in bark beetle control. Thus, these compounds could serve as valuable new agents for bark beetle management. However, bark beetle associations with fungi are very complex. Beetle behavior varies with the species of fungus, the stage of the beetle life cycle, the host tree quality, and probably with changes in the emission rate of fungal volatiles. Additional research on bark beetles and their symbiotic associates is necessary before the basic significance of ophiostomatoid fungal volatiles can be understood and their applied potential realized. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={It is widely known that caloric restriction (CR) has benefits on several organic systems, including the central nervous system. However, the majority of the CR studies was performed in adult animals and the information about the consequences on young populations is limited. In this study, we analyzed the effects of young-onset CR, started at 4 weeks of age, in the number of neuropeptide Y (NPY)-containing neurons and in neurogenesis of the hippocampal formation, using doublecortin (DCX) and Ki67 as markers. Knowing that CR treatment could interfere with exploratory activity, anxiety, learning and memory we have analyzed the performance of the rats in the open-field, elevated plus-maze and Morris water maze tests. Animals aged 4 weeks were randomly assigned to control or CR groups. Controls were maintained in the ad libitum regimen during 2 months. The adolescent CR rats were fed, during 2 months, with 60% of the amount of food consumed by controls. We have found that young-onset CR treatment did not affect the total number of NPY-immunopositive neurons in dentate hilus, CA3 and CA1 hippocampal subfields and did not change the exploratory activity and anxiety levels. Interestingly, we have found that young-onset CR might affect spatial learning process since those animals showed worse performance during the acquisition phase of Morris water maze. Furthermore, young-onset CR induced alterations of neurogenesis in the dentate subgranular layer that seems to underlie the impairment of spatial learning. Our data suggest that adolescent animals are vulnerable to CR treatment and that this diet is not suitable to be applied in this age phase. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={A rise in the occurrence of obesity has driven exploration of its underlying genetic basis and potential targets for intervention. GWAS studies have identified obesity susceptibility pathways involving several neuropeptides that control energy homeostasis, suggesting that variations in the genes that regulate food intake and energy expenditure may contribute to obesity. In this study, we identified 5 additional obesity loci, including a neuronal orphan GPCR called Gpr45, in a forward genetic screen of mutant mice generated by piggyBac insertional mutagenesis. Disruption of Gpr45 led to increased adiposity at the time of weaning and increases in body mass, fat content, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis with advancing age. Mice with disruptions in Gpr45 also displayed a reduction in expression of the metabolic regulator POMC and less energy expenditure prior to the onset of obesity. Mechanistically, we determined that GPR45 regulates POMC expression via the JAK/STAT pathway in a cell-autonomous manner. Consistent with this finding, intraventricular administration of melanotan-2, an analog of the POMC derivative a-MSH, suppressed adult obesity in Gpr45 mutants. These results reveal that GPR45 is a regulator of POMC signaling and energy expenditure, which suggests that it may be a potential intervention target to combat obesity.},

abstract={If genetic architectures of various quantitative traits are similar, as studies on model organisms suggest, comparable selection pressures should produce similar molecular patterns for various traits. To test this prediction, we used a laboratory model of vertebrate adaptive radiation to investigate the genetic basis of the response to selection for predatory behavior and compare it with evolution of aerobic capacity reported in an earlier work. After 13 generations of selection, the proportion of bank voles (Myodes [=Clethrionomys] glareolus) showing predatory behavior was five times higher in selected lines than in controls. We analyzed the hippocampus and liver transcriptomes and found repeatable changes in allele frequencies and gene expression. Genes with the largest differences between predatory and control lines are associated with hunger, aggression, biological rhythms, and functioning of the nervous system. Evolution of predatory behavior could be meaningfully compared with evolution of high aerobic capacity, because the experiments and analyses were performed in the same methodological framework. The number of genes that changed expression was much smaller in predatory lines, and allele frequencies changed repeatably in predatory but not in aerobic lines. This suggests that more variants of smaller effects underlie variation in aerobic performance, whereas fewer variants of larger effects underlie variation in predatory behavior. Our results thus contradict the view that comparable selection pressures for different quantitative traits produce similar molecular patterns. Therefore, to gain knowledge about molecular-level response to selection for complex traits, we need to investigate not only multiple replicate populations but also multiple quantitative traits. © 2016 The Author.},

abstract={Prey may use multiple sensory channels to detect predators, whose cues may differ in altered sensory environments, such as turbid conditions. Depending on the environment, prey may use cues in an additive/complementary manner or in a compensatory manner. First, to determine whether the purely aquatic Barton Springs salamander, Eurycea sosorum, show an antipredator response to visual cues, we examined their activity when exposed to either visual cues of a predatory fish (Lepomis cyanellus) or a non-predatory fish (Etheostoma lepidum). Salamanders decreased activity in response to predator visual cues only. Then, we examined the antipredator response of these salamanders to all matched and mismatched combinations of chemical and visual cues of the same predatory and non-predatory fish in clear and low turbidity conditions. Salamanders decreased activity in response to predator chemical cues matched with predator visual cues or mismatched with non-predator visual cues. Salamanders also increased latency to first move to predator chemical cues mismatched with non-predator visual cues. Salamanders decreased activity and increased latency to first move more in clear as opposed to turbid conditions in all treatment combinations. Our results indicate that salamanders under all conditions and treatments preferentially rely on chemical cues to determine antipredator behavior, although visual cues are potentially utilized in conjunction for latency to first move. Our results also have potential conservation implications, as decreased antipredator behavior was seen in turbid conditions. These results reveal complexity of antipredator behavior in response to multiple cues under different environmental conditions, which is especially important when considering endangered species. © 2016},

abstract={Psychological trauma and obesity co-occur frequently and have been identified as major risk factors for psychiatric disorders. Surprisingly, preclinical studies examining how obesity disrupts the ability of the brain to cope with psychological trauma are lacking. The objective of this study was to determine whether an obesogenic Western-like high-fat diet (WD) predisposes rats to post-traumatic stress responsivity. Adolescent Lewis rats (postnatal day 28) were fed ad libitum for 8 weeks with either the experimental WD diet (41.4% kcal from fat) or the control diet (16.5% kcal from fat). We modeled psychological trauma by exposing young adult rats to a cat odor threat. The elevated plus maze and the open field test revealed increased psychological trauma-induced anxiety-like behaviors in the rats that consumed theWDwhen compared with control animals 1 week after undergoing traumatic stress (p<0.05). Magnetic resonance imaging showed significant hippocampal atrophy (20% reduction) and lateral ventricular enlargement (50% increase) in the animals fed the WD when compared with controls. These volumetric abnormalities were associated with behavioral indices of anxiety, increased leptin and FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) levels, and reduced hippocampal blood vessel density. We found asymmetric structural vulnerabilities to the WD, particularly the ventral and left hippocampus and lateral ventricle. This study highlights how WD consumption during adolescence impacts key substrates implicated in post-traumatic stress disorder. Understanding how consumption of a WD affects the developmental trajectories of the stress neurocircuitry is critical, as stress susceptibility imposes a marked vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders. © 2016 Kalyan-Masih et al.},

abstract={Plants make foraging decisions that are dependent on ecological conditions, such as resource availability and distribution. Despite the field of plant behavioral ecology gaining momentum, ecologists still know little about what factors impact plant behavior, especially light-foraging behavior. We made use of the behavioral reaction norm approach to investigate light foraging in a plant species that exhibits rapid movement: Mimosa pudica. We explored how herbivore avoidance behavior in M. pudica (which closes its leaflets temporarily when disturbed) is affected by an individual's energy state and the quality of the current environment and also repeatedly tested the behavior of individuals from two seed sources to determine whether individuals exhibit a “personality” (i.e., behavioral syndrome). We found that when individuals are in a low-energy state, they adopt a riskier light-foraging strategy, opening leaflets faster, and not closing leaflets as often in response to a disturbance. However, when plants are in a high-energy state, they exhibit a plastic light-foraging strategy dependent on environment quality. Although we found no evidence that individuals exhibit behavioral syndromes, we found that individuals from different seed sources consistently behave differently from each other. Our results suggest that plants are capable of making state-dependent decisions and that plant decision making is complex, depending on the interplay between internal and external factors. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex genetic condition and is a highly prevalent heterogeneous syndrome of clinical and biochemical androgen excess. The disease has genetic as well as environmental involvements. The normal menstrual cycle results from a coordination of hormonal secretion and signaling within the hypothalamic pituitary-ovarian axis. Alterations in the normal cycle or irregularity in menstrual cycle result in amenorrhea, abnormal uterine bleeding, etc. The main causes are PCOS, hormonal imbalance, drugs, nutritional deficiency, personality, some genetic factors, and many more. Women with PCOS are often resistant to the biological effects of insulin and, as a consequence, may have high insulin levels. Women with PCOS are at risk for type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. Obesity also appears to worsen the condition. The impact of the syndrome on an individual varies significantly based on several factors such as the severity of the components, comorbidities, and life course considerations. In addition, each individual experiences the syndrome in the context of her own reproductive health, metabolic, and quality-of-life concerns. Hirsutism, obesity, and infertility are common complaints. This review article gives a detailed account on the association of candidate genes associated with PCOS in South Asian population. © 2016, Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt. Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Identifying the amount of prey available is an important part of an animal’s foraging behaviour. The risk-sensitive foraging theory predicts that an organism’s foraging decisions with regard to food rewards depending upon its satiation level. However, the precise interaction between optimal risk-tolerance and satiation level remains unclear. In this study, we examined, firstly, whether cuttlefish, with one of the most highly evolved nervous system among the invertebrates, have number sense, and secondly, whether their valuation of food reward is satiation state dependent. When food such as live shrimps is present, without training, cuttlefish turn toward the prey and initiate seizure behaviour. Using this visual attack behaviour as a measure, cuttlefish showed a preference for a larger quantity when faced with two-alternative forced choice tasks (1 versus 2, 2 versus 3, 3 versus 4 and 4 versus 5). However, cuttlefish preferred the small quantity when the choice was between one live and two dead shrimps. More importantly, when the choice was between one large live shrimp and two small live shrimps (a prey size and quantity trade-off), the cuttlefish chose the large single shrimp when they felt hunger, but chose the two smaller prey when they were satiated. These results demonstrate that cuttlefish are capable of number discrimination and that their choice of prey number depends on the quality of the prey and on their appetite state. The findings also suggest that cuttlefish integrate both internal and external information when making a foraging decision and that the cost of obtaining food is inversely correlated with their satiation level, a phenomenon similar to the observation that metabolic state alters economic decision making under risk among humans. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={The mammalian brain has evolved in close synchrony with the natural environment; consequently, trends toward disengagement from natural environments in today's industrialized societies may compromise adaptive neural responses and lead to psychiatric illness. Investigations of rodents housed in enriched environments indicate enhanced neurobiological complexity; yet, the origin of these stimuli, natural vs. manufactured, has not been sufficiently explored. In the current study, groups of rats were exposed to one of three environments: (1) a standard environment with only food and water, (2) an artificial-enriched environment with manufactured stimuli and (3) a natural-enriched environment with natural stimuli. Results indicated that, during the dark phase, natural-enriched animals exhibited longer durations interacting with objects than the artificial-enriched group; further, the natural-enriched group engaged in more social behavior than the other two groups. Both enriched groups exhibited less anxiety in response to a novel object but the natural-enriched rats exhibited less anxiety-typical behavior in response to a predator odor than the other groups. Less fos activation in the amygdala was observed in both enriched groups following a water escape task whereas an increase in fos activation in the nucleus accumbens was observed in the natural-enriched animals. Thus, the current findings indicate the potential importance of exposure to complex environments, especially natural-like habitats, in the maintenance of emotional health, perhaps providing a buffer against the emergence of anxiogenic responses. © 2016.},

abstract={Nutritional disorders are now spreading worldwide both in developed and developing countries. Body image ideals and dissatisfaction have been linked to a number of poor health outcomes, including nutritional disorders. While previous studies have offered insight into weight status and body image perception of immigrants in North America, very few studies have analysed these aspects in migrants from Africa to Europe. Our review examines the effects of the migration process on beauty ideals and body dissatisfaction in African immigrants in Europe compared to residents in their own countries. The PubMed, PsycINFO and Google Scholar databases were searched for studies published from January 2000 till November 2015. Of the 730 titles identified, 26 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the present review. Among African residents, the body preferences depend on the country of residence and their socio-cultural status. Ethnic groups living in great isolation or with low incomes still have an ancestral idea of beauty, preferring a shapely body. However ethnic groups living in urban areas are moving toward Westernization of beauty ideals, preferring underweight or normal weight bodies. This review highlights that both residents and migrants are at high risk of nutritional disorders due to the adoption of Western beauty ideals. The results suggest that body dissatisfaction and BMI are increasing from Southern Africa to Europe according to a geographical gradient (described for females by Spearman's coefficient and linear regression, respectively). We emphasize the need for monitoring of the weight and psychological status of immigrants and the development of specific preventive strategies in European countries. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Although it is known that maternal disordered eating is related to restrictive feeding practices, there is little research exploring mechanisms for this association or its effects on other feeding practices. The purpose of this study was to assess whether maternal emotion responses mediate the association between maternal binge eating (BE) and child feeding practices, in order to identify potential risk factors for feeding practices that influence child weight. Methods: This longitudinal observational study included (n = 260) mothers and children from the STRONG Kids Panel Survey. At Wave 1, children were an average of 37 months old (SD = 6.9), and at Wave 2 children were an average of 57 months old (SD = 8.3). Mothers self-reported their frequency of binge eating behavior (Wave 1), responses to children's negative emotions (Wave 1), feeding practices (Wave 1 and Wave 2), and child height and weight were measured at both time points. Using bias-corrected bootstrapping procedures, we tested the hypothesis that longitudinal associations between maternal BE and nonresponsive parent feeding practices would be mediated by parents' unsupportive responses to children's negative emotion. We also tested a serial mediation model positing that maternal BE predicts child body mass index (BMI) percentile change 18-24 months later, indirectly through unsupportive responses to negative emotion and nonresponsive feeding practices. Results: Maternal BE predicted use of more nonresponsive feeding practices (e.g. Emotion Regulation, Restriction for Health, Pressure to Eat, and Food as Reward), indirectly through more Distress responses to children's negative emotions. In the serial mediation model, maternal BE was associated with greater use of Distress responses, which indirectly predicted higher child BMI percentile through Food as Reward feeding practices. Conclusions: These results suggest that maternal eating and emotion responsiveness are important for understanding the interpersonal context of feeding behaviors, and child weight outcomes. Distress responses may serve as a risk factor for use of unhealthful feeding practices among mothers with BE and these responses may increase children's risk for weight gain. Trial registration: This study used an observational prospective design. Therefore, it has not been registered as a clinical intervention trial. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={The management and recovery of large predator populations in areas where human persecution has driven them to ecological extinction requires a solid understanding of the effects of both predation and food limitation on prey populations. We used 11 yr of data on reported losses among 17.3 million free-ranging sheep Ovis aries in the Norwegian farming industry to elucidate the relative roles of climate, vegetation characteristics, sheep densities, lamb body mass and densities of predators and alternative prey on the number of lambs and ewes lost on summer pastures. We first examined whether predator densities predicted autumn lamb body mass through possible impacts of predators on body growth (non-lethal effects) but found no evidence for such effects in our study system. This might be due to weak anti-predator behavioral responses in domesticated sheep. However, autumn lamb body mass was predicted by both sheep density and winter and spring weather conditions, probably through food availability. Losses of both lambs and ewes were positively and strongly related to the density of Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx, wolverine Gulo gulo and brown bear Ursus arctos. In addition, food availability and spring weather conditions were associated to losses of lambs, while precipitation in May predicted losses of ewes. There was little evidence for interaction effects of predator species on losses, suggesting that most of the effects of the predators were additive to each other. Given the strong effect of predator densities on sheep losses, we conclude that changing livestock husbandry practices towards a system that actively protects sheep and/or active management of predator densities may be necessary to reduce sheep losses where predators are recolonizing. © 2015 The Authors},

abstract={Abstract: Theory-based predictions on asymmetries in animal contests have seldom been tested in situations where payoff asymmetries exist among contestants otherwise clearly matched for physical fighting capacity (i.e., resource holding potential, RHP). We examined the effects of food availability and predation risk on contest outcomes and the maintenance of dominance hierarchies in size-matched male noble crayfish pairs (Astacus astacus). Following theoretical predictions, dominant status established via contests staged in a non-resource context successfully predicted contest outcome (resource use) once resources were made available. Still, resource availability significantly increased the aggressive motivation of subordinates and sometimes resulted in hierarchy reversals. In subsequent resource-based contests, subordinates increased their fighting intensity, whereas dominants reduced their fighting motivation, potentially reflecting hunger-driven payoff asymmetries. Moreover, the data support the “asset-protection” principle by showing for the first time that predation risk lowered the aggressive motivation of dominants. At the same time, the percentage of fighting bouts won by subordinates increased significantly, leading to reversal of prior dominance relationships in 30 % of pairs. Compared to pairs where the hierarchy was retained through the different contests, pairs where dominance was reversed were characterized by smaller RHP asymmetries, which is again consistent with theory. These results show how animal contest behavior can be sensitive to the complex interactive effects of prior experience, resource value and RHP. Furthermore, in systems where repeated contests lead to dominance hierarchies, reversals within the hierarchy may occur more often when the RHP asymmetry between contestants is small. Significance Statement: Contest outcome and resulting dominance status of contestants may be influenced by relative resource value and perceived costs involved in animal contests, especially when individuals are similar in major correlates of fighting ability, i.e., often body and weapon size. However, empirical evidence is scant. Using size-matched male crayfish pairs, we investigated the effects of food availability and predation threat on fighting behavior on individual and pair level and on hierarchy maintenance in repeated contests. Our study reveals novel evidence, indicating that crayfish are capable of changing their decisions during contests in response to food availability and predation threat, which can alter the hierarchy. For example, dominants reduced their aggressiveness in the presence of predation threat. Overall, hierarchy reversals were more likely in pairs where the difference in fighting ability between contestants was smaller. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Food subsidies have become a widely available and predictable resource in human-modified landscapes for many vertebrate species. Such resources can alter individual foraging behavior of animals, and induce population-wide changes. Yet, little consensus exists about the relative influence of the availabilities of native and human food subsidies to wildlife foraging throughout altered landscapes. We explored this unresolved question by analyzing the effects of landscape factors on American black bear (Ursus americanus) diet across the state of Colorado, USA. We estimated assimilated diet using stable isotope analysis of harvested black bear tissues to determine the contribution of human-derived foods to bear diets throughout Colorado, as well as how increasing reliance on human-derived food subsidies increases the risk of conflict. We found that bears (n = 296) showed strong regional diet variability, but substantial use of human-derived food subsidies in eastern Colorado (&gt; 30% assimilated diet). The age-sex class of the bear and housing density of its harvest location were the most influential predictors of 13C enrichment (a tracer of human food subsidies). Furthermore, foraging on subsidies increased risk of conflict; the odds of being a nuisance bear increased by 60% for each ~ 1‰ increase in δ13C. Our study confirms the efficacy of δ13C as a proxy for human activity, and indicates that while demographic differences play a clear role in the foraging ecology of bears, availability of subsidies coincident with varying levels of human activity appears to be a major driver in predicting black bear diet throughout the western United States. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Vespula germanica is a social wasp that frequently forages on carrion, making several trips between un-depleted resources and the nest. In the present study, we analyze this food relocation behavior, evaluating V. germanica response in situations of successive changes in food location. To this end, we allowed individual wasps to feed five consecutive times from a dish located within an array of landmarks. After each return, the feeder was randomly displaced 60 cm from the previous location, so that when the wasp retuned to the array it encountered a different scenario. We found that on their first return to the new situation, wasps first went to the previously learned location and took some time to find the displaced feeder. Interestingly, during the following returns, wasps discovered the novel food location more rapidly, even though its location randomly changed at each return. Thus, after the first experience of food absence, wasps seem to have learned that food would not necessarily be present at the previous site. Free-flying wasps use past experience of food position change to reduce searching time at previously learned locations. These findings illustrate wasp behavioral plasticity in uncertain foraging contexts. © 2016, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).},

abstract={It has been suggested that food craving-an intense desire to consume a specific food (particularly foods high in sugar and fat)-can lead to obesity. This behavior has also been associated with abuse of other substances, such as drugs. Both drugs and food cause dependence by acting on brain circuitry involved in reward, motivation, and decision-making processes. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can be activated following evocation and is implicated in alterations in food behavior and craving. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive brain stimulation technique capable of modulates brain activity significantly, has emerged as a promising treatment to inhibit craving. This technique is considered safe and inexpensive; however, there is scant research using animal models. Such studies could help elucidate the behavioral and molecular mechanisms of eating disorders, including food craving. The aim of our study was to evaluate palatable food consumption in rats receiving tDCS treatment (anode right/cathode left). Eighteen adult male Wistar rats were randomized by weight and divided into three groups (n = 6/group): control, with no stimulation; sham, receiving daily 30 s tDCS (500 μA) sessions for 8 consecutive days; and tDCS, receiving daily 20 min tDCS (500 μA) sessions for 8 consecutive days. All rats were evaluated for locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior. A palatable food consumption test was performed at baseline and on treatment completion (24 h after the last tDCS session) under fasting and feeding conditions and showed that tDCS decreased food craving, thus corroborating human studies. This result confirms the important role of the prefrontal cortex in food behavior, which can be modulated by noninvasive brain stimulation. © 2016.},

abstract={Epidemiological studies can be used to identify risk factors for livestock welfare concerns but have not been conducted in the cow-calf sector for this purpose. The objectives of this study were to investigate the relationships of 1) herd-level management, facilities, and producer perspectives with cattle health and behavior and stockperson handling and 2) stockperson handling on cattle behavior at the individual cow level. Cow ( = 3,065) health and behavior and stockperson handling during a routine procedure (e.g., pregnancy checks) were observed on 30 California ranches. Management and producer perspectives were evaluated using an interview, and handling facility features were recorded at the chute. After predictors were screened for univariable associations, multivariable models were built for cattle health (i.e., thin body condition, lameness, abrasions, hairless patches, swelling, blind eyes, and dirtiness) and behavior (i.e., balking, vocalizing, stumbling and falling in the chute and while exiting the restraint, and running out of the restraint) and stockperson handling (i.e., electric prod use, moving aid use, tail twisting, and mis-catching cattle). When producers empathized more toward an animal's pain experience, there was a lower risk of swelling (odds ratio [OR] = 0.7) but a higher risk of lameness (OR = 1.3), which may indicate a lack of awareness of the latter. Training stockpersons using the Beef Quality Assurance program had a protective effect on cow cleanliness and mis-catching in the restraint (OR = 0.2 and OR = 0.5, respectively). Hydraulic chutes increased the risk of vocalizations (OR = 2.7), possibly because these systems can apply greater pressure to the sides of the animal than manual restraints. When a moving aid was used to move an individual cow, it increased the risk of her balking, but when hands, in particular, were used, the risk of balking decreased across the herd (OR = 34.1 and OR = 0.3, respectively). Likewise, individual cows were at a greater risk of balking, vocalizing, stumbling and falling in the chute, and stumbling and running at exit when they were touched with an electric prod (OR = 11.0, OR = 3.3, OR = 1.9, OR = 2.3, OR = 1.8, and OR = 1.7, respectively). Although the implications of using moving aids are unclear, reducing the use of electric prods could improve cattle handling. In conclusion, cattle handling was influenced by a number of facility and stockperson factors: personnel training, facility design, and electric prod use are key areas for future improvements.},

abstract={Territorial males may adopt a mating tactic that yields greater reproductive success but that at the same time increases the risk of predation. Plasticity in reproductive behavior can reflect a balance between sexual selection and natural selection. In this study, we sought to verify the effect of predation risk on territorial behavior of males of the solitary bee Ptilothrix fructifera (Apidae). Males of the species employ alternative mating tactics and can be territorial in defense of larval food sources. By manipulating predator models in the field, we tested whether (1) males avoid perch flowers containing predator models; (2) males alternate between mating tactics when their territory is associated with a predation risk; and (3) female foraging on flowers in a territory is altered in the presence of a predator model. We measured the responses of males and females in flowers containing and not containing a model of a spider or a stuffed bird. The results show that territorial males of P. fructifera alter their territorial behavior when faced with a high risk of predation. They do not abandon their territory or change to a non-territorial mating tactic, but instead change the use of their territory, avoiding flowers containing predator models or perching on other flowers when the previous flower presented a potential predation risk. Female P. fructifera decreases the frequency of their visits to flowers and the length of time spent there in the presence of a spider model. In short, in the face of predation risk, females and males alter their behaviors at the cost of less efficient foraging and searching for partners, respectively. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Based on work a quarter century ago, it is widely accepted personality traits like sensation seeking are related to the enjoyment and intake of spicy foods; however, data supporting this belief is actually quite limited. Recently, we reported strong to moderate correlations between remembered spicy food liking and two personality traits measured with validated questionnaires. Here, participants consumed capsaicin-containing strawberry jelly to generate acute estimates of spicy food liking. Additionally, we used a laboratory-based behavioral measure of risk taking (the mobile Balloon Analogue Risk Task; mBART) to complement a range of validated self-report measures of risk-related personality traits. Present data confirm Sensation Seeking correlates with overall spicy meal liking and liking of the burn of a spicy meal, and extends prior findings by showing novel correlations with the liking of sampled stimuli. Other personality measures, including Sensitivity to Punishment (SP), Sensitivity to Reward (SR), and the Impulsivity and Risk Taking subscales of the DSM5 Personality Inventory (PID-5) did not show significant relationships with liking of spicy foods, either sampled or remembered. Our behavioral risk taking measure, the mBART, also failed to show a relationship with remembered or sampled liking. However, significant relationships were observed between reported intake of spicy foods and Sensitivity to Reward, and the Risk Taking subscale of the PID-5 (PID5-RT). Based on the observed patterns among various personality measures, and spicy food liking and intake, we propose that personality measures may exert their influence on intake of spicy food via different mechanisms. We also speculate that Sensation Seeking may reflect motivations for consuming spicy foods that are more intrinsic, while the motivations for eating spicy foods measured by SR and PID5-RT may be more extrinsic. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The ability of animals to find and consume hoarded seeds (i.e. seed recovery) is a key stage within the seed dispersal process. However, the ecology of seed recovery is still poorly understood. Here, we analyze the factors controlling seed recovery by scatter-hoarding rodents in an oak-dominated temperate forest. We examined the relative importance of intrinsic seed traits (i.e. plant-driven) and extrinsic seed factors (i.e. animal-driven) on the probability of seed recovery. We found that seed recovery is mainly driven by extrinsic seed factors, mostly related to animal behavior (pilfering frequency, microsite preference, predation risk, burial depth and cache size). Important intrinsic traits such as seed size, seed quality and seed-drop timing were, on average, of lower significance in the probability of seed recovery (2.8-times less important than extrinsic factors); only seed quality was an important intrinsic trait. On the other hand, larger and nutritionally more valuable seeds showed a removal–recovery tradeoff as they enhance seed removal and hoarding (increasing dispersal quality) but also favour seed recovery (increasing predation). We find that other mechanisms beyond seed traits (e.g. masting) are needed to decrease seed recovery and, thus, increase seed survival. We conclude that, as seed recovery is mostly driven by animal behavioural factors, it substantially differs from other previous stages of the seed dispersal process that are more dependent on seed traits. We argue that seed recovery needs further attention to advance our understanding of the ecology of seed dispersal and the role of secondary dispersers as a selective force for seeds. © 2015 The Authors},

abstract={Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy adversely affects prenatal and postnatal growth and increases the risk of behavioral deficits. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of prenatal exposure to a moderate dose of alcohol on sexual motivation during adulthood. Rats were prenatally exposed to ethanol by feeding pregnant dams a liquid diet containing 25% ethanol-derived calories on days 6 through 19 of gestation. The controls consisted of pair-fed dams (receiving an isocaloric liquid diet containing 0% ethanol-derived calories) and dams with ad libitum access to a liquid control diet. The sexual motivation of offspring was evaluated during adulthood. The results revealed that the male and female pups of dams treated with alcohol exhibited reduced weight gain, which persisted until adulthood. Both male and female adult animals from dams that were exposed to alcohol showed a reduction in the preference score in the sexual motivation test. Taken together, these results provide evidence of the damaging effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on sexual motivation responses in adulthood. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Objective The main objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between various factors (e.g., sociodemographic, child, and parental factors) and the healthfulness of parental responses to child in-store food purchasing requests. Additionally, a secondary objective is to describe “resist strategies” used by parents to respond to child food-purchasing requests and their efficacy in avoiding conflict. Methods Parent–child dyads (children aged 2–6 years) completed an audio-/visual-recoded food shopping trip at their usual grocery store and time. Recordings of trips were coded for behavioral and environmental factors. Parental healthful response rate (i.e., percent of responses that were healthful) was the primary outcome variable. A healthful response occurred when a parent yielded to a healthful child request, or resisted a non-healthful request. Parents also completed a questionnaire. Kruskal–Wallis tests were used to assess the relationship between the main outcome variable and sociodemographic, child, and parent factors. Results Parents (n = 39) responded healthfully to 62.9 % (±26.7 %) of child food purchasing requests. Low- and middle-income parents, and black and white parents, had significantly higher healthful response rates compared to high-income parents (p = 0.03) and Hispanic/Indian-descent parents (p = 0.02), respectively. Using the “ignore” strategy proved an effective resist strategy in this study, leading to no parent–child conflicts. Conclusions Programming that seeks to improve the healthfulness of food purchasing in families with young children should address unhealthful response behaviors in Hispanic/Indian-descent parents and high-income parents; although, the needs of these groups are different. Further research is needed to confirm and expand on these findings. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Male reproductive success is obviously mate limited, which implies that males should rarely be choosy. One extreme case of a reproductive (or mating) cost is sexual cannibalism. Recent research has proposed that male mantids (Parastagmatoptera tessellata) are choosy and not complicit in cannibalism and that they modify behavior towards females based on the risk imposed by them. Since female cannibalism depends on females' energetic state (i.e. hunger) we investigated whether male mantids are capable of using environmental cues that provide information regarding the energetic state of females to make their mate choices. Under laboratory conditions, males were confronted individually with three options: a female eating a prey, a female without a prey, and a male eating a prey (as a control for the presence of prey). Each subject comprising a choice was harnessed and placed in the corners of a triangular experimental arena at an equidistant distance from the focal male. The prey was a middle size cricket that subjects ate in approximately twenty minutes. The behavior of focal males was recorded for six hours. Females were under the same deprivation regime and, in line with previous studies, consuming one cricket did not significantly increase females' abdomen girth. Male mantids significantly preferred females that were eating a prey. In all cases choices were made after the females consumed the whole prey. This suggests that males did not use the prey as a direct way to avoid being cannibalized by keeping the female busy. The preference for females that had recently fed may have evolved because of the potential reduction in sexual cannibalism. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={By exploiting unutilized resources, organisms expand into novel niches, which can lead to adaptive radiation. However, some groups fail to diversify despite the apparent opportunity to do so. Although arising multiple times, arboreal folivores are rare and have not radiated, presumably because of energetic constraints. To explore this hypothesis, we quantified the field metabolic rate (FMR), movement, and body temperature for syntopic two- and three-toed sloths, extreme arboreal folivores that differ in their degree of specialization. Both species expended little energy, but three-toed sloths (162 kJ/ day*kg0.734) possessed the lowest FMR recorded for any mammal. Three-toed sloths were more heterothermic and moved less than twotoed sloths. We then compared FMRs and basal metabolic rates (BMRs) for 19 species of arboreal folivores along a spectrum of specialization. Overall, arboreal folivores had lower BMRs and FMRs than other mammals, and increasing specialization led to lower FMRs but not BMRs. Thus, reduced energetic expenditure in specialized species was the result of thermoregulatory and behavioral strategies, rather than simply a proportionate reduction in BMR. Altogether, our findings support the concept that arboreal folivores are tightly constrained by nutritional energetics and help to explain the lack of radiation among species exploiting a lifestyle in the trees. © 2016 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={Background Preoperative frailty is an important predictor of poor outcomes but the relationship between frailty and geriatric syndromes is less clear. The aims of this study were to describe the prevalence of frailty and incidence of geriatric syndromes in a cohort of older vascular surgical ward patients, and investigate the association of frailty and other key risk factors with the occurrence of one or more geriatric syndromes (delirium, functional decline, falls, and/or pressure ulcers) and two hospital outcomes (acute length of stay and discharge destination). Methods This prospective cohort study was conducted in a vascular surgical ward in a tertiary teaching hospital in Brisbane, Australia. Consecutive patients aged ≥65 years, admitted for ≥72 hr, were eligible for inclusion. Frailty was defined as one or more of functional dependency, cognitive impairment, or nutritional impairment at admission. Delirium was identified using the Confusion Assessment Method and a validated chart extraction tool. Functional decline from admission to discharge was identified from daily nursing documentation of activities of daily living. Falls were identified according to documentation in the medical record cross-checked with the incident reporting system. Pressure ulcers, acute length of stay, and discharge destination were identified by documentation in the medical record. Risk factors associated with geriatric syndromes, acute length of stay, and discharge destination were assessed using multivariable logistic regression models. Results Of 110 participants, 43 (39%) patients were frail and geriatric syndromes occurred in 40 (36%). Functional decline occurred in 25% of participants, followed by delirium (20%), pressure ulcers (12%), and falls (4%). In multivariable logistic analysis, frailty [odds ratio (OR) 6.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0–22.1, P = 0.002], nonelective admission (OR 7.2, 95% CI 2.2–25.3, P = 0.002), higher physiological severity (OR 5.5, 95% CI 1.1–26.8, P = 0.03), and operative severity (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.2–17.7, P = 0.03) increased the likelihood of any geriatric syndrome. Frailty was an important predictor of longer length of stay (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.0–6.8, P = 0.06) and discharge destination (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.2–13.8, P = 0.02). Nonelective admission significantly increased the likelihood of discharge to a higher level of care (OR 5.3, 95% CI 1.3–21.6, P = 0.02). Conclusions Frailty and geriatric syndromes were common in elderly vascular surgical ward patients. Frail patients and nonelective admissions were more likely to develop geriatric syndromes, have a longer length of stay, and be discharged to a higher level of care. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Parasites are ubiquitous in wildlife populations, but physiological and behavioural responses of hosts to infection are difficult to measure. We experimentally treated semi-free-ranging red-capped mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus) in Nigeria with antiparasitic drugs and examined subsequent changes in glucocorticoid production and individual behaviour. Because both parasites and stress impact energy balance and health, we measured (i) behavioural time re-allocation via activity budgets, (ii) social relationships (e.g. social connectivity and dominance hierarchy stability) and (iii) body condition. We collected triplicate faecal samples (n = 441) from 49 individuals prior to and following treatment. Cortisol levels fluctuated in parallel with parasite abundance. Elevations in cortisol, but not parasitism, were related to reduced body condition. Behaviour also shifted according to infection status, with uninfected individuals spending more time foraging and less time resting and vigilant compared with when they were infected. Time spent feeding, travelling or socializing did not differ between pre- and post-treatment time periods. Group cohesion, but not dominance stability, changed following treatment, suggesting parasite-induced social avoidance. Together, these findings show a coordinated response to infection that promotes host tolerance through stress and energy conservation, reduces transmission risk and increases protection when infected hosts are vulnerable. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Generalist pollinators like the buff-tailed bumble bee, Bombus terrestris, encounter both nutrients and toxins in the floral nectar they collect from flowering plants. Only a few studies have described the gustatory responses of bees toward toxins in food, and these experiments have mainly used the proboscis extension response on restrained honey bees. Here, a new behavioral assay is presented for measuring the feeding responses of freely-moving, individual worker bumble bees to nutrients and toxins. This assay measures the amount of solution ingested by each bumble bee and identifies how tastants in food influence the microstructure of the feeding behavior. The solutions are presented in a microcapillary tube to individual bumble bees that have been previously starved for 2-4 hr. The behavior is captured on digital video. The fine structure of the feeding behavior is analyzed by continuously scoring the position of the proboscis (mouthparts) from video recordings using event logging software. The position of the proboscis is defined by three different behavioral categories: (1) proboscis is extended and in contact with the solution, (2) proboscis is extended but not in contact with the solution and (3) proboscis is stowed under the head. Furthermore the speed of the proboscis retracting away from the solution is also estimated. In the present assay the volume of solution consumed, the number of feeding bouts, the duration of the feeding bouts and the speed of the proboscis retraction after the first contact is used to evaluate the phagostimulatory or the deterrent activity of the compounds tested. This new taste assay will allow researchers to measure how compounds found in nectar influence the feeding behavior of bees and will also be useful to pollination biologists, toxicologists and neuroethologists studying the bumble bee’s taste system. © 2016 Journal of Visualized Experiments.},

abstract={The concept that postnatal health and development can be influenced by events that occur in utero originated from epidemiological studies in humans supported by numerous mechanistic (including epigenetic) studies in a variety of model species. Referred to as the 'developmental origins of health and disease' or 'DOHaD' hypothesis, the primary focus of large-animal studies until quite recently had been biomedical. Attention has since turned towards traits of commercial importance in farm animals. Herein we review the evidence that prenatal risk factors, including suboptimal parental nutrition, gestational stress, exposure to environmental chemicals and advanced breeding technologies, can determine traits such as postnatal growth, feed efficiency, milk yield, carcass composition, animal welfare and reproductive potential. We consider the role of epigenetic and cytoplasmic mechanisms of inheritance, and discuss implications for livestock production and future research endeavours. We conclude that although the concept is proven for several traits, issues relating to effect size, and hence commercial importance, remain. Studies have also invariably been conducted under controlled experimental conditions, frequently assessing single risk factors, thereby limiting their translational value for livestock production. We propose concerted international research efforts that consider multiple, concurrent stressors to better represent effects of contemporary animal production systems. © 2016 CSIRO.},

abstract={The ability to taste bitter thiourea compounds, such as phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP), is inherited. Polymorphisms in the bitter-taste receptor TAS2R38 explain the majority of phenotypic variation in the PROP phenotype. It has been hypothesized that the PROP phenotype is a marker for perception of a variety of chemosensory experiences. In this review, we discuss studies that have investigated the relationship between bitter-taste response and dietary behaviors and chronic health in children. Investigators have hypothesized that children who are PROP tasters have lower liking and consumption of bitter foods, such as cruciferous vegetables. Additionally, several studies suggest that children who are unable to taste PROP (i.e., nontasters) like and consume more dietary fat and are prone to obesity. The relationship between the PROP phenotype and obesity is influenced by multiple confounders, including sex, food access, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Future studies that adjust for these variables are needed. Copyright © 2016 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

abstract={There is a growing view that certain foods, particularly those high in refined sugars and fats, are addictive and that some forms of obesity can usefully be treated as a food addiction. This perspective is supported by a growing body of neuroscience research demonstrating that the chronic consumption of energy-dense foods causes changes in the brain's reward pathway that are central to the development and maintenance of drug addiction. Obese and overweight individuals also display patterns of eating behavior that resemble the ways in which addicted individuals consume drugs. We critically review the evidence that some forms of obesity or overeating could be considered a food addiction and argue that the use of food addiction as a diagnostic category is premature. We also examine some of the potential positive and negative clinical, social, and public policy implications of describing obesity as a food addiction that require further investigation.

abstract={The hippocampal dentate gyrus is critically involved in learning and memory. However, methods for imaging the activity of its principal neurons, the dentate gyrus granule cells, are missing. Here we demonstrate chronic two-photon imaging of granule cell population activity in awake mice using a cortical window implant that leaves the hippocampal formation intact and does not lead to obvious alteration of animal behavior. Using virus delivery, we targeted expression of genetically encoded calcium indicators specifically to dentate gyrus granule cells. Calcium imaging of granule cell activity 600-800μm below the hippocampal surface was facilitated by using 1040 nm excitation of the red indicator R-CaMP1.07, but was also achieved using the green indicator GCaMP6s. We found that the rate of calcium transients was increased during wakefulness relative to an extremely low rate during anesthesia; however, activity still remained sparse with, on average, approximately one event per 2-5 min per cell across the granule cell population. Comparing periods of running on a ladder wheel and periods of resting, we furthermore identified state-dependent differences in the active granule cell population, with some cells displaying highest activity level during running and others during resting. Typically, cells did not maintain a clear state preference in their activity pattern across days. Our approach opens new avenues to elucidate granule cell function, plasticity mechanisms, and network computation in the adult dentate gyrus. © 2016 the authors.},

abstract={Sensitivity to variability in resources has been documented in humans, primates, birds, and social insects, but the fit between empirical results and the predictions of risk sensitivity theory (RST), which aims to explain this sensitivity in adaptive terms, is weak [1]. RST predicts that agents should switch between risk proneness and risk aversion depending on state and circumstances, especially according to the richness of the least variable option [2]. Unrealistic assumptions about agents’ information processing mechanisms and poor knowledge of the extent to which variability imposes specific selection in nature are strong candidates to explain the gap between theory and data. RST's rationale also applies to plants, where it has not hitherto been tested. Given the differences between animals’ and plants’ information processing mechanisms, such tests should help unravel the conflicts between theory and data. Measuring root growth allocation by split-root pea plants, we show that they favor variability when mean nutrient levels are low and the opposite when they are high, supporting the most widespread RST prediction. However, the combination of non-linear effects of nitrogen availability at local and systemic levels may explain some of these effects as a consequence of mechanisms not necessarily evolved to cope with variance [3, 4]. This resembles animal examples in which properties of perception and learning cause risk sensitivity even though they are not risk adaptations [5]. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The principle aim of the present study is to synthesis a novel mesoporous silica-based dual drug delivery system (DDDS) with unique features for the delivery of amoxicillin (antibiotic) and thiamine hydrochloride (vitamin). The DDDS was characterized by Fourier transform infrared, X ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force micrographs analyses. The stimuli response behaviour of the drug carrier was studied by conducting swelling experiments as a function of pH and time. Drug release studies were carried out by mimicking gastric and intestinal conditions and found that the release of both drugs attained its maximum in the intestinal condition. The in vitro release data were analysed using Peppas potential equation in order to predict the release mechanism. The release of antibiotic follows non-Fickian mechanism whereas that of vitamin was diffusion controlled. An in vitro cytotoxicity analysis was carried out on L929 cells and the results showed that the synthesized DDDS is safe. DPPH assay and antibacterial activity were also analysed. From the investigation, it is evident that the prepared DDDS has potential application as dual drug carrier. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The prefrontal cortex (PFC) subserves complex cognitive abilities, including risky decision-making; the modulation of this brain area is shown to alter the way people take risks. Yet, neuromodulation of the PFC in relation to risk-taking behavior remains relatively less well-studied. Moreover, the psychological variables that influence such neuromodulation remain poorly understood. To address these issues, 16 participants took part in 3 experimental sessions on separate days. They received: (i) left anodal–right cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS); (ii) left cathodal–right anodal stimulation; or (iii) sham stimulation while they completed two risk-taking tasks. They also measured on several cognitive–affective abilities and personality traits. It was revealed that left cathodal–right anodal stimulation led to significantly reduced risk-taking under a context of haste. The reduction of risk-taking (relative to sham) correlated with state and trait impulsivity, such that the effect was larger in more impulsive individuals. For these individuals, the tDCS effect size was considered to be large (generalized partial η2 &gt;.17). The effect of prefrontal-neuromodulation in reducing risk-taking was influenced by baseline impulsivity, reflecting a state-dependent effect of neuromodulation on the PFC. The results of this study carry important insights into the use of neuromodulation to alter higher cognition. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The migration strategy of many capital breeders is to garner body stores along the flyway at distinct stopover sites. The rate at which they can fuel is likely to be strongly influenced by a range of factors, such as physiology, food availability, time available for foraging and perceived predation. We analysed the foraging behaviour and fuel accumulation of pink-footed geese, an Arctic capital breeder, at their mid-flyway spring stopover site and evaluated to what extent their behaviour and fuelling were related to physiological and external factors and how it differed from other stopovers along the flyway. We found that fuel accumulation rates of geese at the mid-flyway site were limited by habitat availability rather than by digestive constraints. However, as the time available for foraging increased over the stopover season, geese were able to keep constant fuelling rate. Putting this in perspective, geese increased their daily net energy intake along the flyway corresponding to the increase in time available for foraging. The net energy intake per hour of foraging remained the same. Geese showed differences in their reaction to predators/disturbance between the sites, taking higher risks particularly at the final stopover site. Hence, perceived predation along the flyway may force birds to postpone the final fuel accumulation to the last stopover along the flyway. Flexibility in behaviour appears to be an important trait to ensure fitness in this capital breeder. Our findings are based on a new, improved method for estimating fuel accumulation of animals foraging in heterogeneous landscapes based on data obtained from satellite telemetry and habitat specific intake rates. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Phenotypically plastic changes in response to variation in perceived predation risk are widespread, but little is known about if and how social environment modulates induced responses to predation risk. We investigated the influence of perceived predation risk (i.e. chemical cues from a predator) and social environment (i.e. one, two or 20 individuals reared together) on three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) morphology in a factorial common garden experiment. We found that exposure to chemical cues from potential predators did not influence growth or body condition or induce more robust morphological defences (i.e. lateral plate numbers and dorsal spine lengths). However, sticklebacks exposed to predator cues developed longer caudal peduncles and larger eyes as compared with fish from the control treatment. As these responses may improve sticklebacks' ability to avoid piscine predation, they might be adaptive. Social environment/density also influenced expression of some traits, but these effects were independent of predation-risk treatment effects. In general, these results suggest that apart from the classic morphological defence structures, which appear mostly constitutive, three-spined sticklebacks are capable of expressing potentially adaptive morphological responses to chemical cues from potential predators. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract={Biological variability is no longer considered as statistical noise, but rather as an adaptive benefit. This variability comes from consistent differences in behavioral and physiological responses among individuals to a changing/challenging environment, named "coping style", "temperament" or "personality". Many studies have described how to characterize personality traits and how to assess their consistency over time and between different contexts; however, little is known about the environmental factors shaping personality development. Because contrasting personalities are maintained with evolution, this lead to the widespread assumption that genes play a predominant role in personality. In many cases, personality traits are however also likely to be determined by individual experience, which is probably at least as important as genetics in shaping personality. The aim of this study was to assess how environmental variability (herein food predictability) impacts behavioral responses, particularly the shyness-boldness axis, one of the most widely shared animal personality trait. Here, we reared juvenile seabass (95 days old) from two divergent strains selected for feed deprivation tolerance under standard conditions for 40 days. Thereafter, we submitted them to two feeding treatments (Predictable versus Unpredictable) starting at 135 dph and lasting 60 days. Seabass reared under a predictable food supply (PFS) grew faster and were shyer than fish reared under an unpredictable food supply (UFS) (i.e. they took more time to exit the refuge zone of a Z-maze; UFS: 132.47 ± 34.63 s; PFS: 336.79 ± 56.97 s) but their exploration tendency was similar. We also examined the behavioral responses of these fish facing a hypoxic challenge. Hypoxia tolerance results were consistent before and after the two feeding treatments. Our findings show the importance of early environmental experience as a driving force shaping boldness. In addition, we provide further evidence that predictable feeding time should be respected in studies assessing essential functions such as growth and behavior. Although personality traits are partially heritable, this study demonstrates the important influence of environmental conditions and life history on behavior. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Manganese (Mn) is an essential element but neurotoxic at higher exposures, however, Mn exposure seldom occurs in isolation. It often co-occurs in populations with inadequate dietary iron (Fe) and limited resources that result in stress. Subclinical FeD affects up to 15% of U.S. children and exacerbates Mn toxicity by increasing Mn bioavailability. Therefore, we investigated Mn overexposure (MnOE) in rats in combination with Fe deficiency (FeD) and developmental stress, for which we used barren cage rearing. For barren cage rearing (BAR), rats were housed in cages with a wire grid floor or standard bedding material (STD) from embryonic day (E)7 through postnatal day (P)28. For FeD, dams were fed a 90% Fe-deficient NIH-07 diet from E15 through P28. Within each litter, different offspring were treated with 100 mg/kg Mn (MnOE) or vehicle (VEH) by gavage every other day from P4-28. Behavior was assessed at two ages and consisted of: open-field, anxiety tests, acoustic startle response (ASR) with prepulse inhibition (PPI), sociability, sucrose preference, tapered beam crossing, and the Porsolt's forced swim test. MnOE had main effects of decreasing activity, ASR, social preference, and social novelty. BAR and FeD transiently modified MnOE effects. BAR groups weighed less and showed decreased anxiety in the elevated zero maze, had increased ASR and decreased PPI, and exhibited reduced sucrose preference compared with the STD groups. FeD animals also weighed less and had increased slips on the tapered beam. Most of the monoamine effects were dopaminergic and occurred in the MnOE groups. The results showed that Mn is a pervasive developmental neurotoxin, the effects of which are modulated by FeD and/or BAR cage rearing. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Dietary protein deficiency influences the behavioural phenotypes of mammals. We studied whether protein deficiency during gestation and/or post-weaning heightened anxiety, reduced memory recall and influenced competitive ability in the African striped mouse Rhabdomys dilectus chakae. Mice were subjected to five protein diet treatments, which they received continuously, or were raised on one diet to weaning and switched to an alternate diet post-weaning (Day 16): 1) HP-HP: high protein (24%); first letter pair indicates maternal diet and the second pair indicates offspring diet post-weaning; 2) BP-BP: baseline protein (19%); 3) LP-LP: low protein (10%); 4) HP-LP: switched from high to low protein diet; and 5) LP-HP: switched from low protein to high protein diet. From Day 70, when mice were sexually mature, 20 individuals (10 males, 10 females) per treatment were subjected to three successive experiments, in which we tested their anxiety responses in: 1) an open field arena (time spent in the centre of the open field); 2) novel object recognition (time spent exploring a novel object); and 3) social interactions (excluding BP-BP) in age-matched same-sex dyadic encounters (aggressive, amicable and avoidance behaviours). LP-LP and LP-HP treatment mice spent the least amount of time in the centre of the open field, did not demonstrate object preference compared to the other treatments, and were the most aggressive in dyadic encounters. Our study shows that the systemic effects of protein-deficient diets during early life shapes the behavioural phenotype in R. d. chakae, possibly through early organisation of neuro-biological pathways or competition among littermates. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The benefits of behavioral flexibility in social insect societies are well known, but the advantages of limited flexibility have seldom been considered. Florida harvester ant colonies maintain a stable forager population size for much of their active season, and despite seasonal variation in chronological age, foragers die within 27 days of initiating foraging. To determine how colonies balance forager mortality and forager replacement, we tested the relative influences of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on forager membership, retention, and longevity. Potential and realized forager longevity differed significantly. Residual lifespan increased by 57 % when colonies were penned for 20 days, and up to 8-fold when foragers were retained in the laboratory. Increased forager longevity inhibited the movement of new workers into the forager population. In contrast, increased mortality and starvation did not stimulate the addition of new foragers and forager population size declined when mortality exceeded 4 % per day. Experimental increases in forager number, body fat, and the ratio of larvae to foragers did not induce behavioral reversion in existing foragers. These results suggest an unidirectional allocation strategy, with foragers that are less disposable and less behaviorally flexible than the well-studied honey bee. In P. badius, forager membership is maintained not by young ants detecting increased demand, but by workers developing at rates that allow forager replacement and prevent excessive worker depletion. In the absence of a lifespan matched to predictable risks, opportunistic increases in forager survival may promote colony growth by inhibiting the scheduled and irreversible transitions of younger workers. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In group-living mammals, social dominance can be achieved and maintained via kin support, winner-loser effects and individual differences in resource-holding potential (RHP). When dominance is based on RHP, the likelihood of winning is also influenced by the incentive to compete. For females, this equation can be quite complex, as both age and reproductive state can alter the relative value of resources and the risks associated with fighting. For example, females that are young, pregnant or lactating may have high nutritional demands, while lactating females also face risks associated with offspring survival. To date, however, there have been few studies investigating how such factors influence female agonistic relationships. Here, we use 2 years of data to evaluate how age and reproductive state influence the probability of winning, focusing on two groups (5-9 and 10-12 females) of wild Phayre's leaf monkeys, Trachypithecus phayrei crepusculus, at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand. Consistent with previous studies, we found that young females and pregnant females were more likely to win dyadic interactions in the smaller group, PA. By contrast, the likelihood of winning was unrelated to age in the larger group, PB. Moreover, differences between reproductive states were less pronounced in PB, with females that were pregnant or in early lactation being more likely to win compared to females that were cycling. The deviating results for PB were likely associated with a greater number of competitors and small age differences intensifying intrasexual competition. These results highlight the importance of individual as well as demographic factors in female dominance relationships. In this population, females with high nutritional demands are more likely to win agonistic encounters, suggesting that female-female competition occurs primarily over access to resources. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Prolonged consumption of ketogenic diets (KD) has reported neuroprotective benefits. Several studies suggest KD interventions could be useful in the management of neurological and developmental disorders. Alterations in the Engrailed (En) genes, specifically Engrailed 2 (En2), have neurodevelopmental consequences and produce autism-related behaviors. The following studies used En2 knockout (KO; En2-/-), and wild-type (WT; En2+/+), male mice fed either KD (80% fat, 0.1% carbohydrates) or control diet (CD; 10% fat, 70% carbohydrates). The objective was to determine whether a KD fed from weaning at postnatal day (PND) 21 to adulthood (PND 60) would alter brain monoamines concentrations, previously found dysregulated, and improve social outcomes. In WT animals, there was an increase in hypothalamic norepinephrine content in the KD-fed group. However, regional monoamines were not altered in KO mice in KD-fed compared with CD-fed group. In order to determine the effects of juvenile exposure to KD in mice with normal blood ketone levels, separate experiments were conducted in mice removed from the KD or CD and fed standard chow for 2 days (PND 62). In a three-chamber social test with a novel mouse, KO mice previously exposed to the KD displayed similar social and self-grooming behaviors compared with the WT group. Groups previously exposed to a KD, regardless of genotype, had more c-Fos-positive cells in the cingulate cortex, lateral septal nuclei, and anterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In the novel object condition, KO mice previously exposed to KD had similar behavioral responses and pattern of c-Fos immunoreactivity compared with the WT group. Thus, juvenile exposure to KD resulted in short-term consequences of improving social interactions and appropriate exploratory behaviors in a mouse model that displays autism-related behaviors. Such findings further our understanding of metabolic-based therapies for neurological and developmental disorders. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Selection may favour individuals of the same population to differ consistently in nutritional preference, for example, because optimal diets covary with morphology or personality. We provided Southern field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) with two synthetic food sources (carbohydrates and proteins) and quantified repeatedly how much of each macronutrient was consumed by each individual. We then quantified (i) whether individuals were repeatable in carbohydrate and protein intake rate, (ii) whether an individual's average daily intake of carbohydrates was correlated with its average daily intake of protein, and (iii) whether short-term changes in intake of carbohydrates coincided with changes in intake of protein within individuals. Intake rates were individually repeatable for both macronutrients. However, individuals differed in their relative daily intake of carbohydrates versus proteins (i.e., â € nutritional preference'). By contrast, total consumption varied plastically as a function of body weight within individuals. Body weight-but not personality (i.e., aggression, exploration behaviour)-positively predicted nutritional preference at the individual level as large crickets repeatedly consumed a higher carbohydrate to protein ratio compared to small ones. Our finding of level-specific associations between the consumption of distinct nutritional components demonstrates the merit of applying multivariate and multi-level viewpoints to the study of nutritional preference.},

abstract={Dopamine D2/3 receptor signaling is critical for flexible adaptive behavior; however, it is unclear whether D2, D3, or both receptor subtypes modulate precise signals of feedback and reward history that underlie optimal decision making. Here, PET with the radioligand [11C]-(+)-PHNO was used to quantify individual differences in putative D3 receptor availability in rodents trained on a novel threechoice spatial acquisition and reversal-learning task with probabilistic reinforcement. Binding of [11C]-(+)-PHNO in the midbrain was negatively related to the ability of rats to adapt to changes in rewarded locations, but not to the initial learning. Computational modeling of choice behavior in the reversal phase indicated that [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding in the midbrain was related to the learning rate and sensitivity to positive, but not negative, feedback. Administration of a D3-preferring agonist likewise impaired reversal performance by reducing the learning rate and sensitivity to positive feedback. These results demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for D3 receptors in select aspects of reinforcement learning and suggest that individual variation in midbrain D3 receptors influences flexible behavior. Our combined neuroimaging, behavioral, pharmacological, and computational approach implicates the dopamine D3 receptor in decision-making processes that are altered in psychiatric disorders. © 2016 the authors.},

abstract={Background: The optimal allocation of resources to sexual signals and other life history traits is usually dependent on an individual's condition, while variation in the expression of sexual traits across environments depends on the combined effects of local adaptation, mean condition, and phenotypic responses to environment-specific cues that affect resource allocation. A clear contrast can often be drawn between natural habitats and novel habitats, such as forest plantations and urban areas. In some species, males seem to change their sexual signals in these novel environments, but why this occurs and how it affects signal reliability is still poorly understood. Results: The relative size of sexual traits and level of immune responses were significantly lower for male palmate newts Lissotriton helveticus caught in pine and eucalyptus plantations compared to those caught in native forests, but there was no habitat-dependent difference in body condition (n = 18 sites, 382 males). The reliability with which sexual traits signalled body condition and immune responses was the same in all three habitats. Finally, we conducted a mesocosm experiment in which males were maintained in pine, eucalypt or oak infused water for 21 days. Males in plantation-like water (pine or eucalypt) showed significantly lower immune responses but no change in body condition. This matches the pattern seen for field-caught males. Unlike field-caught males, however, there was no relationship between water type and relative sexual trait size. Conclusions: Pine and eucalyptus plantations are likely to be detrimental to male palmate newt because they are associated with reduced immune function and smaller sexual traits. This could be because ecological aspects of these novel habitats, such as high water turbidity or changes in male-male competition, drive selection for reduced investment into sexual traits. However, it is more probable that there are differences in the ease of acquisition, hence optimal allocation, of resources among habitats. Our mesocosm experiment also provides some evidence that water toxicity is a causal factor. Our findings offer insights into how plantations affect amphibian life histories, and how novel habitats might generate long-term selection for new resource allocation strategies in native species. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Maternal obesity during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in offspring. Here, we report that maternal high-fat diet (MHFD) induces a shift in microbial ecology that negatively impacts offspring social behavior. Social deficits and gut microbiota dysbiosis in MHFD offspring are prevented by co-housing with offspring of mothers on a regular diet (MRD) and transferable to germ-free mice. In addition, social interaction induces synaptic potentiation (LTP) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of MRD, but not MHFD offspring. Moreover, MHFD offspring had fewer oxytocin immunoreactive neurons in the hypothalamus. Using metagenomics and precision microbiota reconstitution, we identified a single commensal strain that corrects oxytocin levels, LTP, and social deficits in MHFD offspring. Our findings causally link maternal diet, gut microbial imbalance, VTA plasticity, and behavior and suggest that probiotic treatment may relieve specific behavioral abnormalities associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In eusocial insects, experiences acquired during the development have long-term consequences on mature behavior. In the honeybee that suffers profound changes associated with metamorphosis, the effect of odor experiences at larval instars on the subsequent physiological and behavioral response is still unclear. To address the impact of preimaginal experiences on the adult honeybee, colonies containing larvae were fed scented food. The effect of the preimaginal experiences with the food odor was assessed in learning performance, memory retention and generalization in 3–5- and 17–19 day-old bees, in the regulation of their expression of synaptic-related genes and in the perception and morphology of their antennae. Three-five day old bees that experienced 1-hexanol (1-HEX) as food scent responded more to the presentation of the odor during the 1-HEX conditioning than control bees (i.e., bees reared in colonies fed unscented food). Higher levels of proboscis extension response (PER) to 1-HEX in this group also extended to HEXA, the most perceptually similar odor to the experienced one that we tested. These results were not observed for the group tested at older ages. In the brain of young adults, larval experiences triggered similar levels of neurexins (NRXs) and neuroligins (Nlgs) expression, two proteins that have been involved in synaptic formation after associative learning. At the sensory periphery, the experience did not alter the number of the olfactory sensilla placoidea, but did reduce the electrical response of the antennae to the experienced and novel odor. Our study provides a new insight into the effects of preimaginal experiences in the honeybee and the mechanisms underlying olfactory plasticity at larval stage of holometabolous insects. © 2016 Ramírez, Fagundez, Grosso, Argibay, Arenas and Farina.},

abstract={Vigilance can be targeted at predators or competitors, but there has been little work on the factors that affect vigilance aimed at competitors, which is known as social vigilance, and how it should be structured to detect and avoid conspecific threats. Social vigilance might be expected to play an important role in foraging groups with frequent conflicts over resources. I examined social vigilance in skimming semipalmated sandpipers, Calidris pusilla, which exploit minute prey at the surface of the substrate using a head-down position that leaves them vulnerable to aggressive displacement by neighbours. Attacks over resources occurred frequently in skimming sandpipers. In these groups, vigilance increased when neighbours were closer, suggesting that close neighbours posed a threat and that vigilance has a non-negligible social component in skimming groups. The negative exponential distribution best fitted the empirical distribution of intervals between successive vigilance bouts during skimming. This type of distribution implies that a bout of vigilance is initiated at the same rate regardless of the time spent head down in the current skimming bout, a feature that would prevent would-be attackers from targeting sandpipers at times of predictable vulnerability. This study shows that the occurrence of threats from within the group can promote randomness in the temporal organization of vigilance. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Prey mortality depends on the likelihood of encountering a predator and of being killed following such an encounter. While the proactive responses of large herbivores to the risk of predation have been well documented, the reactive responses of prey following encounters have been less well studied and restricted mostly to northern temperate ecosystems. We postulated that the reactive response should depend on the habitat selection of the prey species as well as the hunting tactic (cursorial versus stalking) of the predator. We investigated the reactive responses of a selective grazer, the blue wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, and a generalist grazer, the plains zebra, Equus quagga, to encounters with lions, Panthera leo, their main predator, in Kruger National Park. We used simultaneous global positioning system (GPS) locations of prey and predators to identify encounters and assess their frequency and characteristics (e.g. time of day). We compared both the immediate response (stay or flee) and subsequent movement (remain in the habitat patch or relocate) of the two ungulate species following encounters with lions. Despite being more predictably located in open short grass areas, wildebeest encountered lions no more frequently than zebra. However, being more selective for these particular habitat types, wildebeest more often stayed near the encounter site than zebra. Specifically, wildebeest were less likely to leave when located in more open areas with short grass providing both high-quality food and little concealment for stalking lions. We suggest that this is because wildebeest incur higher risks and greater feeding costs than zebra should they relocate, owing to their narrower preference for areas of short grass. Our findings show how the adaptive responses of wildebeest and zebra following encounters with their major predator depend on their habitat requirements. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Numerous studies have examined how predator diets influence prey responses to predation risk, but the role predator diet plays in modulating prey responses remains equivocal. We reviewed 405 predator–prey studies in 109 published articles that investigated changes in prey responses when predators consumed different prey items. In 54 % of reviewed studies, prey responses were influenced by predator diet. The value of responding based on a predator’s recent diet increased when predators specialized more strongly on particular prey species, which may create patterns in diet cue use among prey depending upon whether they are preyed upon by generalist or specialist predators. Further, prey can alleviate costs or accrue greater benefits using diet cues as secondary sources of information to fine tune responses to predators and to learn novel risk cues from exotic predators or alarm cues from sympatric prey species. However, the ability to draw broad conclusions regarding use of predator diet cues by prey was limited by a lack of research identifying molecular structures of the chemicals that mediate these interactions. Conclusions are also limited by a narrow research focus. Seventy percent of reviewed studies were performed in freshwater systems, with a limited range of model predator–prey systems, and 98 % of reviewed studies were performed in laboratory settings. Besides identifying the molecules prey use to detect predators, future studies should strive to manipulate different aspects of prey responses to predator diet across a broader range of predator–prey species, particularly in marine and terrestrial systems, and to expand studies into the field. © 2016, Springer International Publishing.},

abstract={Invasive species are considered a main driver of pollinator declines, yet the direct effects of invasive alien plants on pollinators are poorly understood. Abundant, invasive plant species can provide a copious nectar resource for native pollinators. However, the nectar of some plants contains secondary compounds, usually associated with defence against herbivores. The impacts of these compounds on pollinators are often unknown. We compared how consumption of grayanotoxin I and III, natural secondary compounds in the nectar of invasive Rhododendron ponticum L., affected three native bee species: a honeybee, (Apis mellifera L.), a solitary mining bee (Andrena carantonica, Pérez) and a bumblebee, (Bombus terrestris, L.). Survival of the solitary bee and the bumblebee species was not affected by either grayanotoxin, but honeybees were ∼20× more likely to die when fed solutions containing grayanotoxin I. Furthermore, solitary bees were deterred from feeding and exhibited malaise behaviours indicative of sublethal toxicity in response to consumption of grayanotoxin I. In contrast, grayanotoxins did not affect bumblebee survival or behaviour, even when bees were subjected to multiple stressors (parasite infection or food stress). Our experiments suggest that while R. ponticum provides abundant floral nectar, it is only available as a food resource to pollinators that tolerate grayanotoxins. Pollinators whose health is negatively affected by grayanotoxins may experience negative impacts from R. ponticum invasion directly (if they consume R. ponticum nectar) or indirectly (if native floral resources are replaced by R. ponticum). Our study makes a novel comparison of the effects of a natural nectar secondary compound on three pollinator species and clearly demonstrates drastic variation in the responses of different key pollinator taxa to a nectar toxin. Our findings are thus in congruence with literature demonstrating the varying effects of invasive plant chemistry on native foliar herbivores, and our work demonstrates that nectar chemistry should be taken into account when determining the impacts of plant invasion for native pollinators. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract={Objective: This mixed methods study sought to understand who makes decisions about whether preschool-aged Mexican American children engage in eating, outdoor play, sleep, and screen time behaviors. Methods: Forty Mexican American mothers of children ages 3-4 participated in two interviews, during which both closed- and open-ended questions elicited perceptions of who made decisions for the four behaviors, as well as who was present, mealtime rules, and food choice values. Interviews were transcribed, coded for emergent themes, and compared across participants. Results: Participants generally perceived themselves to be primary decision makers for all four behaviors; however, food decisions often seemed to be made collaboratively with the child. Fathers were most likely to participate in evening television decisions. Other family members were rarely mentioned. Selecting foods that children liked was a strong food choice value, while cost was rarely mentioned. Participants appeared to have low perceived control over their child's behaviors relative to their perceived roles in decision making. Conclusions: Mothers may be the primary audience for obesity prevention messages for preschool-aged, Mexican American children; however, health promotion programs may need to increase mothers' awareness of their control over children's behaviors. Understanding how children's behaviors are regulated is an important aspect of obesity prevention for low-income, Mexican American children. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={High concentrations of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), a chemical compound released by lysed phytoplankton, may indicate high rates of grazing by zooplankton and may thus be a foraging cue for planktivorous fishes. Previous studies have shown that some planktivorous fishes and birds aggregate or alter locomotory behavior in response to this chemical cue, which is likely adaptive because it helps them locate prey. These behavioral responses have been demonstrated in juveniles and adults, but no studies have tested for effects on larval fish. Larvae suffer from high mortality rates and are vulnerable to starvation. While larvae are generally thought to be visual predators, they actually have poor vision and cryptic prey. Thus, larval fish should benefit from a chemical cue that provides information on prey abundance. We reared larval sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria, for one week and supplemented feedings with varying concentrations of DMSP to test the hypothesis that DMSP affects larval survival. Ecologically relevant DMSP concentrations increased larval survival by up to 70 %, which has implications for production in aquaculture and recruitment in nature. These results provide a new tool for increasing larval production in aquaculture and also suggest that larvae may use DMSP as an olfactory cue. The release of DMSP may be a previously unappreciated mechanism through which phytoplankton affect larval survival and recruitment. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={The mechanisms underlying responses of stream invertebrates to low flows are poorly understood. To clarify the strategies used to tolerate and survive low flow periods, we tested associations between patch-scale invertebrate densities and velocity within riffle habitats during moderate and low flows. We focused on filter-feeding and respiration traits because they have a mechanistic link to invertebrate low flow responses. 228 samples were collected from 3 riffles at 2 low and 2 moderate flow periods. Maximum densities of filter-feeders were positively associated with the highest velocities during low flows, but not moderate flows, partly consistent with our prediction that they would be structured along velocity gradients to meet nutritional requirements. Gill-respiring invertebrate densities were inversely related to velocity during both flows, probably attributable to organic matter accumulated in low velocity areas. O2 requirements during low flows did not constrain tegument-respirers to higher velocity patches, inconsistent with perceived views of their response to low flows. We found high velocity areas could act as refuges for some invertebrates during low flows, while low velocity patches, which are vulnerable to rapid flow recession, are important habitats for other invertebrates. Environmental flow management should focus on strategies that preserve these habitats during low flows. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Chelating agents, such as small peptides, can decrease free iron content and increase iron bioavailability. They may have promising therapeutic potential and may prevent the pro-oxidant effects of low molecular weight iron. Hairtail is a species of fish that is rich in easily digestible proteins. We extended this strategy for iron delivery by using an enzymatic hydrolysate of hairtail as the chelating agent and found that the ferrous-chelating hairtail peptides have anti-anaemic activity in Sprague-Dawley rats with anaemia. RESULTS: The anti-anaemic activity of ferrous-chelating hairtail peptides prepared by enzymatic hydrolysis of the hairtail and ferrous chelation was studied in rat models of iron deficiency anaemia. After the end of the 35 d experiment, we noted significant differences in haemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, haemoglobin distribution width, and ferritin concentrations between those animals supplemented with ferrous-chelating hairtail peptides and FeSO4 and healthy animals. There were no negative side effects on the animals' growth or behaviour. There was no obvious inflammation in the intestinal mucosa lamina propria and no unbalance of intestinal flora. CONCLUSION: The novel ferrous-chelating hairtail peptides may be a suitable fortificant for improving iron-deficiency status. Our findings demonstrated that this multi-tracer technique has many applications in nutritional research. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.},

abstract={Objectives: This study investigated the prevalence of suicidal ideation and behaviour in a representative sample of South Koreans with or without tinnitus. Design: A cross-sectional study. Setting: Based on data from the 2010 to 2012 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). Participants: The study included 17 446 Korean individuals. Main outcome measures: Participants provided demographic, socio-economic and behavioural information, as well as responses to questionnaires assessing the presence and severity of tinnitus, mental health status regarding stress, depression, and suicidal ideation and attempts. In the univariate analysis, the Rao-Scott chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were used to test the association between tinnitus and risk factors. Simple and multiple linear regression analyses were used to examine the association between tinnitus and mental status. Results: A total of 20.9% and 1.2% of participants with tinnitus, and 12.2% and 0.6% of those without, reported suicidal ideation and attempts, respectively (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.001). Participants reporting suicide attempts showed a higher proportion of severe annoying (6.0%) and irritating (11.8%) tinnitus than those with suicidal ideation (1.4% and 10.2%, respectively). Risks for experiencing tinnitus were significantly associated with suicidal ideation and attempts after adjusting for confounding variables.

abstract={Objectives: Cardiovascular and metabolic traits (CMT) are influenced by complex interactive processes including diet, lifestyle, and genetic predisposition. The present study investigated the interactions of these risk factors in relation to CMTs in the Turkish population. Methods: We applied bootstrap agglomerative hierarchical clustering and Bayesian network learning algorithms to identify the causative relationships among genes involved in different biological mechanisms (i.e., lipid metabolism, hormone metabolism, cellular detoxification, aging, and energy metabolism), lifestyle (i.e., physical activity, smoking behavior, and metropolitan residency), anthropometric traits (i.e., body mass index, body fat ratio, and waist-to-hip ratio), and dietary habits (i.e., daily intakes of macro- and micronutrients) in relation to CMTs (i.e., health conditions and blood parameters). Results: We identified significant correlations between dietary habits (soybean and vitamin B12 intakes) and different cardiometabolic diseases that were confirmed by the Bayesian network-learning algorithm. Genetic factors contributed to these disease risks also through the pleiotropy of some genetic variants (i.e., F5 rs6025 and MTR rs180508). However, we also observed that certain genetic associations are indirect since they are due to the causative relationships among the CMTs (e.g., APOC3 rs5128 is associated with low-density lipoproteins cholesterol and, by extension, total cholesterol). Conclusions: Our study applied a novel approach to integrate various sources of information and dissect the complex interactive processes related to CMTs. Our data indicated that complex causative networks are present: causative relationships exist among CMTs and are affected by genetic factors (with pleiotropic and non-pleiotropic effects) and dietary habits. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The study aimed at evaluating the psychometric properties of the German version of the Self- Harm Inventory (SHI) and examining the lifetime prevalence and correlates of selfharm in a representative German population sample (N = 2,507; age mean = 48.79, SD = 18.11; range 14 to 94 years; 55.5% women) using the SHI. All participants answered the German SHI, the short form of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-15), the ultra-brief Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4), and provided sociodemographic information. The one-factorial structure of the SHI was replicated using a confirmatory factor analysis. Internal consistency coefficients were sufficient and in line with previous studies. Almost half of the sample (49%) acknowledged at least one self-harming behavior over the life-span, most frequently indirect forms of self-harm. The rate of participants who engaged in at least one SHI behavior was higher among men than women (51.6% vs. 46.9%, respectively, ?2 = 5.38, p = 0.020). Higher SHI scores were related to younger age, male gender, living alone, more symptoms of anxiety and depression (PHQ-4), higher impulsivity scores (BIS-15), and suffering from obesity grade 2. Women engaged more often in discreet forms of self-harm than men, e.g., preventing wounds from healing, exercising an injury, starving, and abusing laxatives. In terms of other indirect self-harming behaviors, men admitted more often driving recklessly, being promiscuous and losing a job on purpose, while women reported more frequently engaging in emotionally abusive relationships. With respect to direct self-harm, women were more likely to endorse suicide attempts and cutting, while men admitted more often head-banging. The findings suggest that self-harm constitutes a common problem. Future longitudinal studies are required to examine the natural course, sociodemographic and psychopathological risk factors, as well as possible time-trends of self-harming behaviors in more depth. © 2016 Müller et al.

abstract={Analysing population genomic data from killer whale ecotypes, which we estimate have globally radiated within less than 250,000 years, we show that genetic structuring including the segregation of potentially functional alleles is associated with socially inherited ecological niche. Reconstruction of ancestral demographic history revealed bottlenecks during founder events, likely promoting ecological divergence and genetic drift resulting in a wide range of genome-wide differentiation between pairs of allopatric and sympatric ecotypes. Functional enrichment analyses provided evidence for regional genomic divergence associated with habitat, dietary preferences and post-zygotic reproductive isolation. Our findings are consistent with expansion of small founder groups into novel niches by an initial plastic behavioural response, perpetuated by social learning imposing an altered natural selection regime. The study constitutes an important step towards an understanding of the complex interaction between demographic history, culture, ecological adaptation and evolution at the genomic level.},

abstract={Background: Because some adverse health effects associated with chronic arsenic exposure may be mediated by methylated arsenicals, interindividual variation in capacity to convert inorganic arsenic into mono- and di-methylated metabolites may be an important determinant of risk associated with exposure to this metalloid. Hence, identifying biological and behavioral factors that modify an individual's capacity to methylate inorganic arsenic could provide insights into critical dose-response relations underlying adverse health effects. Methods: A total of 904 older adults (≥45 years old) in Churchill County, Nevada, who chronically used home tap water supplies containing up to 1850 μg of arsenic per liter provided urine and toenail samples for determination of total and speciated arsenic levels. Effects of biological factors (gender, age, body mass index) and behavioral factors (smoking, recent fish or shellfish consumption) on patterns of arsenicals in urine were evaluated with bivariate analyses and multivariate regression models. Results: Relative contributions of inorganic, mono-, and di-methylated arsenic to total speciated arsenic in urine were unchanged over the range of concentrations of arsenic in home tap water supplies used by study participants. Gender predicted both absolute and relative amounts of arsenicals in urine. Age predicted levels of inorganic arsenic in urine and body mass index predicted relative levels of mono- and di-methylated arsenic in urine. Smoking predicted both absolute and relative levels of arsenicals in urine. Multivariate regression models were developed for both absolute and relative levels of arsenicals in urine. Concentration of arsenic in home tap water and estimated water consumption were strongly predictive of levels of arsenicals in urine as were smoking, body mass index, and gender. Relative contributions of arsenicals to urinary arsenic were not consistently predicted by concentrations of arsenic in drinking water supplies but were more consistently predicted by gender, body mass index, age, and smoking. Conclusions: These findings suggest that analyses of dose-response relations in arsenic-exposed populations should account for biological and behavioral factors that modify levels of inorganic and methylated arsenicals in urine. Evidence of significant effects of these factors on arsenic metabolism may also support mode of action studies in appropriate experimental models. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={The recruitment of modular developmental genetic components into new developmental contexts has been proposed as a central mechanism enabling the origin of novel traits and trait functions without necessitating the origin of novel pathways. Here, we investigate the function of the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, a highly conserved pathway best understood for its role in patterning anterior/posterior (A/P) polarity of diverse traits, in the developmental evolution of beetle horns, an evolutionary novelty, and horn polyphenisms, a highly derived form of environment-responsive trait induction. We show that interactions among pathway members are conserved during development of Onthophagus horned beetles and have retained the ability to regulate A/P polarity in traditional appendages, such as legs. At the same time, the Hh signaling pathway has acquired a novel and highly unusual role in the nutrition-dependent regulation of horn polyphenisms by actively suppressing horn formation in low-nutrition males. Down-regulation of Hh signaling lifts this inhibition and returns a highly derived sigmoid horn body size allometry to its presumed ancestral, linear state. Our results suggest that recruitment of the Hh signaling pathway may have been a key step in the evolution of trait thresholds, such as those involved in horn polyphenisms and the corresponding origin of alternative phenotypes and complex allometries.},

abstract={Background: Appropriate vertical movement is critical for the survival of flying animals. Although negative geotaxis (moving away from Earth) driven by gravity has been extensively studied, much less is understood concerning a static regulatory mechanism for inducing positive geotaxis (moving toward Earth). Results: Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism, we showed that geomagnetic field (GMF) induces positive geotaxis and antagonizes negative gravitaxis. Remarkably, GMF acts as a sensory cue for an appetite-driven associative learning behavior through the GMF-induced positive geotaxis. This GMF-induced positive geotaxis requires the three geotaxis genes, such as cry, pyx and pdf, and the corresponding neurons residing in Johnston's organ of the fly's antennae. Conclusions: These findings provide a novel concept with the neurogenetic basis on the regulation of vertical movement by GMF in the flying animals. © 2016 Bae et al.},

A structural equation model was then employed to formulate the relationship between individual's behavioral intention of using public bicycle and its influencing factors. A set of questionnaires was designed and 202 citizens in Wuhan were interviewed in order to collect the required data for empirical study purpose. The study results indicate that the behavioral intention of using public bicycle is influenced not only by the satisfaction towards biking environments and the perceived degree of security and risks, the attitude towards public bicycle and social personality also plays an important role. For inspiring an individual's willingness to using public bicycle, improving the quality of biking environments is a short cut for encouraging people to using public bicycle. The long-term approach for promoting green transportation is to nourish the right attitude toward public bicycle, and thus promote the development of public transportation system. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Animals use the sense of vision to scan their environment, respond to threats, and locate food sources. The neural computations underlying the selection of a particular behavior, such as escape or approach, require flexibility to balance potential costs and benefits for survival. For example, avoiding novel visual objects reduces predation risk but negatively affects foraging success. Zebrafish larvae approach small, moving objects ("prey") and avoid large, looming objects ("predators"). We found that this binary classification of objects by size is strongly influenced by feeding state. Hunger shifts behavioral decisions from avoidance to approach and recruits additional prey-responsive neurons in the tectum, the main visual processing center. Both behavior and tectal function are modulated by signals from the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis and the serotonergic system. Our study has revealed a neuroendocrine mechanism that modulates the perception of food and the willingness to take risks in foraging decisions. Filosa et al. show that hunger enhances the decision by larval zebrafish to approach (versus avoid) moving visual objects and the processing of prey cues in the tectum through signals from the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis and serotonergic system. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Soft sediments in coastal shallow waters constitute nursery habitats for juveniles of several flatfishes. The quality of a nursery is defined by its capacity to optimize the growth and the survival of juvenile fish. The influence of biotic factors, such as food availability, is poorly studied at the scale of a nursery ground. Whether food availability limits juvenile survival is still uncertain. A spatial approach is used to understand the influence of food availability on the distribution of juvenile fish of various benthic and demersal species in the Bay of Vilaine (France), a productive nursery ground. We quantified the spatial overlap between benthic macro-invertebrates and their predators (juvenile fish) to assess if the latter were spatially covering the most productive areas of the Bay. Three scenarios describing the shapes of the predator–prey spatial relationship were tested to quantify the strength of the relationship and consequently the importance of food availability in determining fish distribution. Our results underline that both food availability and fish densities vary greatly over the nursery ground. When considering small organisational levels (e.g., a single fish species), the predator–prey spatial relationship was not clear, likely because of additional environmental effects not identified here; but at larger organisational level (the whole juvenile fish community), a strong overlap between the fish predators and their prey was identified. The evidence that fish concentrate in sectors with high food availability suggests that either food is the limiting factor in that nursery or/and fish display behavioural responses by optimising their energetic expenditures associated with foraging. Further investigations are needed to test the two hypotheses and to assess the impact of benthic and demersal juvenile fish in the food web of coastal nurseries. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={There is increasing evidence that animal personalities are linked to different life history strategies. However, studies examining whether these effects differ under varying environmental conditions are rare. Here, we investigated how animal personality affects reproductive success in a pulsed resource consumer, the wild boar. We determined the exploratory behaviour of 57 female wild boars in nine novel object tests and additionally assessed their aggressiveness. Exploration behaviour (i.e. approach latency and investigation duration) and aggressiveness were repeatable within individuals and both mapped on a single principal component yielding an individual personality score. Afterwards the females were kept together with 28 males under seminatural conditions in two large breeding enclosures from 2011 to 2014. Over winter 2013/2014 we applied high versus medium feeding regimes to the two enclosures. Our results show that adult body mass and reproductive success were affected by juvenile body mass and thus already determined early in life, which may point to a silver spoon effect in the wild boar. Whether a female reproduced or not, as well as the litter size shortly after birth, was only affected by female body mass. The postweaning litter size (i.e. at the time of independence at the age of about 6 months), however, was additionally affected by the personality score in interaction with food availability. Under high food availability less aggressive and explorative individuals raised more juveniles to independence. We conclude that lower aggressiveness and reduced exploratory tendency of the mother lead to lower juvenile mortality and hence have a positive impact on postweaning litter size. Under slightly decreased food availability, however, this effect vanished. As the impact of personality on reproductive success differed between changing environmental conditions, our results support the hypothesis that different personality phenotypes are evolutionarily maintained by varying selection pressures in heterogeneous environments. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={How animals trade-off food availability and predation threats is a strong determinant of animal activity and behavior; however, the majority of work on this topic has been on individual animals, despite the modulating effect the presence of conspecifics can have on both foraging and predation risk. Although these environmental factors (food and predation threat) vary spatially within habitats, they also vary temporally, and in marine habitats, this can be determined by not only the diel cycle but also the tidal cycle. Humbug damsel-fish, Dascyllus aruanus, live in small groups of unrelated individuals within and around branching coral heads, which they collectively withdraw into to escape a predation threat. In this study, we measured the proportion of individuals in the colony that were outside the coral head before and after they were scared by a fright stimulus and compared the responses at high tide (HT) and low tide (LT). We found that a greater proportion of the shoal emerged after the fright stimulus at HT and in larger groups than at LT or in smaller groups. We also quantified the pattern of emergence over time and discovered the rate of emergence was faster in larger shoals as time progressed. We show that shoals of fish change their behavioral response to a predation threat in accordance with the tide, exemplifying how temporally variable environmental factors can shape group movement decisions. © 2015 The Author.},

abstract={The ways in which animal societies respond to threat has enormous consequences for their success. In the present study, we investigated how group personality composition in social spiders (Stegodyphus dumicola) alters groups' average response towards predators and how their responses change with experience with important predators, Anoplolepis custodiens ants. We found that colonies composed of a mixture of 'bold' and 'shy' personality types exhibited twice as much defensive web-making behaviour as other colony compositions. Colony defensive behaviour was also more temporally stable following experience with predators for 'mixed' colonies than for either monotypic composition (all shy or all bold). Colonies composed of bold individuals were particularly erratic in their defensive behaviour over time. Thus, colony composition altered colony-level plasticity in response to experience with one of their most voracious predators. We additionally observed the behaviour of marked individuals within colonies to determine which individual traits were associated with task participation during encounters with predators. Individual morphology and boldness both predicted task participation at the individual level, with boldness being negatively associated with participation in the attack sequence, but positively associated with defensive silk making. Low body condition also proved to be important for predicting participation in any task. Lastly, despite a tight association between colony composition and colony defensive behaviour, we found no evidence that colony composition affected colony survival during ant attacks in situ. Instead, older and more established nests were positively associated with colony persistence during attacks. © 2016.},

abstract={Hauling out is an essential component of pinniped life-history. Haul-out behaviour may be affected by biological (e.g. sex, age and condition) and physical factors (e.g. food availability and environmental conditions), and identifying these factors may help explain the spatiotemporal distribution and habitat use of pinnipeds. The aim of this study is to describe observed winter haul-out patterns of adult Weddell seals in the Weddell Sea and investigate the role of potential predictors to gain insight into the way these animals interact with the physical environment in this region. We examined the haul-out behaviour in relation to available biological (i.e., diving effort, sex) and physical information (i.e., sun angle). Thirty-three satellite telemetry tags were deployed on adult Weddell seals in the southern Weddell Sea during February 2007, 2009 and 2011, following their annual moult recording information on the behavioural mode of the animal: at surface, hauled out or diving. At the end of the austral summer Weddell seals spent, on average, more than 40% of their time hauled out on the ice. Under constant light conditions, it appears that physiological factors drive sex differences in the timing and duration of haul-out behaviour, with females spending on average more time hauled out than males during daylight hours. This time spent hauled-out declined to around 15% in both sexes by the beginning of autumn and remained at this level with a clear nocturnal haul-out pattern during the winter. The time spent diving increased during this period, indicating an increase in foraging effort during the winter months, and led to a common haul-out pattern in both sexes over winter. We found a positive relationship between haul-out duration and the percentage of time spent diving prior to a haul-out in both sexes, with the exception of female daytime haul-outs early in the year. © 2016 Boehme et al.

abstract={Controlling dyslipidemia is important for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. This review introduces dietary management recommendations from the 2015 Korean Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidemia, which were established by the Korean Society of Lipidology and Atherosclerosis. To prevent dyslipidemia, controlling dietary energy consumption to maintain a healthy body weight is important, due to the positive relationship among overweight, obesity, and dyslipidemia. It is recommended that less than 30% of total daily calories come from dietary fat. Rather than simply decreasing the consumption of total fat, it is suggested that the consumption of saturated and trans fatty acid is less than 7% and 1%, respectively, of total daily calories. To reduce serum total triglycerides, the consumption of dietary carbohydrates is advised not to take excessive, and in particular a reduction in the consumption of simple sugars. The consumption of dietary fiber, which is rich in foods such as whole grains and vegetables, is recommended at 25 grams per day. Also, based on studies on the relationship between disease and dietary patterns, it is advised to maintain a diverse and balanced diet that includes vegetables, fruits, dairy products and whole grains, rather than a diet consisting of meat, noodles, and alcohol. Focusing on lifestyle behavioral strategies that target diet management to improve dyslipidemia could be highly effective in facilitating the risk reduction of cardiovascular disease and enhancing pharmacotherapeutic interventions. © Korean Medical Association.},

abstract={Obesity is a persistent and pervasive problem, particularly in industrialized nations. It has come to be appreciated that the metabolic health of an individual can influence brain function and subsequent behavioral patterns. To examine the relationship between metabolic phenotype and central systems that regulate behavior, we tested rats with divergent metabolic phenotypes (Low Capacity Runner: LCR vs. High Capacity Runner: HCR) for behavioral responses to the conflict between hunger and environmental novelty using the novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) paradigm. Additionally, we measured expression of mRNA, for peptides involved in energy management, in response to fasting. Following a 24-h fast, LCR rats showed lower latencies to begin eating in a novel environment compared to HCR rats. A 48-h fast equilibrated the latency to begin eating in the novel environment. A 24-h fast differentially affected expression of cocaine-amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) mRNA in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), where 24-h of fasting reduced CART mRNA in LCR rats. Bilateral microinjections of CART 55-102 peptide into the NAc increased the latency to begin eating in the NSF paradigm following a 24-h fast in LCR rats. These results indicate that metabolic phenotype influences how animals cope with the conflict between hunger and novelty, and that these differences are at least partially mediated by CART signaling in the NAc. For individuals with poor metabolic health who have to navigate food-rich and stressful environments, changes in central systems that mediate conflicting drives may feed into the rates of obesity and exacerbate the difficulty individuals have in maintaining weight loss. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={When determining an animal's food preference based on comparative consumption, a major problem is the potential for individuals to over-eat, rendering subjects unavailable for subsequent tests as well as exposing them to potentially adverse health implications. Here, we explored alternative, simple and quick ways of assessing food preference that involved only minimal training and avoided satiation. In Study 1, we investigated whether behaviour directed towards inaccessible food predicted consummatory choice. Following a prime with small quantities of two types of food of putatively different quality, 18 pet dogs were concurrently presented with the same two food types in a manner that they could see and smell, but not physically access. Time spent investigating the two inaccessible food types was measured. Subsequently, the dogs were given the opportunity to consume the same two food types but this time in a restricted-intake consummatory test: two puzzle feeders were presented simultaneously, each containing 18 pieces of one of the two food types. The proportion of food types making up the first 18 pieces consumed was recorded. Subjects showed a highly significant preference for the food type predicted to be of higher value in both the non-consummatory and the consummatory test. Moreover the proportion of time spent investigating the two food types in the non-consummatory test was very similar to the proportion of the two food types consumed from the puzzle feeders, demonstrating validity of both test methods. There are, however, some limitations to the consummatory test, in particular that it can only be valid if the two food types to be compared are of similar ease to extract from the boards. To assess the generalizability of the non-consummatory food preference test, in Study 2 we investigated test-retest reliability in 20 dogs, as well as consistency of preferences across populations by comparing 20 owned pet dogs and 25 dogs housed in rescue shelters. Findings were consistent across repetitions of the test as well as across the two test populations. Thus, relative food preference could be confidently and reliably inferred from behaviour during a non-consummatory exposure. The ease and speed of use, the lack of training required and the avoidance of satiation make this an ideal test for determining food preference. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Abstract: Individuals within groups benefit when they are phenotypically and behaviourally similar. Despite this, mixed-species aggregations are found among a wide range of animal taxa and are known to provide advantages in terms of enhanced foraging efficiency and predator avoidance. However, little is known about individual level interactions within these groups or the mechanisms mediating their structure. Diet-derived chemical cues can mediate within-species associations in fish, but it is not known whether they serve a similar function across species. To investigate this, we created mixed-species groups of sympatric three-spined (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and nine-spined (Pungitius pungitius) sticklebacks and manipulated the diet of the constituent group members. We found that three-spined sticklebacks did not associate more frequently with conspecifics over heterospecifics when all animals received the same diet, suggesting that species-specific cues did not influence association patterns. However, when group members were fed different diets, they interacted with heterospecifics fed on the same diet more than with conspecifics from a different diet treatment. This study demonstrates the importance of chemical cues as a possible mechanism for establishing familiarity, and thereby mediating within-group structure even between individuals in mixed-species aggregations. Understanding these underlying mechanisms has significant implications for our understanding of other social dynamics, including social learning and information transfer. Significance statement: Mixed-species groupings are common among animals, although we have a poor understanding of how these groups are structured, what mediates interactions between group members, and what the function of such groups is. In a study using two co-occurring stickleback species, we show that fish preferred to associate with shoal members fed the same diet as themselves, irrespective of their species. This is most likely mediated by diet-derived chemical cues and may allow fish to avoid detection by predators or forage alongside individuals with similar dietary preferences. Understanding the mechanisms underpinning non-random associations in mixed-species groups has significant implications for our understanding of other social dynamics, including social learning and information transfer. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Dispersing and non-dispersing individuals often differ in phenotypic traits (e.g. physiology, behaviour), but to what extent these differences are fixed or driven by external conditions remains elusive. We experimentally tested whether differences in nest-defence behaviour between dispersing and non-dispersing individuals changed with local habitat quality in collared flycatchers, by providing additional food during the nestling rearing period. In control (non-food-supplemented) nests, dispersers were less prone to defend their brood compared with non-dispersers, whereas in food-supplemented nests, dispersing and non-dispersing individuals showed equally strong nest defence. We discuss the importance of dispersal costs versus adaptive flexibility in reproductive investment in shaping these differences in nest-defence behaviour between dispersing and non-dispersing individuals. Irrespective of the underlying mechanisms, our study emphasizes the importance of accounting for environmental effects when comparing traits between dispersing and non-dispersing individuals, and in turn assessing the costs and benefits of dispersal. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Identifying evolutionary and developmental mechanisms underlying consistent between-individual differences in behaviour is the main goal in 'animal personality studies'. Here, we explored whether activity and risk-taking varied consistently between individuals and correlated to various - potentially fitness linked - male traits in Carpetan rock lizards (Iberolacerta cyreni). Lizards showed significant consistency within both behaviours, implying the presence of activity and risk-taking personalities. However, there were no correlation between activity and risk-taking, neither on the between- nor on the within-individual levels, implying the absence of a behavioural syndrome. We found a strong link between the intensity of blood parasite (Haemogregarinidae) infection and risk-taking: lizards with higher infection intensity took more risk. While we cannot distinguish cause from causative in the parasite intensity - risk-taking correlation - our results are in line with the asset protection hypothesis predicting that individuals with lower future reproductive value should focus on the current reproductive event and take higher risk. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Human milk oligosaccharides have been proposed to exert beneficial effects on brain development. During the last decades, most of the studies have focused on the evaluation of sialylated structures but recent experiments have also tested fucosylated oligosaccharides, i.e. 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL). The present study aimed to determine whether oral 2'-FL has an effect on the development of newborn brain, contributing to enhance cognitive skills later in life. Rat pups received an oral supplementation of 2'-FL (2'-FL group) or water (control group) during the lactation period. Thereafter, animals were maintained on a rodent standard diet. Rats (n. =. 12 rats/group) were evaluated twice, at age 4-6 weeks and again at age 1 year, using classical behavioral tests. In vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) was also performed at the same ages (n. =. 10 rats/group). Both groups showed similar behavior when the animals were assessed just after weaning (age 4-6 weeks), although the 2'-FL group seemed to perform slightly better in Morris Water Maze. At age 1 year, 2'-FL rats performed significantly better in the Novel Object Recognition and Y maze paradigms, when compared to controls. In addition, LTP was more intense and longer lasting in the rats supplemented with 2'-FL than in control animals, both in young and adult animals. Oral administration of 2'-FL exclusively during lactation enhanced cognitive abilities, not only in childhood but also in adulthood. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In the face of starvation, animals will engage in high-risk behaviors that would normally be considered maladaptive. Starving rodents, for example, will forage in areas that are more susceptible to predators and will also modulate aggressive behavior within a territory of limited or depleted nutrients. The neural basis of these adaptive behaviors likely involves circuits that link innate feeding, aggression and fear. Hypothalamic agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons are critically important for driving feeding and project axons to brain regions implicated in aggression and fear. Using circuit-mapping techniques in mice, we define a disynaptic network originating from a subset of AgRP neurons that project to the medial nucleus of the amygdala and then to the principal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, which suppresses territorial aggression and reduces contextual fear. We propose that AgRP neurons serve as a master switch capable of coordinating behavioral decisions relative to internal state and environmental cues. © 2016 Nature America, Inc.

abstract={Background: There is growing evidence that maternal obesity and prenatal exposure to a high-fat diet program fetal development to regulate the physiology and behavior of the offspring in adulthood. Yet the extent to which the maternal dietary environment contributes to adult disease vulnerability remains unclear. In the current study we tested whether prenatal exposure to maternal obesity increases the offspring's vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric disorders. Methods: We used a mouse model of maternal diet-induced obesity to investigate whether maternal obesity affects the response to adult chronic stress exposure in young adult (3-month-old) and aged adult (12-month-old) offspring. Results: Long-lasting, delayed impairments to anxiety-like behaviors and stress coping strategies resulted on account of prenatal exposure to maternal obesity. Although maternal obesity did not change the offspring's behavioral response to chronic stress per se, we demonstrate that the behavioral outcomes induced by prenatal exposure to maternal obesity parallel the deleterious effects of adult chronic stress exposure in aged male mice. We found that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR, Nr3c1) is upregulated in various hypothalamic nuclei on account of maternal obesity. In addition, gene expression of a known regulator of the GR, FKBP51, is increased specifically within the paraventricular nucleus. Conclusions: These findings indicate that maternal obesity parallels the deleterious effects of adult chronic stress exposure, and furthermore identifies GR/FKBP51 signaling as a novel candidate pathway regulated by maternal obesity. © 2015 S.

abstract={The increased consumption of diets high in saturated fats and refined sugars is a major public health concern in Western human societies. Recent studies suggest that perinatal exposure to dietary fat and/or sugar may affect behavioural development. We thus investigated the effects of perinatal exposure to a high-fat high-sugar diet (HFS) on behavioural development and production performance of piglets. Thirty-two non-obese sows and their piglets were allocated to 1 of 4 treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial design, with 8-week prenatal (gestation) and 8-week postnatal (lactation and post-weaning) exposure to a HFS diet (12% saturated fat, 18.5% sucrose, 1% cholesterol) or control low-fat low-sugar high-starch diets as factors. From weaning onwards (4 weeks of age), piglets were housed in group of 3 littermates (n = 8 groups/treatment) and fed ad libitum. After the end of the dietary intervention (8 weeks of age), all the piglets were fed a standard commercial diet. Piglet behaviours in the home pens were scored, and skin lesions, growth, feed intake and feed efficiency were measured up to 8 weeks after the end of the dietary treatment, i.e. until 16 weeks of age. At the end of the dietary treatment (8 weeks of age), response to novelty was assessed in a combined open field and novel object test (OFT/NOT). During the weeks following weaning, piglets fed the postnatal HFS diet tended to be less aggressive (p = 0.06), but exhibited more oral manipulation of pen mates (p = 0.05) than controls. Compared to controls, piglets fed the prenatal or postnatal HFS diet walked more in the home pen (p ≤ 0.05), and tended to have fewer skin lesions (p < 0.10). Several behavioural effects of the postnatal HFS diet depended on the prenatal diet, with piglets subjected to a switch of diet at birth being more active, and exploring feeding materials, pen mates, and the environment more than piglets that remained on the same diet. Behaviours during the OFT/NOT were not affected by the diet. The intake of the postnatal HFS diet drastically reduced feed intake, but improved feed efficiency up to 8 weeks after the end of the dietary intervention, i.e. 16 weeks of age (p < 0.0001 for both). Our study highlights the key role of prenatal and postnatal nutritional interactions for early behavioural development, and reveals programming effects of early life nutrition on voluntary feed intake of piglets later in life. © 2016 Clouard et al.

abstract={Understanding the decisions that animals make in the presence of predation risk can reveal their assessment of current and future reproductive options. The Wolf spider, Pardosa milvina, has a conspicuous courtship display that is an indicator of male quality. In an initial experiment, we determined that male courtship was highly repeatable and correlated with symmetry. We then used symmetry as an indicator of quality to explore the reactions of males when presented with simulated predation risk and an attractive virgin female. There were no differences in courtship features between risk and no risk treatments unless we took into account male quality. High-quality males reduced courtship intensity under risk conditions suggesting that they estimated their long-term fitness prospects as strong. This response is consistent with the asset protection principle, which suggests that animals with high value traits should behave cautiously. Low-quality males courted at high levels under predation risk, which seemed to be reckless attempts to attract females. This response is analogous to the "desperado effect," which is one explanation for vigorous fighting by inferior animals in contests. Although females used behavior to select males when no predator information was present, they seemed to use symmetry in the presence of predator cues. The ability of females to select the most attractive males suggests that they can accurately assess male quality under laboratory conditions. High courting "desperado" males may occasionally be selected in more complex environments and/or when they are in competition with other males. © 2015 The Author.},

abstract={We hypothesize that anorexia nervosa (AN) poses a physiological stress. Therefore, the way an individual copes with stress may affect AN vulnerability. Since prenatal stress (PNS) exposure alters stress responsivity in offspring this may increase their risk of developing AN. We tested this hypothesis using the activity based anorexia (ABA) rat model in control and PNS rats that were characterized by either proactive or passive stress-coping behavior.We found that PNS passively coping rats ate less and lost more weight during the ABA paradigm. Exposure to ABA resulted in higher baseline corticosterone and lower insulin levels in all groups. However, leptin levels were only decreased in rats with a proactive stress-coping style. Similarly, ghrelin levels were increased only in proactively coping ABA rats. Neuropeptide Y (Npy) expression was increased and proopiomelanocortin (Pomc) expression was decreased in all rats exposed to ABA. In contrast, agouti-related peptide (Agrp) and orexin (Hctr) expression were increased in all but the PNS passively coping ABA rats. Furthermore, DNA methylation of the orexin gene was increased after ABA in proactive coping rats and not in passive coping rats.Overall our study suggests that passive PNS rats have innate impairments in leptin and ghrelin in responses to starvation combined with prenatal stress associated impairments in Agrp and orexin expression in response to starvation. These impairments may underlie decreased food intake and associated heightened body weight loss during ABA in the passively coping PNS rats. © 2016 .},

abstract={Several genera belonging to the nematode family Diplogastridae show characteristic dimorphism in their feeding structures; specifically, they have microbial feeding stenostomatous and predatory eurystomatous morphs. A diplogastrid satellite model species, Pristionchus pacificus, and its close relatives have become a model system for studying this phenotypic plasticity, with intensive physiological and structural studies having been undertaken. However, the many other species that are morphologically and phylogenetically divergent from P. pacificus have not been examined to date. In the present study, the detailed stomatal structure and induction of dimorphism in Neodiplogaster acaloleptae were examined. N. acaloleptae has a fungal feeding stenostomatous morph and a predatory eurystomatous morph. The predatory morph was induced by starvation, high population density, and coculturing with its potential prey, Caenorhabditis elegans. The feeding behavior of the stenostomatous and eurystomatous morphs of N. acaloleptae was confirmed, demonstrating that 1) the stomatal and pharyngeal movements of the two morphs were basically identical, and 2) the stomatal elements were protracted to cut open the hyphae and/or prey to feed when a N. acaloleptae flips its dorsal movable tooth dorsally and tilts its subventral stegostomatal cylinder ventrally, forming a pair of scissors to cut the food source. The stoma morphology of N. acaloleptae with a single movable tooth and a long stoma is markedly different from that of Pristionchus, which has two movable teeth and a short stoma. It is, however, similar to that of Mononchoides, tentatively a sister to Neodiplogaster. © 2016 Natsumi Kanzaki.

abstract={Research with rodents and nonhuman primates suggests that maternal prenatal dietary fat intake is associated with offspring behavioral functioning indicative of risk for psychopathology. The extent to which these findings extend to humans remains unknown. The current study administered the Automated Self-Administered 24hr Dietary Recall Questionnaire three times in pregnancy (n=48) to examine women's dietary fat intake in relation to infant temperament assessed using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire at 4-months old. The amount of saturated fat that the mother consumed was considered as a moderator of the association between total fat intake and child temperament. Results from a series of multiple linear regressions indicate that greater total fat intake was associated with poorer infant regulation and lower surgency. However, this second effect was moderated by maternal saturated fat intake, such that total fat intake was only related to infant surgency when mothers consumed above the daily recommended allowance of saturated fat. Under conditions of high total fat and high saturated fat, infants were rated as lower on surgency; under conditions of low total fat yet high saturated fat, infants were rated as higher on surgency. There were no associations between maternal prenatal fat intake and infant negative reactivity. These findings provide preliminary evidence that pregnant women's dietary fat intake is associated with infants' behavioral development, though future research is needed to address this report's limitations: a relatively small sample size, the use of self-report measures, and a lack of consideration of maternal and infant postnatal diet. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Seasonal sea-ice cover has been decreasing in the southeastern Bering Sea shelf, which might affect ecosystem dynamics and availability of food resources to marine top predators breeding in the region. In this study, we investigated the foraging responses of two seabird species, surface-foraging red-legged kittiwakes Rissa brevirostris (hereafter, RLKI) and pursuit-diving foraging thick-billed murres Uria lomvia (TBMU) to different marine environmental conditions over 2 years. At-sea distributions of RLKI and TBMU breeding on St. George Island, the largest seabird colony in the region, were recorded using GPS loggers, and blood samples were taken to examine their physiological condition and isotopic foraging niche in a given year. Between the study years, winter ice retreated earlier and summer water temperatures were relatively warmer in 2014 compared to those in 2013. RLKI foraging occurred mostly over the oceanic basin in both years. TBMU, however, foraged mostly over the shelf but showed a relatively higher use of the shelf break and oceanic basin in 2013. The foraging distances from the colony peaked at 250-300 km in 2013 and bimodally at 150-250 and 300-350 km in 2014 for RLKI and tended to be farther in 2013 compared to those in 2014 for TBMU. Plasma levels of corticosterone did not differ between the years in RLKI but differed in TBMU, showing higher levels of physiological stress incurred by murres in 2013, the year of relatively cooler sea surface temperatures with later sea-ice retreat. δ13N (a proxy of trophic level of prey) did not differ between the years in either RLKI or TBMU. These results suggest that the response of ecosystem dynamics to climate variability in the southeastern Bering Sea may differ between the ocean basin and continental shelf regions, which, in turn, may generate differential responses in seabirds relying on those habitats for foraging. © Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Early initiation of breastfeeding after birth is a key behavioral health factor known to decrease neonatal mortality risks. Yet, few demographic studies examined how a community-based intervention impacts postpartum breastfeeding among the socio-economically deprived population in Sub-Saharan Africa. A post-intervention evaluation was conducted in 2011 to measure the effect of a UNICEF-led behavior change communication program promoting child health care in rural Niger.
METHODS: A quantitative survey is based on a post hoc constitution of two groups of a study sample, exposed and unexposed households. The sample includes women aged 15-49 years, having at least one child less than 24 months born with vaginal delivery. Rate ratio for bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were applied for statistical analysis. The outcome variable is the initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour of birth. Independent variables include other behavioral outcome variables, different types of communication actions, and socio-demographic and economic status of mothers.
RESULTS: The gaps in socio-economic vulnerability between the exposed and unexposed groups imply that mothers deprived from accessing basic health services and hygiene facilities are likely to be excluded from the communication actions. Mothers who practiced hand washing and used a traditional latrine showed 2.0 times more likely to initiate early breastfeeding compared to those who did not (95 % CI 1.4-2.7; 1.3-3.1). Home visits by community volunteers was not significant (AOR 1.2; 95 % CI 0.9-1.5). Mothers who got actively involved in exclusive breastfeeding promotion as peers were more likely to initiate breastfeeding within the first hour of birth (AOR 2.0; 95 % CI 1.4-2.9).
CONCLUSIONS: A multi-sectorial approach combining hygiene practices and optimal breastfeeding promotion led to supporting early initiation of breastfeeding. A peer promotion of child health care suggests a model of behavior change communication strategy as a response to socio-economic disparity.},

abstract={Despite the importance of host attributes for the likelihood of associated microbial transmission, individual variation is seldom considered in studies of wildlife disease. Here, we test the influence of host phenotypes on social network structure and the likelihood of cuticular bacterial transmission from exposed individuals to susceptible group-mates using female social spiders (Stegodyphus dumicola). Based on the interactions of resting individuals of known behavioural types, we assessed whether individuals assorted according to their behavioural traits. We found that individuals preferentially interacted with individuals of unlike behavioural phenotypes. We next applied a green fluorescent protein-transformed cuticular bacterium, Pantoea sp., to individuals and allowed them to interact with an unexposed colonymate for 24 h. We found evidence for transmission of bacteria in 55% of cases. The likelihood of transmission was influenced jointly by the behavioural phenotypes of both the exposed and susceptible individuals: transmission was more likely when exposed spiders exhibited higher ‘boldness’ relative to their colony-mate, and when unexposed individuals were in better body condition. Indirect transmission via shared silk took place in only 15% of cases. Thus, bodily contact appears key to transmission in this system. These data represent a fundamental step towards understanding how individual traits influence larger-scale social and epidemiological dynamics. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={The lung evolved to efficiently exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide between the external environment and circulating blood. Because it is an open conduit to the environment, the lung must also maintain tight barrier function, defend against inhaled toxins, and have tremendous repair capacity when injured. Creating, maintaining, and repairing the remarkably complex structure of the lung is controlled by genes that regulate cell autonomous functions and cell- cell interactions. However, many studies have now shown how perinatal environmental factors can also permanently modify lung development, thereby influencing long-term lung function and respiratory health. Environmental factors include oxygen at birth, nutrition and intrauterine growth restriction, prenatal and postnatal infections, ionizing radiation, ozone, tobacco smoke, and chemical toxins such as bisphenol A. Although perinatal influences are often considered detrimental to long-term respiratory health, how the lung responds to different levels of oxygen at birth suggests that its response to other influences may represent developmental changes in an organ evolutionarily designed to functionally adapt to its environment. Improving respiratory health as people age may therefore require a better understanding of how the perinatal environment plays a role in generating biologic fit and novelty. © Cambridge University Press 2016.

abstract={We examine the mechanistic basis and wider implications of adopting a developmental perspective on human ageing. Previous models of ageing have concentrated on its genetic basis, or the detrimental effects of accumulated damage, but also have raised issues about whether ageing can be viewed as adaptive itself, or is a consequence of other adaptive processes, for example if maintenance and repair processes in the period up to reproduction are traded off against later decline in function. A life course model places ageing in the context of the attainment of peak capacity for a body system, starting in early development when plasticity permits changes in structure and function induced by a range of environmental stimuli, followed by a period of decline, the rate of which depends on the peak attained as well as the later life conditions. Such path dependency in the rate of ageing may offer new insights into its modification. Focusing on musculoskeletal and cardiovascular function, we discuss this model and the possible underlying mechanisms, including endothelial function, oxidative stress, stem cells and nutritional factors such as vitamin D status. Epigenetic changes induced during developmental plasticity, and immune function may provide a common mechanistic process underlying a life course model of ageing. The life course trajectory differs in high and low resource settings. New insights into the developmental components of the life course model of ageing may lead to the design of biomarkers of later chronic disease risk and to new interventions to promote healthy ageing, with important implications for public health. © 2016 The Physiological Society.},

abstract={Diabetes, and associated diabetic neuropathic pain, impact negatively on cognitive function. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study investigated neuropathic pain-related behaviour and cognitive function in the rat streptozotocin (STZ) model of diabetes, and assessed cannabinoid1 (CB1) receptor functionality in discrete brain regions. Male Lister-Hooded rats received STZ (60 mg/kg s.c.) or vehicle. Sensory responses were assessed in von Frey and Hargreaves tests. Cognitive, motor and sensorimotor functions were assessed using novel object recognition and Morris water maze tasks. CB1 receptor functionality was assessed by [35S]GTPγS (guanosine 5'-O-[gamma-thio]triphosphate) autoradiography. STZ treatment was associated with mechanical allodynia and thermal hypoalgesia. Novel object recognition was unaltered in diabetic rats. STZ treatment was associated with impaired performance in the Morris water maze acquisition phase, but there were no differences in memory retrieval in the probe trial. Stimulus-response learning in the water maze cued trial was also disrupted in STZ-treated rats, possibly indicating sensorimotor deficits. CB1 receptor agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding was attenuated in the substantia nigra of STZ-treated rats but unaltered in the hippocampus. In conclusion, STZ treatment as a model of diabetic neuropathy was associated with specific functional deficits in the Morris water maze, effects which may be related to altered CB1 receptor functionality in the substantia nigra. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={One might expect a single solution to the question of 'how best' to mate and reproduce. In nature, however, discrete variation in mating patterns is common (called alternative mating tactics (AMTs)). Two main evolutionary explanations exist for the persistence of AMTs: a genetic polymorphism under negative frequency-dependent selection and phenotypic plasticity where the fitness associated with AMTs depends on environmental or individual conditions. Understanding how and when a single species generates such striking differences in behavior is essential to understanding AMTs, individual variation, and the evolution of novelty. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={There is an urgent need to identify therapeutic targets for anorexia nervosa (AN) because current medications do not impact eating behaviors that drive AN's high mortality rate. A major obstacle to developing new treatments is the lack of animal models that recapitulate the pattern of disease onset typically observed in human populations. Here we describe a translational mouse model to study interactions between genetic, psychological and biological risk factors that promote anorexic behavior. We combined several factors that are consistently associated with increased risk of AN - adolescent females, genetic predisposition to anxiety imposed by the BDNF-Val66Met gene variant, social isolation stress and caloric restriction (CR). Approximately 40% of the mice with all of these risk factors will exhibit severe self-imposed dietary restriction, sometimes to the point of death. We systematically varied the risk factors outlined above to explore how they interact to influence anorexic behavior. We found that the Val66Met genotype markedly increases the likelihood and severity of abnormal feeding behavior triggered by CR, but only when CR is imposed in the peri-pubertal period. Incidence of anorexic behavior in our model is dependent on juvenile exposure to social stress and can be extinguished by adolescent handling, but is discordant from anxiety-like behavior. Thus, this study characterized gene × environment interactions during adolescence that could be the underlying driver of abnormal eating behavior in certain AN patients, and represents a promising system to identify possible targets for therapeutic intervention.},

abstract={When perceiving a dangerous predation threat, mammalian and other species activate antipredator defensive reactions. These include the seemingly paradoxical—but compatible—activation of overarousal (e.g., agitation, insomnia) and “shutdown” (e.g., mutism, withdrawal) states. Acute suicidal crises, too, are characterized by the co-occurrence of overarousal and shutdown behaviors. In the minutes, hours, and days prior to one’s death by suicide, it is not uncommon for one to be simultaneously agitated and socially withdrawn, states that resemble antipredator defensive reactions. In this article, we present empirical, clinical, and philosophical grist for our conjecture that antipredator defensive reactions may serve as a useful way to understand the phenomenology of a serious suicidal crisis, and we reflect on the implications that soon-to-be suicide decedents are simultaneously killer and victim.

First, a standardized open-field behavioural assay was developed to assess individual behaviour of wild-captured adult E. lucius. Behaviour within the standardized assay predicted swimming behaviour in the lake, providing an ecological validation of the assay. There was no relationship between standardized behaviour and any of the life-history and state variables, including metabolism, body condition, juvenile growth rate and adult growth rate in contrast to predictions from the pace-of-life hypothesis. This study demonstrates that it is possible to assess ecologically relevant behavioural variation in a large-bodied top predator using a standard open-field assay, but it is noteworthy that this standardized behaviour is not systematically related to standard metabolism or growth. © 2016 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

abstract={The Eurasian otter Lutra lutra is a top predator that feeds mostly on fish. Yet, studies show the high plasticity of otter foraging behaviour and the varying importance of alternative food types in the species' diet. The aims of this study were, firstly, to demonstrate by meta-analysis how the diet composition of otters varies depending on the habitat occupied, in terms of the types of land use, waterbody, and bank vegetation. Secondly, we tested whether the choice of method of presenting prey percentages in the diet of otters influenced the conclusions of the meta-analysis. The percentage of fish in the diet was greater for otters occupying standing water than for those occupying flowing water; was higher for otters in waterbodies overgrown by reed vegetation; and varied depending on the type of surrounding land use. However, the results of the meta-analysis varied depending on which of the two most common methods of diet analysis were used: percentage biomass or relative frequency of occurrence (RFO). We showed that the plasticity of otter feeding behaviour might be explained by the various habitats occupied by otters. Habitat differences reflected in otters' diets might have importance for the maintenance and conservation of local populations of this species. The high diversity of methods used by researchers to report the results of dietary studies precludes full comparisons and synthesis. This demonstrates the importance of unification of reporting. Moreover, the conclusions reached by the authors of any particular study might be highly dependent on the method they applied. Thus, care should be taken when comparing ecological studies based on different methods. © 2016 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Sub-health is a state featuring a deterioration in physiological function between health and illness, and the sub-health condition has surfaced as life-threatening in humans. The aim of the present study was to establish a sub-health model in rats, and investigate the function of the intestinal barrier in the sub-health rats and rats following intervention. To establish a sub-health model, the rats were subjected to a high-fat and sugar diet, motion restriction and chronic stress. Their serum glucose and triglyceride levels, immune function and adaptability were then measured. The levels of diamine oxidase and D-lactic acid in the plasma were analyzed as markers of the intestinal permeability. The protein and mRNA expression levels of anti-apoptotic YWHAZ in the colonic tissue was detected using immunohistochemical and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses In the present study, the sub-health rat model was successfully established, and sub-health factors increased the intestinal permeability and reduced the expression of YWHAZ. Providing sub-health rats with normal living conditions did not improve the function of the intestinal barrier. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that intestinal disorders in the sub-health rat model may result from the damage caused by reduce intestinal barrier function as well as the decreased expression levels of YWHAZ. Additionally, rats in the sub-health condition did not recover following subsequent exposure to normal living conditions, suggesting that certain exercises or medical intervention may be necessary to improve sub-health symptoms.},

abstract={Infant temperament and parental feeding practices may be risk factors for childhood obesity, however most studies have relied upon parent-report assessments. We tested whether infant emotional distress and maternal restrictive feeding at 12-months of age, assessed observationally at a home feeding interaction, predicted child BMI through age 6 years. We conducted a prospective observational study of 86 children (34 girls and 52 boys, from 55 adoptive and 31 non-adoptive families) enrolled in the Colorado Adoption Project. Mother-infant feeding interactions were video-recorded during a home snack or meal at year 1, and child anthropometrics (length or height, and weight) were assessed at years 1 through 6. The main outcome measures were child weight-for-length at year 1 and body mass index (BMI: kg/m2) at years 2-6. Results of generalized linear models indicated that greater infant emotional distress at 12-months predicted greater increases in child weight status through age 6 years, B = 0.62 and odds ratio (OR) = 1.87. In separate analyses, restrictive feeding interacted with child sex in predicting weight status trajectories (p =.012). Male infants whose mothers displayed any compared to no restriction at year 1 showed a downward BMI trajectory from 2 to 6 years; for female infants, exposure to any compared to no restriction prompts predicted increasing BMI from 4 to 6 years. In sum, early obesity prevention strategies should pay greater attention to infant temperament, especially distress and negative affect, and how parents respond to such cues. Additionally, 'responsive feeding' strategies that provide an alternative to restriction warrant greater research during infancy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In many animals, the nontrivial cost of ejaculate production has led males to evolve prudent reproductive strategies in the form of precopulatory mating bias and/or cryptic ejaculate allocation. Behaviours determining male reproductive success, such as courtship and aggression, also impose substantial costs potentially selecting for plasticity in these traits. Here, using laboratory-adapted populations of Drosophila melanogaster, we investigated whether males show plasticity in these behaviours in response to the changes in their perception of future risk of competition (generated by varying the number of rivals). We show that males exhibited nonlinear plasticity in their aggressive behaviour. Males subjected to intermediate risk were found to show the maximum level of aggression compared to those subjected to low and high risk. Such plasticity in aggression did not lead to any variation in mating success but significantly increased the cost of reproduction. We also found a similar trend in courtship behaviour. While our results on copulation duration confirmed the previously reported plasticity, we did not find any effect of the treatment on mating latency. To the best of our knowledge this is the first empirical evidence showing plasticity in aggression in response to perceived risk of future competition and its relation to the cost of reproduction. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

In contrast, the Environmental Matching Hypothesis predicts that individuals will perform better if they experience similar conditions during development and adulthood. Past tests of these hypotheses have focussed on the effect of food quantity on growth and development, with little attempt to investigate the effect of individual nutrients on behavioural traits. This study aimed to test the predictions of the Environmental Matching and Silver Spoon Hypotheses by investigating the influence of carotenoid supplementation at different life-stages on the foraging performance of Pseudophryne corroboree. To assess foraging performance, adults were presented with prey in either a cryptic or conspicuous foraging matrix. There was no effect of diet treatment on time to first movement towards prey, number of stalking events, time spent actively foraging, proportion of successful strikes, proportion of prey consumed or number of pedal luring events. These findings indicate that carotenoid supplementation at different life-stages does not influence the foraging performance of P. corroboree, providing no support for either the Silver Spoon or Environmental Matching Hypotheses. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The establishment of protected areas or parks has become an important tool for wildlife conservation. However, frequent occurrences of human-wildlife conflict at the edges of these parks can undermine their conservation goals. Many African protected areas have experienced concurrent declines of apex predators alongside increases in both baboon abundance and the density of humans living near the park boundary. Baboons then take excursions outside of the park to raid crops for food, conflicting with the human population. We model the interactions of mesopredators (baboons), apex predators, and shared prey in the park to analyze how four components affect the proportion of time that mesopredators choose to crop-raid: (1) the presence of apex predators; (2) nutritional quality of the crops; (3) mesopredator "shyness" about leaving the park; and (4) human hunting of mesopredators. We predict that the presence of apex predators in the park is the most effective method for controlling mesopredator abundance, and hence significantly reduces their impact on crops. Human hunting of mesopredators is less effective as it only occurs during crop-raiding excursions. Furthermore, making crops less attractive, for instance by planting crops further from the park boundary or farming less nutritional crops, can reduce the amount of time mesopredators crop-raid. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Cows managed for extended lactation go through several estruses before rebreeding. The aims of this study were (1) to quantify the effect of the first 8 estruses after calving on milk yield, milking frequency, and estrous behavioral activity, and (2) to determine the effects of early lactation live weight gain (LWG) as an indication of energy balance on milk yield, plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentration, estrous behavioral activity, interval from calving to first estrus, between-estrus intervals, and pregnancy risk. Milk yield, live weight, and estrous behavioral activity were measured daily in 62 Holstein cows, 17 primiparous and 45 multiparous, managed for an 18-mo calving interval. Blood plasma obtained at wk 3, 5, 12, and 24 after calving was analyzed for IGF-1. Estrus was detected by use of milk progesterone profiles combined with visual observations (i.e., mounting behavior and other). The cows were divided into 2 groups: the cows having a negative LWG in each of the first 5 wk postpartum and the cows having a positive LWG in at least 1 of the first 5 wk after calving. The results indicate a similar decrease of 0.56 kg of milk per day of estrus during each of the 8 consecutive estruses. The activity level was 17 ± 1 movements per hour higher during the 8 estruses compared with the basic activity level. More cows expressed mounting behavior at estrus 8 than at estrus 2 (63.3 and 45.9%, respectively). The negative LWG cows had lower IGF-1 and higher milk production than the positive LWG cows. Both LWG groups had similar interval from calving to first estrus, on average 55 d. To conclude, the decrease in milk yield during estrus is marginal and similar in consecutive estruses. Moreover, estrous behavior is more highly expressed in the later estruses compared with the earlier estruses. Reproductive parameters (frequency of mounting, pregnancy risk, interval to first estrus, and between-estrus intervals) were not influenced by the live weight change during early lactation. © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.},

abstract={Despite many advances in management and housing of dairy calves, 1 in 10 US dairy heifers die before weaning. A better understanding of the internal and external stimuli that contribute to the physiological and behavioral responses of calves to stressors is needed to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality. Feeding calves their first meal is crucial, as successful passive transfer reduces the risk of mortality and morbidity. Sexually dimorphic immune and stress responses appear to be present in young cattle, but more research is needed to determine if this is caused by human bias for female calves. After that first feeding, 1 in 10 heifers and most bull calves in the United States are transported to specialized calf-raising facilities, yet information is lacking on the newborn calf stress response during transit. Whether calves are raised on site or at a calf ranch, individual housing systems are commonly used in the United States to reduce the risk of pathogen exposure and provide individual feeding and healthcare. However, health, growth, and social implications may be present for calves in alternative systems with greater space allowance than conventional systems or group housing. Disbudding and castration are typically performed at an early age for dairy calves during the pre-wean stage. These stressors often take place when the calf has decreased passive transfer of Ig and immunity is developing. Availability of pain mitigation through anesthetics and analgesics is limited, but evidence indicates that analgesics attenuate suppressed leukocyte function during these procedures. Solid-feed intake is a primary measure for determining weaning readiness, but some milk replacer formulas may influence the calf's oral behaviors before weaning; therefore, alternate weaning methods may need to coincide with alternate milk replacer formulas. The calf's behavioral and stress response at weaning may influence its immunity during the transition from individual to group housing (commingling). Alternate commingling strategies and nutritional supplements may help with this transition, but more research is needed to explore feasible alternatives. Optimizing the calf's health and well-being at these early stages may improve its long-term health and welfare. © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.},

abstract={The rate at which infants develop can vary within species. This variation may be due to differences between infants in their nutritional intake and physiology, or the ability of females to adjust the amount and timing of maternal investment to maximize their lifetime reproductive success. This is the first primate study that uses a large sample size and multivariate analyses to investigate whether variation in early infant development (measured visually using durations of natal coat stages) is explained by differences in infanticide pressure, predation pressure or feeding competition among mothers. We recorded the number of days that infants took to transition through each of the two natal coat stages (white to grey: N = 32; grey to black-and-white: N = 22), as well as through their entire natal coats (white to black-and-white: N = 38) in a population of wild ursine colobus, Colobus vellerosus. Infant males, which are at greater risk of infanticidal attacks, transitioned coat colours earlier than females, and infants in multimale groups, where infanticide occurs more frequently, transitioned earlier than infants in unimale groups. Variation in group size did not affect natal coat durations, which suggests that the intensity of predation risk and feeding competition do not influence development. Instead of terminating investment in offspring before birth, as in the 'Bruce effect', females may invest more heavily in infants after birth in order to speed up infant development and reduce the time period during which offspring are the most vulnerable to infanticide. Mothers may therefore have flexible means of exerting choice over maternal investment in relation to infanticide risk. However, the extent to which mothers and infants are responsible for adjusting the speed of development is unknown. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Female herbivorous insects often dictate the distributions of offspring through oviposition site selection. The optimal oviposition hypothesis proposes that sites selected should benefit offspring because they provide the best diets, but distributions can reflect adult responses to non-dietary factors. On its dioecious host [Allocasuarina verticillata (Lam.) L. Johnson (Casuarinaceae)], the largely sessile nymphs of Aacanthocnema dobsoni (Froggatt) (Hemiptera: Triozidae) are most abundant at the bases of the equisetoid, photosynthetic branchlets and can also be associated with chlorosis. We asked whether the distribution of nymphs could be explained by the nutritional quality of hosts (at tree and branchlet levels) and investigated the nutritional implications of chlorosis. Binary choice oviposition bioassays revealed that female psyllids exhibited a weak preference for the apical (younger) halves of branchlets of male and female trees over basal (older) halves. In the absence of nymphs, basal and apical halves of branchlets of both sexes had comparable concentrations of amino N. The severity of chlorosis of individual female branchlets was positively related to the density of nymphs. Along entire female branchlets, chlorosis was associated with significant reductions in the concentrations of certain amino acids (including glutamic acid). For basal halves of female branchlets, chlorosis was associated with increased concentrations of a different suite of amino acids, i.e., evidence of nutritional enhancement. Fifth instars from female branchlets were slightly larger than those from male branchlets but nymphal morphology is constrained by branchlet diameter. The conformation of the host (especially the spaces between the scale-like leaves) appears to dictate oviposition site selection more than nutritional quality. Nutritional enhancement is suggested to explain the absence of a strong linkage between preference and performance. Aggregation of adults (and eggs) at the base of branchlets could arise from heightened risk of dislodgement by wind at the ends of branchlets and enhanced mate finding in less exposed locations. © 2016 The Netherlands Entomological Society.},

The performance of the Bog gum-Victorian metapopulation of Ctenarytaina bipartita Burckhardt et al. (Psylloidea:Aphalaridae), a psyllid whose range is being expanded by tree planting, on five species and genotypes of Eucalyptus endemic to south-eastern Australia was quantified. Settling of females on two non-hosts was also tested. 3. Female C. bipartita exhibited significant host-associated plasticity in proctiger length (the body part used for oviposition into apical buds). Psyllids with longer wings and proctigers arose from a primary host. Fecundity varied significantly among hosts and was highest on a novel host. Hosts did not differ significantly in free amino acids (FAAs) but did differ in concentrations of essential amino acids (EAAs). However, nymphs did not differ significantly in EAAs. Surprisingly, fecundity was not related to total FAAs, availability of EAAs or concentrations of EAAs but was related to concentrations of four non-EAAs. Mean fecundity per host was also positively related to the relative abundance of galloyl groups (associated with hydrolysable tannins). 4. Leaf age was more important to settling than eucalypt species; females settled on young leaves but this response was not related to leaf water content. 5. Planting the rare Eucalyptus kitsoniana in new habitats will expand the range of Bog gum-Victorian C. bipartita and provide a bridge for the colonisation of novel eucalypts with buds suitable for oviposition. Host expansion by this metapopulation is not constrained by nutritional quality and may result in morphological divergence. © 2016 The Royal Entomological Society.},

abstract={Background/Objective:Appetitive traits and general temperament traits have both been correlated with adiposity and obesity in children. However, very few studies have tested structural models to identify the links between temperament, appetitive traits and adiposity in children. A validated structural model would help suggesting mechanisms to explain the impact of temperament on body mass index (BMI). In this study, we used Rothbart's heuristic definition of temperament as a starting point to define four appetitive traits, including two appetite reactivity dimensions (Appetite Arousal and Appetite Persistence) and two dimensions of self-regulation in eating (Self-regulation In Eating Without Hunger and Self-regulation in Eating Speed). We conducted a cross-sectional study in young adolescents to validate a structural model including these four appetitive traits, Effortful Control (a general temperament trait) and adiposity.Subjects/Methods:A questionnaire assessing the four appetitive trait dimensions and Effortful Control was completed by adolescents from 10 to 14 years old (n=475), and their BMI-for-age was calculated (n=441). In total, 74% of the study participants were normal weight, 26% were overweight and 8% were obese. We then used structural equation modelling to test the structural model.Results:We identified a well-fitting structural model (Comparative Fit Index=0.91; Root Mean Square Error of Approximation=0.04) that supports the hypothesis that Effortful Control impacts both dimensions of self-regulation in eating, which in turn are linked with both appetite reactivity dimensions. Moreover, Appetite Persistence is the only appetitive trait that was significantly related to adiposity (B=0.12; P<0.05).Conclusions:Our model shows that Effortful Control is related to adiposity through the mediation of an individual's 'eating temperament' (appetite reactivity and self-regulation in eating). Results suggest that young adolescents who exhibit high appetite reactivity but a low level of self-regulation in eating are at higher risk for excess adiposity. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract={Bats of the genus Pteropus (Pteropodidae) are recognised as the natural host of multiple emerging pathogenic viruses of animal and human health significance, including henipaviruses, lyssaviruses and ebolaviruses. Some studies have suggested that physiological and ecological factors may be associated with Hendra virus infection in flying-foxes in Australia; however, it is essential to understand the normal range and seasonal variability of physiological biomarkers before seeking physiological associations with infection status. We aimed to measure a suite of physiological biomarkers in P. alecto over time to identify any seasonal fluctuations and to examine possible associations with life-cycle and environmental stressors. We sampled 839 adult P. alecto in the Australian state of Queensland over a 12-month period. The adjusted population means of every assessed hematologic and biochemical parameter were within the reported reference range on every sampling occasion. However, within this range, we identified significant temporal variation in these parameters, in urinary parameters and body condition, which primarily reflected the normal annual life cycle. We found no evident effect of remarkable physiological demands or nutritional stress, and no indication of clinical disease driving any parameter values outside the normal species reference range. Our findings identify underlying temporal physiological changes at the population level that inform epidemiological studies and assessment of putative physiological risk factors driving Hendra virus infection in P. alecto. More broadly, the findings add to the knowledge of Pteropus populations in terms of their relative resistance and resilience to emerging infectious disease. © 2016 International Association for Ecology and Health.},

abstract={Coevolution is relentlessly creating and maintaining biodiversity and therefore has been a central topic in evolutionary biology. Previous theoretical studies have mostly considered coevolution between genetically symmetric traits (i.e. coevolution between two continuous quantitative traits or two discrete Mendelian traits). However, recent empirical evidence indicates that coevolution can occur between genetically asymmetric traits (e.g. between quantitative and Mendelian traits). We examine consequences of antagonistic coevolution mediated by a quantitative predator trait and a Mendelian prey trait, such that predation is more intense with decreased phenotypic distance between their traits (phenotype matching). This antagonistic coevolution produces a complex pattern of bifurcations with bistability (initial state dependence) in a two-dimensional model for trait coevolution. Furthermore, with eco-evolutionary dynamics (so that the trait evolution affects predator- prey population dynamics), we find that coevolution can cause rich dynamics including anti-phase cycles, in-phase cycles, chaotic dynamics and deterministic predator extinction. Predator extinction is more likely to occur when the prey trait exhibits complete dominance rather than semidominance and when the predator trait evolves very rapidly. Our study illustrates how recognizing the genetic architectures of interacting ecological traits can be essential for understanding the population and evolutionary dynamics of coevolving species. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Several recent hypotheses consider oxidative stress to be a primary constraint ensuring honesty of condition-dependent carotenoid-based signalling. The key testable difference between these hypotheses is the assumed importance of carotenoids for redox homeostasis, with carotenoids being either antioxidant, pro-oxidant or unimportant. We tested the role of carotenoids in redox balance and sexual signalling by exposing adult male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) to oxidative challenge (diquat dibromide) and manipulating carotenoid intake. As the current controversy over the importance of carotenoids as antioxidants could stem from the hydrophilic basis of commonly-used antioxidant assays, we used the novel measure of in vivo lipophilic antioxidant capacity. Oxidative challenge reduced beak pigmentation but elicited an increase in antioxidant capacity suggesting resource reallocation from signalling to redox homeostasis. Carotenoids counteracted the effect of oxidative challenge on lipophilic (but not hydrophilic) antioxidant capacity, thereby supporting carotenoid antioxidant function in vivo. This is inconsistent with hypotheses proposing that signalling honesty is maintained through either ROS-induced carotenoid degradation or the pro-oxidant effect of high levels of carotenoid-cleavage products acting as a physiological handicap. Our data further suggest that assessment of lipophilic antioxidant capacity is necessary to fully understand the role of redox processes in ecology and evolution.},

To validate the use of the model for profiling NaV1.7 inhibitors, we determined the NaV selectivity and tested the efficacy of the reported NaV1.7 inhibitors GpTx-1, PF-04856264 and CNV1014802 (raxatrigine). GpTx-1 selectively inhibited NaV1.7 and was effective when co-administered with OD1, but lacked efficacy when delivered systemically. PF-04856264 state-dependently and selectively inhibited NaV1.7 and significantly reduced OD1-induced spontaneous pain when delivered locally and systemically. CNV1014802 state-dependently, but non-selectively, inhibited NaV channels and was only effective in the OD1 model when delivered systemically. Our novel model of NaV1.7-mediated pain based on intraplantar injection of OD1 is thus suitable for the rapid in vivo characterization of the analgesic efficacy of NaV1.7 inhibitors. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Generalist predators typically have broad diets, but their diets may become constrained when one species of prey becomes disproportionately available. Yet there is poor understanding regarding whether generalist predators exhibit stereotypic relationships with pulsed prey resources. We used telemetry data from 959 woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788); 146 adult females, 813 calves), 61 coyotes (Canis latrans Say, 1823), and 55 black bears (Ursus americanus Pallas, 1780) to investigate how two generalist predators interacted with caribou neonates on the island of Newfoundland. We examined the similarity of patterns of habitat use between caribou and their predators across time and related this similarity to interspecific spatiotemporal co-occurrence and mortality risk for caribou neonates. The similarity in habitat use between coyotes and caribou mirrored variation in juvenile hazard risk, but had weak association with actual co-occurrence with caribou. Bears and caribou exhibited less similarity in habitat use during the calving season than coyotes and caribou. The relationship between habitat use of bear and caribou did not correspond with either co-occurrence patterns or overall risk for caribou neonates. Our work illustrates how risk for a prey species can be shaped differently based upon differences between the behavioural strategies of generalist predator species. © 2016, All rights reserved.},

abstract={Copepod mating is a complex behavioral interplay between males and females. But successful mating also requires a physiological component in terms of egg- and spermatophore production. In striking contrast to the extensive literature on copepod egg production, costs of spermatophore production has largely been ignored. This article explores the energetic demands in male copepod reproduction, testing how food and predation risk influence spermatophore production. Moreover, we analyse swimming behavior to test if predation risk and food act on reproductive investments via behavioral responses. We found that spermatophore production depends strongly on food availability. The copepods increased grazing rates with predation risk when food was limited, and video analyses revealed that males spend less time swimming in presence of a risk cue. A review of the few available spermatophore production rates suggests that food limits spermatophore production for copepods at large. Apparently, potential encounter rates with mates or predators did not influence spermatophore production. However, the reduced activity indicates a trade-off between risk avoidance and mate encounter, potentially influencing mating rates. This study shows that males invest considerable resources in each spermatophore, with implications for mating strategies and population dynamics in copepods, the most abundant metazoans on earth. © 2016 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography.},

abstract={Predation risk can strongly constrain how individuals use time and space. Grouping is known to reduce an individual's time investment in costly antipredator behaviours. Whether grouping might similarly provide a spatial release from antipredator behaviour and allow individuals to use risky habitat more and, thus, improve their access to resources is poorly known. We used mosquito larvae, Aedes aegypti, to test the hypothesis that grouping facilitates the use of high-risk habitat. We provided two habitats, one darker, low-risk and one lighter, high-risk, and measured the relative time spent in the latter by solitary larvae versus larvae in small groups. We tested larvae reared under different resource levels, and thus presumed to vary in body condition, because condition is known to influence risk taking. We also varied the degree of contrast in habitat structure. We predicted that individuals in groups should use high-risk habitat more than solitary individuals allowing for influences of body condition and contrast in habitat structure. Grouping strongly influenced the time spent in the high-risk habitat, but, contrary to our expectation, individuals in groups spent less time in the high-risk habitat than solitary individuals. Furthermore, solitary individuals considerably increased the proportion of time spent in the high-risk habitat over time, whereas individuals in groups did not. Both solitary individuals and those in groups showed a small increase over time in their use of riskier locations within each habitat. The differences between solitary individuals and those in groups held across all resource and contrast conditions. Grouping may, thus, carry a poorly understood cost of constraining habitat use. This cost may arise because movement traits important for maintaining group cohesion (a result of strong selection on grouping) can act to exaggerate an individual preference for low-risk habitat. Further research is needed to examine the interplay between grouping, individual movement and habitat use traits in environments heterogeneous in risk and resources. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Many birds have advanced their spring migration and breeding phenology in response to climate change, yet some long-distance migrants appear constrained in their adjustments. In addition, bird species with long generation times and those in higher trophic positions may also be less able to track climate-induced shifts in food availability. Migratory birds of prey may therefore be particularly vulnerable to climate change because: 1) most are long-lived and have relatively low reproductive capacity, 2) many feed predominately on insectivorous passerines, and 3) several undertake annual migrations totaling tens of thousands of kilometers. Using multi-decadal datasets for 14 raptor species observed at six sites across the Great Lakes region of North America, we detected phenological shifts in spring migration consistent with decadal climatic oscillations and global climate change. While the North Atlantic and El Niño Southern Oscillations exerted heterogeneous effects on the phenology of a few species, arrival dates more generally advanced by 1.18 d per decade, a pattern consistent with the effects of global climate change. After accounting for heterogeneity across observation sites, five of the 10 most abundant species advanced the bulk of their spring migration phenology. Contrary to expectations, we found that long-distance migrants and birds with longer generation times tended to make the greatest advancements to their spring migration. Such results may indicate that phenotypic plasticity can facilitate climatic responses among these long-lived predators. Journal of Avian Biology © 2016 Nordic Society Oikos.},

abstract={Data from 96 Holstein Friesian cows on a commercial dairy farm were used to investigate whether body condition and serum levels of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) postpartum (pp) affect progesterone (P4) levels, estrous activity, and fertility in dairy cows. The examination period started 14 days before the expected calving date and ended either when a cow was inseminated or at a maximum of 90 days pp. Body condition score (BCS; 1-5 scale) and backfat thickness (BFT) were determined every 2 weeks. Blood for analysis of NEFA and P4 concentrations was sampled weekly during the first 35 days pp and then every 48 hours until an ovulation was observed. Transrectal ultrasonography of the ovaries started at 21 days pp and was performed after blood sampling. If cows were not inseminated because of silent ovulation, sampling and ultrasonography continued on Days 7, 14, and 18 after ovulation and again every 48 hours until the next ovulation. Estrous activity was continuously measured with the Heatime estrus detection system. Pregnancy controls were performed ultrasonographically 28 and 42 days after AI. Cows with increased NEFA levels at 28 days pp had an increased risk of maintaining minimum P4 levels above 0.4 ng/mL at first recognized estrus (P = 0.03). Higher NEFA levels at Day 7 were associated with lower probability for a cow to have elevated P4 levels (≥2 ng/mL) by Day 35 pp, indicating delayed commencement of luteal activity (C-LA). Estrous activity was not influenced (P > 0.10) by minimum P4 concentrations at estrus, but more animals with C-LA until Day 35 pp showed estrous activity compared to cows without C-LA throughout this period (P = 0.006). Estrous activity was lower in cows with a low BCS 14 days pp (P = 0.02) and with a low BFT 42 days pp (P = 0.03). Moreover, the probability to exhibit estrus was reduced with higher NEFA levels at 21 days pp (P = 0.01). Eighty-five cows were inseminated and 37 (44%) got pregnant after insemination. Higher NEFA levels, especially 14, 28, and 42 days pp, were associated with lower probability to inseminate a cow. Regarding the cows that were inseminated, no influence of BCS, BFT, or NEFA levels on pregnancy per artificial insemination was found. In conclusion, cows with higher loss of body condition and elevated NEFA concentrations had higher P4 concentrations during estrus, a reduced estrous activity and insemination rate, but no depression in pregnancy per artificial insemination. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={For many species sexual signaling is a very costly activity, both in terms of energetic expenditure and increased conspicuousness to predators. One potential strategy to limit the costs of signaling is to only signal at maximum effort in contexts when signaling is expected to be most effective. Multiple studies have documented extensive plasticity in sexual signaling within a variety of contexts, however fewer experiments have examined individual-level variation in the extent of signaling plasticity and the causes of this variation. In this study we examined the influence of size and physical condition on the magnitude of signaling plasticity using a gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) study system. We quantified signaling plasticity by recording male calling behavior first in the absence and then in the presence of a sexually receptive female. For one call property, call length, we found that both weight and condition had a significant influence on the magnitude of plasticity. Smaller males, and males in higher condition exhibited the greatest degree of plasticity. We discuss several possible explanations for this pattern and provide suggestions for future work to examine the consequences of this plasticity and the potential interactive effects of multiple biotic and abiotic contexts on signaling plasticity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

However, experimental studies have tended to focus on trait means; intra-population variation in responses are likely, but have rarely been explored. Here we use established experimental methods to demonstrate a condition-dependent effect of additional noise. We show that juvenile European eels (Anguilla anguilla) in good condition do not respond differently to playbacks of ambient coastal noise and coastal noise with passing ships. By contrast, the additional noise of ship passes caused an increase in ventilation rate and a decrease in startling to a looming predatory stimulus in poor condition eels. Intra-population variation in responses to noise has important implications both for population dynamics and the planning of mitigation measures. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Current models indicate that an organism’s sensitivity to risk may be heavily influenced by the trade-off between current and future reproduction. Individuals that have fewer future reproductive opportunities are expected to show more risky behavior as they have less to lose if captured by a predator (the asset protection principle). In this study, we examined the effects of age and physical condition on risk taking behavior during sexual signaling in the gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) to test the prediction that older and poor condition males will take greater risks than their younger or higher-condition counterparts. In accordance with these predictions, we found that males in low physical condition resumed signaling activity more rapidly following a simulated predator attack than their higher-condition counterparts, although this effect was only apparent in one of two study years. Further, males that resumed calling early did not offset their risk of detection by predators via reduced calling effort. Contrary to our predictions, we did not find age to be a significant predictor of risk taking in male signaling behavior. We conclude with a discussion of possible explanations for the discrepancy observed between years and highlight the potential reproductive consequences of variation in risk taking behavior. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Preterm birth interrupts normal fetal growth with consequences for postnatal growth and organ development. In preterm infants, many physiological deficits adapt and disappear with advancing postnatal age, but some may persist into childhood. We hypothesized that preterm birth would induce impaired organ growth and function during the first postnatal week in pigs, while motor abilities and behavioral characteristics would show more persistent developmental delay. Cesarean-delivered preterm (n [1] 112, 90% gestation) or term (n [1] 56, 100% gestation) piglets were reared under identical conditions and euthanized for blood and organ collection on postnatal days 0, 5, or 26. Body weight gain remained lower in preterm vs. term pigs up to day 26 (25.5 ± 1.5 vs. 31.0 ± 0.5 g·kg-1·day-1, P &lt; 0.01) when relative weights were higher for brain and kidneys and reduced for liver and spleen. Neonatal preterm pigs had reduced values for blood pH, PO2, glucose, lactate, hematocrit, and cortisol, but at day 26, most values were normalized, although plasma serotonin and IGF 1 levels remained reduced. Preterm pigs showed delayed neonatal arousal and impaired physical activity, coordination, exploration, and learning, relative to term pigs (all P &lt; 0.05). Supplementation of parenteral nutrition during the first 5 days with an enteral milk diet did not affect later outcomes. In preterm pigs, many physiological characteristics of immaturity disappeared by 4 wk, while some neurodevelopmental deficits remained.

abstract={Although specialist herbivorous insects are guided by innate responses to host plant cues, host plant preference may be influenced by experience and is not dictated by instinct alone. The effect of learning on host plant preference was examined in the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri; vector of the causal agent of citrus greening disease or huanglongbing. We investigated: a) whether development on specific host plant species influenced host plant preference in mature D. citri; and b) the extent of associative learning in D. citri in the form of simple and compound conditioning. Learning was measured by cue selection in a 2-choice behavioral assay and compared to naïve controls. Our results showed that learned responses in D. citri are complex and diverse. The developmental host plant species influenced adult host plant preference, with female psyllids preferring the species on which they were reared. However, such preferences were subject to change with the introduction of an alternative host plant within 24-48 hrs, indicating a large degree of experience-dependent response plasticity. Additionally, learning occurred for multiple sensory modalities where novel olfactory and visual environmental cues were associated with the host plant. However, males and females displayed differing discriminatory abilities. In compound conditioning tasks, males exhibited recognition of a compound stimulus alone while females were capable of learning the individual components. These findings suggest D. citri are dynamic animals that demonstrate host plant preference based on developmental and adult experience and can learn to recognize olfactory and visual host plant stimuli in ways that may be sex specific. These experience-based associations are likely used by adults to locate and select suitable host plants for feeding and reproduction and may suggest the need for more tailored lures and traps, which reflect region-specific cultivars or predominate Rutaceae in the area being monitored.},

abstract={Background: Sedentary time is an independent risk factor for chronic diseases and mortality. It is unknown whether active adults alter their dietary and/or physical activity behaviors in response to imposed sedentary time, possibly modifying risk. The aim of this study was to determine whether imposed sedentary time would alter typical behaviors of active adults. Methods: Sixteen physically active, young adults were randomized to the no-intervention control (CON, n = 8) group or the sedentary-intervention (SIT, n = 8) group. SIT participants attended monitored sedentary sessions (8 wk, 10 h/wk). Assessments including diet and physical activity occurred at baseline, week 4, and week 9. Results: There were no differences (P > .05) between CON and SIT groups for step counts or time spent in sedentary, light, moderate, or vigorous physical activity when comparing a week during imposed sedentary time (week 4) to baseline and week 9. At week 4, caloric intake was not different from baseline (P > .05) in either group. Caloric intake decreased significantly (P > .05) in SIT from baseline to week 9. Conclusions: Active adults did not alter physical activity or dietary behaviors during the imposed sedentary intervention. However, SIT reduced caloric intake from baseline to week 9, indicating a possible compensatory response to imposed sitting in active adults. © 2016 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

abstract={Background In 2012, yoga was practiced by 20 million Americans, of whom 82% were women. A recent literature review on prenatal yoga noted a reduction in some pregnancy complications (ie, preterm birth, lumbar pain, and growth restriction) in those who practiced yoga; to date, there is no evidence on fetal response after yoga. Objectives We aimed to characterize the acute changes in maternal and fetal response to prenatal yoga exercises using common standardized tests to assess the well-being of the maternal-fetal unit. Study Design We conducted a single, blinded, randomized controlled trial. Uncomplicated pregnancies between 28 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks with a nonanomalous singleton fetus of women who did not smoke, use narcotics, or have prior experience with yoga were included. A computer-generated simple randomization sequence with a 1:1 allocation ratio was used to randomize participants into the yoga or control group. Women in the yoga group participated in a 1-time, 1 hour yoga class with a certified instructor who taught a predetermined yoga sequence. In the control group, each participant attended a 1-time, 1 hour PowerPoint presentation by an obstetrician on American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendations for exercise, nutrition, and obesity in pregnancy. All participants underwent pre- and postintervention testing, which consisted of umbilical and uterine artery Doppler ultrasound, nonstress testing, a biophysical profile, maternal blood pressure, and maternal heart rate. A board-certified maternal-fetal medicine specialist, at a different tertiary center, interpreted all nonstress tests and biophysical profile data and was blinded to group assignment and pre- or postintervention testing. The primary outcome was a change in umbilical artery Doppler systolic to diastolic ratio. Sample size calculations indicated 19 women per group would be sufficient to detect this difference in Doppler indices (alpha, 0.05; power, 80%). Data were analyzed using a repeated-measures analysis of variance, a χ2, and a Fisher exact test. A value of P &lt;.05 was considered significant. Results Of the 52 women randomized, 46 (88%) completed the study. There was no clinically significant change in umbilical artery systolic to diastolic ratio (P =.34), pulsatility index (P =.53), or resistance index (P =.66) between the 2 groups before and after the intervention. Fetal and maternal heart rate, maternal blood pressure, and uterine artery Dopplers remained unchanged over time. When umbilical artery indices were individually compared with gestational age references, there was no difference between those who improved or worsened between the groups. Conclusion There was no significant change in fetal blood flow acutely after performing yoga for the first time in pregnancy. Yoga can be recommended for low-risk women to begin during pregnancy. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Persistence by adaptation is called evolutionary rescue. Evolutionary rescue is more likely in populations that have been previously exposed to lower doses of the same stressor. Environmental fluctuations might also reduce the possibility of rescue, but little is known about the effect of evolutionary history on the likelihood of rescue. In this study, we hypothesised that the ubiquitous operation of generalised stress responses in many organisms increases the likelihood of rescue after exposure to other stressors. We tested this hypothesis with experimental populations that had been exposed to long-term starvation and were then selected on different, unrelated stressors. We found that prior adaptation to starvation imposes contrary effects on the plastic and evolutionary responses of populations to subsequent stressors. When first exposed to new stressors, such populations become extinct more often. If they survive the initial exposure to the new stressors, however, they are more likely to undergo evolutionary rescue. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract={Food neophobia seems to be related to nutritional, emotional, and family problems during childhood and adolescence. However, a specific measure to assess food neophobia in this population group is lacking in Spain. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a culturally appropriate Spanish version of the self-report Food Situations Questionnaire (FSQ) published by Loewen and Pliner in 2000. Items were translated into Spanish by means of the forward-backward translation procedure, using age-appropriate and simple vocabulary. The Spanish Food Situations Questionnaire (SFSQ) was then administered to a community sample of 831 participants (368 males and 463 females) aged between 8 and 16. The internal structure (dimensionality), internal consistency, and temporal stability of the instrument were examined, as were its convergent and external validity. The results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed, as in the original FSQ, a two-factor structure (Low Stimulation and High Stimulation). These dimensions showed adequate internal consistency and temporal stability. The results also provide some evidence of convergent validity. External validation data were obtained based on the negative relationship between food neophobia and the sensation-seeking personality trait. Overall, the present work offers researchers and professionals interested in this area of study a valid and reliable tool for assessing food neophobia in Spanish-speaking children and adolescents. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Objective To examine whether weight recovery among children with weight faltering varied by enrollment age and child and household risk factors. Study design Observational, conducted in an interdisciplinary specialty practice with a skill-building mealtime behavior intervention, including coaching with video-recorded interactions. Eligibility included age 6-36 months with weight/age <fifth percentile or crossing of 2 major percentiles. Children were categorized as <24 months vs ≥24 months. Child and household risk factors were summed into risk indices (top quartile = elevated risks, vs reference). Outcome was weight/age z-score change over 6 months. Analyses were conducted with longitudinal linear mixed-effects models, including age by risk index interaction terms. Results Enrolled 286 children (mean age 18.8 months, SD 6.8). Significant weight/age recovery occurred regardless of risk index or age. Mean weight/age z-score change was significantly greater among younger compared with older age (0.29 vs 0.17, P =.03); top household risk quartile compared with reference (0.34 vs 0.22, P =.046); and marginally greater among top child risk quartile compared with reference (0.37 vs 0.25, P =.058). Mean weight/age z-score change was not associated with single risk factors or interactions; greatest weight gain occurred in most underweight children. Conclusions Weight recovery over 6 months was statistically significant, although modest, and greater among younger children and among children with multiple child and household risk factors. Findings support differential susceptibility theory, whereby some children with multiple risk factors are differentially responsive to intervention. Future investigations should evaluate components of the mealtime behavior intervention. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The long-term weight management of obesity remains a very difficult task, associated with a high risk of failure and weight regain. However, many people report that they have successfully managed weight loss maintenance in the long term. Several factors have been associated with better weight loss maintenance in long-term observational and randomized studies. A few pertain to the behavioral area (eg, high levels of physical activity, eating a low-calorie, low-fat diet; frequent self-monitoring of weight), a few to the cognitive component (eg, reduced disinhibition, satisfaction with results achieved, confidence in being able to lose weight without professional help), and a few to personality traits (eg, low novelty seeking) and patient–therapist interaction. Trials based on the most recent protocols of lifestyle modification, with a prolonged extended treatment after the weight loss phase, have also shown promising long-term weight loss results. These data should stimulate the adoption of a lifestyle modification-based approach for the management of obesity, featuring a nonphysician lifestyle counselor (also called “lifestyle trainer” or “healthy lifestyle practitioner”) as a pivotal component of the multidisciplinary team. The obesity physicians maintain a primary role in engaging patients, in team coordination and supervision, in managing the complications associated with obesity and, in selected cases, in the decision for drug treatment or bariatric surgery, as possible more intensive, add-on interventions to lifestyle treatment. © 2016 Montesi et al.},

abstract={Background Isavuconazole is a novel triazole with broad-spectrum antifungal activity. The SECURE trial assessed efficacy and safety of isavuconazole versus voriconazole in patients with invasive mould disease. Methods This was a phase 3, double-blind, global multicentre, comparative-group study. Patients with suspected invasive mould disease were randomised in a 1:1 ratio using an interactive voice-web response system, stratified by geographical region, allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, and active malignant disease at baseline, to receive isavuconazonium sulfate 372 mg (prodrug; equivalent to 200 mg isavuconazole; intravenously three times a day on days 1 and 2, then either intravenously or orally once daily) or voriconazole (6 mg/kg intravenously twice daily on day 1, 4 mg/kg intravenously twice daily on day 2, then intravenously 4 mg/kg twice daily or orally 200 mg twice daily from day 3 onwards). We tested non-inferiority of the primary efficacy endpoint of all-cause mortality from first dose of study drug to day 42 in patients who received at least one dose of the study drug (intention-to-treat [ITT] population) using a 10% non-inferiority margin. Safety was assessed in patients who received the first dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00412893. Findings 527 adult patients were randomly assigned (258 received study medication per group) between March 7, 2007, and March 28, 2013. All-cause mortality from first dose of study drug to day 42 for the ITT population was 19% with isavuconazole (48 patients) and 20% with voriconazole (52 patients), with an adjusted treatment difference of -1·0% (95% CI -7·8 to 5·7). Because the upper bound of the 95% CI (5·7%) did not exceed 10%, non-inferiority was shown. Most patients (247 [96%] receiving isavuconazole and 255 [98%] receiving voriconazole) had treatment-emergent adverse events (p=0·122); the most common were gastrointestinal disorders (174 [68%] vs 180 [69%]) and infections and infestations (152 [59%] vs 158 [61%]). Proportions of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events by system organ class were similar overall. However, isavuconazole-treated patients had a lower frequency of hepatobiliary disorders (23 [9%] vs 42 [16%]; p=0·016), eye disorders (39 [15%] vs 69 [27%]; p=0·002), and skin or subcutaneous tissue disorders (86 [33%] vs 110 [42%]; p=0·037). Drug-related adverse events were reported in 109 (42%) patients receiving isavuconazole and 155 (60%) receiving voriconazole (p<0·001). Interpretation Isavuconazole was non-inferior to voriconazole for the primary treatment of suspected invasive mould disease. Isavuconazole was well tolerated compared with voriconazole, with fewer study-drug-related adverse events. Our results support the use of isavuconazole for the primary treatment of patients with invasive mould disease.

abstract={Background: Internationally, studies show that similar levels of alcohol consumption in deprived communities (vs. more affluent) result in higher levels of alcohol-related ill health. Hypotheses to explain this alcohol harm paradox include deprived drinkers: Suffering greater combined health challenges (e.g. smoking, obesity) which exacerbate effects of alcohol harms; exhibiting more harmful consumption patterns (e.g. bingeing); having a history of more harmful consumption; and disproportionately under-reporting consumption. We use a bespoke national survey to assess each of these hypotheses. Methods: A national telephone survey designed to test this alcohol harm paradox was undertaken (May 2013 to April 2014) with English adults (n = 6015). Deprivation was assigned by area of residence. Questions examined factors including: Current and historic drinking patterns; combined health challenges (smoking, diet, exercise and body mass); and under-reported consumption (enhanced questioning on atypical/special occasion drinking). For each factor, analyses examined differences between deprived and more affluent individuals controlled for total alcohol consumption. Results: Independent of total consumption, deprived drinkers were more likely to smoke, be overweight and report poor diet and exercise. Consequently, deprived increased risk drinkers (male >168-400 g, female >112-280 g alcohol/week) were >10 times more likely than non-deprived counterparts to drink in a behavioural syndrome combining smoking, excess weight and poor diet/exercise. Differences by deprivation were significant but less marked in higher risk drinkers (male >400 g, female >280 g alcohol/week). Current binge drinking was associated with deprivation independently of total consumption and a history of bingeing was also associated with deprivation in lower and increased risk drinkers. Conclusions: Deprived increased/higher drinkers are more likely than affluent counterparts to consume alcohol as part of a suite of health challenging behaviours including smoking, excess weight and poor diet/exercise. Together these can have multiplicative effects on risks of wholly (e.g. alcoholic liver disease) and partly (e.g. cancers) alcohol-related conditions. More binge drinking in deprived individuals will also increase risks of injury and heart disease despite total alcohol consumption not differing from affluent counterparts. Public health messages on how smoking, poor diet/exercise and bingeing escalate health risks associated with alcohol are needed, especially in deprived communities, as their absence will contribute to health inequalities. © 2016 Bellis et al.},

abstract={Background: Identifying the determinants of child's liking for different foods may help to prevent future choices of unhealthy food. Objective: To study early-life food-related characteristics associated with child's liking for different foods at 5y with a longitudinal study. Design: 1142 5y- old children completed a liking test for "fruit and vegetables", "meat, fish and eggs", desserts and cheese. Data related to maternal food intake before pregnancy, infant feeding during the first year of life, maternal feeding practices at 2y, child's food intake at 3y, and child's food neophobia from 1 to 4y were collected prospectively from the mother. The associations between these factors and child's liking for each category of foods were analyzed using structural equation modelling. Results: High food neophobia at 4 y was related to lower child's liking for all food groups. Maternal feeding practices at 2y were associated with liking for dessert: negatively for the practices allowing child to control his/her own food intake, positively for restriction of child's food intake for weight reasons. Moreover, child's food intake at 3y was positively associated with child's liking for "fruit and vegetables" as well as for cheese. Finally, adherence to the infant feeding pattern "long breastfeeding, later introduction of main meal components and use of home-made products" was positively associated with child's liking for meat/fish/eggs. Conclusions: For all food groups, food neophobia was a common determinant of child's liking for food at 5y, whereas other factors were associated with food liking for specific food groups. © 2016 Yuan et al.},

abstract={The study of primates living in novel environments represents an interesting context in which to examine patterns of behavioral and ecological flexibility. Our research focused on an understudied, anthropogenically introduced primate population living in Florida, USA: the Silver River rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). To better understand how this population has adapted to life in Florida’s riparian woodlands, we collected data on the diet and size of the rhesus macaque population and its encounters with boaters along the Silver River from January to May 2013. Using scan sampling and all-occurrences sampling, we collected 166 h of diet data and 105 h of human-macaque encounter data, respectively. We confirmed previous reports that four social groups comprise the Silver River macaque population, totaling 118 individuals. The Silver River macaques predominantly consumed leaves and other vegetative plant parts (87.5 %), with ash trees serving as a staple food (66.5 % of feeding records). Although human-macaque encounters were frequent (80 % of 611 boats observed), only a small proportion of boats (11.5 %) provisioned the macaques. Motorized boats (e.g., pontoon and motor boats) were more likely to provision, while kayaks and canoes were more likely to move in close proximity of the macaques situated at the river’s edge. Our results indicate that the Silver River macaques have adjusted to life in the New World by adopting a temperate welling feeding strategy and by incorporating locally available foods (e.g., sedges) into their diet. They have also learned that the river’s edge provides opportunities to receive provisions from boaters. However, because the rate of provisioning is low, these foods likely play a filler fallback role. Given that provisioning and direct contact between macaques and boaters are infrequent but proximity to the macaques is a concern, our findings have important implications for the management of the humanmacaque interface along the Silver River and beyond. © Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan 2016.},

Nonetheless, group living and sociality is found in many animals, and understanding the direct and indirect benefits of cooperation that override the inherent costs remains a challenge in evolutionary ecology. Individuals in groups may benefit from more efficient management of energy or water reserves, for example in the form of reduced water or heat loss from groups of animals huddling, or through reduced energy demands afforded by shared participation in tasks. We investigated the putative benefits of group living in the permanently social spider Stegodyphus dumicola by comparing the effect of group size on standard metabolic rate, lipid/protein content as a body condition measure, feeding efficiency, per capita web investment, and weight/water loss and survival during desiccation. Because energetic expenditure is temperature sensitive, some assays were performed under varying temperature conditions. We found that feeding efficiency increased with group size, and the rate of weight loss was higher in solitary individuals than in animals in groups of various sizes during desiccation. Interestingly, this was not translated into differences in survival or in standard metabolic rate. We did not detect any group size effects for other parameters, and group size effects did not co-vary with experimental temperature in a predictive manner. Both feeding efficiency and mass loss during desiccation are relevant ecological factors as the former results in lowered predator exposure time, and the latter benefits social spiders which occupy arid, hot environments. © 2016 Vanthournout, Greve, Bruun, Bechsgaard, Overgaard and Bilde.},

abstract={The effects of social and ecological stressors on female reproductive success vary among species and, in mammals, previous reviews have identified no clear patterns. However, few studies have simultaneously examined the relation between social rank and stressors and the relationships among rank, stressors and reproductive success. We used a long-term data set to study free-living facultatively social yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris, to isolate the relationship between female social dominance rank and faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) levels (our measure of basal stress) in adult females. In addition, we examined whether rank and FGM levels were associated with reproductive success by quantifying the probability of an individual successfully weaning a litter and, for those who did, litter size. High-ranking females had lower FGM levels and larger litters. However, females with the highest FGM levels were significantly more likely to wean a litter. Importantly, body condition (as measured by previous year's mass) was also positively associated with breeding and with weaning larger litters. Thus, although low-ranking females probably experienced more social stressors than high-ranking females and although adult females often delayed their first reproduction until they were of a sufficient mass, our results suggest that elevated baseline FGM levels failed to mediate reproductive suppression. Perhaps, in species like marmots that have only a single chance per year to reproduce, reproductive suppression should be rare. These results highlight the importance of social status, body condition and predator abundance on determining reproductive success in highly seasonal breeders. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Daily activity patterns in mammals depend on food availability, reproductive stage, habitat selection, intraspecific interactions and predation risk, among other factors. Some mammals exhibit behavioral plasticity in activity patterns, which allows them to adapt to environmental changes. A good example of this can be found in the red fox Vulpes vulpes. This species is adapted to living in highly humanized environments, where it is often culled because it may affect human interests (e.g. through the consumption of game species or livestock). We assessed the potential main drivers of the daily activity patterns of the red fox in 12 Iberian Mediterranean areas through the use of camera traps. Among drivers, we considered main prey availability (European wild rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus), degree of human disturbance (e.g. distance to human settlements, and intensity of predator control) and habitat structure. Our results revealed a predominantly crepuscular and nocturnal activity of foxes with local variations. Although overall fox activity increased with rabbit availability, the temporal overlap with prey activity was on average low, because foxes increased activity when rabbits decreased theirs (twilight-night). Red fox activity rhythms seemed to be determined by human presence where human disturbance is high. In addition, diurnal activity decreased in areas with higher levels of human disturbance (closer to human settlements and high predator control intensity) and increased in dense habitats. Our study shows that daily activity patterns of highly adaptable species are determined by several interacting drivers, resulting in complex behavioral patterns. This suggests that further ecological studies should consider different factors simultaneously for a better understanding of daily activity patterns of wildlife in different landscapes. © 2016 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract={Adolescents are especially prone to risky behavior and to the emergence of psychological disorders like substance abuse, anxiety and depression. However, there is a sex (or gender) difference in this vulnerability, with females being more prone to developing internalizing disorders and males being more likely to engage in risky behavior and drug use. While several researchers have proposed that there is a relationship between corticolimbic circuit development and adolescent vulnerability, the current proposed models do not take sex differences into account. In this review, we explore recent findings from both human and rodent studies of sex differences during adolescence. In particular, we consider epidemiological studies on the factors that contribute to the development of substance abuse and internalizing disorders, laboratory studies on reward-related and decision-making behavior, and neuroanatomical studies on the development of several structures in the corticolimbic circuit (i.e., prefrontal cortex [PFC], amygdala and striatum). We then integrate these recent findings into models of adolescent vulnerability to substance use that have previously not addressed sex differences. Lastly, we discuss methodological considerations for the interpretation and design of studies on sex (or gender) differences during adolescence while highlighting some opportunities for future investigations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Larvae of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar L. (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae), a generalist species, frequently encounter spatial and temporal variations in diet quality. Such variation favoured the evolution of high behavioural and physiological plasticity which, depending on forest stand composition, enables more or less successful exploitation of the environment. Even in mixed oak stands, a suitable habitat, interspecific and intraspecific host quality variation may provoke significant variation in gypsy moth performance and, consequently, defoliation severity. To elucidate the insufficiently explored relationship between gypsy moth and oaks (Fagaceae), we carried out reciprocal switches between Turkey oaks (Quercus cerris L.) and less nutritious Hungarian oaks (Quercus frainetto Ten.) (TH and HT groups), under controlled laboratory conditions, and compared larval performance between the switched larvae and larvae continuously fed on either Turkey oak (TT) or Hungarian oak (HH). We found that larval traits were most strongly affected by among-tree variation in oak quality and identity of the host consumed during the fourth instar. Switching from Turkey to Hungarian oak (TH) led to a longer period of feeding, decrease of mass gain, growth, and consumption rate, lower efficiency of food use and nutrient conversion, and increase of protease and amylase activities. Larvae exposed to the reverse switch (HT) attained values of these traits characteristic for TT larvae. It appeared that the lower growth in the TH group than in the TT group was caused by both behavioural (consumption, pre-ingestive) and metabolic (post-digestive) effects from consuming oaks. Multivariate analyses of growth, consumption, and efficiency of food use revealed that early diet experience influenced the sensitivity of the most examined traits to less suitable Hungarian oaks, suggesting the development of behavioural and physiological adjustments. Our results indicate that lower risks of defoliation by gypsy moth might be expected in mixed stands with a higher proportion of Hungarian oak. © 2016 The Netherlands Entomological Society.},

abstract={Chemoreception is often crucial to the interaction between predators and their prey. Investigating the mechanisms controlling predator chemical preference gives insight into how selection molds traits directly involved in ecological interactions between species. In snakes, prey cue preferences are influenced by both direct genetic control and experience-based plasticity. We assessed prey preference in a group of Dusky Pigmy Rattlesnakes that had eaten only mice or lizards over a 5 year period to test whether genetics or plasticity primarily determine the preference phenotype. Our results provide evidence for genetic determination of preference for lizard chemical cues in pigmy rattlesnakes. Snakes preferred the scent of lizards, regardless of their initial diet, and the response to mouse scent did not differ from the water-only control. We discuss these findings in light of previous studies that manipulated snake diets over shorter timescales. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common degenerative disease of the motoneuron system, involving various abnormalities, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, transitional metal accumulation, neuroinflammation, glutamate excitotoxicity, apoptosis, decreased supply of trophic factors, cytoskeletal abnormalities, and extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD)-1 toxicity. These multiple disease etiologies implicated in ALS gave rise to the perception that future therapeutic approaches for the disease should be aimed at targeting multiple pathological pathways. In line with this view, we have evaluated in the current study the therapeutic effects of low doses of the novel multifunctional monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor/iron-chelating compound, M30 in combination with high Calorie Energy supplemented Diet (CED) in the SOD1-G93A transgenic mouse model of ALS. Our results demonstrated that the combined administration of M30 with CED produced additive neuroprotective effects on motor performance and increased survival of SOD1-G93A mice. We also found that both M30 and M30/CED regimens caused a significant inhibition of MAO-A and -B activities and decreased the turnover of dopamine in the brain of SOD1-G93A mice. In addition, M30/CED combined treatment resulted in a significant increase in mRNA expression levels of various mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism regulators, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ)-co activator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), PPARγ, uncoupling protein 1, and insulin receptor in the gastrocnemius muscle of SOD1-G93A mice. These results suggest that a combination of drug/agents with different, but complementary mechanisms may be beneficial in the treatment of ALS. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Keller and Schoenfeld (1950) proposed a unique behavioral perspective on conceptualization. They suggested that concepts refer solely to an organism's behavior and to the conditions under which it occurs; as such, conceptual behavior need be neither verbal nor uniquely human. Herrnstein and Loveland (1964) advanced that behavioral perspective by deploying an elegant training procedure to teach visual concepts to pigeons. Keller and Schoenfeld's perspective and Herrnstein and Loveland's methodology have inspired my own research into conceptualization by pigeons. Using a system of arbitrary visual tokens, my colleagues and I have built ever-expanding nonverbal "vocabularies" in pigeons through a variety of different concept learning tasks. Pigeons have reliably categorized as many as 2000 individual photographs from as many as 16 different human object categories, even without the benefit of seeing an item twice. Our formal model of conceptualization effectively embraces 25 years of empirical evidence as well as generates novel predictions for both pigeon and human conceptual behavior. Comparative study should continue to elucidate the commonalities and disparities between human and nonhuman conceptual behavior it should also explicate the relationship between associative learning, object recognition, conceptualization, and language. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The benefits of behavioral flexibility in social insect societies are well known, but the advantages of limited flexibility have seldom been considered. Florida harvester ant colonies maintain a stable forager population size for much of their active season, and despite seasonal variation in chronological age, foragers die within 27 days of initiating foraging. To determine how colonies balance forager mortality and forager replacement, we tested the relative influences of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on forager membership, retention, and longevity. Potential and realized forager longevity differed significantly. Residual lifespan increased by 57 % when colonies were penned for 20 days, and up to 8-fold when foragers were retained in the laboratory. Increased forager longevity inhibited the movement of new workers into the forager population. In contrast, increased mortality and starvation did not stimulate the addition of new foragers and forager population size declined when mortality exceeded 4 % per day. Experimental increases in forager number, body fat, and the ratio of larvae to foragers did not induce behavioral reversion in existing foragers. These results suggest an unidirectional allocation strategy, with foragers that are less disposable and less behaviorally flexible than the well-studied honey bee. In P. badius, forager membership is maintained not by young ants detecting increased demand, but by workers developing at rates that allow forager replacement and prevent excessive worker depletion. In the absence of a lifespan matched to predictable risks, opportunistic increases in forager survival may promote colony growth by inhibiting the scheduled and irreversible transitions of younger workers. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders that primarily display social and communication impairments and restricted/repetitive behaviors. ASD prevalence has increased in recent years, yet very limited therapeutic targets and treatments are available to counteract the incapacitating disorder. Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) is a popular herbal plant in South Korea known for its wide range of therapeutic effects and nutritional benefits and has recently been gaining great scientific attention, particularly for its positive effects in the central nervous system. Objectives: Thus, in this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of KRG in alleviating the neurobehavioral deficits found in the valproic acid (VPA)-exposed mice models of ASD. Design: Starting at 21 days old (P21), VPA-exposed mice were given daily oral administrations of KRG solution (100 or 200 mg/kg) until the termination of all experiments. From P28, mice behaviors were assessed in terms of social interaction capacity (P28-29), locomotor activity (P30), repetitive behaviors (P32), shortterm spatial working memory (P34), motor coordination (P36), and seizure susceptibility (P38). Results: VPA-exposed mice showed sociability and social novelty preference deficits, hyperactivity, increased repetitive behavior, impaired spatial working memory, slightly affected motor coordination, and high seizure susceptibility. Remarkably, long-term KRG treatment in both dosages normalized all the ASD-related behaviors in VPA-exposed mice, except motor coordination ability. Conclusion: As a food and herbal supplement with various known benefits, KRG demonstrated its therapeutic potential in rescuing abnormal behaviors related to autism caused by prenatal environmental exposure to VPA. © 2016 Edson Luck T.

abstract={Estrogen depletion due to aging, surgery or pathological events can cause a multitude of problems, including neurodegenerative alterations. In rodents without ovaries, 17-beta estradiol (E2) has been shown to produce beneficial effects on cognition, stimulating brain regions (e.g., the neocortex, hippocampus and amygdala) related to cognition and learning. Another treatment that stimulates these brain regions is an enriched environment (EE), which is a complex set of external factors in the immediate surroundings that facilitates greater stimulation of sensorial, cognitive and motor circuits of the brain. The aim of the present study was to test, using an animal model of ovariectomy-induced impairment of memory, the relative effect of E2 (with a time-released pellet; 1 μg/rat/day), EE exposure and a combination of both treatments. Experimental and control groups were submitted to two memory tests 18 weeks post-surgery: the autoshaping learning task (ALT) for measuring associative learning and the novel object recognition test (NORT) for evaluating short- and long-term memory. To assess potential motor impairments caused by treatments, all rats were tested after the ALT in an automatic activity counter. Results from ALT show that the ovariectomy blocked the conditioned responses displayed, an effect rescued by chronic treatment with estrogen or EE exposure. The combination of both treatments did not improve the results obtained separately. In the NORT, the exploration time for recognizing a novel object was similar in the short run with all groups, but greater in the long run with hormone administration or EE exposure. As with the ALT, in the NORT there was no improvement shown by the combination treatment. These data were not masked by changes in spontaneous activity because this parameter was not modified in the rats by either treatment. Possible action mechanisms are proposed, taking into account the role of corticosterone and BDNF on cognition. © 2016, Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Previous animal studies have demonstrated that phthalate exposure is associated with depression-like behaviors. However, no human study has explored this relationship. We explored the association between urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and depression in a nationally representative sample of the U.S. elderly population. We analyzed 2030 participants aged 60 years or older with available data on phthalates and depression from the 2005 to 2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We selected 10 urinary phthalate metabolites with a weighted detection rate >60%. Depression was defined as a 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire score ≥10. The models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education level, income-to-poverty ratio, health insurance coverage, marital status, smoking status, alcohol consumption, moderate physical activity, body mass index, comorbidity status, NHANEs cycle, and urinary creatinine levels. One-unit increases in log-transformed mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP) (odds ratio [OR]=1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.02-1.52) and mono(carboxynonyl) phthalate (MCNP) (OR=1.42, 95% CI=1.15-1.75) were positively associated with depression. When we stratified the urinary phthalate metabolites into quartiles, the highest quartiles (Q4) of MCNP (OR=2.57, 95% CI=1.25-5.27) and mono-. n-butyl phthalate (MBP) (OR=2.40, 95% CI=1.10-5.22) were associated with depression compared with the lowest quartiles (Q1). Concentrations of urinary phthalate metabolites MCPP, MCNP, and MBP were positively associated with the risk of depression in a representative sample of the U.S. elderly population. However, the present cross-sectional study is hypothesis generating and the associations need to be investigated through further longitudinal studies. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Objective: This study analyzed child feeding beliefs and behaviors, types of recipes, and their associations in blogs focused on child feeding. Design: The authors selected 13 blogs using purposive snowball sampling, from which 158 blog posts were sampled and coded using directed qualitative content analysis. Variables Measured: Child feeding beliefs and behaviors and types of recipes were coded using schemes developed from existing literature. Analysis: Code frequencies were calculated. Chi-square tests for independence examined associations between child feeding and recipe codes. Bonferroni corrections were applied: P < .05/(tests). Results: Child feeding beliefs and behaviors were coded in 78% and 49% of posts, respectively. Beliefs about children's food preferences (48% of posts) and involving children in food preparation (27% of posts) were the most frequent codes. Recipes were included in 66% of posts. Most recipes were for mixed dishes (32% of recipes), followed by sweets and desserts (19% of recipes). Vegetable recipes were more likely in posts that included behavior encouraging balance and variety (χ2 [1, n = 104] = 18.54; P < .001). Conclusions and Implications: Blog posts contained information that may influence readers' child feeding practices. Future research should explore how mothers use blogs to learn about child feeding. © 2016 Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior.},

abstract={The maternal environment influences a broad range of phenotypic outcomes for offspring, with anxiety-like behavior being particularly susceptible to maternal environmental perturbations. Much less is known regarding paternal environmental influences. To investigate this, adult male rats were exposed to 25% calorie restriction (CR) or glucocorticoid elevation (CORT; 200 μg/ml of corticosterone in drinking water) for ~6 weeks prior to breeding. Elevated plus maze (EPM), open field (OF), predator odor (cat urine), and acoustic startle/pre-pulse inhibition (AS/PPI) were characterised in the adult male offspring. Plasma concentrations of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRF), adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), and serum lepin were characterised in both sires and offspring. Maternal care received by litters was additionally observed. Expectedly, CR and CORT treatment attenuated weight gain, whilst only CR induced anxiolytic behavior in the EPM. The adult offspring sired by CR males also demonstrated a reduction in weight gain, food intake and serum leptin levels when compared to controls. Moreover, CR offspring demonstrated an anxiolytic-like profile in the EPM and OF, enhanced habituation to the AS pulse, reduced PPI, but no alteration to predator odor induced defensiveness compared to control. CORT offspring failed to demonstrate any behavioral differences from controls, however, exhibited a trend towards reduced ACTH and leptin concentration. Collectively, the results indicate that a reduction in calories in males prior to conception can affect the behavior of adult offspring. The phenotypic transmission of CR experiences from fathers to the progeny could potentially be mediated epigenetically. The role of glucocorticoid elevation and maternal care are also discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Personality disorders are common, and the core problems of interpersonal dysfunction and social disturbance are difficult to treat. One area gaining international attention is the impact that diet and nutrients can have on psychiatric/psychological symptoms. There are no empirical studies studying the specific relationship between nutrition and personality disorders. A systematic search revealed longitudinal studies following malnourished children, either during pregnancy or in early life that reported malnourishment is a risk factor that can express as maladaptive behaviours later in life. Other studies show associations between nutrient intake and personality styles. A small body of literature reveals a potential benefit of consuming nutrients therapeutically in order to address behaviours often associated with personality disorders. If we consider the broad patterns of behaviour that typify personality disorders, such as cognition, affectivity, interpersonal functioning and impulse control, there is a research rationale for studying the role that nutrition could play in protecting against the development of these problems as well as possibly modifying them. Whether it is too late to intervene with nutrition once the pathological behaviours are entrenched is unknown. Given the dearth of good evidence-based treatments currently available for people with personality disorders, it is an area worth investing in. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The late Pleistocene extinction of so many large-bodied vertebrates has been variously attributed to two general causes: rapid climate change and the effects of humans as they spread from the Old World to previously uninhabited continents and islands. Many large-bodied vertebrates, especially large apex predators, maintain their associated ecosystems through top-down forcing processes, especially trophic cascades, and megaherbivores also exert an array of strong indirect effects on their communities. Thus, a third possibility for at least some of the Pleistocene extinctions is that they occurred through habitat changes resulting from the loss of these other keystone species. Here we explore the plausibility of this mechanism, using information on sea otters, kelp forests, and the recent extinction of Steller's sea cows from the Commander Islands. Large numbers of sea cows occurred in the Commander Islands at the time of their discovery by Europeans in 1741. Although extinction of these last remaining sea cows during early years of the Pacific maritime fur trade is widely thought to be a consequence of direct human overkill,we showthat it is also a probable consequence of the loss of sea otters and the co-occurring loss of kelp, even if not a single sea cow had been killed directly by humans. This example supports the hypothesis that the directly caused extinctions of a few large vertebrates in the late Pleistocene may have resulted in the coextinction of numerous other species.},

abstract={Background: The current Australia's Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines recommend that adults engage in regular moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and strength training (ST), and minimise time spent in sedentary behaviours (SB). However, evidence about the specific individual and concurrent distribution of these behaviours in Australia is scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of MVPA, ST and SB in a national-representative sample of Australian adults. Methods: Data were collected using face-to-face interviews, as part of the National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey 2011-12. The population-weighted proportions meeting the MVPA (≥150 min/week), ST (≥2 sessions/week) and combined MVPA-ST guidelines, and proportions classified as having 'low levels of SB' (<480 min/day) were calculated, and their associations with selected sociodemographic and health-related variables were assessed using multiple logistic regression analyses. This was also done for those at potentially 'high-risk', defined as insufficient MVPA-ST and 'high-sedentary' behaviour. Results: Out of 9345 participants (response rate = 77.0 %), aged 18-85 years, 52.6 % (95 % CI: 51.2 %-54.0 %), 18.6 % (95 % CI: 17.5 %-19.7 %) and 15.0 % (95 % CI: 13.9 %-16.1 %) met the MVPA, ST and combined MVPA-ST guidelines, respectively. Female gender, older age, low/medium education, poorer self-rated health, being classified as underweight or obese, and being a current smoker were independently associated with lower odds of meeting the MVPA, ST and combined MVPA-ST guidelines. A total of 78.9 % (95 % CI: 77.9 %-80.0 %) were classified as having low levels of SB. Females, older adults and those with lower education were more likely to report lower levels of SB, whilst those with poor self-rated health and obese individuals were less likely to report lower levels of SB (i.e. SB = ≥480 min/day). A total of 8.9 % (95 % CI: 8.1 %-9.6 %) were categorised as individuals at potentially 'high-risk'. Those with poorer self-rated health, obese individuals, those aged 25-44, and current smokers were more likely to be in the 'high risk' group. Conclusions: The large majority of Australian adults do not meet the full physical activity guidelines and/or report excessive SB. Our results call for public health interventions to reduce physical inactivity and SB in Australia, particularly among the subgroups at the highest risk of these unhealthy behaviours. © 2016 Bennie et al.},

abstract={In humans, maximum brain development occurs between the third trimester of gestation and 2 years of life. Nutrition during these critical windows of rapid brain development might be essential for later cognitive functioning and behaviour. In the last few years, trends on protein recommendations during infancy and childhood have tended to be lower than that in the past. It remains to be demonstrated that lower protein intakes among healthy infants, a part of being able to reduce obesity risk, is safe in terms of mental performance achievement. Secondary analyses of the EU CHOP, a clinical trial in which infants from five European countries were randomised to be fed a higher or a lower protein content formula during the 1st year of life. Children were assessed at the age of 8 years with a neuropsychological battery of tests that included assessments of memory (visual and verbal), attention (visual, selective, focused and sustained), visual-perceptual integration, processing speed, visual-motor coordination, verbal fluency and comprehension, impulsivity/inhibition, flexibility/shifting, working memory, reasoning, visual-spatial skills and decision making. Internalising, externalising and total behaviour problems were assessed using the Child Behaviour Checklist 4–18. Adjusted analyses considering factors that could influence neurodevelopment, such as parental education level, maternal smoking, child’s gestational age at birth and head circumference, showed no differences between feeding groups in any of the assessed neuropsychological domains and behaviour. In summary, herewith we report on the safety of lower protein content in infant formulae (closer to the content of human milk) according to long-term mental performance.

abstract={Background: In pediatric hemophilia, caregivers are facing unique challenges to adherence and self-care in children and adolescents with hemophilia. Hemophilia treatment requires adequate prophylaxis and on-demand treatment, as well as a clear behavioral strategy to limit risk-taking in terms of physical exercise and diet. Medication adherence rates of hemophilia patients have been reported to decrease during late childhood and adolescence. In the developing child, moving safely from parent-care to self-care is one of the greatest challenges of integrative care within this domain. There is a clear need for initiatives designed to increase an individual's motivation for treatment and self-care activities. Discussion: Among motivational approaches, the self-determination perspective offers a useful framework to explain how the transition to self-care can be facilitated. We discuss how motivation regarding hemophilia treatment may be increased through parental autonomy support and we offer examples of applied communication techniques to facilitate autonomy-supportive caregiving. Although it has not yet been tested in the context of hemophilia, these communication techniques could potentially help caregivers promote adherence and self-care in children. Summary: Confronted by unique challenges to adherence and self-care, caregivers of children with hemophilia should move from an exclusive focus on illness-management education to an integrative strategy, including motivation-enhancing communication. The self-determination perspective provides important proximal objectives (e.g. autonomy support) to maintain optimal adherence in adolescents as they move from parent-care to self-care. Future research initiatives should address the practice of these communication techniques and evaluate them in the context of hemophilia. © 2016 Bérubé et al.},

abstract={The increasing recognition that the gut microbiota plays a central role in behavior and cognition suggests that the manipulation of microbial taxa through diet may provide a means by which behavior may be altered in a reproducible and consistent manner in order to achieve a beneficial outcome for the host. Resistant starch continues to receive attention as a dietary intervention that can benefit the host through mechanisms that include altering the intestinal microbiota. Given the interest in dietary approaches to improve health, the aim of this study was to investigate whether the use of dietary resistant starch in mice to alter the gut microbiota also results in a change in behavior. Forty-eight 6 week-old male Swiss-Webster mice were randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups (n = 16 per group) and fed either a normal corn starch diet (NCS) or diets rich in resistant starches HA7 diet (HA7) or octenylsuccinate HA7 diet (OS-HA7) for 6 week and monitored for weight, behavior and fecal microbiota composition. Animals fed an HA7 diet displayed comparable weight gain over the feeding period to that recorded for NCS-fed animals while OS-HA7 displayed a lower weight gain as compared to either NCS or HA7 animals (ANOVA p = 0.0001; NCS:HA7 p = 0.244; HA7:OS-HA7 p<0.0001; NCS:OS-HA7 p<0.0001). Analysis of fecal microbiota using 16s rRNA gene taxonomic profiling revealed that each diet corresponded with a unique gut microbiota. The distribution of taxonomic classes was dynamic over the 6 week feeding period for each of the diets. At the end of the feeding periods, the distribution of taxa included statistically significant increases in members of the phylum Proteobacteria in OSHA7 fed mice, while the Verrucomicrobia increased in HA7 fed mice over that of mice fed OS-HA7. At the class level, members of the class Bacilli decreased in the OS-HA7 fed group, and Actinobacteria, which includes the genus Bifidobacteria, was enriched in the HA7 fed group compared to the control diet. Behavioral analysis revealed that animals demonstrated profound anxiety-like behavior as observed by performance on the elevated-plus maze with time spent by the mice in the open arm (ANOVA p = 0.000; NCS:HA7 p = 0.004; NCS:OS-HA7 p = 1.000; HA7:OS-HA7 p = 0.0001) as well as entries in the open arm (ANOVA p = 0.039; NCS:HA7 p = 0.041; HA7:OS-HA7 p = 0.221; NCS:OS-HA7 p = 1.000). Open-field behavior, a measure of general locomotion and exploration, revealed statistically significant differences between groups in locomotion as a measure of transitions across quadrant boundaries. Additionally, the open-field assay revealed decreased exploration as well as decreased rearing in HA7 and OS-HA7 fed mice demonstrating a consistent pattern of increased anxiety-like behavior among these groups. Critically, behavior was not correlated with weight. These results indicate that diets based on resistant starch can be utilized to produce quantifiable changes in the gut microbiota and should be useful to "dial-in" a specific microbiome that is unique to a particular starch composition. However, undesirable effects can also be associated with resistant starch, including lack of weight gain and increased anxiety-like behaviors. These observations warrant careful consideration when developing diets rich in resistant starch in humans and animal models. © 2016 Lyte et al.

abstract={We sought to uncover the impact of the social environment on the spatial behavior of rats. ood-deprived rats were trained in a spatial task of collecting food items from 16 equispaced bjects. Following training, they were tested, first alone and then with a similarlytrained age-mate. It was found that the presence of another rat substantially altered the ats' spatial behavior. Lone rats collected the food items faster while traveling a shorter distance, eflecting a higher efficiency of task completion. When accompanied by a partner, owever, the rats traveled together, visiting the same set of objects in each trip with one of hem leading. Whether alone or with a partner, rats continued to revisit the same objects; owever, more such revisits occurred with a partner. We argue that revisiting objects is not ecessarily an error, since returning to past places is an important aspect of rats' natural ehavior. Revisiting an object following food depletion implies that searching for food was ot the main driving force in the rats' spatial behavior. Specifically, despite food deprivation, ats were more attentive to one another than to the food. This could be adaptive, since foraging nd feeding in groups is a way of poison avoidance in wild rats. Finally, the addition of social component added complexity to the environment since the rats organized their spatial ehavior in reference to one another in addition to their organization in the physical surrounding. onsequently, when tested with a partner, spatial behavior was less structured, ess predictable and more chaotic. © 2016 Dorfman et al.

abstract={1. Developmental experience, for example food abundance during juvenile stages, is known to affect life history and behaviour. However, the life history and behavioural consequences of developmental experience have rarely been studied in concert. As a result, it is still unclear whether developmental experience affects behaviour through changes in life history, or independently of it. 2. The effect of developmental experience on life history and behaviour may also be masked or affected by individual condition during adulthood. Thus, it is critical to tease apart the effects of developmental experience and current individual condition on life history and behaviour. 3. In this study, we manipulated food abundance during development in the western black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, by rearing spiders on either a restricted or ad lib diet. We separated developmental from condition-dependent effects by assaying adult foraging behaviour (tendency to attack prey and to stay on out of the refuge following an attack) and web structure multiple times under different levels of satiation following different developmental treatments. 4. Spiders reared under food restriction matured slower and at a smaller size than spiders reared in ad lib conditions. Spiders reared on a restricted diet were more aggressive towards prey and built webs structured for prey capture, while spiders reared on an ad lib diet were less aggressive and built safer webs. Developmental treatment affected which traits were plastic as adults: restricted spiders built safer webs when their adult condition increased, while ad lib spiders reduced their aggression when their adult condition increased. The amount of individual variation in behaviour and web structure varied with developmental treatment. Spiders reared on a restricted diet exhibited consistent variation in all aspects of foraging behaviour and web structure, while spiders reared on an ad lib diet exhibited consistent individual variation in aggression and web weight only. 5. Developmental experience affected the average life history, behaviour and web structure of spiders, but also shaped the amount of phenotypic variation observed among individuals. Surprisingly, developmental experience also determined the particular way in which individuals plastically adjusted their behaviour and web structure to changes in adult condition. © 2016 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Information on where to find food patches, their quality, and food variance can have implications for fitness and survival when a current food patch fails. Individuals have been found to vary in their response to changes in food availability, and this has been related to several personality traits in animals such as exploration behavior that measures activity in a novel environment. We examined if personality-related variation in reactions to food availability change could be explained by information-gathering strategies (IGSs), where individuals vary in investing in sampling known patches as a trade-off to seeking new patches. We also examined if these relationships can be explained by an alternative hypothesis where individuals are expected to express variation in behavioral flexibility (BF). The BF hypothesis predicted that individuals rely more on either internal/prior or external/current information. In addition to a standardized exploration behavior test, we designed a new 5-day-long experiment where individual reactions to changes in food availability were measured using wild great tits (Parus major). We found that slow exploring individuals sampled empty food patches more than fast exploring individuals, supporting the IGS hypothesis. We found no evidence for personality-related differences in feeder choice in response to changes in food availability, nor personality-related differences in flexibility in behavioral responses. © 2016 The Author.},

abstract={Early developmental conditions can have a strong influence on the life history. Fire salamanders represent an interesting system due to their biphasic life cycle consisting of an aquatic larval stage and a subsequent terrestrial stage. The environment experienced as larvae affects growth, age at metamorphosis and behaviour. In particular, diet restrictions can cause developmental stress. However, the impact of such developmental stress on the growth and behaviour in a long-lived amphibian are not yet well studied. We manipulated the early diet of sibling pairs of fire salamander larvae. One sibling was raised under food-restriction and the other was raised under conditions of abundant food. We report long-term effects on growth and exploratory behaviour; exploratory behaviour was tested in two sessions, first as young juveniles and later as subadults. We found that food-restricted conditions during early development affected exploratory behaviour. Early deficits in body mass and body size were compensated later in life, by approximately 18 months of age. When morphological differences were compensated, the initial differences in exploratory behaviour also disappeared. Thus, compensation not only led to an alignment of body parameters but was also accompanied by an adjustment in exploratory behaviour. No cost of compensation was detected, but future research will need to verify whether the potential costs of compensation are negligible in slowgrowing salamanders or whether they are shifted to later life stages. Our study provides novel insights into the life history of fire salamanders and reveals that early larval conditions have effects on individuals long after metamorphosis. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2016.},

abstract={Movement makes prey more vulnerable to predators. Antipredator responses usually have associated costs such as reduced feeding activity, and decisions made under predation risk may be affected by the feeding state of the prey. In this study, we evaluated whether food regime influences antipredator behavioural responses of Pleurodema thaul tadpoles (diet treatment) before adding food or water (incentive treatment) while the tadpoles were exposed to alarm cues. Under predation risk, normally fed tadpoles showed decreased overall activity, whereas poorly fed tadpoles spent more time feeding after food was provided. Tadpoles in all treatments decreased their swimming activity but not their feeding activity. Our study showed that swimming behaviour was more sensitive to predation risk than feeding behaviour. We suggest that the motivational state of tadpoles under different environmental conditions should be considered when behavioural patterns are analysed to understand short-term trade-offs between foraging requirements and predator avoidance. © 2016, British Herpetological Society.

abstract={There is a growing evidence that members of animal groups synchronize their vigilance behavior to minimize predation risk. Because synchronized vigilance deviates from the classical vigilance models, which assume independent scanning, it is important to understand when and why it occurs. We explored vigilance behavior of wild boar (Sus scrofa) in a population subject to spatial variation in human hunting risk and seasonal variation in food availability. Group members synchronized their vigilance behavior. We hypothesized that vigilance synchronization would be context dependent and the trade-off between energy gain and safety would shape the relationship between the degree of vigilance synchronization and group size. We predicted weaker synchronization in large groups under heavy predation risk, due to benefits of numerical dilution, and stronger synchronization in large groups when food is limiting, due to intense food competition. The degree of synchronization decreased with increasing group size in the area where human hunting added another risk factor to the natural predation, pointing at the safety benefits of vigilance synchrony for members of small groups and the role of human-induced risk in shaping vigilance synchrony. We found no relation between vigilance synchrony and group size in a food scarce, winter season. However, low levels of vigilance and its synchronization observed in winter indicated that energy gain was prioritized over safety. Thus, members of wild boar groups can adjust levels of vigilance and its synchronization depending on the forage-risk trade-off set by the ecological context. © 2016 The Author.},

abstract={Factors such as temperature, habitat, larval density, food availability and food quality substantially affect organismal development. In addition, risk of predation has a complex impact on the behavioural and morphological life history responses of prey. Responses to predation risk seem to be mediated by physiological stress, which is an adaptation for maintaining homeostasis and improving survivorship during life-threatening situations. We tested whether predator exposure during the larval phase of development has any influence on body elemental composition, energy reserves, body size, climbing speed and survival ability of adult Drosophila melanogaster. Fruit fly larvae were exposed to predation by jumping spiders (Phidippus apacheanus), and the percentage of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content, extracted lipids, escape response and survival were measured from predator-exposed and control adult flies. The results revealed predation as an important determinant of adult phenotype formation and survival ability. D. melanogaster reared together with spiders had a higher concentration of body N (but equal body C), a lower body mass and lipid reserves, a higher climbing speed and improved adult survival ability. The results suggest that the potential of predators to affect the development and the adult phenotype of D. melanogaster is high enough to use predators as a more natural stimulus in laboratory experiments when testing, for example, fruit fly memory and learning ability, or when comparing natural populations living under different predation pressures. © 2016 Krams et al.},

abstract={Explaining the remarkable variation in socially monogamous females' extrapair (EP) behaviour revealed by decades of molecular paternity testing remains an important challenge. One hypothesis proposes that restrictive environmental conditions (e.g. extreme weather, food scarcity) limit females' resources and increase EP behaviour costs, forcing females to reduce EP reproductive behaviours. For the first time, we tested this hypothesis by directly quantifying within-pair and EP behaviours rather than inferring behaviour from paternity. We evaluated whether warmer sea surface temperatures depress total pre-laying reproductive behaviours, and particularly EP behaviours, in socially paired female blue-footed boobies (Sula nebouxii). Warm waters in the Eastern Pacific are associated with El Niño Southern Oscillation and lead to decreased food availability and reproductive success in this and other marine predators. With warmer waters, females decreased their neighbourhood attendance, total copulation frequency and laying probability, suggesting that they contend with restricted resources by prioritizing self-maintenance and committing less to reproduction, sometimes abandoning the attempt altogether. Females were also less likely to participate in EP courtship and copulations, but when they did, rates of these behaviours were unaffected by water temperature. Females' neighbourhood attendance, total copulation frequency and EP courtship probability responded to temperature differences at the between-season scale, and neighbourhood attendance and EP copulation probability were affected by within-season fluctuations. Path analysis indicated that decreased EP participation was not attributable to reduced female time available for EP activities. Together, our results suggest that immediate time and energy constraints were not the main factors limiting females' infidelity. Our study shows that El Niño conditions depress female boobies' EP participation and total reproductive activity. In addition to increasing general self-maintenance and reproductive costs, warm waters may increase costs specific to EP behaviours including divorce, reduced male parental care, or pathogen exposure. Our results suggest that female boobies strategically refrained from EP behaviours to avoid these or other longer-term costs, rather than being compelled by immediate constraints. This study demonstrates that current environmental conditions affect females' mating decisions, contributing to variation in EP behaviours, even in a long-lived, iteroparous species that can buffer against temporary adversity. © 2016 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={For ectothermic animals, selection of a suitable microhabitat is affected by a combination of abiotic and biotic factors. Also important is the trade-off between those microhabitats with optimal microclimatic conditions and food availability vs. those with the lowest level of competition and lowest risk of predation. Central European species of groundhoppers (Orthoptera: Tetrigidae) live in locations with small-scale mosaics of patches formed by bare ground, moss cushions and vascular plants (grasses and forbs). Our research focused on the effects of selected weather components (current temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure and sunlight) on specific microhabitat selection by adults (during the reproductive season) and by the last-instar nymphs (during the non-reproductive season) of the groundhopper Tetrix tenuicornis. Using experimental conditions, we determined that microhabitat use by T. tenuicornis is sex-specific and that microhabitat preference differs between adults and nymphs. We suppose that microhabitats are used according to groundhopper current needs in relation to each habitat’s suitability for maintaining body temperature, food intake and reproductive behaviour. Microhabitat preferences were significantly associated with temperature and atmospheric pressure. Changes in atmospheric pressure signal changes in weather, and insects respond to increases or decreases in pressure by adjusting their behaviour in order to enhance survival. We propose that, under low atmospheric pressure, T. tenuicornis actively seeks microhabitats that provide increased protection from adverse weather. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.},

abstract={Freshwater fishes utilising seasonally available habitats within annual migratory circuits time movements out of such habitats with changing hydrology, although individual attributes of fish may also mediate the behavioural response to environmental conditions. We tagged juvenile Arctic grayling in a seasonally flowing stream on the Arctic Coastal Plain in Alaska and recorded migration timing towards overwintering habitat. We examined the relationship between individual migration date, and fork length (FL) and body condition index (BCI) for fish tagged in June, July and August in three separate models. Larger fish migrated earlier; however, only the August model suggested a significant relationship with BCI. In this model, 42% of variability in migration timing was explained by FL and BCI, and fish in better condition were predicted to migrate earlier than those in poor condition. Here, the majority (33%) of variability was captured by FL with an additional 9% attributable to BCI. We also noted strong seasonal trends in BCI reflecting overwinter mass loss and subsequent growth within the study area. These results are interpreted in the context of size and energetic state-specific risks of overwinter starvation and mortality (which can be very high in the Arctic), which may influence individuals at greater risk to extend summer foraging in a risky, yet prey rich, habitat. Our research provides further evidence that heterogeneity among individuals within a population can influence migratory behaviour and identifies potential risks to late season migrants in Arctic beaded stream habitats influenced by climate change and petroleum development. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.},

abstract={Repeatability of behavioural and physiological traits is increasingly a focus for animal researchers, for which fish have become important models. Almost all of this work has been done in the context of evolutionary ecology, with few explicit attempts to apply repeatability and context dependency of trait variation toward understanding conservation-related issues. Here, we review work examining the degree to which repeatability of traits (such as boldness, swimming performance, metabolic rate and stress responsiveness) is context dependent. We review methods for quantifying repeatability (distinguishing between within-context and across-context repeatability) and confounding factors that may be especially problematic when attempting to measure repeatability in wild fish. Environmental factors such temperature, food availability, oxygen availability, hypercapnia, flow regime and pollutants all appear to alter trait repeatability in fishes. This suggests that anthropogenic environmental change could alter evolutionary trajectories by changing which individuals achieve the greatest fitness in a given set of conditions. Gaining a greater understanding of these effects will be crucial for our ability to forecast the effects of gradual environmental change, such as climate change and ocean acidification, the study of which is currently limited by our ability to examine trait changes over relatively short time scales. Also discussed are situations in which recent advances in technologies associated with electronic tags (biotelemetry and biologging) and respirometry will help to facilitate increased quantification of repeatability for physiological and integrative traits, which so far lag behind measures of repeatability of behavioural traits. © The Author 2016.},

abstract={Individuals at the forefront of a range shift are likely to exhibit phenotypic traits that distinguish them from the population breeding within the historic range. Recent studies have examined morphological, physiological and behavioral phenotypes of individuals at the edge of their range. Several studies have found differences in the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activity in response to acute restraint stress in individuals at the range limits. HPA axis activation leads to elevations in glucocorticoids that regulate physiology and behavior. Here we compare the hormonal profiles and morphometrics from Gambel’s white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii) breeding at the northern limit of the population’s range to those birds breeding within the historic population range. Birds breeding at the northern limit experienced a harsher environment with colder temperatures; however, we found no differences in arthropod prey biomass between the northern limit and more southern (historic) sites. Males at the northern limit had higher body condition scores (mass corrected for body size) compared to individuals within the historic range, but no differences were found in beak and tarsus lengths, wing chord, muscle profile or fat stores. In males during the pre-parental stage, before breeding commenced, HPA axis activity was elevated in birds at the northern limit of the range, but no differences were found during the parental or molt stages. Females showed no differences in HPA axis activity during the parental stage. This study suggests that “pioneering” individuals at the limits of their breeding range exhibit physiology and morphology that are distinct from individuals within the historic range. © 2015, The Author(s).},

abstract={Recent reports in human demonstrate a role of theta-gamma coupling in memory for spatial episodes and a lack of coupling in people experiencing temporal lobe epilepsy, but the mechanisms are unknown. Using multisite silicon probe recordings of epileptic rats engaged in episodic-like object recognition tasks, we sought to evaluate the role of theta-gamma coupling in the absence of epileptiform activities. Our data reveal a specific association between theta-gamma (30-60 Hz) coupling at the proximal stratum radiatum of CA1 and spatial memory deficits. We targeted the microcircuit mechanisms with a novel approach to identify putative interneuronal types in tetrode recordings (parvalbumin basket cells in particular) and validated classification criteria in the epileptic context with neurochemical identification of intracellularly recorded cells. In epileptic rats, putative parvalbumin basket cells fired poorly modulated at the falling theta phase, consistent with weaker inputs from Schaffer collaterals and attenuated gamma oscillations, as evaluated by theta-phase decomposition of current-source density signals. We propose that theta-gamma interneuronal rhythmopathies of the temporal lobe are intimately related to episodic memory dysfunction in this condition. © 2016 Lopez-Pigozzi et al.},

abstract={There is a strong inter-relationship between activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and energy homeostasis. Patients with abdominal obesity have elevated cortisol levels. Furthermore, stress and glucocorticoids act to control both food intake and energy expenditure. In particular, glucocorticoids are known to increase the consumption of foods enriched in fat and sugar. It is well-known that, in all species, the cortisol response to stress or adrenocorticotropin is highly variable. It has now emerged that cortisol responsiveness is an important determinant in the metabolic sequelae to stress. Sheep that are characterized as high-cortisol responders (HRs) have greater propensity to weight gain and obesity than low-cortisol responders (LRs). This difference in susceptibility to become obese is associated with a distinct metabolic, neuroendocrine, and behavioral phenotype. In women and ewes, HR individuals eat more in response to stress than LR. Furthermore, HR sheep have impaired melanocortin signaling and reduced skeletal muscle thermogenesis. High-cortisol responder sheep exhibit reactive coping strategies, whereas LRs exhibit proactive coping strategies. This complex set of traits leads to increased food intake and reduced energy expenditure in HR and thus, predisposition to obesity. We predict that cortisol responsiveness may be used as a marker to identify individuals who are at risk of weight gain and subsequent obesity. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Past risk-sensitive foraging studies commonly manipulated delay to reward and reward magnitude, but recent risk-sensitive foraging research revealed that changes in reward quality resulted in changes in a forager's preference for a variable or fixed return. However, no studies have investigated the effects of changes in reward quality and delay to reward on risk sensitivity. Therefore, the current experiment was designed to explore rats' preference for a variable or fixed option when delay to reward and reward quality were manipulated. Using a within-subjects, ABACADA design, rats (. N=. 10) choose between a variable and constant option that delivered six food pellets but the amount of sugar (i.e. reward quality) and delay to reward differed per condition. In each baseline condition, pellets were 100% sugar and delivered after a 2. s mean delay. Subjects displayed a significant preference for the variable option in all baseline conditions. In condition B, pellets were 20% sugar, delivered after a 2. s mean delay, and rats were risk indifferent. In condition C, rats displayed a significant preference for the variable option when delay was 10. s and reward quality was 100%. Finally, in condition D, subjects showed the strongest variable option responses among all treatments when both reward quality and delay to reward were manipulated (i.e. 20% sugar pellets and 10. s mean delay). Preference was assessed relative to the daily energy budget rule, the scalar utility theory and the sequential choice model. The sequential choice model provided the most comprehensive and accurate prediction of subjects' preferences. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={There is increasing interest in documenting and explaining the existence of marked intraspecific variation in metabolic rate in animals, with fishes providing some of the best-studied examples. After accounting for variation due to other factors, there can typically be a two to three-fold variation among individual fishes for both standard and maximum metabolic rate (SMR and MMR). This variation is reasonably consistent over time (provided that conditions remain stable), and its underlying causes may be influenced by both genes and developmental conditions. In this paper, current knowledge of the extent and causes of individual variation in SMR, MMR and aerobic scope (AS), collectively its metabolic phenotype, is reviewed and potential links among metabolism, behaviour and performance are described. Intraspecific variation in metabolism has been found to be related to other traits: fishes with a relatively high SMR tend to be more dominant and grow faster in high food environments, but may lose their advantage and are more prone to risk-taking when conditions deteriorate. In contrast to the wide body of research examining links between SMR and behavioural traits, very little work has been directed towards understanding the ecological consequences of individual variation in MMR and AS. Although AS can differ among populations of the same species in response to performance demands, virtually nothing is known about the effects of AS on individual behaviours such as those associated with foraging or predator avoidance. Further, while factors such as food availability, temperature, hypoxia and the fish's social environment are known to alter resting and MMRs in fishes, there is a paucity of studies examining how these effects vary among individuals, and how this variation relates to behaviour. Given the observed links between metabolism and measures of performance, understanding the metabolic responses of individuals to changing environments will be a key area for future research because the environment will have a strong influence on which animals survive predation, become dominant and ultimately have the highest reproductive success. Although current evidence suggests that variation in SMR may be maintained within populations via context-dependent fitness benefits, it is suggested that a more integrative approach is now required to fully understand how the environment can modulate individual performance via effects on metabolic phenotypes encompassing SMR, MMR and AS. © 2016 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

abstract={Food choice has profound implications for the relative intakes of water and salts, and thus for an animal's physiological state. Discrimination behaviors with respect salt intake have been documented in a number of vertebrate species, but few studies have considered the ecological context in which they occur. Here, we report on the results of a 2-choice experiment designed to examine the influence of dietary salt content and freshwater availability in food discrimination behaviors in red knots Calidris canutus (Aves: Scolopacidae) that feed on mud snails Peringia ulvae (Gastropoda: Hydrobiidae) whose body fluids have either relatively low (25%) or high (42%) salinity. Birds ate more and spent longer time foraging on low-salinity mud snails when their salt gland sizes-an indicator of excretory capacity-were relatively small and when they were deprived of freshwater. However, as they enlarged salt glands-following a prolonged exposure to salty diet without access to freshwater-and regained access to freshwater, their preference for lowsalinity prey disappeared. Such a change of preference illustrates the context dependency of discrimination. As the birds were able to maintain salt-water balance-inferred from plasma sodium concentration-under all conditions, changes in salinity preferences may occur without measurable physiological signs of osmotic stress. Our results highlight the importance of ecological context for understanding foraging responses. We argue that areas with high salinities could act as refuges for euryhaline invertebrates and fish from top vertebrate predators. © The Author 2015.

abstract={Although the evolutionary mechanisms that favor investment in cooperative behaviors have long been a focus of research, comparatively few studies have considered the role that sexual selection may play. For example, evolutionary explanations for sentinel behavior (where 1 individual assumes an elevated position and scans the surroundings while other group members forage nearby) have traditionally focused on the inclusive fitness benefits arising from its effects on predation risk, while its potential role in defense against intrasexual competitors remains largely unexplored. Here, we provide experimental evidence of a role for sentinel behavior in intrasexual competition, in a cooperatively breeding songbird, the white-browed sparrow weaver (Plocepasser mahali). First, dominant males sentinel substantially more than other group members (even when controlling for variation in age and body condition), consistent with a role for sentineling in intrasexual competition for mates and/or territory. Second, experimental playback of an unfamiliar male's solo song elicited a marked increase in sentineling by the dominant male, and the vocal response to the playback also positively predicted his sentinel effort following the simulated intrusion. A second experiment also suggests that sentineling may facilitate mounting rapid anti-intruder responses, as responses to intruder-playback occurred significantly earlier when the dominant male was sentineling rather than foraging at playback onset. Together, our findings provide rare support for the hypothesis that sentinel behavior plays a role in intrasexual competition, and so highlight the potential for sexually selected direct benefits to shape its expression in this and other social vertebrates. © 2016 The Author.},

abstract={Habitat heterogeneity can promote coexistence between herbivores of different body size limited to different extents by resource quantity and quality. Red deer (Cervus elaphus) are known as superior competitors to smaller species with similar diets. We compared competitive interactions and habitat use between red deer and Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) in two adjacent valleys in a strictly protected area in the Central Alps. Red deer density was higher in the valley with higher primary productivity. Only here was horn growth in kid and yearling chamois (as a measure for body condition) negatively correlated with red deer population size, suggesting interspecific competition, and chamois selected meadows with steeper slopes and lower productivity than available on average. Conversely, red deer selected meadows of high productivity, particularly in the poorer area. As these were located mainly at lower elevations, this led to strong altitudinal segregation between the two species here. Local differences in interspecific competition thus coincided with differences in habitat preference and-segregation between areas. This suggests that spatial habitat and resource heterogeneity at the scale of adjacent valleys can provide competition refuges for competitively inferior mountain ungulates which differ from their superior competitor in their metabolic requirements. © 2016 Anderwald et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.},

abstract={Variation in personality traits is predicted to reflect physiology, but the extent to which variations in stress hormones derive from differences in personality and/or state-dependent factors remains unclear. To investigate this, wild blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) were briefly brought into captivity and scored for personality and corticosterone (Cort) concentrations. More active females had lower baseline Cort than less active individuals. Exploratory tendency and neophobia did not co-vary with baseline Cort. Stress-induced Cort concentrations were correlated negatively with exploratory tendency and haematocrit, but positively with mass gain in captivity. Therefore, baseline and stress-induced Cort concentrations in wintering blue tits were associated with state-dependent variables, sex, age and personality traits. Key to interpreting the physiology of personality traits seems to be their interactions with other traits that mediate ability to utilise resources, and thus influence an individual's perception of its current and future energy balance. © 2016 Copyright 2016 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.},

abstract={Inducible defenses are a common phenotypically plastic response to a heterogeneous predation risk. Once induced, these defenses cannot only lose their benefit, but even become costly, should the predator disappear. Consequently, some organisms have developed the ability to reverse their defensive traits. However, despite extensive research on inducible defenses, reports on reversibility are rare and mostly concentrate on defensive behavior. In our study, we investigated the reversibility of morphological defenses in the freshwater crustacean Daphnia barbata. This species responds to Notonecta glauca and Triops cancriformis with two distinctively defended morphotypes. Within the numerous defensive traits, we found both trait- and predator-specific reversibility. Body torsion and tail-spine-related traits were highly reversible, whereas helmet-related traits remained stable, suggesting different physiological constraints. However, in general, we found the defenses against Triops mostly reversible, while Notonecta-induced defenses were persistent and grew further, even in the absence of a predator. © The Author 2016.

abstract={This article shows how an interaction between economic constraints and children's taste preferences shapes low-income families' food decisions. According to studies of eating behavior, children often refuse unfamiliar foods 8 to 15 times before accepting them. Using 80 interviews and 41 grocery-shopping observations with 73 primary caregivers in the Boston area in 2013-2015, I find that many low-income respondents minimize the risk of food waste by purchasing what their children like-often calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods. High-income study participants, who have greater resources to withstand the cost of uneaten food, are more likely to repeatedly introduce foods that their children initially refuse. Several conditions moderate the relationship between children's taste aversion and respondents' risk aversion, including household-level food preferences, respondents' conceptions of adult authority, and children's experiences outside of the home. Low-income participants' risk aversion may affect children's taste acquisition and eating habits, with implications for socioeconomic disparities in diet quality. This article proposes that the cost of providing children a healthy diet may include the possible cost of foods that children waste as they acquire new tastes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={There is increasing evidence that chronic noise stress impairs cognition and induces oxidative stress in the brain. Recently, orientin, a phenolic compound abundant in some fruits, millet, and herbs, has been shown to have antioxidant properties. This study investigated the potential effects of orientin against chronic noise-induced cognitive decline and its underlying mechanisms. A moderate-intensity noise exposure model was used to investigate the effects of orientin on behavior and biochemical alterations in mice. After 3 weeks of the noise exposure, the mice were treated with orientin (20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg, oral gavage) for 3 weeks. The chronic noise exposure impaired the learning and memory in mice in the Morris water maze and step-through tests. The noise exposure also decreased exploration and interest in a novel environment in the open field test. The administration of orientin significantly reversed noise-induced alterations in these behavior tests. Moreover, the orientin treatment significantly improved the noise-induced alteration of serum corticosterone and catecholamine levels and oxidative stress in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, the orientin treatment ameliorated the noise-induced decrease in brain-derived neurotrophic factor and synapse-associated proteins (synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95) in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Thus, orientin exerts protective effects on noise-induced cognitive decline in mice, specifically by improving central oxidative stress, neurotransmission, and increases synapse-associated proteins. Therefore, supplementation with orientin-enriched food or fruit could be beneficial as a preventive strategy for chronic noise-induced cognitive decline. © 2015.},

abstract={Background. A large proportion of natural grasslands around the world is exposed to overgrazing resulting in land degradation and biodiversity loss. Although there is an increasing effort in the promotion of sustainable livestock management, rangeland degradation still occurs because animals' foraging behaviour is highly selective at different spatial scales. The assessment of the ecological mechanisms modulating the spatial distribution of grazing and how to control it has critical implications for long term conservation of resources and the sustainability of livestock production. Considering the relevance of social interactions on animals' space use patterns, our aim was to explore the potential effects of including animals' social context into management strategies using domestic sheep grazing in rangelands as case study. Methods. We used GPS data from 19 Merino sheep (approximately 10% of the flock) grazing on three different paddocks (with sizes from 80 to 1000 Ha) during a year, to estimate resource selection functions of sheep grazing in flocks of different levels of heterogeneity. We assessed the effects of sheep class (i.e., ewes, wethers, and hoggets), age, body condition and time since release on habitat selection patterns. Results. We found that social rank was reflected on sheep habitat use, where dominant individuals (i.e., reproductive females) used more intensively the most preferred areas and low-ranked (i.e., yearlings) used less preferred areas. Our results showed that when sheep grazed on more heterogeneous flocks, grazing patterns were more evenly distributed at all the paddocks considered in this study. On the other hand, when high-ranked individuals were removed from the flock, low-ranked sheep shifted their selection patterns by increasing the use of the most preferred areas and strongly avoided to use less preferred sites (i.e., a highly selective grazing behaviour). Discussion. Although homogenization and segregation of flocks by classes are common practices to increase flock productivity, we are proposing an alternative that employs behavioural interactions in heterogeneous flocks to generate more evenly distributed grazing patterns. This practice can be combined with other practices such as rotational grazing and guardian dogs (to decrease mortality levels that may be generated by sheep grazing on more risky habitats). This does not imply any modifications of livestock stocking rates and densities or any additional investments for labour and materials. Considering livestock behaviour is critical for the design of sustainable management practices that balance landscape conservation and livestock productivity. © 2016 di Virgilio and Morales.},

abstract={Leishmaniasis affects different species of domestic and wild animals, being the canines its main reservoir. In Corrientes (Argentina), a high incidence of canine visceral leishmaniasis is registered, with risk for the public health. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the in vivo effect of diminazine, associated with allopurinol and levamisole, as antileishmanial hamster treatment, in order to use these treatment as a therapeutic alternative for the control and possible eradication of leishmaniasis in dogs. Tree groups were formed with 26 hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) two months old, both sexes, 60 g weight, which were divided into four lots, two batches of 6 individuals each, and two batches of 7 individuals each. Animals from lots 1 and 3 were inoculated intraperitoneally (1 ml/animal) with a macerated spleen removed from a dog naturally infected with Leishmania chagasi. Lot 3 group 1 animals were treated with diminazine; group 2 lot 3 animals were treated with allopurinol and diminazine, and group 3 lot 3 were treated with diminazine, allopurinol and levamisole. Starting from 70 days of the beginning of inoculations, euthanasias were carried out on two animals from each batch and group every 30 days, so that the animals with 30, 60 and 90 days of treatment could be investigated. Medicated-infected rodents showed fewer symptoms and better overall welfare, as evidenced by their normal state of the hair coat, good body condition, maintaining the eating habits and behavior, in contrast to the animals inoculated with L. chagasi without treatment. It is conclude that the isolated use of diminazine (leishmanicidal) produced the same protective effect (diminishing the symptomatology caused by L. chagasi) that when being associated with allopurinol (leishmaniostatic) and levamisol (immunomodulator), although none of the rehearsed treatments obtained the parasitological cure, since the presence of the parasites persisted.},

abstract={Increasing evidence that the maternal environment influences the programming of developing embryos and fetuses through epigenetic mechanisms has significant potential application in the broiler industry. The broiler breeder hen is subjected to restricted-feeding regimes to maximise egg quantity and quality, but the genetically high-intake potential of these birds makes this regime a stressful one. We propose that this stress is signalled to the developing embryo via changes in yolk composition as an evolutionary adaptation to changing environments, and that exposure to high levels of corticosteroids in ovo is associated with developmental reprogramming, which has effects on the behaviour, health and growth of the progeny. The present paper describes some preliminary results from a series of trials designed to elucidate the relationship between breeder hen diet and egg composition, and the growth, behaviour and immune function of the progeny. We conclude that manipulation of the breeder hen diet is an untapped opportunity to maintain the competitiveness of the chicken meat industry and further, that achieving improved productivity by this means may be compatible with improved animal welfare outcomes for the hen and her progeny. © CSIRO 2016.},

abstract={Avian communities of arid ecosystems may be particularly vulnerable to global climate change due to the magnitude of projected change for desert regions and the inherent challenges for species residing in resource limited ecosystems. How arid-zone birds will be affected by rapid increases in air temperature and increased drought frequency and severity is poorly understood because avian responses to climate change have primarily been studied in the relatively mesic northern temperate regions. We studied the effects of increasing air temperature and aridity on a Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) population in the southwestern United States from 1998 to 2013. Over 16 years, the breeding population declined 98.1%, from 52 pairs to 1 pair, and nest success and fledgling output also declined significantly. These trends were strongly associated with the combined effects of decreased precipitation and increased air temperature. Arrival on the breeding grounds, pair formation, nest initiation, and hatch dates all showed significant delays ranging from 9.4 to 25.1 days over 9 years, which have negative effects on reproduction. Adult and juvenile body mass decreased significantly over time, with a loss of 7.9% mass in adult males and 10.9% mass in adult females over 16 years, and a loss of 20.0% mass in nestlings over 8 years. Taken together, these population and reproductive trends have serious implications for local population persistence. The southwestern United States has been identified as a climate change hotspot, with projections of warmer temperatures, less winter precipitation, and an increase in frequency and severity of extreme events including drought and heat waves. An increasingly warm and dry climate may contribute to this species' decline and may already be a driving force of their apparent decline in the desert southwest. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Objective: To describe the prescribing habits of a sample of small animal veterinarians pertaining to use of fluoxetine in dogs and cats. Design: Exploratory descriptive survey using a questionnaire, available on paper and through email, distributed to small animal veterinarians by convenience sampling. Participants: Veterinarians practicing small animal medicine in North America contacted by email and at local veterinary meetings. Results: Of 127 initial respondents, 106 prescribed fluoxetine for dogs and/or cats. The majority (91 per cent) indicated the drug be given once every 24 hours. Respondents used one or more formulations of fluoxetine. Of those who prescribed fluoxetine for both dogs and cats (57 per cent), 80 per cent used a generic form. A third prescribed fluoxetine only for dogs (31 per cent) and 72 per cent of these prescribed the US Food and Drug Administration approved product that was available at that time. The primary use of fluoxetine was related to behaviour problems. Overall for dogs, uses of fluoxetine were organised into five major categories by the investigators: Anxieties, Aggression, Compulsive Disorders, Phobias/Fear and Other, Anxieties being the most common. Of those who prescribed fluoxetine, 12 per cent did so only for cats and the majority of these prescribed generic (58 per cent) and or compounded (42 per cent) forms. Overall for cats, uses of fluoxetine were organised into six major categories: Elimination behaviours, Anxieties, Aggression, Dermatologic/Grooming, Compulsive Disorders and Other, Elimination behaviours being most common. Conclusions: This study indicates that practitioners prescribed fluoxetine in generic, proprietary and compounded formulations for a variety of behaviour problems of dogs and cats. The broad use by the respondents suggests how important psychotropic drugs are in veterinary medicine. Research, information and continuing education regarding such drugs and animal behaviour should be made available to the general practitioner. © 2016 Veterinary Record Open. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The success of new food technologies largely depends on consumers' behavioral responses to the innovation. In Eastern Africa, and Uganda in particular, a technology to process matooke into flour has been introduced with limited success. We measure and apply the Food technology Neophobia Scale (FTNS) to this specific case. This technique has been increasingly used in consumer research to determine consumers' fear for foods produced by novel technologies. Although it has been successful in developed countries, the low number and limited scope of past studies underlines the need for testing its applicability in a developing country context. Data was collected from 209 matooke consumers from Central Uganda. In general, respondents are relatively neophobic towards the new technology, with an average FTNS score of 58.7%, which hampers the success of processed matooke flour. Besides socio-demographic indicators, 'risk perception', 'healthiness' and the 'necessity of technologies' were key factors that influenced consumer's preference of processed matooke flour. Benchmarking the findings against previous FTNS surveys allows to evaluate factor solutions, compare standardized FTNS scores and further lends support for the multidimensionality of the FTNS. Being the first application in a developing country context, this study provides a case for examining food technology neophobia for processed staple crops in various regions and cultures. Nevertheless, research is needed to replicate this method and evaluate the external validity of our findings. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Bean consumption can reduce chronic disease risk and improve nutrition status. Consumer knowledge of bean health benefits could lead to increased intakes. Low-income women have poorer health and nutrition, but their level of knowledge about bean health benefits is unknown. Beans are a familiar food of reasonable cost in most settings and are cultural staples for Hispanics and other ethnicities. Study objectives were to assess awareness of bean health benefits among low-income women, and to evaluate any differences by acculturation status for Hispanic women in the Southwestern United States. Methods: A convenience sample of 406 primarily Mexican-origin (70%) low-income women completed a survey on knowledge of bean health benefits and general food behaviors. Principal components analysis of responses identified two summary scale constructs representing "bean health benefits" and "food behaviors." Acculturation level was the main independent variable in chi-square or ANOVA. Results: The survey completion rate was 86% (406/471). Most women agreed or strongly agreed that beans improved nutrition (65%) and were satiating (62%). Over 50% answered 'neutral' to statements that beans could lower LDL cholesterol (52%), control blood glucose (56%) or reduce cancer risk (56%), indicating indifference or possible lack of knowledge about bean health benefits. There were significant differences by acculturation for beliefs that beans aid weight loss and intestinal health. Scores on the bean health benefits scale, but not the food behavior scale, also differed by acculturation. Conclusions: Limited resource women have a favorable view of the nutrition value of beans, but the majority did not agree or disagreed with statements about bean health benefits. Greater efforts to educate low-income women about bean health benefits may increase consumption and improve nutrition. © 2016 Winham et al.

abstract={Rationale: Clinical studies have shown that patients with exaggerated risk-taking tendencies have high baseline levels of norepinephrine. In this work, we systemically manipulated norepinephrine levels in rats and studied their behavioral changes in a probabilistic discounting task, which is a paradigm for gauging risk taking. Methods: This study aims to explore the effects of the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (atomoxetine at doses of 0.6, 1.0 and 1.8 mg/kg), and receptor selective antagonists (propranolol at a single dose of 1.0/kg, and prazosin at a single dose of 0.1 mg/kg), on risk taking using a probabilistic discounting task. In this task, there were two levers available to rats: pressing the 'small/certain' lever guaranteed a single food pellet, and pressing the 'large/risky' lever yielded either four pellets or none. The probability of receiving four food pellets decreased across the four experimental blocks from 100% to 12.5%. Results: Atomoxetine increased the tendency to choose the large/risky lever. It significantly reduced the lose-shift effect (i.e. pressing a different lever after losing a trial), but did not affect the win-stay effect (i.e. pressing the same lever after winning a trial). Furthermore, co-administration of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist, propranolol, eliminated the effects of atomoxetine on risk taking and the lose-shift effect; but co-administration of alpha1-adrenoreceptor antagonist, prazosin, did not. Conclusions: Atomoxetine boosted NE levels and increased risk taking. This was because atomoxetine decreased rats' sensitivity to losses. These effects were likely mediated by beta-adrenoreceptor. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Threat-sensitive behavioral trade-offs allow prey animals to balance the conflicting demands of successful predator detection and avoidance and a suite of fitness-related activities such as foraging, mating, and territorial defense. Here, we test the hypothesis that background predation level and reproductive status interact to determine the form and intensity of threat-sensitive behavioral decisions of wild-caught female Trinidadian guppies Poecilia reticulata. Gravid and nongravid guppies collected from high- and low-predation pressure populations were exposed to serial dilutions of conspecific chemical alarm cues. Our results demonstrate that there was 'no effect of reproductive status on the response of females originating from a low-predation population, with both gravid and nongravid guppies exhibiting strong anti-predator responses to the lowest concentration of alarm cues tested. Increasing cue concentrations did not result in increases in response intensity. Conversely, we found a significant effect of reproductive status among guppies from a highpredation population. Nongravid females from the high-predation population exhibited a strong graded (proportional) response to increasing concentrations of alarm cue. Gravid females from the same high-predation population, however, shifted to a nongraded response. Together, these results demonstrate that accrued reproductive assets influence the threat-sensitive behavioral decisions of prey, but only under conditions of high-ambient predation risk. © The Author (2016).},

abstract={Prey use chemical cues from predation events to obtain information about predation risk to alter their phenotypes. Though we know how many prey respond to predators, we still have a poor understanding of the processes and chemical cues involved during a predation event. We examined how gray treefrog tadpoles (Hyla versicolor) altered their behavior and morphology when raised with cues from different stages of predator attack, predators fed different amounts of prey, and predators consuming different combinations of treefrog tadpoles or snails (Helisoma trivolvis). We found that starved predators and predators fed snails induced no defensive responses whereas tadpoles exposed to a predator consuming gray treefrogs induced greater hiding, lower activity, and relatively deeper tails. We also found that the tadpoles did not respond to crushed, chewed, or digested conspecifics, but they did respond to consumed (i.e., chewed plus digested) conspecifics. When we increased the treefrog biomass consumed by predators, tadpoles frequently increased their defenses when only tadpoles were consumed and always increased their defenses when the total diet biomass was held constant via the inclusion of snails. When predators experienced temporal variation in diet composition, including cues from snails to cause additional digestive cues or chemical noise, there was no effect on tadpole phenotypes. Our results suggest that amphibian prey rely on cues from both chewing and digestion of conspecifics and that the presence of cues from digested heterospecifics play little or no role in adding chemical noise or increased digestive enzymes and by-products that could potentially interfere with induced defenses. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Neurovascular integrity plays an important role in protecting cognitive and mental health in aging. Lifestyle interventions that sustain neurovascular integrity may thus be critical on preserving brain functions in aging and reducing the risk for age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Here we show that caloric restriction (CR) had an early effect on neurovascular enhancements, and played a critical role in preserving vascular, cognitive and mental health in aging. In particular, we found that CR significantly enhanced cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood-brain barrier function in young mice at 5-6 months of age. The neurovascular enhancements were associated with reduced mammalian target of rapamycin expression, elevated endothelial nitric oxide synthase signaling, and increased ketone bodies utilization. With age, CR decelerated the rate of decline in CBF. The preserved CBF in hippocampus and frontal cortex were highly correlated with preserved memory and learning, and reduced anxiety, of the aging mice treated with CR (18-20 months of age). Our results suggest that dietary intervention started in the early stage (e.g., young adults) may benefit cognitive and mental reserve in aging. Understanding nutritional effects on neurovascular functions may have profound implications in human brain aging and age-related neurodegenerative disorders.},

abstract={Animals reduce their exposure to predation often at the cost of nutritional inputs. A variety of predator avoidance strategies exist, but species generally exist along a spectrum with some primarily utilizing behavioral responses to avoid predation and others relying more on morphological defenses to deter predation. North American porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) possess a well-developed predator deterrent strategy (i.e., quills). During the winter, porcupines enter a nutritional bottleneck where they principally rely on endogenous stores to survive winter. We hypothesized that porcupine behavior in winter would, then, be primarily driven by nutritional demands rather than predation risk. To test this trade-off between perceived risk of predation and nutritional stress, we analyzed the length and sinuosity of movement patterns, relative to nutritional condition (urinary urea: creatinine), snow conditions (depth, density), and a risk landscape (predation risk and refuges). As predicted, the sinuosity of movement paths was unrelated to any of our variables, but we detected a strong correlation between lengths of movements with risk landscape. Specifically, the length of porcupine movement declined as the average risk of predation increased, and the presence of refuge trees in their movement path was positively related to path length. Thus, even for animals possessing extreme morphological defenses effective at deterring predation, and during a period of nutritional stress, movement and behavior are nevertheless driven by perceived predation risk. © The Author 2015.

abstract={Obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are associated with decreased cognitive function. While weight loss and T2D remission result in improvements in metabolism and vascular function, it is less clear if these benefits extend to cognitive performance. Here, we highlight the malleable nature of MetS-associated cognitive dysfunction using a mouse model of high fat diet (HFD)-induced MetS. While learning and memory was generally unaffected in mice with type 1 diabetes (T1D), multiple cognitive impairments were associated with MetS, including deficits in novel object recognition, cued fear memory, and spatial learning and memory. However, a brief reduction in dietary fat content in chronic HFD-fed mice led to a complete rescue of cognitive function. Cerebral blood volume (CBV), a measure of vascular perfusion, was decreased during MetS, was associated with long term memory, and recovered following the intervention. Finally, repeated infusion of plasma collected from age-matched, low fat diet-fed mice improved memory in HFD mice, and was associated with a distinct metabolic profile. Thus, the cognitive dysfunction accompanying MetS appears to be amenable to treatment, related to cerebrovascular function, and mitigated by systemic factors. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={The prevalence of childhood obesity has increased globally over the past three decades, with evidence of recent leveling off in developed countries. Reduction in the, currently high, prevalence of obesity will require a full understanding of the biological and social pathways to obesity in order to develop appropriately targeted prevention strategies in early life. Determinants of childhood obesity include individual level factors, including biological, social, and behavioral risks, acting within the influence of the child's family environment, which is, in turn, imbedded in the context of the community environment. These influences act across childhood, with suggestions of early critical periods of biological and behavioral plasticity. There is evidence of sex and gender differences in the responses of boys and girls to their environments. The evidence that determinants of childhood obesity act at many levels and at different stages of childhood is of policy relevance to those planning early health promotion and primary prevention programs as it suggests the need to address the individual, the family, the physical environment, the social environment, and social policy. The purpose of this narrative review is to summarize current, and emerging, literature in a multilevel, life course framework. © 2016 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.},

A survey study was conducted on the housing and management practices used for cats by students, faculty, and staff of The Ohio State University and Purdue University veterinary colleges. Subjects were 138 cat-owner dyads. Most cats (74%) were housed strictly indoors in keeping with common US veterinary recommendations. However, many did not implement best practices outlined for behavior and other welfare needs of indoor cats. The percentage of respondents placing resources where cats could be disrupted while using them was 31%, 53%, and 30% for resting areas, food/water dishes, and litter boxes, respectively. Many cats were not provided a litter box in a private area (35%), in multiple areas of the house (51%), or that was regularly washed (73%). Horizontal scratching opportunities were not provided to 38% of cats; 32% were not provided toys that mimic prey and 91% of cats were fed a diet consisting of >75% dry food. These findings suggest a need for more concerted efforts to educate owners about meeting their cats' welfare needs so as to attenuate risks and improve cat physical and behavioral welfare outcomes. © 2016 Judith L.

abstract={Kindling is a phenomenon of activity-dependent neural circuit plasticity induced by repeated seizures that results in progressive permanent increases in susceptibility to epilepsy. As the permanent structural and functional modifications induced by kindling include a diverse range of molecular, cellular, and functional alterations in neural circuits, it is of interest to determine if genetic background associated with seizure-induced plasticity might also influence plasticity in neural circuitry underlying other behaviors. Outbred Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were selected and bred for ~. 15 generations for "fast' or "slow" rates of kindling development in response to stimulation of the perforant path input to the hippocampus. After 7-8 generations of selection and breeding, consistent phenotypes of "fast" and "slow" kindling rates were observed. By the 15th generation "fast" kindling rats referred to as Perforant Path Kindling Susceptible (PPKS) rats demonstrated a kindling rate of 10.7. ±. 1.1 afterdischarges (ADs) to the milestone of the first secondary generalized (Class V) seizure, which differed significantly from "slow" kindling Perforant Path Kindling Resistant (PPKR) rats requiring 25.5. ±. 2.0 ADs, and outbred SD rats requiring 16.8. ±. 2.5 ADs (p. <. 0.001, ANOVA). Seizure-naïve adult PPKS and PPKR rats from offspring of this generation and age-matched adult outbred SD rats were compared in validated behavioral measures including the open field test as a measure of exploratory activity, the Morris water maze as a measure of hippocampal spatial memory, and fear conditioning as a behavioral paradigm of associative fear learning. The PPKS ("fast" kindling) strain with increased susceptibility to seizure-induced plasticity demonstrated statistically significant increases in motor exploratory activity in the open field test and reduced spatial learning the Morris water maze, but demonstrated normal fear conditioned learning comparable to outbred SD rats and the "slow" kindling-resistant PPKR strain. These results confirm that selection and breeding on the basis of responses to repeated pathway activation by stimulation can produce enduring modification of genetic background influencing behavior. These observations also suggest that genetic background underlying susceptibility or resistance to seizure-induced plasticity in hippocampal circuitry also differentially influences distinct behaviors and learning that depend on circuitry activated by the kindling selection process, and may have implications for associations between epilepsy, comorbid behavioral conditions, and cognition. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: Early-life iron deficiency is a common nutrient deficiency worldwide. Maternal iron deficiency increases the risk of schizophrenia and autism in the offspring. Postnatal iron deficiency in young children results in cognitive and socioemotional abnormalities in adulthood despite iron treatment. The rat model of diet-induced fetal-neonatal iron deficiency recapitulates the observed neurobehavioral deficits. Objectives: We sought to establish molecular underpinnings for the persistent psychopathologic effects of early-life iron deficiency by determining whether it permanently reprograms the hippocampal transcriptome. We also assessed the effects of maternal dietary choline supplementation on the offspring's hippocampal transcriptome to identify pathways through which choline mitigates the emergence of long-term cognitive deficits. Methods: Male rat pups were made iron deficient (ID) by providing pregnant and nursing dams an ID diet (4 g Fe/kg) from gestational day (G) 2 through postnatal day (PND) 7 and an iron-sufficient (IS) diet (200 g Fe/kg) thereafter. Control pups were provided IS diet throughout. Choline (5 g/kg) was given to half the pregnant dams in each group from G11 to G18. PND65 hippocampal transcriptomes were assayed by next generation sequencing (NGS) and analyzed with the use of knowledgebased Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Real-time polymerase chain reactionwas performed to validate a subset of altered genes. Results: Formerly ID rats had altered hippocampal expression of 619 from >10,000 gene loci sequenced by NGS, many of which map onto molecular networks implicated in psychological disorders, including anxiety, autism, and schizophrenia. There were significant interactions between iron status and prenatal choline treatment in influencing gene expression. Choline supplementation reduced the effects of iron deficiency, including those on gene networks associated with autism and schizophrenia. Conclusions: Fetal-neonatal iron deficiency reprograms molecular networks associated with the pathogenesis of neurologic and psychological disorders in adult rats. The positive response to prenatal choline represents a potential adjunctive therapeutic supplement to the high-risk group.},

abstract={Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is an important disease of cattle caused by infection with Mycobacterium bovis, a pathogen that may be extremely difficult to eradicate in the presence of a true wildlife reservoir. Our objective was to identify and review relevant literature and provide a succinct summary of current knowledge of risk factors for transmission of infection of cattle. Search strings were developed to identify publications from electronic databases to February 2015. Abstracts of 4255 papers identified were reviewed by three reviewers to determine whether the entire article was likely to contain relevant information. Risk factors could be broadly grouped as follows: animal (including nutrition and genetics), herd (including bTB and testing history), environment, wildlife and social factors. Many risk factors are inter-related and study designs often do not enable differentiation between cause and consequence of infection. Despite differences in study design and location, some risk factors are consistently identified, e.g. herd size, bTB history, presence of infected wildlife, whereas the evidence for others is less consistent and coherent, e.g. nutrition, local cattle movements. We have identified knowledge gaps where further research may result in an improved understanding of bTB transmission dynamics. The application of targeted, multifactorial disease control regimens that address a range of risk factors simultaneously is likely to be a key to effective, evidence-informed control strategies. © Crown Copyright.

abstract={Subtle differences in neuronal microanatomy may be coded in individuals with genetic susceptibility for neuropsychiatric disorders. Genetic susceptibility is a significant risk factor in the development of anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Pavlovian fear conditioning has been proposed to model key aspects of PTSD. According to this theory, PTSD begins with the formation of a traumatic memory which connects relevant environmental stimuli to significant threats to life. The lateral amygdala (LA) is considered to be a key network hub for the establishment of Pavlovian fear conditioning. Substantial research has also linked the LA to PTSD. Here we used a genetic mouse model of fear susceptibility (F-S) and resistance (F-R) to investigate the dendritic and spine structure of principal neurons located in the LA. F-S and F-R lines were bi-directionally selected based on divergent levels of contextual and cued conditioned freezing in response to fear-evoking footshocks. We examined LA principal neuron dendritic and spine morphology in the offspring of experimentally naive F-S and F-R mice. We found differences in the spatial distribution of dendritic branch points across the length of the dendrite tree, with a significant increase in branch points at more distal locations in the F-S compared with F-R line. These results suggest a genetic predisposition toward differences in fear memory strength associated with a dendritic branch point organization of principal neurons in the LA. These micro-anatomical differences in neuron structure in a genetic mouse model of fear susceptibility and resistance provide important insights into the cellular mechanisms of pathophysiology underlying genetic predispositions to anxiety and PTSD. © 2016.},

abstract={Associative learning is a basic mechanism required for herbivorous insects to adapt to highly variable environments. In most lepidopteran species, the adult stage is the main stage responsible for host plant selection, but newly hatched larvae can also contribute to host selection by moving a short distance from their birth position to feeding parts on plants. An understanding of mechanisms underlying olfactory associative learning in larvae would be helpful in enhancing the effectiveness of natural lethal factors on early instar stages via ecological interference and provide a scientific accordance for cultivating crop varieties that cannot be easily attacked by the larvae. Studies on olfactory associative learning in lepidopteran species have generally concentrated on the adult stage; little attention has been paid to early-instar larvae, probably because of their limited mobility and relatively simple life behaviors. Once the larvae are forced to leave their natal host plant, they need to move to plants with an odor profile that is similar to that of the previous host so that the larvae do not have to re-adapt to novel diet items and save the cost of physiological metabolism caused by host switch. As long as the memory of some key and stable cues is formed, the larvae can recognize and re-locate to these food plants, thus improving their fitness. Since the females of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) prefer to oviposit on or near the flowering parts of a plant and the larvae exclusively feed on flowering parts, we hypothesized that some key floral volatiles may represent the larval classical conditioning, the subjects were starved enough time to enhance their feeding motivation, and the inter-stimulus intervals and inter-trial intervals were strictly controlled in the laboratory; thus, the ecological relevance of larval classical conditioning is weak. In this paper, we have reported the associative learning capability of and corresponding temporal pattern of learning performance in early-instar larvae of H. armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) to the association between conditioned stimuli (seven floral volatiles with biological meaning to H. armigera) and an un-conditioned stimulus (artificial diet). During a seven-day conditioning period, the larvae were continually exposed to the floral volatiles. Results of the conditioning show that the phenylacetaldehyde-conditioning group exhibited significant preference to phenylacetaldehyde. Phenethylalcohol- and linalool-conditioned groups exhibited significant preference to the corresponding conditioned stimuli. However, benzaldehyde, phenylmethanol, benzyl acetate, and geraniol did not produce a positive result at any conditioning time lengths; this suggested that the larvae selectively sensed and remembered the cue of some stable and key components during the feeding process, rather than responding to all the floral volatiles equally. In addition, the naive group did not show any preference to phenylacetaldehyde in all the tests, regardless of the time length after 24 h of feeding; this suggested that the alteration of the olfactory preference during conditioning was not induced by physiological maturity. Taken together, H. armigera larvae exhibited olfactory learning capability, and the variation in olfactory preference had no relationship with the conditioning time length. Possible explanations for such findings have been discussed with respect to the ecological habits of the larvae. © 2016, Ecological Society of China. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: The purpose of this study was to examine the association of birth weight and infant growth with childhood autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity and to assess whether ANS activity mediates the associations of birth weight and infant growth with energy-balance-related behaviours, including energy intake, satiety response, physical activity and screen time. Methods: In 2089 children, we prospectively collected birth weight, infant growth defined as conditional weight and height gain between birth and 12 months and-at 5 years- indices of cardiac ANS activity and parent-reported energy-balance-related behaviours. A mediation analysis was conducted, based on MacKinnon's multivariate extension of the product-of-coefficients strategy. Results: Birth weight and infant height gain were inversely associated with sympathetic, but not parasympathetic, activity at age 5. Infant weight gain was not associated with childhood ANS activity. Infant weight gain was predictive of increased childhood screen time and infant height gain of diminished childhood energy intake, but sympathetic activity did not mediate these associations. Conclusions: Low-birth-weight children have higher sympathetic activity, which is considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Height gain in infancy seems to be beneficial for childhood sympathetic activity. However, sympathetic activity was no mediator of the associations of infant growth with childhood energy-balance-related behaviours. As individual differences in ANS activity predict increased risk of cardiovascular disease, these differences may offer insight into the early-life origins of chronic diseases and provide further basis for public health strategies to optimize birth weight and infant growth. © The Author 2016.},

abstract={Introduction The objective of this exploratory study was to determine whether fruit and vegetable consumption differed by race/ethnicity, by origin and nativity among Hispanics, and by language preference (as an indicator of acculturation) among foreign-born Hispanics. Methods We recruited 723 women enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) and orally administered a questionnaire containing demographic items, validated measures of food security status and social desirability trait, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System fruit and vegetable module. Differences in intakes of 100% fruit juice, fruit, cooked or canned beans, and dark green, orange-colored, and other vegetables were assessed by using analysis of covariance with Bonferroni post hoc tests. Analyses were controlled for age, pregnancy status, breastfeeding status, food security status, educational attainment, and social desirability trait. Results The frequency of vegetable intake differed by race/ethnicity (cooked or canned beans were consumed more often among Hispanic than non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white or other participants, orange-colored vegetables were consumed more often among Hispanics than non-Hispanic black participants, and other vegetables were consumed more often among non-Hispanic white or other than among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic participants), origin (other vegetables were consumed more often among Columbian and other Hispanics than Dominican participants) and nativity (orange-colored vegetables were consumed more often among foreign-born than US-born Hispanics). Fruit and vegetable intake did not differ by language preference among foreign-born Hispanics. Conclusion Differences in fruit and vegetable consumption among WIC participants by race/ethnicity and by Hispanic origin and nativity may have implications for WIC nutrition policies and nutrition education efforts.},

abstract={Background Nutrition behaviors of adolescent girls is of serious health concerns. Although nutrition education interventions in Iran have met with some success, most of them could not promote nutrition behavioral changes. The aim of our study is to determine a school-based nutrition education intervention to improve adolescents' nutrition behaviors and behavioral mediators based on the social cognitive theory (SCT). Materials and Methods This study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. Eligible participants will be all student girls in grade 6 and 7, their parents and teachers in Isfahan governmental schools. This multi component school-based intervention include adolescents' nutrition education package, parents' nutrition massages, participatory homework, parents and teachers nutrition education package, supportive group, and collaboration with decision makers. Changing in nutrition behaviors including breakfast, fruit and vegetable, snack and fast food consumption will be examined, as primary outcome. Secondary outcome will be behavioral mediators such as knowledge, self-efficacy, intention, situation, self-regulation, social support, outcome expectations and expectancies, in adolescent girls. The outcomes will be assessed at baseline, and after 3 and 6-month follow-up. Discussion This study evaluates a school-based, guided SCT intervention, designed to improve healthy dietary behaviors, nutrition knowledge of adolescent girls. Few behavioral interventions have targeted this high-risk population in Iran. The intervention seems to be promising and has the potential to bridge the gap of the limited program outcomes of nutrition education in Iranian adolescents.},

abstract={Background: Coeliac disease (CD) is managed by life-long adherence to a gluten-free diet and dietitians have the potential to facilitate this. Patient involvement through shared decision-making is central to behaviour-change skills used by dietitians, although there is little evidence supporting its inclusion in evaluating dietetic interventions. The present study aimed to explore patients' preferences for diet and nutrition-related outcomes in CD. Methods: Adults with CD or adult carers of children with CD were invited through support networks. Participants took part in a telephone, face-to-face interview or focus group which was audio-recorded and transcribed. Themes were developed using a framework method. Ethical approval was obtained. Results: Twenty-nine adult patients and five parents of CD children participated 0–34 years after diagnosis. Four main outcome-related themes emerged: (i) Participants wanted information specific to their lifestyle and time since diagnosis, focussing on food containing gluten, practical issues, prescribable items and general nutrition. (ii) The degree of satisfaction with the consultation process impacted on participants' experience, including the dietitian's CD expertise, consistency of the dietitian seen, and the frequency and length of appointments. (iii) Health concerns were important to participants and focussed on risk of osteoporosis, unwanted weight gain, and the fat and sugar content of manufactured gluten-free products. (iv) Clinical monitoring, including bone scans and antibody measurements, was mentioned but was not described as being of importance for most participants. Conclusions: The outcomes preferred by CD patients and carers focussed primarily on information and resources received and satisfaction with their dietetic consultation. © 2016 The British Dietetic Association Ltd.},

abstract={Traits that facilitate competition for reproductive resources or that influence mate choice generally have a heightened sensitivity to stressors. They have evolved to signal resilience to infectious disease and nutritional and social stressors, and they are compromised by exposure to man-made toxins. Although these traits can differ from one species or sex to the next, an understanding of the dynamics of competition and choice can in theory be used to generate a priori predictions about sex-, age-, and trait-specific vulnerabilities for any sexually reproducing species. I provide a review of these dynamics and illustrate associated vulnerabilities in nonhuman species. The age- and sex-specific vulnerability of such traits is then illustrated for stressor-related disruptions of boys’ and girls’ physical growth and play behavior, as well as for aspects of boys’ and girls’ and men’s and women’s personality, language, and spatial abilities. There is much that remains to be determined, but enough is now known to reframe trait sensitivity in ways that will allow scientists and practitioners to better identify and understand vulnerable human traits, and eventually ameliorate or prevent their expression. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={The concept of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease presumes that early human development programmes health and the risk of adult diseases through the processes of developmental plasticity which can create different fenotypes stemming from a single genotype in response to enviromental signals. Early nutrition is a significant programming factor. Individual long-term health can be affected by inadequate intrauterine and postnatal nutrition. In order to reduce susceptibility to noncommunicable diseases preventive measures are most effective in the time of the highest plasticity - during the human reproductive cycle which includes both pregnancy and breastfeeding. Exclusive breastfeeding for up to 6 months of age followed by the introduction of complementary foods with adequate protein intake and energy together with continued breastfeeding is a basic preventive measure. Breastfeeding lowers the risk of being overweight or obese in infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. It also reduces the probability that a future mother will become overweight or obese before conception and during pregnancy and thereby lowers the risk of fetal overnutrition with all the consequnces for the child's health.},

abstract={It is now widely recognized that the environment in early life can have important effects on human growth and development, including the 'programming' of far-reaching effects on the risk of developing common metabolic and other noncommunicable diseases in later life. We have shown that greater childhood adiposity is associated with higher maternal adiposity, low maternal vitamin D status, excessive gestational weight gain and short duration of breast-feeding; maternal dietary patterns in pregnancy and vitamin D status have been linked with childhood bone mineral content and muscle function. Human studies have identified fetal liver blood flow adaptations and epigenetic changes as potential mechanisms that could link maternal influences with offspring body composition. In experimental studies, there is now substantial evidence that the environment during early life induces altered phenotypes through epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation, covalent modifications of histones and non-coding RNAs, can induce changes in gene expression without a change in DNA base sequence. Such processes are involved in cell differentiation and genomic imprinting, as well as the phenomenon of developmental plasticity in response to environmental influences. Elucidation of such epigenetic processes may enable early intervention strategies to improve early development and growth.},

abstract={Background: High food responsiveness (FR) and low satiety responsiveness (SR) are 2 appetitive traits that have been associated longitudinally with risk of excessive weight gain; however, to our knowledge, no studies have examined the associations between these traits and eating patterns in daily life in young children. Objective: We tested the hypothesis that higher FR is independently associated with a higher meal frequency and that lower SR is associated with a larger meal size. Design: Data were from 1102 families (2203 children) from the Gemini twin birth cohort. Appetite was assessed with the use of the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire when the children were 16 mo old (mean ± SD: 15.73 ± 1.08 mo old), and meal frequency (eating occasions per day) and meal size (kilojoules per eating occasion) were determined from 3-d diet diaries completed by parents when the children were 21 mo old (mean ± SD: 20.65 ± 1.10 mo old). Complex samples general linear models were used to explore cross-sectional associations between appetitive traits and meal variables. Results: After adjustment for the covariates gestational age, birth weight, sex, difference in age at diet-diary completion, and appetite measurement, higher FR was associated with more-frequent meals (B ± SE: 0.13 ± 0.04; P = 0.001) but not with meal size (P = 0.41), and lower SR was associated with a larger meal size (B ± SE: 247.61 ± 8.79; P < 0.001) but not with meal frequency (P = 0.15). Conclusions: FR and SR predict different eating variables with more food-responsive children eating more frequently, whereas less-satiety-responsive children eat more food on each eating occasion. Different strategies may be required to reduce the potential effects of FR and SR on weight gain. © 2016 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Bariatric surgery is indicated in obese patients with a BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 or ≥ 35 kg/m2 with serious comorbidities, in second intention in patients who failed to achieve significant weight loss after a well-managed medical, nutritional and psychotherapeutic treatment for 6 to 12 months, and in patients who are aware of the consequences of bariatric surgery and who agree with a long term medical and surgical follow-up. Such a treatment requires a preoperative multidisciplinary assessment and management, which includes a mandatory consultation with a psychiatrist or a psychologist that should be member of the multidisciplinary staff and participate in these staffs.Although one of this consultation's aim is to screen for the few patients who for which surgery is contra-indicated, in most cases, the main aim of this assessment is to screen for and manage psychiatric and psychopathologic disorders that could be temporary contra-indication, because these disorders could lead to poorer postoperative outcome when untreated. By explaining to the patient how these disorders could affect postoperative outcome and which benefits he could retrieve from their management, the patient will increase his motivation for change and he will be more likely to seek professional help for these disorders. In all cases, a systematic examination of the patient's personality and his/her ability to understand the postoperative instructions is essential before surgery because clinicians should check that the patient is able to be adherent to postoperative instructions. In addition to clinical interview, use of self-administered questionnaires before the consultation might help to determine which psychiatric or psychopathologic factors should be more closely screened during the consultation.Psychiatric disorders and addictions are highly prevalent in this population (e.g., mood and anxiety disorders, binge eating disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, addictions, personality disorders, pathological personality traits and dimensions), and when untreated, they can lead to poorer postoperative outcome (postoperative occurrence of psychiatric disorders, poorer quality of life, and sometimes to poorer weight loss or excessive weight rebound when the disorder is present during the postoperative period). A complementary training in addiction medicine is helpful given the higher risk for addictions in this population.Given that this evaluation is often the first meeting with a psychiatrist, an empathic and motivational approach is helpful to improve the patient's ability to request for a future psychiatric consultation during the follow-up.Some conditions are required for a high quality assessment: the objectives and expectations of the consultation should be systematically explained to the patient prior to the consultation by the physician who enquires for the assessment; it needs time; the psychiatrist should systematically be member of the multidisciplinary staff and should take part in regular multisciplinary staff meetings; patients should be seen alone to assess his/her readiness to change.After the consultation, a contact with the physician who enquires for the assessment should be systematic (e.g., use of a medical letter that sum up the main conclusions of the consultation; participation in regular multisciplinary staff meetings). © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract={Eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, have long been recognized in psychiatry and other medical disciplines for their primary dysregulation in the basic ability to eat and inability to maintain weight without significant distress or dysregulation. Although the diagnostic criteria of these disorders have been debated over time, the core feature remain as (1) disturbances in the ability to maintain a healthy weight, (2) recurrent binge-eating or compensatory behavior, and (3) significant disturbances in the investment and perceptions of shape, weight, or appearance. The neurobiology of these disorders has been aided greatly by the study of eating behavior and weight regulation designed to study obesity. This chapter summarizes the current state of knowledge about the genetic, hormonal, neurotransmitter, and functional neurocircuitry of these disorders. Emerging evidence suggests that appetite hormones and peptides, adrenal hormones, ovarian hormones, and serotonin and dopamine are dysregulated in both disorders. Despite these advances, no neurobiological model has been able to explain the differences in prevalence rates between men and women or the common occurrence of expression during puberty. It is likely that relevant hormonal systems and neurotransmitter changes are working synergistically to affect these disorders. Future directions in translational and clinical research are discussed. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2013 and Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.},

abstract={Background/Aim. The widespread symptoms of anorexia nervosa (AN) in young women require to draw professional attention to this problem in Serbia. In previous research on AN, insecure attachment styles, perfectionism and concerns about body shape were identified as notable risk factors. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of AN among female students and assess the importance of these factors in its development. Methods. The Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-40), the Experiences in Close Relationships Scale (ECR), the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (FMPS) and the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ) were applied to a sample of 500 randomly selected female students of the University of Belgrade, the mean age of 22.44 years (min 18, max 35). In addition, Body Mass Index (BMI) was also calculated. Results. Although 38 (7.6%) female students displayed symptoms of AN (EAT > 30) and 13 (2.6%) had BMI indicating anorexia nervosa syndrome (BMI ≤ 17.50 kg/m2), only 1 (0.2%) student fulfilled both criteria. The majority of female students (60.4%) had some type of insecure attachment style. There is a significant influence of attachment styles on symptoms of AN: female students with insecure attachment styles have a significantly higher mean score on the EAT compared to those with secure attachment style (F = 7.873; p < 0.01). There was a positive correlation between scores on the EAT and FMPS (r = 0.217; p < 0.01), and scores on the EAT and BSQ (r = 0.388; p < 0.01). Conclusions. The obtained results show the prevalence of AN of 0.2% among female students and indicate the importance of insecure attachment styles, perfectionism and concern about body shape as risk factors. Activities for the prevention of AN in this subpopulation should include internet-based therapy and special counseling services with specific programs focusing on emotion-regulation skills through mindfulness, acceptance and commitment techniques, as well as specific cognitive-behavioral techniques. © 2016, Institut za Vojnomedicinske Naucne Informacije/Documentaciju.

abstract={Introduction: Personality traits are divided into five basic dimensions: extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness and openness. These influence our attitudes and behaviours. Studies show that differences in personality traits may influence the dietary intake. Methods: A cross-sectional study aimed at determining the association between personality traits and body weight status with energy intake was conducted among adolescents in Hulu Langat district of Selangor. Height, weight and waist circumference were measured and respondents completed a pre-tested self-administered questionnaire. Personality traits were assessed using the Malay version of USM Personality (USMaP-i). A single 24-h dietary recall was used to assess dietary intake. Results: A total of 430 adolescents aged 13-16 years (46% male and 54% female) was recruited. Female respondents tended to be more neurotic and agreeable compared to male respondents. A majority of the respondents (67%) were in the normal weight category, 26.7% were overweight and obese, while 19.0% had a high risk of developing abdominal obesity with a mean waist circumference of 72.65 ± 10.93cm. Males significantly had a higher intake of energy (1425±583 kcal), compared to females (1232±462 kcal). Conscientiousness trait (r=-0.158, p<0.01), BMI-for-age (r=-0.147, p<0.01) and waist circumference (r=-0.108, p<0.05) were inversely related to the energy intake of the respondents. Conclusion: Leaner adolescents and individuals with low conscientiousness were significantly consuming more energy than their counterparts. Understanding the personality traits that may regulate caloric intake is essential in order to develop effective interventions towards modifying obesityinducing eating patterns.},

abstract={Background: Despite the increased risk, the quality of somatic healthcare is lower for patients with mental illnesses. Currently dominant approach separates physical and mental, primary and secondary healthcare. Objective of our study was to explore whether somatic comorbidities are associated with a poor HRQoL independently of some sociodemographic and clinical factors. Majority of studies have explored particular somatic and psychiatric illnesses. Therefore we decided to access the problem from the general perspective of the universe of somatic and mental illnesses in the large psychiatric institution. Subjects and methods: This nested cross-sectional study was done during May 2016 at Psychiatric hospital Sveti Ivan, Zagreb, Croatia on the sample of 506 patients diagnosed with psychiatric illnesses (ICD-10: F00-F99). Key outcome was the lowest 25% results on the SF-36 General health sub-scale, indicating the worst HRQoL. Predictors were all detected somatic illnesses. By multivariate logistic regression we controlled different sociodemographic, vital and clinical factors. Results: After adjustment for different sociodemographic and clinical factors, three somatic comorbidities remained independently associated with the worst HRQoL: endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (E00-E90), diseases of respiratory system (J00-J99) and diseases of musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (M00-M99) Conclusions: Somatic comorbidities in psychiatric patients are associated with the poor HRQoL independently of different sociodemographic, vital and clinical factors and they should be treated seriously and integrally with mental aspects of HRQoL. Early comorbidities detection and adequate pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment, as well as the prevention of risk factors, may improve the quality of life and reduce morbidity and mortality ofpsychiatric patients. © 2016 Medicinska naklada - Zagreb, Croatia.},

abstract={The recovery movement differentiated clinical, which is related to disorder's symptoms, from personal recovery, which is outlined by a subjectively defined wellness state, characterised by hope and self-management. Schizophrenia research has long focused on risk factors and symptoms. The recovery movement triggered a focus shift from psychopathology towards better adjustment and growth despite living with schizophrenia. The recovery movement flourished parallel with positive psychology, the scientific study of ordinary human strengths and virtues investigating human motives and potentials. Understanding of human strengths could contribute to prevention or lessening of psychiatric disorders' devastating consequences, since optimism, sense of personal control and many other positive processes promote psychological health. Lately, the concepts of positive psychology have been implemented in schizophrenia research. Positive self-appraisals moderated suicidal ideation, even when patients experienced high levels of hopelessness.1 Additionally, among other factors, better self-images, internal locus of control (i.e. the perception that events in one's life relate to one's actions) and emphasis on personal efforts predicted a more favourable outcome in functioning of unmedicated patients.2 The concept of "resilience" is closely related to positive psychology. The American Psychological Association defines resilience as ''the process of adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, threats or significant sources of stress''. The concept of resilience includes rebound from adversity.3 Determinants of resilience include biological, psychological, social and cultural factors that interact in a complex manner. The major manifestations of personal resilience are social competence, problem solving, autonomy and sense of purpose.5 Personality strengths that relate to resilience include high self-esteem, extroversion and optimism. Internal assets and personal competencies comprise the so called "phenomenological resilience" that can be measured by scales.4,5 Originally, research focused on resilience in relation to post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Recently, resilience was proven a significant predictor of depressive episode recurrence in bipolar disorder.6 Low resilience levels were also established in individuals at clinical high risk state for development of psychosis. Interestingly, individuals at high risk that developed a full-blown psychosis had shown significantly lower resilience levels compared with non-converters. Additionally, high resilience levels in individuals at high risk for psychosis related to less severe negative, anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as higher social functioning.7,8 Schizophrenia patients with higher resilience levels and optimism showed higher levels of happiness that associated in turn with lower perceived stress and higher personal mastery,9 while resilience was a significant predictor of functioning in a subgroup of non-medicated schizophrenia patients.10 In light of evidence supporting a positive association between resilience and schizophrenia outcome and based on the fact that resilience is modifiable and could improve with treatment,5 resilience studies are particularly meaningful, specifically within the first 3-5 years after schizophrenia onset,11 and could lead to interventions that aim at harnessing resilience during this "critical period". Diverse positive psychology interventions aim at improving psychological well-being by developing and nourishing positive feelings, behaviours and cognitions. Lately, positive psychotherapy was adapted for schizophrenia patients and was proven a feasible intervention that might contribute to improvement in functioning.12 Conclusively, sustained improvement in social and occupational functioning remains the most important indicator of recovery from schizophrenia. Still, such an improvement may not be accomplished in all patients by currently available pharmacological treatment alone. Studies that implement resilience and other positive psychology concepts reinforce schizophrenia research shift from risk to protective factors, reverse the question "which factors associate with relapse and chronicity" to "which factors promote recovery" and are promising for the development of additional therapeutic approaches.},

abstract={Species abundances and distributions are inherently tied to individuals' decisions about movement within their habitat. Therefore, integrating individual phenotypic variation within a larger ecological framework may provide better insight into how populations structure themselves. Recent evidence for consistent individual differences in behaviour prompts the hypothesis that variation in behavioural types might be related to variation in movement in natural environments. In a multiyear mark-recapture study, we found that individual sticklebacks exhibited consistent individual differences in behaviour both within a standardized testing arena designed to measure exploratory behaviour and within a river. Therefore, we asked whether individual differences in movement in a natural river were related to an individual's exploratory behavioural type. We also considered whether body condition and/or the individual's habitat or social environment use was related to movement. There was no evidence that an individual's exploratory behavioural type was related to movement within the river. Instead, an individual's habitat use and body condition interacted to influence natural movement patterns. Individuals in good condition were more likely to move further in the river, but only if they inhabited a vegetated complex part of the river; body condition had no influence on movement in those individuals inhabiting open areas of the river. Our results suggest that individual traits could help improve predictions about how populations may distribute themselves within patchy and complex environments. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Feeding behavior rarely occurs in direct response to metabolic deficit, yet the overwhelming majority of research on the biology of food intake control has focused on basic metabolic and homeostatic neurobiological substrates. Most animals, including humans, have habitual feeding patterns in which meals are consumed based on learned and/or environmental factors. Here we illuminate a novel neural system regulating higher-order aspects of feeding through which the gut-derived hormone ghrelin communicates with ventral hippocampus (vHP) neurons to stimulate meal-entrained conditioned appetite. Additional results show that the lateral hypothalamus (LHA) is a critical downstream substrate for vHP ghrelin-mediated hyperphagia and that vHP ghrelin activated neurons communicate directly with neurons in the LHA that express the neuropeptide, orexin. Furthermore, activation of downstream orexin-1 receptors is required for vHP ghrelin-mediated hyperphagia. These findings reveal novel neurobiological circuitry regulating appetite through which ghrelin signaling in hippocampal neurons engages LHA orexin signaling. © Hsu et al.},

abstract={• This study tested the effects of adolescent-stress on adult learning and memory. • Adolescent-stressed rats had enhanced reversal learning compared to unstressed rats. • Adolescent-stress exposure made working memory more vulnerable to disturbance. • Adolescent-stress did not affect adult associative learning or reference memory. Exposure to acute stress can cause a myriad of cognitive impairments, but whether negative experiences continue to hinder individual as they age is not as well understood. We determined how chronic unpredictable stress during adolescence affects multiple learning and memory processes in adulthood. Using male Sprague Dawley rats, we measured learning (both associative and reversal) and memory (both reference and working) starting 110 days after completion of an adolescent-stress treatment. We found that adolescent-stress affected adult cognitive abilities in a context-dependent way. Compared to rats reared without stress, adolescent-stressed rats exhibited enhanced reversal learning, an indicator of behavioral flexibility, but showed no change in associative learning and reference memory abilities. Working memory, which in humans is thought to underpin reasoning, mathematical skills, and reading comprehension, may be enhanced by exposure to adolescent-stress. However, when adolescent-stressed animals were tested after a novel disturbance, they exhibited a 5-fold decrease in working memory performance while unstressed rats continued to exhibit a linear learning curve. These results emphasize the capacity for stress during adolescence to transform the cognitive abilities of adult animals, even after stress exposure has ceased and animals have resided in safe environments for the majority of their lifespans. © 2015 Chaby, Cavigelli, Hirrlinger, Lim, Warg and Braithwaite.},

abstract={The ability to form associations between behaviorally relevant sensory stimuli is fundamental for goal-directed behaviors. We investigated neuronal activity in the telencephalic area nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) while two crows (Corvus corone) performed a delayed association task. Whereas some paired associates were familiar to the crows, novel associations had to be learned and mapped to the same target stimuli within a single session. We found neurons that prospectively encoded the chosen test item during the delay for both familiar and newly learned associations. These neurons increased their selectivity during learning in parallel with the crows' increased behavioral performance. Thus, sustained activity in the NCL actively processes information for the upcoming behavioral choice. These data provide new insights into memory representations of behaviorally meaningful stimuli in birds, and how such representations are formed during learning. The findings suggest that the NCL plays a role in learning arbitrary associations, a cornerstone of corvids' remarkable behavioral flexibility and adaptability.},

abstract={The key for the long-term survival of species is their potential to respond to changing conditions. These reactions are usually species-specific and may vary between populations. The Yellow-bellied Toad (Bombina variegata (L., 1758)) occurs in forested and open areas. We wanted to know whether tadpoles react plastically to different environmental conditions, and if so, whether reaction norms are species, population, or season specific. In a common garden experiment, we compared developmental traits (developmental time, size, body condition) of metamorphs from different habitats (forest vs. quarry) in close geographic proximity. Tadpoles from both habitats grew up under shaded and sunny conditions. The experiments were run during early and late breeding season. We detected different developmental strategies between populations, concerning treatments and season on a microgeographic scale. Tadpoles with quarry origin developed faster and reached larger body sizes, at the expense of lower body condition. Major risks affecting tadpole’s survival in the open habitat are high temperatures and high desiccation. Forest tadpoles were comparatively smaller in size, but showed higher plasticity and higher body condition. Under changing climatic conditions, quarry population may reach temperatures above their thermal limits. In contrast, forest conditions may mitigate increasing temperatures. Forest populations could be better adapted to future climate change. © 2016, National Research Council of Canada. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Social relationships are fundamental to animals living in complex societies [1-3]. The extent to which individuals base their decisions around their key social relationships, and the consequences this has on their behavior and broader population level processes, remains unknown. Using a novel experiment that controlled where individual wild birds (great tits, Parus major) could access food, we restricted mated pairs from being allowed to forage at the same locations. This introduced a conflict for pair members between maintaining social relationships and accessing resources. We show that individuals reduce their own access to food in order to sustain their relationships and that individual foraging activity was strongly influenced by their key social counterparts. By affecting where individuals go, social relationships determined which conspecifics they encountered and consequently shaped their other social associations. Hence, while resource distribution can determine individuals' spatial and social environment [4-8], we illustrate how key social relationships themselves can govern broader social structure. Finally, social relationships also influenced the development of social foraging strategies. In response to forgoing access to resources, maintaining pair bonds led individuals to develop a flexible "scrounging" strategy, particularly by scrounging from their pair mate. This suggests that behavioral plasticity can develop to ameliorate conflicts between social relationships and other demands. Together, these results illustrate the importance of considering social relationships for explaining behavioral variation due to their significant impact on individual behavior and demonstrate the consequences of key relationships for wider processes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract={Precopulatory sexual cannibalism is an extreme form of sexual conflict because it has the potential to eliminate current and future reproductive success for males. Several female factors such as body condition, mating status and orientation are predicted to impact the likelihood of cannibalism, and males are expected to respond to these factors by altering their approach behaviours in ways that minimize the chance of being attacked (i.e. slower approach and greater distance at mounting). We used the sexually cannibalistic praying mantid Pseudomantis albofimbriata to test whether and how certain female risk factors affect male approach and mating behaviour. We created three different risk treatments by manipulating female body condition, mating status and orientation, and recorded the frequency of cannibalism, male mating success, male approach behaviours and copulation duration. As predicted, female body condition and mating status had an effect on the frequency of sexual cannibalism, and cannibalized males had significantly lower mating success than noncannibalized males. Female orientation was the least important factor in determining the rate of sexual cannibalism in this system, with no significant difference between front- and rear-facing females. Contrary to what we predicted, male P. albofimbriata did not alter/shape their approach or mating behaviours relative to any of the proposed female risk factors of sexual cannibalism. There was also no difference in copulation duration between cannibalized and noncannibalized males. Future studies that investigate the effect of sexual cannibalism on postcopulatory male mating strategies will provide better clarification of the costs and benefits of sexual cannibalism in this system and will also be useful in understanding why males do not respond to the risk of sexual cannibalism in a precopulatory scenario. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Undernutrition during brain development causes long lasting alterations in different neurotransmitter systems that may alter responses to psychoactive drugs. Despite the recognized effects of early undernutrition on the cholinergic system, no evidence that demonstrates the influence of this insult on nicotine susceptibility has been reported. We investigated the effects of protein/calorie restriction during lactation on the susceptibility to nicotine in adolescent mice. Dams were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: Control (C, 20 litters)-free access to standard laboratory diet (23% protein); Protein Restricted (PR, 12 litters)-free access to a isoenergetic, 8% protein diet; Calorie Restricted (CR, 12 litters)-access to standard laboratory diet in restricted quantities (mean ingestion of PR: pair-fed group). Undernutrition extended from postnatal day 2 (PN2) to weaning (PN21). At PN30, animals either received an i.p. injection of nicotine (0.5. mg/Kg) or saline and were immediately placed in open field (OF). After the OF, adrenal glands and serum were collected for the analyses of stress-related endocrine parameters and leptin concentration. PR and CR offspring showed less body mass gain and visceral fat mass. PR offspring presented reduced serum leptin concentration. In the OF, nicotine increased locomotor activity of C and PR, but not of CR. CR and PR offspring showed decreased adrenal catecholamine content, which was not dependent on nicotine exposure. Our results indicate that early undernutrition interferes with nicotine-elicited locomotor effects in adolescent mice and suggest that endocrine parameters alterations in malnourished animals do not influence the behavioral response to nicotine. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Group-foraging animals can coordinate their activities by performing positive signals that increase foraging or inhibitory signals that decrease recruitment when foragers detect danger. However, it is unclear whether foragers tune their excitatory and inhibitory signalling according to food value and predation risk. We therefore studied the signals that honeybee foragers perform before and after being attacked by live predators (wasps and spiders) or a robo-predator at a nectar source. Predator attacks significantly reduced recruitment dancing and increased stop signalling, which inhibits dancing for the dangerous resource. Attack equally reduced dancing for all sucrose concentrations. However, foragers factored travel costs into their positive signalling. At the feeder with greater travel cost (100. m), bees danced less when they responded more severely to attacks. At the low travel cost feeder (1. m), there was no significant effect of attack response severity upon dancing. Attacks increased inhibitory signal production. Live and robo-predator attacks elicited 131-fold more stop signals from foragers as compared to control treatments of freshly dead predators that did not attack. However, food profitability, distance and sucrose concentration did not alter stop signalling. We suggest that this pattern may generally characterize excitatory/inhibitory signal pairs in group foraging. Foragers tune positive signalling (recruitment) to food quality and peril, and this is countered by an inhibitory signal that is tuned to danger but not resource value. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Behaviours are the result of the interaction between genetic factors, past experiences, and labile environmental and social influences. Usually, the behavioural variability of an individual is smaller than the behavioural range of its species, but stable over time and contexts. This intraindividual consistency has been termed animal personality, and is found in a wide range of taxa. Personality types have various fitness and behavioural consequences. In particular, proactive individuals seem to perform better in most, but not all, learning tasks. Furthermore, personality types may also influence behavioural reaction towards the task at hand. For instance, in the literature, reactive individuals are expected to explore new environments more slowly, but to respond better to changes in their environment than proactive individuals. Here, we report the characterization of personality profiles in mallards over a period of 8 months, as well as their reactions towards a spatial-learning task. Mallards' exploration scores were repeatable both in novel environment and in novel object tests. Even though they did not differ in their baseline cortisol levels, fast-exploring birds had lower cortisol levels 30. min after the occurrence of a stressor than slow-exploring birds. Irrespective of their personality, all our birds successfully learned to find a food location within a maze. Yet, fast-exploring individuals took longer to accomplish the task, potentially because they habituated faster to stress and could engage earlier in other activities within the maze. Our results contrast with recent views of the respective consequences of being reactive or proactive. They thus highlight the importance of considering the habituation to stress when investigating the relative advantages of the reactive - proactive continuum, as well as taking into account the personality bias when conducting cognitive experiments. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={In the UK, it has been suggested that abattoirs are ideal locations to assess the welfare of sheep as most are slaughtered at abattoirs either as finished lambs or cull ewes. Data from abattoirs could provide benchmarks for welfare indicators at a national level, as well as demonstrating how these change over time. Additionally, feedback could be provided to farmers and regulatory authorities to help improve welfare and identify high or low standards for quality assurance or risk-based inspections. A systematic review of the scientific literature was conducted, which identified 48 animal-based indicators of sheep welfare that were categorised by the Five Freedoms. Their validity as measures of welfare and feasibility for use in abattoirs were evaluated as potential measures of prior sheep welfare on the farm of origin, at market, or during transportation to the abattoir.A total of 19 indicators were considered valid, of which nine were considered theoretically feasible for assessing sheep welfare at abattoirs; these were body cleanliness, carcass bruising, diarrhoea, skin lesions, skin irritation, castration, ear notching, tail docking and animals recorded as 'obviously sick'. Further investigation of these indicators is required to test their reliability and repeatability in abattoirs. Novel welfare indicators are needed to assess short-term hunger and thirst, prior normal behaviour and long-term fear and distress. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Wild boar is a highly polycotous ungulate species, characterized by a complex and dynamical social organization based on the maintenance of long-term bonds between mother and daughters. The roots of this social organization have to be researched at the individual level, considering adaptations that improve fitness in hostile environments. We used information collected by camera-traps at artificial feeding sites, in two contrasting environments in Bulgaria (mountain habitat) and Italy (sub-Mediterranean habitat). We recorded 417 and 885 distinct groups on 7 and 11 foraging sites in Bulgaria and Italy, respectively. We computed (controlling for time range, study area and supplementary feeding site) an index of effective foraging time of the different social groups. We observed a positive and significant effect of the number of conspecifics of the same social group on the effective foraging time. The impact of the other social classes on effective foraging time is also positive, and males, yearlings, and juveniles benefited more from the presence of other social classes, while females were less affected. The access of the different social groups to foraging sites is not random. Males and yearlings play producers (i.e., search for food) and are prone to attend foraging sites before adult females and subadults, so attaining a larger foraging efficiency with respect to a situation where other groups are already present on the feeding site. Wild boars exhibit a more complex social organisation than previously believed, where cooperation prevails largely on competition. A rough division of labour is also present: yearlings, males, and juveniles use to play producers and assume a significant amount of risk determined by the presence of predators or hunters. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A novel migratory polymorphism evolved within the last 60 years in blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) breeding sympatrically in southwestern Germany. While most individuals winter in the traditional areas in the Mediterranean, a growing number of blackcaps started migrating to Britain instead. The rapid microevolution of this new strategy has been attributed to assortative mating and better physical condition of birds wintering in Britain. However, the isolating barriers as well as the physical condition of birds are not well known. In our study, we examined whether spatial isolation occurred among individuals with distinct migratory behaviour and birds with different arrival dates also differed in physical and genetic condition. We caught blackcaps in six consecutive years upon arrival on the breeding grounds and assigned them via stable isotope analysis to their wintering areas. Analysis of the vegetation structure within blackcap territories revealed different microhabitat preferences of birds migrating to distinct wintering areas. Blackcaps arriving early on the breeding grounds had higher survival rates, better body condition and higher multilocus heterozygosities than later arriving birds. We did however not find an effect of parasite infection status on arrival time. Our results suggest that early arriving birds have disproportionate effects on population dynamics. Allochrony and habitat isolation may thus act together to facilitate ongoing divergence in hybrid zones, and migratory divides in particular. © 2015 HERMES et al.

abstract={The deleterious effect of competition for space and food in animals increases with increasing population density. In contrast, familiarity towards conspecifics can relax the intensity of interference competition. Here, we hypothesized that familiarity towards conspecifics mitigates the effect of density-dependent growth and dispersal behaviour in territorial animals. To test this, wild-captured juvenile brown trout were subjected to two consecutive laboratory experiments. First, growth and fin erosion were measured for 40 d in a 2 × 2 factorial design manipulating density and familiarity. The density was manipulated via size of experimental tanks, while per capita food abundance and fish number was constant. All fish were subsequently exposed to an emergence test, giving them the option to leave their group and disperse to a novel unoccupied environment. The results show that familiarity increases growth and decreases the level of fin erosion (i.e. proxy of intensity of aggressive interactions). We found no significant effect of population density on growth rate. However, there was a tendency towards higher fin erosion in fish kept under high density. The growth of individuals was also affected by their size rank within the group, with the largest individuals in each group growing disproportionally faster than the rest of the group, probably due to their high social rank. However, the second and third fish in the size rank did not grow significantly faster and tended to suffer higher mortality than the rest of the group. During the emergence test, the largest individuals in the familiar groups left the shelter either as the first (six of 12 groups) or last (five of 12 groups) individual in the group, while no such pattern was observed in unfamiliar groups. Our results suggest that individuals in familiar groups receive less aggression and stress (i.e. fin damage) and grow faster than fish in unfamiliar groups. The mechanisms indicated in this laboratory study may be especially important in highly fecund organisms like fish which undergo density-dependent bottlenecks during early life. © 2015 FDI World Dental Federation.},

abstract={There is considerable evidence for both environmental and genetic causes of obesity. Increased availability of cheap, palatable food plays a role, but despite the ubiquity of the 'obesogenic' environment there is still substantial variation in weight - in fact, weight variability has gone up over recent decades. Twin and adoption studies show that adiposity is highly heritable (50-90%), and genome-wide association studies have started to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with weight. We have proposed that genetic susceptibility to obesity is partly attributable to appetitive phenotypes, called the behavioral susceptibility theory (BST). BST proposes that individuals who inherit a more avid appetite or lower sensitivity to satiety are more likely to overeat in response to the food environment. Our laboratory has provided considerable evidence for BST using a variety of research approaches. We have used prospective epidemiological studies to demonstrate that appetite plays a causal role in the development of weight, twin designs to show that appetitive phenotypes are highly heritable and have genetic overlap with adiposity, and genomic analyses to show that obesity-related SNPs are associated with appetite and that appetite mediates some of the SNP-adiposity association. BST has helped to resolve the seeming paradox of both genetic determination and environmental determination of weight, and points to appetite as a useful target for pharmacological and behavioral interventions in the prevention and management of obesity. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Objective: The aim of this paper is to map the possibility of new treatment approaches for eating disorders. Background: Eating disorders have a protracted trajectory with over 50% of cases developing a severe and enduring stage of illness. Although a good response to family-based interventions occurs in the early phase, once the illness has become severe and enduring there is less of a response to any form of treatment. Neuroprogressive changes brought about by poor nutrition and abnormal eating patterns contribute to this loss of treatment responsivity. Method: We have summarised the profile of symptoms at the various stages of illness and considered new treatments that might be applied. Results: In the enduring stage of illness in addition to problems with body image, food and eating, there are additional problems of low mood, high anxiety and compulsivity and problems in social functioning. This suggests that there are dysfunctions in circuits subsuming reward, punishment, decision-making and social processes. New approaches have been developed targeting these areas. Conclusion: New interventions targeting both the primary and secondary symptoms seen in the enduring stage of eating disorders may improve the response to treatment. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Chemically-mediated orientation is essential for many animals that must locate sites containing resources such as mates or food. One way to find these areas is by using publically-available information from other individuals. We tested a freshwater snail, Physa gyrina, for chemoreception of conspecific cues and predicted they could discriminate between cues based on information regarding hunger levels. We placed 'tracker' snails into a 2-arm arena where they could either follow or avoid an area previously used by a 'marker' snail. The hunger levels of both trackers and markers was manipulated, being either starved or fed. Starved and fed trackers did not differ in their following response when markers were hungry, but starved trackers were significantly more likely to follow fed markers, compared to fed trackers that tended to avoid areas used by fed markers. This outcome suggests that P. gyrina uses conspecific chemical cues to find food and potentially in some situations to avoid intra-specific food competition. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The aim of the study was to evaluate, in a representative sample of high school students, the psychometric characteristics of the Italian version of the CEBRACS scale (Rahal et al., 2011), a questionnaire investigating compensatory eating behaviors correlated with alcohol consumption. These behaviors are adopted to make up for calories consumed through the drinking of alcohol and/or to enhance the intoxicative effects of alcohol. Study participants were selected from an initial sample of 965 students. Out of the 965 youths originally recruited, 640 (376 males and 264 females) reported drinking alcohol over the previous 3 months, and were considered eligible for the purpose of the study. The following questionnaireswere administered: CEBRACS, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) (Saunders, 1993), and the Eating Disorder Inventory-3 (EDI-3) (Garner, 2004). Test/retest reproducibilitywas evaluated on a subgroup of 189 youths. The factorial structure, internal consistency, test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of CEBRACS were evaluated. Factor analysis of inter-item correlation indicated 5 factors as being better suited to describe data, with an estimated 68.85% variance: "Alcohol Effect, "Laxative Use", "Dietary Restraint and Exercise", "Diuretic Use", "Restriction and Vomiting". A high degree of reproducibility and homogeneity (ICC=0.806; Cronbach's Alpha=0.886) of the scale was detected. A significant correlation was revealed between CEBRACS, the three eating disorder risk scales comprised in EDI-3 and scores and clinical risk yielded by AUDIT. The overall reliability and validity of the CEBRACS scale was confirmed in an extensive sample of Italian students, highlighting a satisfactory construct validity, good internal consistency and good degree of reproducibility. In view of the relevance of the problem, associatedwith serious health risks, a morewidespread investigation of the phenomenon should be conducted using evaluation tools of proven validity and reliability on both representative samples of the general population and clinical samples. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Omnivorous arthropods make dietary choices according to the environment in which they forage, mainly availability/quality of plant and/or prey resources. Such decisions and their subsequent impacts on life-history traits may be affected by the availability of nutrients and water to plants, that is, through bottom-up forces. By setting up arenas for feeding behavior observation as well as glasshouse cages for plant preference assessment, we studied effects of the presence of prey (Lepidoptera eggs) and nitrogen/water availability to host tomato plants on the foraging behavior and life-history traits in the omnivorous predator Macrolophus pygmaeus (Heteroptera: Miridae). In the absence of prey, the predator fed equally on the plants treated with various levels of nitrogen and water. In the presence of prey, however, the feeding rate on plants decreased when the plant received low water input. The feeding rate on prey was positively correlated with feeding rate on plants; that is, prey feeding increased with plant feeding when the plants received high water input. Moreover, plants receiving high water input attracted more M. pygmaeus adults compared with those receiving low water input. For M. pygmaeus fitness, the presence of prey enhanced its fertility and longevity, but the longevity decreased when plants received low compared with high water input. In conclusion, the omnivorous predator may be obliged to feed on plants to obtain water, and plant water status may be a limiting factor for the foraging behavior and fitness of the omnivorous predator. © 2015 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Like many animals, firebugs (Hemiptera, Pyrrhocoridae) rely on behavioural adaptations to successfully endow their offspring with microbial mutualists. To transmit the nutritionally beneficial Coriobacteriaceae symbionts, female firebugs smear egg surfaces with symbiont-containing faecal droplets that are subsequently ingested by newly hatched nymphs through active probing to initiate infection. Alternatively, the symbionts can be acquired horizontally through contact with faeces of infected conspecifics. Here,we report that these adaptations ensuring successful transmission of bacterial symbionts among firebugs are exploited by the specialized trypanosomatid parasite Leptomonas pyrrhocoris. Using comparative transcriptomics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and controlled bioassays, we demonstrate that the transmission cycle of L. pyrrhocoris mirrors that of the bacterial mutualists, with high efficiency for both vertical and horizontal transmission. This indicates that the parasite capitalizes on pre-existing behavioural adaptations (egg smearing and probing) to facilitate its own transfer within host populations, adaptations that likely evolved to initiate and maintain an association with beneficial gut symbionts. Thus, the transmission of mutualistic microbes across host generations can entail a significant risk of co-transmitting pathogens or parasites, thereby exerting selective pressures on the host to evolve more specific mechanisms of transfer. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Aggregation of necrophagous larvae has several benefits: the sharing of salivary enzymes (exodigestion), temperature regulation, protection from predators and parasites, etc., and is well developed in blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae). The present study focuses on the aggregation mechanism used by the necrophagous larvae of Lucilia sericata Meigen, the common green bottle fly. The ability of single larva to detect and follow a signal (trail) created by conspecifics is investigated initially. A circular ring is drawn in a Petri dish where 20 starved larvae have crawled for a period of 30min. A naïve (test) larva is then placed in the dish and video-tracked. Naïve larvae are able to detect the boundaries of the larvae-crawled area and stay preferentially within this conspecific-marked zone. In a second step, the orientation of larvae by scanning, a dedicated, ground-signal detection behaviour of dipteran larvae, is analyzed. Four experimental conditions are tested: control, presence of food, conspecifics, and food+conspecifics. When conspecifics have been previously present in a given area, the scanning behaviour by naïve larvae in this area decreases (both in number and frequency of scans). Accordingly, scanning by necrophagous larvae of L. sericata should be considered not only as locomotion behaviour, but also as a potential way to detect signals from conspecifics for the purpose of aggregation. The chemical composition of the attractant(s), the behavioural effects (attraction or retention) and the implication of larval signalling in the aggregation process are new fields to explore. © 2015 The Royal Entomological Society.},

abstract={The rewarding effects of alcohol can lead to progressively heavier and more frequent drinking. Since studies of reward have mainly focused on responses to higher alcohol doses, the relations between reward and moderate/sustained alcohol exposure remain unknown. Our objective was to evaluate factors affecting the reward value of low alcohol doses and risk factors for increasing alcohol doses due to reward progression caused by alcohol exposure patterns. We thus performed conditioned place preference (CPP) and ethanol (EtOH)-induced locomotor sensitization tests in mice. Low-dose EtOH (0.5 or 1 g/kg twice/week)-induced CPP was stronger than that produced by saline control treatment, but the effect decreased with increasing numbers of conditioning trials. Moderate-dose/long-term EtOH exposure induced a weaker CPP than high-dose/short-term EtOH (2 g/kg twice/week) exposure with the same total EtOH dose (8 g/kg/experiment). Acamprosate calcium, an anti-relapse drug, preclusively reduced EtOH-induced CPP. EtOH induced CPP and locomotor sensitization in black but not white chamber, although the initial preference and the basal locomotion in each chamber were equal. Therefore the brightness of the chamber had an effect on EtOHinduced sensitization. Moreover, additional studies indicated that EtOH-induced locomotor sensitization also depends on the dose but not the administration interval. Paired associative learning with EtOH exposure is a potent factor influencing the level of reward produced by EtOH. Moreover, exposure to high doses of alcohol, even on an intermittent schedule, carries a higher risk of addiction than exposure to moderate doses over longer periods. © 2015 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.},

abstract={Obesity is associated with a range of health outcomes that are of clinical and public health significance, including cancer. Herein, we summarize epidemiologic and preclinical evidence for an association between obesity and increased risk of breast and prostate cancer incidence and mortality. Moreover, we describe data from observational studies of weight change in humans and from calorie-restriction studies in mouse models that support a potential role for weight loss in counteracting tumor-promoting properties of obesity in breast and prostate cancers. Given that weight loss is challenging to achieve and maintain, we also consider evidence linking treatments for obesity-associated co-morbidities, including metformin, statins and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with reduced breast and prostate cancer incidence and mortality. Finally, we highlight several challenges that should be considered when conducting epidemiologic and preclinical research in the area of obesity and cancer, including the measurement of obesity in population-based studies, the timing of obesity and weight change in relation to tumor latency and cancer diagnosis, and the heterogeneous nature of obesity and its associated co-morbidities. Given that obesity is a complex trait, comprised of behavioral, epidemiologic and molecular/metabolic factors, we argue that a transdisciplinary approach is the key to understanding the mechanisms linking obesity and cancer. As such, this review highlights the critical need to integrate evidence from both epidemiologic and preclinical studies to gain insight into both biologic and non-biologic mechanisms contributing to the obesity-cancer link. © 2015 Society for Endocrinology.},

abstract={Background: Shared decision making (SDM) holds great potential for improving the therapeutic efficiency and quality of nutritional treatment of dyslipidaemia by promoting patient involvement in decision making. Adoption of specific behaviours fostering SDM during consultations has yet to be studied in routine dietetic practice. Objective: Using a cross-sectional study design, we aimed to explore both dieticians' and patients' adoption of SDM behaviours in dietetic consultations regarding the nutritional treatment of dyslipidaemia. Methods: Twenty-six dieticians working in local health clinics in the Quebec City metropolitan area were each asked to identify one dyslipidaemic patient they would see in an upcoming consultation. Based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), questionnaires were designed to study two targeted SDM behaviours: 'to discuss nutritional treatment options for dyslipidaemia' and 'to discuss patients' values and preferences about nutritional treatment options for dyslipidaemia'. These questionnaires were administered to the dietician-patient dyad individually before the consultation. Associations between TPB constructs (attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control) towards behavioural intentions were analysed using Spearman's partial correlations. Results: Thirteen unique patient-dietician dyads completed the study. Perceived behavioural control was the only TPB construct significantly associated with both dieticians' and patients' intentions to adopt the targeted SDM behaviours (P < 0.05). Conclusions: As perceived behavioural control seems to determine dieticians' and patients' adoption of SDM behaviours, interventions addressing barriers and reinforcing enablers of these behaviours are indicated. This exploratory study highlights issues that could be addressed in future research endeavours to expand the knowledge base relating to SDM adoption in dietetic practice. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Delay discounting (DD) refers to how rapidly an individual devalues goods based on delays to receipt. DD usually is considered a trait variable but can be state dependent, yet few studies have assessed commodity valuation at short, naturalistically relevant time intervals that might enable state-dependent analysis. This study aimed to determine whether drug-use impulsivity and intelligence influence heroin DD at short (ecologically relevant) delays during two pharmacological states (heroin satiation and withdrawal). Out-of-treatment, intensive heroin users (n = 170; 53.5% African American; 66.7% male) provided complete DD data during imagined heroin satiation and withdrawal. Delays were 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours; maximum delayed heroin amount was thirty $10 bags. Indifference points were used to calculate area under the curve (AUC). We also assessed drug-use impulsivity (subscales from the Impulsive Relapse Questionnaire [IRQ]) and estimated intelligence (Shipley IQ) as predictors of DD. Heroin discounting was greater (smaller AUC) during withdrawal than satiation. In regression analyses, lower intelligence and IRQ Capacity for Delay as well as higher IRQ Speed (to return to drug use) predicted greater heroin discounting in the satiation condition. Lower intelligence and higher IRQ Speed predicted greater discounting in the withdrawal condition. Sex, race, substance use variables, and other IRQ subscales were not significantly related to the withdrawal or satiation DD behavior. In summary, heroin discounting was temporally rapid, pharmacologically state dependent, and predicted by drug-use impulsivity and estimated intelligence. These findings highlight a novel and sensitive measure of acute DD that is easy to administer. © 2015 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Background/Aims: Previous diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have shown microstructural changes in the brain white matter of at-risk mental state (ARMS) subjects for psychosis and patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP). However, only a few studies have been conducted in clinical high-risk samples and findings in both groups are inconsistent, in particular along the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). Methods: This DTI study used tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to compare fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) between ARMS subjects, untreated and antipsychotic-treated FEP patients and healthy controls (HC) across the whole brain and the SLF. Results: Compared to HC, ARMS and FEP patients showed increased FA and decreased MD in diverse regions across the whole brain including the SLF. FA in the SLF was positively correlated with positive psychotic symptoms in ARMS and FEP individuals. Furthermore, untreated but not treated FEP patients showed increased FA in the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus and right SLF. Conclusion: This study revealed increased FA and decreased MD in early stages of psychosis in widespread white matter tracts including the SLF. Our findings further suggest that microstructural changes in the SLF are probably related to state-dependent psychopathology. © 2015The Author(s) Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract={Objective: When considering repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for major depressive disorder, clinicians often face a lack of detailed information on potential interactions between rTMS and pharmacotherapy. This is particularly relevant to patients receiving bupropion, a commonly prescribed antidepressant with lower risk of sexual side effects or weight increase, which has been associated with increased risk of seizure in particular populations. Our aim was to systematically review the information on seizures occurred with rTMS to identify the potential risk factors with attention to concurrent medications, particularly bupropion. Data sources: We conducted a systematic review through the databases PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE between 1980 and June 2015. Additional articles were found using reference lists of relevant articles. Reporting of data follows Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Study selection: Two reviewers independently screened articles reporting the occurrence of seizures during rTMS. Articles reporting seizures in epilepsy during rTMS were excluded. A total of 25 rTMS-induced seizures were included in the final review. Data extraction: Data were systematically extracted, and the authors of the applicable studies were contacted when appropriate to provide more detail about the seizure incidents. Results: Twenty-five seizures were identified. Potential risk factors emerged such as sleep deprivation, polypharmacy, and neurological insult. High-frequency-rTMS was involved in a percentage of the seizures. None of these seizures reported had patients taking bupropion in the literature review. One rTMS-induced seizure was reported from the Food and Drug Administration in a sleep-deprived patient who was concurrently taking bupropion, sertraline, and amphetamine. Conclusion: During the consent process, potential risk factors for an rTMS-induced seizure should be carefully screened for and discussed. Data do not support considering concurrent bupropion treatment as contraindication to undergo rTMS. © 2015 Dobek et al.},

abstract={Understanding space use remains a major challenge for animal ecology, with implications for species interactions, disease spread, and conservation. Behavioural type (BT) may shape the space use of individuals within animal populations. Bolder or more aggressive individuals tend to be more exploratory and disperse further. Yet, to date we have limited knowledge on how space use other than dispersal depends on BT. To address this question we studied BT-dependent space-use patterns of sleepy lizards (Tiliqua rugosa) in southern Australia. We combined high-resolution global positioning system (GPS) tracking of 72 free-ranging lizards with repeated behavioural assays, and with a survey of the spatial distributions of their food and refuge resources. Bayesian generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) showed that lizards responded to the spatial distribution of resources at the neighbourhood scale and to the intensity of space use by other conspecifics (showing apparent conspecific avoidance). BT (especially aggressiveness) affected space use by lizards and their response to ecological and social factors, in a seasonally dependent manner. Many of these effects and interactions were stronger later in the season when food became scarce and environmental conditions got tougher. For example, refuge and food availability became more important later in the season and unaggressive lizards were more responsive to these predictors. These findings highlight a commonly overlooked source of heterogeneity in animal space use and improve our mechanistic understanding of processes leading to behaviourally driven disease dynamics and social structure. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Background: L-methionine, the principal sulfur-containing amino acid in proteins, plays critical roles in cell physiology as an antioxidant and in the breakdown of fats and heavy metals. Previous studies suggesting the use of L-methionine as a treatment for depression and other diseases indicate that it might also improve memory and propose a role in brain function. However, some evidence indicates that an excess of methionine can be harmful and can increase the risk of developing Type-2 diabetes, heart diseases, certain types of cancer, brain alterations such as schizophrenia, and memory impairment. Results: Here, we report the effects of an L-methionine-enriched diet in wild-type mice and emphasize changes in brain structure and function. The animals in our studypresented 1) higher levels of phosphorylated tau protein, 2) increased levels of amyloid-β (Aβ)-peptides, including the formation of Aβ oligomers, 3) increased levels of inflammatory response,4) increased oxidative stress, 5) decreased level of synaptic proteins, and 6) memory impairment and loss. We also observed dysfunction of the Wnt signaling pathway. Conclusion: Taken together, the results of our study indicate that an L-methionine-enriched diet causes neurotoxic effects in vivo and might contribute to the appearance of Alzheimer's-like neurodegeneration. © 2015 Tapia-Rojas et al.},

abstract={Many echinoderm larvae exhibit phenotypic plasticity: a change in phenotype in response to environmental food levels. We investigated phenotypic plasticity in the larvae of the crown-of-thorns seastar Acanthaster planci, an opportunistic boom-and-bust species with larvae that have a strong response to food conditions. The increased predation pressure resulting from outbreaks (population explosions) of A. planci is deleterious to coral reefs, but the link between population outbreaks and larval ecology is poorly understood. We hypothesised that the larvae of A. planci would have a different morphological profile in the oligotrophic conditions typical of tropical waters than in the eutrophic conditions associated with increased nutrients. We predicted that larvae reared in low food conditions would increase their ciliated band length to enhance feeding potential. Larvae were fed algal concentrations representing starvation (0 cells ml-1), low food (oligo trophic; 1000 cells ml-1), high food (eutrophic; 10 000 cells ml-1) or excessive food (100 000 cells ml-1) conditions. A phenotypic response was evident. Larvae in the 2 high food treatments had a shorter ciliated band length relative to body size. Conversely, larvae in the starvation and low food treatments had longer ciliated bands relative to body size, a change that would enhance particle capture capacity and facilitate larval success. This plastic response of the larvae of A. planci could have flow-on effects to adult populations, potentially facilitating population outbreaks. © Inter-Research 2015, www.int-res.com.},

abstract={Animals may adjust their behavior according to their perception of risk. Here we show that free-flying honey bee (Apis cerana) foragers mitigate the risk of starvation in the field when foraging on a food source that offers variable rewards by carrying more 'fuel' food on their outward journey. We trained foragers to a feeder located 1.2 km from each of four colonies. On average foragers carried 12.7% greater volume of fuel, equivalent to 30.2% more glucose when foraging on a variable source (a random sequence of 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 M sucrose solution, average sucrose content 1.5 M) than when forging on a consistent source (constant 1.5 M sucrose solution). Our findings complement an earlier study that showed that foragers decrease their fuel load as they become more familiar with a foraging place. We suggest that honey bee foragers are risk sensitive, and carry more fuel to minimize the risk of starvation in the field when a foraging trip is perceived as being risky, either because the forager is unfamiliar with the foraging site, or because the forage available at a familiar site offers variable rewards. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract={Obesity is an important medical problem affecting humans and animals in the developed world, but the evolutionary origins of the behaviours that cause obesity are poorly understood. The potential role of occasional gluts of food in determining fat-storage strategies for avoiding mortality have been overlooked, even though animals experienced such conditions in the recent evolutionary past and may follow the same strategies in the modern environment. Humans, domestic, and captive animals in the developed world are exposed to a surplus of calorie-rich food, conditions characterised as 'constant-glut'. Here, we use a mathematical model to demonstrate that obesity-related mortality from poor health in a constant-glut environment should equal the average mortality rate in the 'pre-modern' environment when predation risk was more closely linked with foraging. It should therefore not be surprising that animals exposed to abundant food often over-eat to the point of ill-health. Our work suggests that individuals tend to defend a given excessive level of reserves because this level was adaptive when gluts were short-lived. The model predicts that mortality rate in constant-glut conditions can increase as the assumed health cost of being overweight decreases, meaning that any adaptation that reduced such health costs would have counter-intuitively led to an increase in mortality in the modern environment. Taken together, these results imply that efforts to reduce the incidence of obesity that are focussed on altering individual behaviour are likely to be ineffective because modern, constant-glut conditions trigger previously adaptive behavioural responses. © 2015 McNamara et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.},

abstract={Chronic ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves depressive-like behaviour in rats via serotonergic and neurotrophic-related mechanisms. We hypothesise that, in addition to these substrates, DBS-induced increases in hippocampal neurogenesis may also be involved. Our results show that stress-induced behavioural deficits in the sucrose preference test, forced swim test, novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT) and elevated plus maze were countered by chronic vmPFC DBS. In addition, stressed rats receiving stimulation had significant increases in hippocampal neurogenesis, PFC and hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. To block neurogenesis, stressed animals given DBS were injected with temozolomide. Such treatment reversed the anxiolytic-like effect of stimulation in the NSFT without significantly affecting performance in other behavioural tests. Taken together, our findings suggest that neuroplastic changes, including neurogenesis, may be involved in specific anxiolytic effects of DBS without affecting its general antidepressant-like response. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract={The predicted increase of the frequency and intensity of wildfires as a result of climate change could have a devastating impact on many species and ecosystems. However, the particular physiological and behavioural adaptions of animals to survive fires are poorly understood. We aimed to provide the first quantitative data on physiological and behavioural mechanisms used by a small heterothermic marsupial mammal, the fat-tailed dunnart (. Sminthopsis crassicaudata), that may be crucial for survival during and immediately after a fire. Specifically, we aimed to determine (i) whether captive torpid animals are able to respond to fire stimuli and (ii) which energy saving mechanisms are used in response to fires. The initial response of torpid dunnarts to smoke exposure was to arouse immediately and therefore express shorter and shallower torpor bouts. Dunnarts also increased activity after smoke exposure when food was provided, but not when food was withheld. A charcoal/ash substrate, imitating post-fire conditions, resulted in a decrease in torpor use and activity, but only when food was available. Our novel data suggests that heterothermic mammals are able to respond to fire stimuli, such as smoke, to arouse from torpor as an initial response to fire and adjust torpor use and activity levels according to food availability modulated by fire cues. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Parasites are ubiquitous in nature and can be costly to animal fitness, so hosts have evolved behavioural counter-strategies to mitigate infection risk. We investigated feeding-related infection-Avoidance strategies in Japanese macaques via field-experimentation and observation. We first examined risk sensitivity during foraging tasks involving faecally contaminated or debriscovered food items, and then investigated individual tendencies to manipulate food items during natural foraging bouts.We concurrently monitored geohelminth infection in all subjects. We ran a principal component analysis on the observational/experimental data to generate a hygienic index across individuals and found that hygienic tendencies towards faeces avoidance and food manipulation correlated negatively with geohelminth infection. Females scored higher in hygienic tendencies than males, which might contribute to the common vertebrate pattern of male-biased infection. The behavioural tendencies observed may reflect a general form of hygiene, providing a mechanism of behavioural immunity against parasites with implications for the evolution and diversification of health maintenance strategies in humans. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Naturally occurring environmental factors shape developmental trajectories to produce variable phenotypes. Such developmental phenotypic plasticity can have important effects on fitness, and has been demonstrated for numerous behavioral and morphological traits. However, surprisingly few studies have examined developmental plasticity of the nervous system in response to naturally occurring environmental variation, despite accumulating evidence for neuroplasticity in a variety of organisms. Here, we asked whether the brain is developmentally plastic by exposing larval amphibians to natural and anthropogenic factors. Leopard frog tadpoles were exposed to predator cues, reduced food availability, or sublethal concentrations of the pesticide chlorpyrifos in semi-natural enclosures. Mass, growth, survival, activity, larval period, external morphology, brain mass, and brain morphology were measured in tadpoles and after metamorphosis. Tadpoles in the experimental treatments had lower masses than controls, although developmental rates and survival were similar. Tadpoles exposed to predator cues or a high dose of chlorpyrifos had altered body shapes compared to controls. In addition, brains from tadpoles exposed to predator cues or a low dose of chlorpyrifos were narrower and shorter in several dimensions compared to control tadpoles and tadpoles with low food availability. Interestingly, the changes in brain morphology present at the tadpole stage did not persist in the metamorphs. Our results show that brain morphology is a developmentally plastic trait that is responsive to ecologically relevant natural and anthropogenic factors. Whether these effects on brain morphology are linked to performance or fitness is unknown. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Aggression is a central trait affecting fitness, which has been well studied in many animals. As a part of a research programme integrating mechanisms and fitness consequences of aggression, we examined the adaptive functions of antagonistic interactions in fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, a species in which aggression has been studied primarily in the context of territorial behaviour. In our experiments, males at an attractive food patch were more aggressive towards other males when they were in the presence of their recent mates than when they were in the presence of females mated with other males. Furthermore, while recently mated males accompanied by their mates were more aggressive than virgin males, recently mated males and virgin males showed similar levels of aggression in the presence of females mated with other males. When we allowed focal males to mate inside experimental arenas and then added intruder males, the intruder males spent less time on the food patch, remated with the resident females at lower frequencies and fathered a smaller proportion of offspring when the focals males remained in the arenas than when we removed the focal males. Our results reveal a novel adaptive function of aggression in fruit flies: in addition to fighting to defend attractive food sources that attract prospective mates, males rely on aggression to guard their mates, and such mate guarding enhances their fitness. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Objective Despite alarming prevalence rates, surprisingly little is known about neural mechanisms underlying eating behavior in juveniles with obesity. To simulate reactivity to modern food environments, event-related potentials (ERP) to appetizing food images (relative to control images) were recorded in adolescents with obesity and healthy adolescents. Methods Thirty-four adolescents with obesity (patients) and 24 matched healthy control adolescents watched and rated standardized food and object images during ERP recording. Personality (impulsivity) and eating styles (trait craving and dietary restraint) were assessed as potential moderators. Results Food relative to object images triggered larger early (P100) and late (P300) ERPs. More impulsive individuals had considerably larger food-specific P100 amplitudes in both groups. Controls with higher restraint scores showed reduced food-specific P300 amplitudes and subjective palatability ratings whereas patients with higher restraint scores showed increased P300 and palatability ratings. Conclusions This first ERP study in adolescents with obesity and controls revealed impulsivity as a general risk factor in the current obesogenic environment by increasing food-cue salience. Dietary restraint showed paradoxical effects in patients, making them more vulnerable to visual food-cues. Salutogenic therapeutic approaches that deemphasize strict dietary restraint and foster healthy food choice might reduce such paradoxical effects. © 2015 The Obesity Society.},

abstract={Obesity and chronic stress have been considered important public health problems that affect millions of people worldwide. Our aim was to analyze the effect of obesity associated with chronic stress on neurobehavioral parameters in female rats, considering that the association of these syndromes can enhance the negative effects on homeostasis. The animals were distributed into standard diet (Std), standard diet. + stress (Std + stress), cafeteria diet (Cafe), and cafeteria diet + stress (Cafe + stress) groups. The animals of groups Std and Std + stress were fed with rodent standard feed. Groups Cafe and Cafe + stress, additionally to the standard feed, were offered palatable and calorie-rich processed food and cola-type soft drink ad libitum. From the eighth experimental week, groups Std + stress and Cafe + stress were subjected to restraint chronic stress model (50 days). After the stress protocol, predictive anxiety (open-field and elevated plus-maze tests) and depression (forced swim) were applied. The cafeteria diet was effective in inducing obesity. The ratio locomotion in the central quadrants/total locomotion evaluated during the open field test was not indicative of anxiogenic or anxiolytic effect in the animal's behavior. However, the elevated plus maze test showed that obese and stressed animals were prone to higher anxiety levels. In addition, the obese and stressed animals display less climbing behavior than all the other groups, which can be considered an indicator of depression-like behavior. Nevertheless, it is suggested that the mechanisms involved in effects of obesity associated with chronic stress be better investigated in female rats, considering the organic complexity related to these modern illnesses. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Nuptial gifts are packages of non-gametic material transferred by males to females at mating. These gifts are common in bushcrickets, where males produce a complex spermatophore consisting in a sperm-containing ampulla and an edible sperm-free spermatophylax. Two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses have been suggested to explain the function of the spermatophylax: the paternal investment hypothesis proposes that it represents a male nutritional investment in offspring; the mating effort hypothesis proposes that the spermatophylax maximizes the male's sperm transfer. Because gift production may represent significant energy expenditure, males are expected to adjust their investment relative to the perceived quality of the female. In this study, we first examined the free amino acid composition and protein-bound amino acid composition of the nuptial gift in the bushcricket, Ephippiger diurnus (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae). Second, we investigated whether this composition was altered according to female age and body weight. Our study represents the first investigation of both free and protein-bound amino acid fractions of a bushcricket spermatophylax. We found that composition of the nuptial gift varied both qualitatively and quantitatively with respect to traits of the receiving female: older females received larger amounts of protein-bound amino acids (both essential and non-essential), less water and less free glycine. This result suggests that gift composition is highly labile in E. diurnus, and we propose that gift allocation might represent a form of cryptic male mate choice, allowing males to maximize their chances of paternity according to the risk of sperm competition that is associated with mate quality. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This article is part of a Special Issue "SBN 2014".Maternal obesity, metabolic state, and diet during gestation have profound effects on offspring development. The prevalence of neurodevelopmental and mental health disorders has risen rapidly in the last several decades in parallel with the rise in obesity rates. Evidence from epidemiological studies indicates that maternal obesity and metabolic complications increase the risk of offspring developing behavioral disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and schizophrenia. Animal models show that a maternal diet high in fat similarly disrupts behavioral programming of offspring, with animals showing social impairments, increased anxiety and depressive behaviors, reduced cognitive development, and hyperactivity. Maternal obesity, metabolic conditions, and high fat diet consumption increase maternal leptin, insulin, glucose, triglycerides, and inflammatory cytokines. This leads to increased risk of placental dysfunction, and altered fetal neuroendocrine development. Changes in brain development that likely contribute to the increased risk of behavioral and mental health disorders include increased inflammation in the brain, as well as alterations in the serotonergic system, dopaminergic system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background Chronic non-communicable diseases represent the major drivers of disease burden, being responsible for the majority of health care cost and deaths. Almost half of premature deaths is due to behaviors amenable to change. Accordingly, addressing behavior might represent a strategic change in the health delivery system. Improving lifestyle requires a specific strategy embedding the active collaboration of individuals with a multilevel team-oriented medical practice. With the present study we sought to assess whether the implementation of cognitive-behavioral strategies, following the principles of lifestyle medicine in an outpatient clinic provides better results in weight reduction as compared to simpler strategies as presently executed in General Practitioners' offices. Methods This is an observational study on 173 subjects (age 53.1 ± 11.5), comparing three different groups of preventive practice: a personalized lifestyle medicine, combining cognitive behavioral strategies with patient tailored prescription of exercise and nutrition (Group A); a semi-structured approach with generic counseling (Group B); and an unstructured advice (Group C). Results At the end of the intervention period (17-20 months), group A showed an average weight loss of 5.4 ± 5.1 kg, which was significantly (p < 0.001)more than observed in group B (2.8 ± 5.1 kg) and group C (1.2 ± 4.8 kg). Likewise BMI and waist were progressively more reduced from A to C. Conclusions It is possible to implement preventive cognitive-behavioral lifestyle strategies in outpatient internal medicine clinics. This methodology appears more efficacious in inducing weight reduction after more than a year as compared to usual family medicine approaches. © 2015 European Federation of Internal Medicine.},

abstract={The life cycle of the cestode Echinococcus multilocularis primarily involves canids and small mammals (rodents, lagomorphs) as definitive and intermediate hosts, respectively. Several surveys have identified marked temporal and geographical variations at different scales in the parasite's prevalence in both types of hosts, suggesting variations in the biological and ecological factors that control transmission processes. The parasite transmission from intermediate to definitive hosts is determined by the predator-prey relationship, which theoretically depends on prey population dynamics and the complex dietary response of predators to varying densities of prey species and other food items. Parasite eggs are transmitted to intermediate hosts via carnivore faeces, whose distribution in the environment is driven by the defecating behaviour of final hosts. We reviewed field-based studies that address issues related to the trophic ecology and behaviour of definitive hosts, interactions between definitive and intermediate hosts, and E. multilocularis transmission both in wild and domestic animals in rural and urban environments. Two density-dependent mechanisms control the transmission dynamics in definitive hosts: one is based on the variations in the availability of intermediate hosts, and the other is based on the variations in the density of the definitive host and its faeces. Non-linearity and the direct and delayed responses of definitive host contamination in relation to intermediate host population variations were recorded. The dietary response of the red fox was shown to be complex when abundant alternative resources were available (anthropogenic food, multiple intermediate host prey species). Micro-local hotspots of parasite transmission to intermediate hosts in a landscape, as well as areas of higher risk for human contamination in village and urban settings, may be explained by the definitive hosts' activity patterns and defecation behaviour. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess potential prepregnancy risk factors for preterm birth in a low-income, Hispanic population in Southern California. Additionally, the study assessed whether the prevalence of preterm birth and any associations between risk factors and preterm birth differed between U.S.- and foreign-born mothers. Methods: The study sample included 1174 mothers participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) within 1 year postpartum, including an augment sample of mothers who delivered preterm. Maternal sociodemographic traits, prepregnancy health-related characteristics and behaviors, and birth outcomes were collected by telephone survey. Odds ratios for associations between risk factors and preterm birth were estimated by logistic regression with sampling weights. Effect measure modification of any association by maternal nativity was also assessed using interaction terms. Results: After adjustment for confounding, significant prepregnancy risk factors for preterm birth included maternal age ≥35 years (OR 2.00; 95 % CI 1.04, 3.84) compared to age 18–24 years, and experience of a financially stressful life event among U.S.-born, but not foreign-born, women (OR 2.61; 95 % CI 1.43, 4.77). The weighted prevalence of preterm birth was 15.1 % and did not significantly differ by maternal nativity (P = 0.19). Conclusions for Practice: Further investigation with large, prospective studies is needed to better understand the risk factors for and disparities in preterm birth among the growing Hispanic population in the U.S. so that women who are at risk prepregnancy can be identified and provided risk-specific services. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Innovative behaviour may allow animals to cope with changes in their environment. Innovative propensities are known to vary widely both between and within species, and a growing body of research has begun to examine the factors that drive individuals to innovate. Evidence suggests that individuals are commonly driven to innovate by necessity; for instance by hunger or because they are physically unable to outcompete others for access to resources. However, it is not known whether the factors that drive individuals to innovate are stable across contexts. We examined contextual variation in the drivers of innovation in rock pool prawns (Palaemon spp), invertebrates that face widely fluctuating environments and may, through the actions of tides and waves, find themselves isolated or in groups. Using two novel foraging tasks, we examined the effects of body size and hunger in prawns tested in solitary and group contexts. When tested alone, small prawns were significantly more likely to succeed in a spatial task, and faster to reach the food in a manipulation task, while hunger state had no effect. In contrast, size had no effect when prawns were tested in groups, but food-deprived individuals were disproportionately likely to innovate in both tasks. We suggest that contextual variation in the drivers of innovation is likely to be common in animals living in variable environments, and may best be understood by considering variation in the perception of relative risks and rewards under different conditions. © 2015 Duffield et al.

abstract={Recent research suggests that obesity is linked to prominent alterations in learning and decision-making. This general difference may also underlie the preference for immediately consumable, highly palatable but unhealthy and high-calorie foods. Such poor food-related inter-temporal decision-making can explain weight gain; however, it is not yet clear whether this deficit can be generalized to other domains of inter-temporal decision-making, for example financial decisions. Further, little is known about the stability of decision-making behavior in obesity, especially in the presence of rewarding cues. To answer these questions, obese and lean participants (n = 52) completed two sessions of a novel priming paradigm including a computerized monetary delay discounting task. In the first session, general differences between groups in financial delay discounting were measured. In the second session, we tested the general stability of discount rates. Additionally, participants were primed by affective visual cues of different contextual categories before making financial decisions. We found that the obese group showed stronger discounting of future monetary rewards than the lean group, but groups did not differ in their general stability between sessions nor in their sensitivity toward changes in reward magnitude. In the obese group, a fast decrease of subjective value over time was directly related to a higher tendency for opportunistic eating. Obese in contrast to lean people were primed by the affective cues, showing a sex-specific pattern of priming direction. Our findings demonstrate that environments rich of cues, aiming at inducing unhealthy consumer decisions, can be highly detrimental for obese people. It also underscores that obesity is not merely a medical condition but has a strong cognitive component, meaning that current dietary and medical treatment strategies may fall too short. © 2015 Simmank, Murawski, Bode and Horstmann.},

abstract={Rationale: Mouse models of ethanol (EtOH) self-administration are useful to identify genetic and biological underpinnings of alcohol use disorder. Objectives: These experiments developed a novel method of oral operant EtOH self-administration in mice without explicitly paired cues, food/water restriction, or EtOH fading. Methods: Following magazine and lever training for 0.2 % saccharin (SAC), mice underwent nine weekly overnight sessions with lever pressing maintained by dipper presentation of 0, 3, 10, or 15 % EtOH in SAC or water vehicle. Ad libitum water was available from a bottle. Results: Water vehicle mice ingested most fluid from the water bottle in contrast to SAC vehicle mice, which despite lever pressing demands, drank most of their fluid from the liquid dipper. Although EtOH in SAC vehicle mice showed concentration-dependent increases of g/kg EtOH intake, lever pressing decreased with increasing EtOH concentration and did not exceed that of SAC vehicle alone at any EtOH concentration. Mice reinforced with EtOH in water ingested less EtOH than mice reinforced with EtOH in SAC. EtOH in water mice, however, showed concentration-dependent increases in g/kg EtOH intake and lever presses. Fifteen percent EtOH in water mice showed significantly greater levels of lever pressing than water vehicle mice and a significant escalation of responding across weeks of exposure. Naltrexone pretreatment reduced EtOH self-administration and intake in these mice without altering responding in the vehicle control condition during the first hour of the session. Conclusions: SAC facilitated EtOH intake but prevented observation of EtOH reinforcement. Water vehicle unmasked EtOH's reinforcing effects. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

These cavefish have, over the last 1 million years, evolved for successful searching, identification, and consumption of food in these resource-limiting environments. These adaptations include the development of constructive traits, such as large jaws to accommodate more teeth and an increased number of tastebuds around the mouth and ventral surface of the head. Coincident with the evolution of these traits are changes in feeding behavior.

abstract={The blind cavefish Astyanax have adapted to their subterranean habitat where food is often scarce and difficult to locate. Specialized anatomical features allow the cavefish to better locate food and maximize their food intake. Behavioral changes, such as increased swimming/exploratory behavior, also contribute to effective feeding. Cavefish exhibit lower standard metabolic rates and higher glycogen levels than eyed-surface fish and have higher survival rates during fasting periods. In vertebrates, several peptides produced by the brain and in the periphery regulate feeding and metabolism. These include hormones such as orexin, cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript, peptide YY, cholecystokinin, ghrelin and apelin, as well as metabolic enzymes and neurotransmitters, such as tyrosine hydroxylase, serotonin, and target of rapamycin. This review gives an overview of the current knowledge of feeding behavior and metabolism in cavefish, and how it might be influenced by these regulatory peptides. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Findings showing that neonatal lesions of the forebrain dopaminergic system in rodents lead to juvenile locomotor hyperactivity and learning deficits have been taken as evidence of face validity for the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, the core cognitive and physiological intermediate phenotypes underlying this rodent syndrome remain unknown. Here we show that early postnatal dopaminergic lesions cause long-lasting deficits in exploitation of shelter, social and nutritional resources, and an imbalanced exploratory behavior, where nondirected local exploration is exacerbated, whereas sophisticated search behaviors involving sequences of goal directed actions are degraded. Importantly, some behavioral deficits do not diminish after adolescence but instead worsen or mutate, particularly those related to the exploration of wide and spatially complex environments. The in vivo electrophysiological recordings and morphological reconstructions of striatal medium spiny neurons reveal corticostriatal alterations associated to the behavioral phenotype. More specifically, an attenuation of corticostriatal functional connectivity, affecting medial prefrontal inputs more markedly than cingulate and motor inputs, is accompanied by a contraction of the dendritic arbor of striatal projection neurons in this animal model. Thus, dopaminergic neurons are essential during postnatal development for the functional and structural maturation of corticostriatal connections. From a bottom-up viewpoint, our findings suggest that neuropsychiatric conditions presumably linked to developmental alterations of the dopaminergic system should be evaluated for deficits in foraging decision making, alterations in the recruitment of corticostriatal circuits during foraging tasks, and structural disorganization of the frontostriatal connections. © 2015 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

abstract={Extinction serves as the leading theoretical framework and experimental model to describe how learned behaviors diminish through absence of anticipated reinforcement. In the past decade, extinction has moved beyond the realm of associative learning theory and behavioral experimentation in animals and has become a topic of considerable interest in the neuroscience of learning, memory, and emotion. Here, we review research and theories of extinction, both as a learning process and as a behavioral technique, and consider whether traditional understandings warrant a re-examination. We discuss the neurobiology, cognitive factors, and major computational theories, and revisit the predominant view that extinction results in new learning that interferes with expression of the original memory. Additionally, we reconsider the limitations of extinction as a technique to prevent the relapse of maladaptive behavior and discuss novel approaches, informed by contemporary theoretical advances, that augment traditional extinction methods to target and potentially alter maladaptive memories. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Memory formation is promoted by stress via the release of norepinephrine and stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs). Previous data demonstrate that repeated stressor exposure increases norepinephrine turnover and β-AR signaling within the amygdala, which led to the hypothesis that some stress-induced behavioral changes are likely due to facilitated associative learning. To test this, Fischer rats were exposed to chronic mild stress for four days. On day 5, subjects (including non-stressed controls) were injected with the beta-blocker propranolol or vehicle prior to conditioning in an operant box (animals receive two mild foot shocks) or passive avoidance apparatus (animals received a foot shock upon entry into the dark chamber). Twenty-four hours later, subjects were returned to the operant box for measurement of freezing or returned to the passive avoidance apparatus for measurement of latency to enter the dark chamber. Subjects were also tested in an open field to assess context-independent anxiety-like behavior. Animals exposed to chronic stress showed significantly more freezing behavior in the operant box than did controls, and this exaggerated freezing was blocked by propranolol during the conditioning trial. There was no effect of stress on behavior in the open field. Unexpectedly, retention latency was significantly reduced in subjects exposed to chronic stress. These results indicate that chronic exposure to stress results in complex behavioral changes. While repeated stress appears to enhance the formation of fearful memories, it also results in behavioral responses that resemble impulsive behaviors that result in poor decision-making. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract={Introduction: Endurance exercises have a direct influence on aerobic capacity. To improve this quality is necessary develop an extensive and continuous training sessions. However anaerobic exercise requires low volume of training and high intensity to sport performance. In aerobic or anaerobic exercise is obvious to state that weight reduction must be performed from the body fat component, furthermore is an important point of view from the last years. Therefore, it is of vital importance to control the strategies used by the athletes in order to obtain the correct weight and avoid eating disorders. Objective: identify differences comparing for groups that develop aerobic or anaerobic exercises, and concerns related to eating disorders, dietetic habits and physical activity. Method: 206 trained men were examined and participated in the study, that can be screened using the validated EAT-26 questionnaire, Predimed fat-free diet questionnaire and Spanish short version of the Minessota Leisure Time Physical Activity questionnaire. Results: Athletes who practice aerobic physical activity showed higher values at majority of EAT-26 scales and total score. When this population increased their training sessions presented higher scores of Oral Control. The effects of consuming supplementation increases EAT-26 scores and eating disorder predisposition. In addition, high-structured training session increases EAT-26 scores and eating disorder predisposition too. Discussion: Practice aerobic physical activities seem to show a greater predisposition to the presence of TCA in athletes. © 2015, Grupo Aula Medica S.A. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The coupling of growth to nutritional status is an important adaptive response of living organisms to their environment. For this ability, animals have evolved various strategies, including endocrine systems that respond to changing nutritional conditions. In animals, nutritional information is mostly perceived by peripheral organs, such as the digestive tract and adipose tissues, and is subsequently transmitted to other peripheral organs or the brain, which integrates the incoming signals and orchestrates physiological and behavioral responses. In Drosophila melanogaster, adipose tissue, known as the fat body, functions as an endocrine organ that communicates with the brain. This fat body-brain axis coordinates growth with nutritional status by regulating the secretion of Drosophila insulin-like peptides (Dilps) from the brain. However, the molecular nature of the fat body-brain axis remains to be elucidated. We recently demonstrated that a small peptide, CCHamide-2 (CCHa2), expressed in the fat body and gut, directly stimulates its receptor (CCHa2-R) in the brain, leading to Dilp production. Notably, the expression of CCHa2 is sensitive to the presence of nutrients, particularly sugars. Our results, together with the results of previous studies, show that signaling between peripheral organs and the brain is a conserved strategy that couples nutritional availability to organismal physiology. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Differences in food availability and predation risk can influence how herbivores use landscapes. As a result, trade-offs between costs and benefits can influence habitat and patch selection. To determine how oribi antelope, Ourebia ourebi, weigh up costs and benefits when making habitat and patch level foraging decisions, we measured giving-up densities in artificial patches. First, we determined large-scale habitat use, and then explored how different variables explained patch use within habitats. When the availability of food within patches across the different habitats was equal, oribi preferred to feed in short and tall grasslands and avoided woodlands. Furthermore, the avoidance of woodlands extended into the surrounding grasslands, resulting in oribi feeding less intensively in grassland areas within 15. m of the woodlands. Within the safe grassland habitats, oribi preferred to feed in patches close to tall grass (i.e. escape cover), and where they could see beyond 2. m. These results suggest that oribi select habitats and patches in relation to perceived predation risk (i.e. predation costs outweigh potential food intake benefits). However, when we increased food availability within woodlands, oribi increased their large-scale risk-taking behaviour and fed in these woodlands. Furthermore, this increased risk taking extended to small-scale foraging decisions whereby an increase in food availability within woodlands caused oribi to increase their relative usage of patches that had sight lines as well as patches that were closer to potential ambush sites. Ultimately, these results highlight how changes in food availability can determine the degree to which herbivores are willing to increase their risk-taking behaviour, and how these changes can affect overall landscape use. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Identifying cues used by animals to select habitat offers insights into ecological trade-offs-often, contrasting choices amongst physical environment to meet physiological demands, food/other resources and predator avoidance. We examined the relative influence of food and refuge on occurrence of Royle’s pika, a common high-altitude prey in western Himalaya. We sampled distribution of rock with different crevices size (anti-predation refuge), and vegetation cover (food) in 0.25-ha plots at 20 pika occupied sites each paired with a putative (talus habitat) but unoccupied site along 1080-m elevation gradient. We used logistic regression and information-theoretic approach to test the effects of these factors on habitat selection. We found that pika occurrence was determined by rock cover with small crevices (AICc-wt summation = 0.98 R2 = 0.77) in a positive way (β = 0.16 ± 0.03), whereas negligibly influenced by vegetation covers (AICc-wt range 0.01–0.21). Model incorporating rock cover with small crevices could accurately predict pika occurrence (93 % area under ROC curve). Since this species inhabit open habitats with high predation risk and heat stress, abundant rock cover with small crevices offers critical escape from predators apart from providing thermal refuge since temperature inside rock crevices are usually moderate compared to ambient conditions. It simultaneously allows animals to access larger foraging areas that perhaps reduce their dependency on local food availability. Thus, we demonstrate the relative importance of refuge over food in microhabitat selection by pika and highlight that concurrent large-scale rock extraction for developmental activities can adversely affect pika distribution. © 2015, Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Białowieża, Poland.},

abstract={We compared the prey composition of the red-backed shrike's (Lanius collurio) larders in agricultural habitats in Italy, France and Poland. This species exhibits the behaviour of impaling prey in larders, a behaviour attributed not only to storing food, but also as a social indication for sexual selection and/or demarcation of territories.A total of 426 impaled items were identified in 244 larders. Most common prey were identified for each country: Insecta (Hymenoptera) in Italy, Amphibia, Insecta (Diptera) and Clitellata in Poland, and Insecta (Orthoptera, Lepidoptera) in France. We found no relationship between type of prey impaled and height of impalement, however, we noted a negative relationship between the height of impalement and the distance to the nearest road. Furthermore, impaled toxic prey were found in all three countries, strengthening the possibility that prey are exposed to expedite the degradation of toxins or used as a social signal.Our results showed that the average weight of impaled prey was greater during the last reproductive stage (hatching and feeding young), providing evidence of differential usage of impaled prey during the breeding season. We therefore hypothesize that larger animals provide more energy, then vertebrates are preferred to invertebrates, especially when parents are feeding their nestlings. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Body weight and the levels of stored body fat have fitness consequences. Greater levels of fat may provide protection against catastrophic failures in the food supply, but they may also increase the risk of predation. Animals may therefore regulate their fatness according to their perceived risks of predation and starvation: the starvation-predation trade-off model. We tested the predictions of this model in wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) by experimentally manipulating predation risk and starvation risk. We predicted that under increased predation risk individuals would lose weight and under increased starvation risk they would gain it. We simulated increased predation risk by playing the calls made by predatory birds (owls: Tyto alba and Bubo bubo) to the mice. Control groups included exposure to calls of a non-predatory bird (blackbird: Turdus merula) or silence. Mice exposed to owl calls at night lost weight relative to the silence group, mediated via reduced food intake, but exposure to owl calls in the day had no significant effect. Exposure to blackbird calls at night also resulted in weight loss, but blackbird calls in the day had no effect. Mice seemed to have a generalised response to bird calls at night irrespective of their actual source. This could be because in the wild any bird calling at night will be a predation risk, and any bird calling in the day would not be, because at that time the mice would normally be resting, and hence not exposed to avian predators. Consequently, mice have not evolved to distinguish different types of call but only to respond to the time of day that they occur. Mice exposed to stochastic 24. h starvation events altered their behaviour (reduced activity) during the refeeding days that followed the deprivation periods to regain the lost mass. However, they only marginally elevated their food intake and consequently had reduced body weight/fat storage compared to that of the control unstarved group. This response may have been constrained by physiological factors (alimentary tract absorption capacity) or behavioural factors (perceived risk of predation). Overall the responses of the mice appeared to provide limited support for the starvation-predation trade-off model, and suggest that wood mice are much more sensitive to predation risk than they are to starvation risk. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Rationale: Addiction is characterized by persistence to seek drug reinforcement despite negative consequences. Drug-induced aberrations in approach and avoidance processing likely facilitate the sustenance of addiction pathology. Currently, the effects of repeated drug exposure on the resolution of conflicting approach and avoidance motivational signals have yet to be thoroughly investigated. Objective: The present study sought to investigate the effects of cocaine pre-exposure on conflict resolution using novel approach-avoidance paradigms. Methods: We used a novel mixed-valence conditioning paradigm to condition cocaine-pre-exposed rats to associate visuo-tactile cues with either the delivery of sucrose reward or shock punishment in the arms in which the cues were presented. Following training, exploration of an arm containing a superimposition of the cues was assessed as a measure of conflict resolution behavior. We also used a mixed-valence runway paradigm wherein cocaine-pre-exposed rats traversed an alleyway toward a goal compartment to receive a pairing of sucrose reward and shock punishment. Latency to enter the goal compartment across trials was taken as a measure of motivational conflict. Results: Our results reveal that cocaine pre-exposure attenuated learning for the aversive cue association in our conditioning paradigm and enhanced preference for mixed-valence stimuli in both paradigms. Conclusions: Repeated cocaine pre-exposure allows appetitive approach motivations to gain greater influence over behavioral output in the context of motivational conflict, due to aberrant positive and negative incentive motivational processing. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Evidence suggests that flavanol consumption can beneficially affect cognition in adults, but little is known about the effect of flavanol intake early in life. The present study aims to assess the effect of dietary flavanol intake during the gestational and postnatal period on brain structure, cerebral blood flow (CBF), cognition, and brain metabolism in C57BL/6J mice. Female wild-type C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to either a flavanol supplemented diet or a control diet at gestational day 0. Male offspring remained on the corresponding diets throughout life and performed cognitive and behavioral tests during puberty and adulthood assessing locomotion and exploration (Phenotyper and open field), sensorimotor integration (Rotarod and prepulse inhibition), and spatial learning and memory (Morris water maze, MWM). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging at 11.7T measured brain metabolism, CBF, and white and gray matter integrity in adult mice. Biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses evaluated inflammation, synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and vascular density. Cognitive and behavioral tests demonstrated increased locomotion in Phenotypers during puberty after flavanol supplementation (p=0.041) but not in adulthood. Rotarod and prepulse inhibition demonstrated no differences in sensorimotor integration. Flavanols altered spatial learning in the MWM in adulthood (p=0.039), while spatial memory remained unaffected. Additionally, flavanols increased diffusion coherence in the visual cortex (p=0.014) and possibly the corpus callosum (p=0.066) in adulthood. Mean diffusion remained unaffected, a finding that corresponds with our immunohistochemical data showing no effect on neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and vascular density. However, flavanols decreased CBF in the cortex (p=0.001) and thalamus (p=0.009) in adulthood. Brain metabolite levels and neuroinflammation remained unaffected by flavanols. These data suggest that dietary flavanols results in subtle alterations in brain structure, locomotor activity and spatial learning.

abstract={The field of personality psychology offers a wealth of robust empirical research and a successful descriptive taxonomy, but neither explains the origins of the structure of human personality nor elaborates a generative framework for predicting the specific conditions that evoke the development of distinct personality traits. Exploration of traditional personality constructs within an evolutionary adaptive individual differences framework may help fill this explanatory gap. Personality traits exhibit functional features and patterns of variation expected from psychological adaptations designed to solve survival- and reproduction-related challenges recurrently faced during our species' evolutionary history. Condition-dependent evolutionary models of personality have been proposed for decades, but only recently have begun to see empirical investigation. These models posit that species-typical psychological mechanisms take as input cues from the individual's phenotype that would have been ancestrally linked to differential cost-benefit tradeoffs of alternative personality strategies, and produce as output personality trait levels with the greatest probabilistic net benefit for the individual. This paper elaborates a more nuanced conceptual framework that builds on earlier conceptualizations of condition-dependent traits to yield new and untested hypotheses about personality trait variation and covariation. It then describes clear future research directions for empirically investigating these readily testable hypotheses. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The China Jintan Child Cohort study began in 2004 with 1656 pre-school participants and a research focus on studying the impact of environmental exposures, such as lead, on children's neurobehavioural outcomes. This population cohort now includes around 1000 of the original participants, who have been assessed three times over a period of 10 years. Since the original IJE cohort profile publication in 2010, participants have experienced a critical developmental transition from pre-school to school age and then adolescence. The study has also witnessed an increase in breadth and depth of data collection from the original aim of risk assessment. This cohort has added new directions to investigate the mechanisms and protective factors for the relationship between early health factors and child physical and mental health outcomes, with an emphasis on neurobehavioural consequences. The study now encompasses 11 domains, composed of repeated measures of the original variables and new domains of biomarkers, sleep, psychophysiology, neurocognition, personality, peer relationship, mindfulness and family dynamics. Depth of evaluation has increased from parent/teacher report to self/peer report and intergenerational family report. Consequently, the cohort has additional directions to include: (i) classmates of the original cohort participants for peer relationship assessment; and (ii) parental and grandparental measures to assess personality and dynamics within families. We welcome interest in our study and ask investigators to contact the corresponding author for additional information on data acquisition. © The Author 2015; all rights reserved.

abstract={Prenatal exposure to maternal immune activation (MIA) increases the risk of schizophrenia and autism in the offspring. The MIA rodent model provides a valuable tool to directly test the postnatal consequences of exposure to an early inflammatory insult; and examine novel preventative strategies. Here we tested the hypotheses that behavioural differences in the MIA mouse model are accompanied by in vivo and ex vivo alterations in brain biochemistry; and that these can be prevented by a post-weaning diet enriched with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). The viral analogue PolyI:C (POL) or saline (SAL) was administered to pregnant mice on gestation day 9. Half the resulting male offspring (POL = 21; SAL = 17) were weaned onto a conventional lab diet (n-6 PUFA); half were weaned onto n-3 PUFA-enriched diet. In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy measures were acquired prior to behavioural tests; glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) and tyrosine hydroxylase protein levels were measured ex vivo. The main findings were: (i) Adult MIA-exposed mice fed a standard diet had greater N-acetylaspartate/creatine (Cr) and lower myo-inositol/Cr levels in the cingulate cortex in vivo. (ii) The extent of these metabolite differences was correlated with impairment in prepulse inhibition. (iii) MIA-exposed mice on the control diet also had higher levels of anxiety and altered levels of GAD67 ex vivo. (iv) An n-3 PUFA diet prevented all the in vivo and ex vivo effects of MIA observed. Thus, n-3 PUFA dietary enrichment from early life may offer a relatively safe and non-toxic approach to limit the otherwise persistent behavioural and biochemical consequences of prenatal exposure to inflammation. This result may have translational importance.},

abstract={Parasite dynamics can be mediated by host behaviours such as sociality, and seasonal changes in aggregation may influence risk of parasite exposure. We used little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) captured during the autumn mating/swarming period to test the hypothesis that seasonal and demographic-based variation in sociality affect ectoparasitism. We predicted that ectoparasitism would: (1) be higher for adult females and young of the year (YOY) than adult males because of female coloniality; (2) increase for adult males throughout swarming because of increasing contact with females; (3) decrease for adult females and YOY throughout swarming because of reduced coloniality and transmission of individual ectoparasites to males; (4) be similar for male and female YOY because vertical transmission from adult females should be similar. Ectoparasitism was lowest for adult males and increased for males during swarming, but some effects of demographic were unexpected. Contrary to our prediction, ectoparasitism increased for adult females throughout swarming and YOY males also hosted fewer ectoparasites compared with adult and YOY females. Interestingly, females in the best body condition had the highest parasite loads. Our results suggest that host energetic constraints associated with future reproduction affect pre-hibernation parasite dynamics in bats. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2015.},

abstract={Summary Hunger is a complex motivational state that drives multiple behaviors. The sensation of hunger is caused by an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. One immediate response to hunger is increased food consumption. Hunger also modulates behaviors related to food seeking such as increased locomotion and enhanced sensory sensitivity in both insects [1-5] and vertebrates [6, 7]. In addition, hunger can promote the expression of food-associated memory [8, 9]. Although progress is being made [10], how hunger is represented in the brain and how it coordinates these behavioral responses is not fully understood in any system. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster to identify neurons encoding hunger. We found a small group of neurons that, when activated, induced a fed fly to eat as though it were starved, suggesting that these neurons are downstream of the metabolic regulation of hunger. Artificially activating these neurons also promotes appetitive memory performance in sated flies, indicating that these neurons are not simply feeding command neurons but likely play a more general role in encoding hunger. We determined that the neurons relevant for the feeding effect are serotonergic and project broadly within the brain, suggesting a possible mechanism for how various responses to hunger are coordinated. These findings extend our understanding of the neural circuitry that drives feeding and enable future exploration of how state influences neural activity within this circuit. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Underserved minority communities have few resources for addressing comorbidity risk reduction among long-term cancer survivors. To address this community need, we developed and piloted the Bronx Oncology Living Daily (BOLD) Healthy Living program, the first known diabetes prevention and control program to target cancer survivors and co-survivors in Bronx County, NY. The program aimed to facilitate lifestyle change and improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL) through weekly group nutrition education (60–90 min) and exercise (60 min) classes. We examined baseline characteristics of participants using simple descriptive statistics and evaluated program implementation and impact using the Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. The curriculum, which drew from the social-ecological framework and motivational and cognitive behavioral strategies, consisted of 12 culturally and medically tailored modules with options for implementation as a 12- or 4-week program. Seven programs (four 12 weeks and three 4 weeks in length, respectively) were implemented at five community site locations. Sixty-six cancer survivors and 17 cancer co-survivors (mean age 60.5 ± 10.2 years) enrolled in one of the programs. Most participants were female (95.2 %) minority (55.4 % black, 26.5 % Hispanic/Latino) breast cancer survivors (75.7 %). Median program attendance was 62.5 % and did not significantly differ by program length; however, 67.3 % of participants achieved ≥60 % attendance among the 12-week programs, compared to 41.9 % among the 4-week programs, and this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.02). Overall, participants reported significant pre/post improvements in perceived health as good/excellent (66.0 to 75.5 %; p = 0.001) and borderline significant decreases in perceived pain as moderate/severe (45.5 to 38.2 %; p = 0.05). More than 90 % of participants reported that the program helped them to achieve their short-term goals, motivated them to engage in healthier behaviors, and felt that the nutrition and exercise classes were relevant to their needs. These results indicate that a short-term lifestyle intervention program for adult cancer survivors was acceptable in our community and motivated cancer survivors to improve their HRQoL. The curriculum can be used as a tool to facilitate development of similar programs in the future. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Maternal nutritional status (MNS) is a strong predictor of growth and development in the first 1000 days of life and may influence susceptibility to non-communicable diseases in adulthood. However, the role of nutrition during this window of developmental plasticity in Africa is unclear. This paper reviews published data to address whether maternal nutrition during the first 1000 days is important for Africa, with a focus on MNS and its associations with fetal growth and birth, neonatal and infant outcomes. A systematic approach was used to search the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, SciSearch and Cochrane Library. In all, 26 studies met the inclusion criteria for the specific objectives. MNS in Africa showed features typical of the epidemiological transition: higher prevalences of maternal overweight and obesity and lower underweight, poor diet quality 1 and high anaemia prevalence. Maternal body mass index and greater gestational weight gain (GWG) were positively associated with birth weight; however, maternal overweight and obesity were associated with increased risk of macrosomia and intrauterine growth restriction. Maternal anaemia was associated with lower birth weight. Macro-and micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy were associated with improvements in GWG, birth weight and mortality risk. Data suggest poor MNS in Africa and confirms the importance of the first 1000 days as a critical period for nutritional intervention to improve growth, birth outcomes and potential future health risk. However, there is a lack of data beyond birth and a need for longitudinal data through infancy to 2 years of age. © 2015 Cambridge University Press and the International Society for Developmental Origins of Health and Disease.},

abstract={Some individuals exhibit a weak satiety response to food and may be susceptible to overconsumption. The current study identified women showing consistently low or high satiety responses to standardised servings of food across four separate days and compared them on behavioural, psychological and physiological risk factors for overeating and future weight gain. In a crossover design, 30 female participants (age: 28.0 ± 10.6; body mass index (BMI): 23.1 ± 3.0) recorded sensations of hunger in the post-prandial period following four graded energy level breakfasts. Satiety quotients were calculated to compare individuals on satiety responsiveness across conditions. Body composition, resting metabolic rate (RMR), energy intake, food reward and craving, and eating behaviour traits were assessed under controlled laboratory conditions. A distinct low satiety phenotype (LSP) was identified with good consistency across separate study days. These individuals had a higher RMR, greater levels of disinhibition and reported feeling lower control over food cravings. Further, they consumed more energy and exhibited greater wanting for high-fat food. The inverse pattern of characteristics was observed in those exhibiting a consistently high satiety phenotype (HSP). Weak satiety responsiveness is a reliable trait identifiable using the satiety quotient. The LSP was characterised by distinct behavioural and psychological characteristics indicating a risk for overeating, compared to HSP. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Obesity is a chronic disease that has been associated with chronic stress and hypercaloric diet (HD) consumption. Increased ingestion of food containing sugar and fat ingredients (comfort food) is proposed to "compensate" chronic stress effects. However, this eating habit may increase body fat depositions leading to obesity. This study evaluated behavioral/physiological parameters seeking to establish whether there is an association between the effects of HD intake and stress, and to test the hypothesis that the development of anxious behavior and obesity during chronic stress periods depends on the type of diet. Sixty-day-old male Wistar rats (n = 100) were divided into four groups: standard chow, hypercaloric diet, chronic stress/standard chow and chronic stress/hypercaloric diet. Chronic stress was induced by restraint stress exposure for 1 h/day, for 80 d. At the end of this period, rat behavior was evaluated using open-field and plus-maze tests. The results showed that HD alone increased weight gain and adipose deposition in subcutaneous and mesenteric areas. However, stress reduced weight gain and adipose tissue in these areas. HD also increased naso-anal length and concurrent stress prevented this. Behavioral data indicated that stress increased anxiety-like behaviors and comfort food reduced these anxiogenic effects; locomotor activity increased in rats fed with HD. Furthermore, HD decreased corticosterone levels and stress increased adrenal weight. The data indicate that when rats are given HD and experience chronic stress this association reduces the pro-obesogenic effects of HD, and decreases adrenocortical activity. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of sodium butyrate on depressive-like behavior and mitochondrial alteration parameters in animal models of depression induced by maternal deprivation or chronic mild stress in Wistar rats. maternal deprivation was established by separating pups from their mothers for 3 h daily from postnatal day 1 to day 10. Chronic mild stress was established by water deprivation, food deprivation, restraint stress, isolation and flashing lights. Sodium butyrate or saline was administered twice a day for 7 days before the behavioral tests. Depressive behavior was evaluated using the forced swim test. The activity of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes (succinate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase) and of mitochondrial chain complexes (I, II, II-III and IV) was measured in the striatum of rats. From these analyses it can be observed that sodium butyrate reversed the depressive-like behavior observed in both animal models of depression. Additionally, maternal deprivation and chronic mild stress inhibited mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and increased the activity of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes. Sodium butyrate treatment reversed -maternal deprivation and chronic mild stress- induced dysfunction in the striatum of rats. In conclusion, sodium butyrate showed antidepressant effects in maternal deprivation and chronic mild stress-treated rats, and this effect can be attributed to its action on the neurochemical pathways related to depression. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Temperature, food quantity and quality play important roles in insect growth and survival, influencing population dynamics as well as interactions with other community members. However, the interaction between temperature and diet and its ecological consequences have been poorly documented. Toxorhynchites are well-known biocontrol agents for container-inhabiting mosquito larvae. We found that Toxorhynchites haemorrhoidalis larvae (Diptera: Culicidae) inhabiting water-filled rosettes of tank bromeliads catch and eat prey of both aquatic (mosquito larvae) and terrestrial origin (ants), using distinct predatory methods. They carried out frontal attacks on ants, but ambushed mosquito larvae. In choice tests, T. haemorrhoidalis favored terrestrial prey. Temperature had a significant effect on predator development and survival through its interaction with diet, but did not alter the preference for ants. T. haemorrhoidalis larvae emerged quickly when fed only mosquito larvae, whereas all individuals died before pupation when fed only ants. We conclude that behavioral factors (i.e., attraction to ants that disturb the surface of the water) overtake physiological factors (i.e., the adverse outcome of elevated temperature and an ant-based diet) in determining a predator's response to temperature:diet interactions. Finally, because T. haemorrhoidalis larvae preferentially feed on terrestrial insects in tank bromeliads, mosquito larvae may indirectly benefit from predation release. © 2015 Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation Inc.},

abstract={Stopover behavior of migrant birds is influenced by their energetic condition, but also by extrinsic factors, including weather conditions and habitat attributes such as vegetation structure, microclimates, predation pressure, competition, and food availability. Anthropogenic habitats may differ from natural habitats in these attributes, which could promote differing stopover behaviors for migrants in the two habitat types and affect overall habitat suitability. We used radio-telemetry to measure stopover behaviors of fall migrant yellow-rumped warblers Setophaga coronata in native riparian corridor woodlands (corridors) and anthropogenic woodlots (woodlots) in the Northern Prairie region. We measured stopover duration, movement rate, and temporary home range size for birds in both habitat types by attaching radio-transmitters and relocating birds to either corridor (n = 17) or woodlot (n = 16) study sites. We used AICC to rank null, global, and reduced models, which included habitat type, energetic condition, habitat size, year, date, and movement rate (for stopover duration analyses only) as explanatory variables. Model rankings showed that habitat type was not included in any of the top models (ΔAICC &lt; 2) for movement behavior, temporary home range size, or stopover duration, which suggests similar functional habitat quality between the two habitat types. These data add similar behavioral responses for birds in the two habitat types to similar fattening rates and stress physiology, further confirming similar suitability of native and anthropogenic woodland habitats in this region as stopover habitat. We also applied logistic regression with a model selection approach, including cloud cover, tail wind component, temperature, and barometric pressure as independent variables, and departure decision as the dependent variable, to evaluate the effects of weather variables on departure. Model selection suggested that cloud cover is a prominent factor affecting departure decisions and the other variables may also influence departure decisions of yellow-rumped warblers from inland stopover sites. © 2015 Nordic Society Oikos.},

abstract={Daphnia lumholtzi is an exotic species of zooplankton that was first introduced in Texas, U.S.A., and has since spread across most of the areas in the country. Research has focussed on the importance of the production of morphological defences in response to predator exposure as a key explanation for the spread of this species. Very little is known about the influence of other common environmental stressors on the fitness of this species or the potential role for genetic variation in plasticity in the spread of this species. We assessed the effects of two common environmental stressors, invertebrate predator cues and increasing concentrations of cyanobacteria, on the life-history traits in D. lumholtzi. This study also included clones from three reservoirs in Texas to measure potential genetic variation in plasticity. We found that the expression of life-history traits depended strongly upon the combined effects of predator exposure and food quality. Increasing concentrations of cyanobacteria resulted in delayed maturation, slower growth, a smaller size at maturation, declines in clutch size and slower rate of population growth. Yet, such declines were much smaller in the presence of predator cues. Divergent responses observed were the size of defence traits; Daphnia reared in the absence of predator cues increased the size of spines as the concentrations of cyanobacteria increased, while the opposite pattern was observed in the presence of predator cues. This study also revealed extensive genetic variation in the magnitude and direction of phenotypic responses to predators and cyanobacteria. These latter results illustrate that significant clonal variation in plasticity may help promote the spread of this species. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Recent studies have suggested that the cerebellum contributes to the central processing of pain, including pain-related learning and memory processes. As a complex experience with multiple emotional and cognitive facets, the response to pain and its underlying neural correlates differ between men and women. However, it remains poorly understood whether and to what extent sex differences exist in the cerebellar contribution to pain-related associative learning processes. In the present conditioning study with experimental abdominal pain as unconditioned stimuli (US), we assessed sex-dependent differences in behavioral and neural responses to conditioned warning and safety cues in healthy volunteers. The results revealed that in response to visual stimuli signaling safety from abdominal pain (CS-), women showed enhanced cerebellar activation in lobules I-IV, V, VI, VIIIa, IX and X as well as Crus II and the dentate nucleus, which are mostly representative of somatomotor networks. On the other hand, men showed enhanced neural activation in lobules I-IV, VI, VIIb, VIIIb, IX as well as Crus I and II in response to CS-, which are representative of frontoparietal and ventral attention networks. No sex differences were observed in response to pain-predictive warning signals (CS+). Similarly, men and women did not differ in behavioral measures of conditioning, including conditioned changes in CS valence and contingency awareness. Together, we could demonstrate that the cerebellum is involved in associative learning processes of conditioned anticipatory safety from pain and mediates sex differences in the underlying neural processes. Given the high prevalence of chronic pain conditions in women, these results may contribute to improve our understanding of the acquisition and manifestation of chronic abdominal pain syndromes. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..},

The current study examined how maternal feeding style and infant temperament independently and interactively predicted the age at which infants were introduced to solid food. Data from 115 predominately white, middle-class mothers were collected when infants were 4 and 6 months of age. The timing of solid food introduction was positively correlated with mothers' age, education, breastfeeding at 4 months, self-reported responsiveness to infants' hunger and satiety cues, and negatively correlated with mothers' pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), beliefs about feeding infants solid food prior to 6 months of age, and infants' temperamental motor reactivity. When controlling for maternal age, education, pre-pregnancy BMI, and milk feeding method at 4 months, the timing of solid food introduction was negatively predicted by mothers' beliefs about feeding solid food prior to 6 months of age. Exploratory interaction analyses suggested that infant temperament marginally moderated maternal feeding style in predicting the timing of solid food introduction. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Objective The objectives were to identify and predict patterns of weight-control behavior in 15 years old (yo) girls and to examine weight-control group differences in energy intake. Method Participants included 166 girls assessed every 2 years (ys) from age 5 to 15. Latent class analysis was used to identify patterns of weight-control behaviors. Antecedent variables (e.g., inhibitory control at 7 ys), and concurrent variables (e.g., BMI and dietary intake at 15 ys) were included as predictors. Assessments were a combination of survey, interview, and laboratory measures. Results Latent class analysis (LCA) identified four classes of weight-control behaviors, nondieters (26%), and three dieting groups, namely lifestyle (16%), dieters (43%), and extreme dieters (17%). Levels of restraint, weight concerns, and dieting frequency increased across groups, from nondieters to extreme dieters. Body mass index (BMI) at 5 ys and inhibitory control at 7 ys predicted weight-control group at 15 ys; for example, with every one point decrease in inhibitory control, girls were twice as likely to be extreme dieters than nondieters. Girls in the extreme dieters group were mostly classified as under-reporters and had the lowest self-reported intake, but ate significantly more in the laboratory. Discussion Among 15 yo girls, "dieting" includes a range of both healthy and unhealthy behaviors. Risk factors for membership in a weight-control group are present as early as 5 ys. Patterns of intake in the laboratory support the view that lower reported energy intake by extreme dieters is likely due under-reporting as an intent to decrease intake, not actual decreased intake. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={It is believed that the amyloid β-protein (Aβ) plays a causative role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP), a substrate of Aβ, and β-secretase and β-secretase complex proteins, which process AβPP to generate Aβ, are all membrane proteins. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that alterations in brain lipid metabolism modulate AβPP and/or Aβ metabolism. However, the role of cellular polyunsaturated fatty acids in AβPP processing has not been completely understood yet.We report here that 4 months of treatment of Tg2576 mice with an arachidonic acid (ARA)-or a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-containing (ARA+ or DHA+) diet prevented memory impairment at 13 months of age. Although, AβPP processing to generate soluble AβPP and induce Aβ synthesis was enhanced, Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio decreased in 14-monthold Tg2576 mice fed with the ARA+ or DHA+ diet. The ARA+ or DHA+ diet did not alter the AβPP levels and the expression levels of Aβ-degrading enzymes. In cortical primary neuron cultures, ARA or DHA treatment also increased soluble AβPP and Aβ1-40 levels, and decreased Aβ 1-42/Aβ 1-40 ratio, which are similar to what were observed in Tg2576 mice fed with ARA+ or DHA+ diet. These findings suggest that not only the DHA+ diet, but also the ARA+ diet could prevent cognitive dysfunction in Tg2576 mice through the alteration of AβPP processing.},

abstract={Predicting the impacts of climate change on communities requires understanding how temperature affects predator–prey interactions under different biotic conditions. In cases of size-specific predation, environmental influences on the growth rate of one or both species can determine predation rates. For example, warming increases top–down control of food webs, although this depends on resource availability for prey, as increased resources may allow prey to reach a size refuge. Moreover, because the magnitude of inducible defenses depends on predation rates and resource availability for prey, temperature and resource levels also affect phenotypic plasticity. To examine these issues, we manipulated the presence/absence of predatory Hynobius retardatus salamander larvae and herbivorous Rana pirica tadpoles at two temperatures and three basal resource levels. and measured their morphology, behavior, growth and survival. Prior work has shown that both species express antagonistic plasticity against one another in which salamanders enlarge their gape width and tadpoles increase their body width to reach a size-refuge. We found that increased temperatures increased predation rates, although this was counteracted by high basal resource availability, which further decreased salamander growth. Surprisingly, salamanders caused tadpoles to grow larger and express more extreme defensive phenotypes as resource levels decreased under warming, most likely due to their increased risk of predation. Thus, temperature and resources influenced defensive phenotype expression and its impacts on predator and prey growth by affecting their interaction strength. Our results indicate that basal resource levels can modify the impacts of increased temperatures on predator–prey interactions and its consequences for food webs. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Food odors stimulate appetite and innate food-seeking behavior in hungry animals. The smell of food also induces salivation and release of gastric acid and insulin. Conversely, sustained odor exposure may induce satiation. We demonstrate novel effects of food odors on food ingestion, metabolism and endocrine signaling in Drosophila melanogaster. Acute exposure to attractive vinegar odor triggers a rapid and transient increase in circulating glucose, and a rapid upregulation of genes encoding the glucagon-like hormone adipokinetic hormone (AKH), four insulin-like peptides (DILPs) and some target genes in peripheral tissues. Sustained exposure to food odors, however, decreases food intake. Hunger-induced strengthening of synaptic signaling from olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) to brain neurons increases food-seeking behavior, and conversely fed flies display reduced food odor sensitivity and feeding. We show that increasing the strength of OSN signaling chronically by genetic manipulation of local peptide neuromodulation reduces feeding, elevates carbohydrates and diminishes lipids. Furthermore, constitutively strengthened odor sensitivity altered gene transcripts for AKH, DILPs and some of their targets. Thus, we show that food odor can induce a transient anticipatory endocrine response, and that boosted sensitivity to this odor affects food intake, as well as metabolism and hormonal signaling. © 2015 Springer Basel.},

abstract={Dispersal decisions underlie the spatial dynamics of metacommunities. Prey individuals may disperse to reduce the risk of either predation or starvation, and both of these risks may depend on conspecific density. Surprisingly, there is little theory examining how dispersal rates should change in response to the combined effects of predation and changes in conspecific density. We develop such a model and show that, under certain conditions, predators may induce dispersal at low prey densities but not high prey densities. We then experimentally manipulate the density of the ciliate Paramecium aurelia and the perceived presence of its predator, the flatworm Stenostomum virginiamum, in a two-patch metacommunity to parameterise the model. Paramecium dispersed in response to Stenostomum at low densities, but they reduced their dispersal in response to predation risk at high predator densities. By applying our model to the empirical data, we show that this switch in dispersal strategy, linked to increases in prey density, occurred because predators increased the difficulty or risk of dispersal. Together, the model and experiment reveal that the effects of predators on dispersal are contingent on prey density. Previous studies have sometimes reported an increase in dispersal rate when predation risk is elevated, and other times a decrease in dispersal rate. Our demonstration of a switch point, with predation risk increasing dispersal at low prey densities but reducing dispersal above a threshold of prey density, may reconcile the diversity of prey dispersal behaviours reported in these previous investigations and observed in nature. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Background: Variation in early nutrition is known to play an important role in shaping the behavioural development of individuals. Parental prey selection may have long-lasting behavioural influences. In birds foraging on arthropods, for instance, the specific prey types, e.g. spiders and caterpillars, matter as they have different levels of taurine which may have an effect on personality development. Here we investigated how naturally occurring variation in the amounts of spiders and caterpillars, provisioned to nestlings at day 4 and 8 after hatching, is related to the response to handling stress in a wild passerine, the great tit (Parus major). Broods were cross-fostered in a split-brood design allowing us to separate maternal and genetic effects from early rearing effects. Adult provisioning behaviour was monitored on day four and day eight after hatching using video recordings. Individual nestlings were subjected to a handling stress test at an age of 14 days, which is a validated proxy for exploratory behaviour as an adult. Results: Variation in handling stress was mainly determined by the rearing environment. We show that, contrary to our predictions, not the amount of spider biomass, but the amount of caterpillar biomass delivered per nestling significantly affected individual performance in the stress test. Chicks provisioned with lower amounts of caterpillars exhibited a stronger stress response, reflecting faster exploratory behaviour later on in life, than individuals who received larger amounts of caterpillars. Conclusions: These results suggest that natural variation in parental behaviour in wild birds modulates the developmental trajectories of their offspring's personality via food provisioning. Since parental provisioning behaviour might also reflect the local environmental conditions, provisioning behaviour may influence how nestlings respond to these local environmental conditions. © 2015 Oers et al.},

Often such ornaments develop already early in life and thus are affected by nutritional conditions experienced then. Individuals thus should benefit by compensating as soon as possible for poor initial development of ornaments, to be attractive already at sexual maturity. Here, we tested whether early nutritional stress affects the cheek patch size of male Zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), which are important in mate choice, and whether a small cheek patch size early on is compensated at sexual maturation. Furthermore we tested whether exploration behaviour is affected by such a compensation, as shown for other compensatory growth trajectories. Results: Zebra finch males which were raised under poorer nutritional conditions initially expressed smaller cheek patches at day 50 post-hatching but then compensated in cheek patch size already at 65 days, i.e. when becoming sexually mature. Furthermore, compensatory growth in cheek patch during adolescence was negatively correlated with activity and exploration behaviour, measured in a novel environment. Conclusion: This compensation in cheek patch size benefits male attractiveness but also was related to less exploration behaviour, an established proxy for avian personality traits. We discuss the possibility that compensatory priorities exist so that not all deficits from a bad start are caught-up at the same time. Resource allocation to compensate for poorly expressed traits is likely to have evolved to optimise traits by the time they are most beneficial. © 2015 Krause et al.},

abstract={Apex predators can impact smaller predators via lethal effects that occur through direct killing, and non-lethal effects that arise when fear-induced behavioural and physiological changes reduce the fitness of smaller predators. A general outcome of asymmetrical competition between co-existing predator species is that larger predators tend to suppress the abundances of smaller predators. Here, we investigate interference effects that an apex predator, the dingo (Canis dingo), has on the acquisition of food and water by the smaller red fox (Vulpes vulpes), by exposing free-ranging foxes to the odour of dingoes and conspecifics in an arid environment. Using giving-up densities we show that foxes foraged more apprehensively at predator-odour treatments than unscented controls, but their food intake did not differ between dingo- and fox-odour treatments. Using video analysis of fox behaviour at experimental water stations we show that foxes spent more time engaged in exploration behaviour at stations scented with fox odour and spent more time drinking at water stations scented with dingo odour. Our results provide support for the idea that dingo odour exerts a stronger interference effect on foxes than conspecific odour, but suggest that the odours of both larger dingoes and unfamiliar conspecifics curtailed foxes’ acquisition of food resources. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Background: There is a need to identify effective behavioural strategies for weight loss. Self-weighing may be one such strategy. Purpose: To examine the effectiveness of self-weighing for weight loss. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials that included self-weighing as an isolated intervention or as a component within an intervention. We used sub groups to analyse differences in frequency of weighing instruction (daily and weekly) and also whether including accountability affected weight loss. Results: Only one study examined self-weighing as a single strategy and there was no evidence it was effective (-0.5 kg 95 % CI -1.3 to 0.3). Four trials added self-weighing/self-regulation techniques to multi-component programmes and resulted in a significant difference of -1.7 kg (95 % CI -2.6 to -0.8). Fifteen trials comparing multi-component interventions including self-weighing compared with no intervention or minimal control resulted in a significant mean difference of -3.4 kg (95 % CI -4.2 to -2.6). There was no significant difference in the interventions with weekly or daily weighing. In trials which included accountability there was significantly greater weight loss (p=0.03). Conclusions: There is a lack of evidence of whether advising self-weighing without other intervention components is effective. Adding self-weighing to a behavioural weight loss programme may improve weight loss. Behavioural weight loss programmes that include self-weighing are more effective than minimal interventions. Accountability may improve the effectiveness of interventions that include self-weighing. © 2015 Madigan et al.},

abstract={Background/Aims: Telomere biology plays a fundamental role in genomic integrity and cell physiology. The newborn setting of telomere length (TL) likely has important implications for telomere dynamics over the lifespan; however, its determinants are poorly understood. Folate is essential for DNA integrity. The maternal compartment is the only source of folate for the developing fetus. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that variation in maternal folate during pregnancy is associated with newborn TL. Methods: A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted in 119 mother-newborn dyads. Eligible mothers were enrolled at 9.5 (SD ±2.1) weeks gestation and followed through birth. Concentrations of maternal serum folate were measured in the first trimester of pregnancy. Newborn telomere length was measured in cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC). Results: After accounting for the effects of other established determinants of newborn TL, each 10 ng/ml increase in maternal total folate was associated with a 5.8% increase in median TL (p = 0.03). The median TL in newborns of mother in the lowest quartile of total folate levels was approximately 10% shorter than that of newborns of mothers in the highest folate quartile. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that fetal TL exhibits developmental plasticity, and provide evidence that maternal nutrition may exert a 'programming' effect on this system. © 2015 S.

abstract={Associative learning is essential for resource acquisition, predator avoidance and reproduction in a wide diversity of species, and is therefore a key target for evolutionary and comparative cognition research. Automated operant devices can greatly enhance the study of associative learning and yet their use has been mainly restricted to laboratory conditions. We developed a portable, weatherproof, battery-operated operant device and conducted the first fully automated colour-associative learning experiment using free-ranging individuals in the wild. We used the device to run a colour discrimination task in a monitored population of tits (Paridae). Over two winter months, 80 individuals from four species recorded a total of 5,128 trials. Great tits (Parus major) were more likely than other species to visit the devices and engage in trials, but there were no sex or personality biases in the sample of great tits landing at the devices and registering key pecks. Juveniles were more likely than adults to visit the devices and to register trials. Individuals that were successful at solving a novel technical problem in captivity (lever-pulling) learned faster than non-solvers when at the operant devices in the wild, suggesting cross-contextual consistency in learning performance in very different tasks. There was no significant effect of personality or sex on learning rate, but juveniles' choice accuracy tended to improve at a faster rate than adults. We discuss how customisable automated operant devices, such as the one described here, could prove to be a powerful tool in evolutionary ecology studies of cognitive traits, especially among inquisitive species such as great tits. © 2015 Morand-Ferron et al.},

abstract={Objective: Diagnosis of an eating disorder (ED) has been associated with differences in social cognition. To date research investigating social cognition and ED has mainly employed patient and recovered samples. It is therefore unclear whether differences in social cognition are present prior to onset of ED, potentially contributing to development, or whether differences observed are a consequence of the disorder. We aimed to further explore whether individuals at high-risk for ED present social cognition characteristics previously found in ED groups. Methods: Our sample was drawn from a population-based cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Data on maternal ED behaviors over the lifetime were collected through in-depth clinical interviews (n = 1128) conducted using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM disorders (SCID), and were used to categorize mothers according to ED behaviors over the lifetime: Restricting and Excessive Exercising (n = 58), Purging (n = 70), Binge-eating (n = 72), Binging and Purging (n = 66), no ED (n = 862). High-risk status of children was determined using these maternal lifetime behavioral phenotypes. Children at high-risk (maternal ED exposure) were compared to children at low-risk (born to mothers with no ED) on three measures of social cognition: the Social Communication Disorders Checklist (SCDC) (n = 922), the faces subtest of the Diagnostic Analysis of Non-Verbal Accuracy (DANVA) (n = 722), and the Emotional Triangles Task (n = 750). Results: Children at high-risk for ED showed poorer performance on measures of social cognition compared to children at low-risk. Maternal lifetime binge-eating, and maternal lifetime binging and purging were associated with poorer social communication in children (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.0, 5.7, p = 0.05; and OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.1, 6.5, p = 0.03 respectively). Maternal binging and purging was also found to be associated with differential facial emotion processing and poorer recognition of fear from social motion cues (B: −0.7, 95% CI: −1.1, −0.2, p = 0.004). Discussion: Children at high-risk for ED showed slight differences in some areas of social cognition when compared to children at low-risk. Characteristic patterns in social cognition are present in children at high-risk for ED, particularly among children whose mothers have binge-eating and purging behaviors over the lifetime. Our findings support the hypothesis that these differences may be part of an intermediate phenotype for ED: perhaps contributing to development, or perhaps indexing a shared liability with psychiatric disorders characterized by abnormal social cognition. © 2015 Kothari, Barona, Treasure and Micali.},

Many studies are now beginning to explore the gene–environment interactions, which may mediate early-life exposure to risk factors, such as nutritional deficiencies and later development of behavioral problems in children and adults. In this paper, we review the current literature on the role of epigenetics in the development of psychopathology, with a specific focus on the potential for epigenetic modifications to link nutrition and brain development. We propose a conceptual framework whereby epigenetic modifications (e.g., DNA methylation) mediate the link between micro- and macro-nutrient deficiency early in life and brain dysfunction (e.g., structural aberration, neurotransmitter perturbation), which has been linked to development of behavior problems later on in life. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Problematic eating behaviours during early childhood could be mediators of poor dietary habits. This study aims to prospectively relate early eating behaviours with fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake and a healthy diet variety score of children aged between 4 and 5 years. Eating behaviours were assessed in three European birth cohorts (Generation XXI from Portugal, ALSPAC from the UK and EDEN from France) at 4-6, 12-15, 24 and 48-54 months of age, based on the child's feeding difficulties, mother's perception of child's poor eating (eating small quantities at each meal, not eating enough or needing to be stimulated to eat), food refusal and difficulties in the establishment of daily food routines. Daily servings of F&V (>1 v. ≤1 serving/d, except in Generation XXI: >3 v. ≤3) and the Healthy Plate Variety Score (categorised by the median score of each sample) were calculated using FFQ. Associations were tested by logistic regressions adjusted for maternal age, education, smoking during pregnancy, any breast-feeding and the child's z-score BMI at 4-5 years of age. Children with more feeding difficulties, poor eating, food refusal/neophobia and difficulties in establishing a daily routine at 12-15, 24 and 48-54 months of age had in general lower F&V intake at 4-5 years of age. The association with vegetables was slightly stronger than with fruits. These early feeding problems were also inversely associated with the variety score at 4-5 years of age, particularly when eating behaviours were reported after 12-15 months of age. A better understanding of these early feeding difficulties may help define strategies to increase the dietary quality in children. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Sociability in animals provides benefits such as reduced predation risk and increased foraging efficiency. During the early stages of invasion, individuals are often vulnerable as part of a small population (Allee effects); associations with native heterospecifics could mitigate some of the disadvantages of small population size and thereby increase the chances of establishment success. Here we explored two potential benefits of heterospecific association to guppies, Poecilia reticulata, a very successful invasive species. We first investigated whether guppies can exploit visual cues from morphologically similar heterospecific individuals as effectively as those from conspecifics. We next tested whether willingness to explore an unfamiliar environment depends on whether guppies are accompanied by conspecifics or heterospecifics. Our results show that guppies can acquire information on food availability from another species, as well as from conspecifics. We also found that guppies engaged in exploratory behaviour more quickly if the habitat had plants in it, and were more likely to associate if it was unstructured; there was, however, no difference in the frequency with which the focal fish was accompanied by a conspecific or a heterospecific individual. These results show that guppies respond to these heterospecifics as they do with conspecifics. Our study reveals some of the traits that could make an invader successful and potentially help to identify species with a higher potential to become established outside their native range. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Cognitive mechanisms underlying the choice of movement patterns between resource sites for nonhuman primates are not well understood. Specifically, the influence of landscape features on decision making and spatial memory of naturally ranging animals has not been explicitly investigated. We evaluated three models of bearded capuchin monkey, Sapajus libidinosus, movement decisions that incorporated varying degrees of landscape and memory influences, and we conducted a field experiment using a novel call-back technique to test these influences. The movements and spatial decisions of the monkeys were modelled between temporal stop points and spatial change points during natural travel using straight-line path, a minimum-resistance path and landscape-perceiving path models. For these movement models, resistance was calculated as the inverse of habitat suitability, a surface based on the natural movement patterns of the study group. Of the three models, natural travel most closely resembled the straight-line path model in its landscape resistance, but not in its geometry. This result indicates that while the monkeys travel in zones of low resistance, they do not minimize distance or landscape resistance between travel nodes. When monkeys were called to an artificial resource site using the call-back experiment, their travel was more linear and higher in landscape resistance. The limited quantity and high quality of the food resource in the artificial resource sites may have influenced the nature of the monkeys' travel in these experiments. We present the advantages and challenges of the call-back method of experimental analysis of animal movement and we conclude that future analyses of spatial cognition should include consideration of landscape context. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Increased frequency of eating in the absence of homeostatic need, notably through snacking, is an important contributor to overconsumption and may be facilitated by increased availability of palatable food in the obesogenic environment. Opportunistic initiation of snacking is likely to be subject to individual differences, although these are infrequently studied in laboratory-based research paradigms. This study examined psychological factors associated with opportunistic initiation of snacking, and predictors of intake in the absence of homeostatic need. Fifty adults (mean age 34.5years, mean BMI 23.9kg/m2, 56% female) participated in a snack taste test in which they ate a chocolate snack to satiation, after which they were offered an unanticipated opportunity to initiate a second eating episode. Trait and behavioural measures of self control, sensitivity to reward, dietary restraint and disinhibited eating were taken. Results showed that, contrary to expectations, those who initiated snacking were better at inhibitory control compared with those who did not initiate. However, amongst participants who initiated snacking, intake (kcal) was predicted by higher food reward sensitivity, impulsivity and BMI. These findings suggest that snacking initiation in the absence of hunger is an important contributor to overconsumption. Consideration of the individual differences promoting initiation of eating may aid in reducing elevated eating frequency in at-risk individuals. © 2015.},

abstract={Women are more likely than men to exhibit motivational disorders (e.g., anhedonia and anxiety) with limited treatment options, and to overconsume high-fat "comfort foods" to improve motivational disruptions. Unfortunately, neurobiological underpinnings for sex differences in motivational disruptions and their responses to dietary fat are poorly understood. To help bridge these fundamental knowledge gaps, we assessed behavioral and neurobiological responses to dietary fat in a hamster model of female-biased motivational lability. Relative to social housing, social separation reduced hedonic drive in a new behavioral assay, the reward investigational preference (RIP) test. Fluoxetine or desipramine treatment for 21, but not 7, days improved RIP test performance. Pharmacologic specificity in this test was shown by non-responsiveness to diazepam, tracazolate, propranolol, or naltrexone. In the anxiety-related feeding/exploration conflict (AFEC) test, social separation worsened latency to eat highly palatable food under anxiogenic conditions, but not in home cages. Social separation also reduced weight gain, food intake, and adiposity while elevating energy expenditure, assessed by caloric efficiency and indirect calorimetry. Furthermore, chronic high-fat feeding improved anhedonic and anxious responses to separation, particularly in females. In the motivation-influencing nucleus accumbens, females, but not males, exhibited a separation-induced anxiety-related decrease in Creb1 mRNA levels and an anhedonia-related decrease in δFosb mRNA levels. Consistent with its antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects on behavior, high-fat feeding elevated accumbal Creb1 and δFosb mRNA levels in females only. Another accumbal reward marker, Tlr4 mRNA, was elevated in females by high-fat feeding. These results show that social separation of hamsters provides a novel model of sex-dependent comorbid anhedonia, anxiety, and anorexia, and implicate accumbal CREB, δFosB, and TLR4.

abstract={Insects, as well as vertebrates, possess morphological, physiological and behavioural sexual dimorphisms. Because they are commonly bigger and produce eggs, female insects usually require more and specific energy intake. In addition to quantitative and qualitative requirements in food for reproduction, animals also have to avoid eating lethal toxins. The praying mantis Tenodera aridifolia is a good model to investigate sexual differences in feeding behaviour because its sexual dimorphism is marked in terms of morphology and behaviour. Here, we observed that females ate approximately four times as much prey as males. We then investigated the attacking and feeding behaviours of praying mantises by presenting mealworms injected with bitter solutions (quinine hydrochloride dihydrate or denatonium benzoate at 50 or 500. mM) as prey. We observed that males had a low level of acceptance for bitter prey: unlike females, they reduced consumption of mealworms injected with 50. mM of these bitter solutions. However, they showed higher motivation (unlike females, their rate of attack on prey increased when they reduced their consumption of mealworms). This difference in ingestion between the sexes did not seem to be due to different sensitivities for these bitter solutions (there was no detectable difference between the sexes in time taken to drink drops of these bitter solutions). Instead, this seems related to males and females having different feeding strategies based on different nutritive requirements. The possible effects of nutritional composition of prey on avoidance behaviours in predatory insects are discussed. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The consumption of palatable high-fat and high-sugar foods have increased dramatically over the past years. Overconsumption of calorically dense food contributes to increasing rates of overweight and obesity that are associated with psychiatry disorders, in particular mood and anxiety disorders. This study evaluated the impact of palatable cafeteria diet (CAF) intake on cognitive and noncognitive behaviors, as well as identified factors related to these behaviors through an evaluation of brain neurotrophic factor (BDNF, NGF, and GDNF) levels in hippocampus of mice. Male Swiss mice received two different diets during 13 weeks: standard chow (STA) and highly CAF. Posteriorly, forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), plus-maze test (PMT), open-field tests (OFT), and object recognition task (ORT) were utilized as behavioral tests. In addition, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and nerve growth factor (NGF) neurotrophins’ levels were evaluated in hippocampus of mice. The results demonstrated that mice from the CAF group showed a decrease in the immobility time in the FST and TST. Besides, mice in the CAF group spent more time in the open arms of the PMT. No significant differences were observed in the cognitive behaviors, which were evaluated in the OFT and ORT. In addition, the CAF group showed that BDNF and NGF protein levels increased in the hippocampus of mice. In conclusion, our data suggest that the consumption of palatable high-fat and high-sugar foods induces antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like behaviors, which can be related with BDNF and NGF expression increases in hippocampus of mice in the CAF group. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Intra-sexual segregation is a form of social segregation widespread among vertebrates. In the bat Myotis daubentonii, males are disproportionately abundant at higher elevations, while females are restricted to lower altitude. Intra-male segregation is also known to occur yet its ecological and behavioural determinants are unclear. We studied male segregation along a river in Central Italy where we tested the following predictions: 1. Upstream (> 1000 m a.s.l.) males will rely on scarcer prey; 2. To deal with this limitation and exploit a cooler roosting environment, they will employ more prolonged and deeper torpor than downstream (< 900 m a.s.l.) males; 3. Body condition will be better in downstream males as they forage in more productive areas; 4. To cope with less predictable foraging opportunities, upstream males will use more habitat types. Consistent with our predictions, we found that prey were less common at higher altitudes, where bats exhibited prolonged and deeper torpor. Body condition was better in downstream males than in upstream males but not in all summer months. This result reflected a decrease in downstream males' body condition over the season, perhaps due to the energy costs of reduced opportunities to use torpor and/or intraspecific competition. Downstream males mainly foraged over selected riparian vegetation whereas upstream males used a greater variety of habitats. One controversial issue is whether upstream males are excluded from lower elevations by resident bats. We tested this by translocating 10 upstream males to a downstream roost: eight returned to the high elevation site in 1-2 nights, two persisted at low altitude but did not roost with resident bats. These results are consistent with the idea of segregation due to competition. Living at high altitude allows for more effective heterothermy and may thus be not detrimental for survival, but by staying at lower altitude males increase proximity to females and potentially benefit from summer mating opportunities.

abstract={Ecological restoration attempts to recover the structure and function of ecosystems that have been degraded by human activities. A crucial test of ecosystem recovery would be to determine whether individuals in restored environments are as healthy as those in conserved environments. However, the impact of restoration on physiology of terrestrial animals has never been tested. Here, we evaluated the effect of two restoration methods on body condition measured as body size, body mass, lipid and muscle content of the spider Nephila clavipes in a tropical dry forest that has suffered chronic disturbance due to cattle grazing. We used experimental plots that had been excluded from disturbance by cattle grazing during eight years. Plots were either planted with native trees (i. e. maximal intervention), or only excluded from disturbance (i. e. minimal intervention), and were compared with control conserved (remnants of original forest) and disturbed plots (where cattle is allowed to graze). We predicted (1) better body condition in spiders of conserved and restored sites, compared to disturbed sites, and (2) better body condition in plots with maximal intervention than in plots with minimal intervention. The first prediction was not supported in males or females, and the second prediction was only supported in females: body dry mass was higher in planted than in conserved plots for spiders of both sexes and also higher that in disturbed plots for males, suggesting that plantings are providing more resources. We discuss how different life histories and environmental pressures, such as food availability, parasitism, and competition for resources can explain our contrasting findings in male and female spiders. By studying animal physiology in restoration experiments it is possible to understand the mechanistic basis of ecological and evolutionary processes that determine success of ecological restoration. © 2015 González-Tokman, Martínez-Garza.},

abstract={Background: Several parasites with complex life-cycles induce phenotypic alterations in their intermediate hosts. According to the host manipulation hypothesis, such phenotypic alterations are supposed to increase the fitness of the parasite at the expense of that of its intermediate hosts through increasing the probability of transmission to next hosts. Although the phenomenon has received a large attention, the proximate factors modulating the occurrence and intensity of host manipulation remain poorly known. It has however, been suggested that the amount of energy reserves in the intermediate host might be a key parameter, although its precise influence on the intensity of manipulation remains unclear. Dietary depletion in the host may also lead to compromise with other parasite traits, such as probability of establishing or growth or virulence. Methods: Here, we address the question through performing experimental infections of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex with two different populations of the acanthocephalan fish parasite Pomphorhynchus laevis, and manipulation of host nutritional condition. Following exposure, gammarids were given either a "standard" diet (consisting of elm leaves and chironomid larvae) or a "deprived" food treatment (deprived in proteins), and infection parameters were recorded. Once parasites reached the stage at which they become infective to their definitive host, refuge use (a behavioural trait presumably implied in trophic transmission) was assessed, and metabolic rate was measured. Results: Infected gammarids exposed to the deprived food treatment showed a lower metabolic rate, indicative of a lower body condition, compared to those exposed to the standard food treatment. Parasite size was smaller, and, depending on the population of origin of the parasites, intensity of infection was lower or mortality was higher in deprived hosts. However, food treatment had no effect on either the timing or intensity of behavioural modifications. Conclusions: Overall, while our results suggest that acanthocephalan parasites develop better in hosts in good condition, no evidence was found for an influence of host nutritional condition on host manipulation by parasites. © 2015 Labaude et al.},

abstract={Over the past decade, it has been recognized that in many animal species, individuals present consistent behavioral differences across time and/or contexts, thus defining personality traits. A general relationship seems to exist between personality and fitness in wild populations, which raises the question as to how variation in personality is maintained in the presence of selection. Fluctuating selection associated with a heterogeneous environment could contribute to maintaining personality variation, but its presence in wild populations has rarely been tested. In this 6-year study, we investigated the relationship between individual personality differences and 1 component of fitness, annual reproductive success (ARS), in a population of Siberian chipmunk Tamias sibiricus that experiences considerable annual variations in food availability. We estimated trappability - the propensity of chipmunks to enter traps - using capture-mark-recapture data, and we showed that it was repeatable over a 1-year interval. Genetic data were used to estimate parentage and thus ARS. Assuming that trappability is an indicator of boldness, we found that bolder chipmunks had higher ARS in years with low food availability, whereas lower ARS in years with high food availability. Temporally fluctuating selection therefore probably contributes to maintaining variation in boldness in the study population. © The Author 2015.

abstract={The internal state of an organism influences its perception of attractive or aversive stimuli and thus promotes adaptive behaviors that increase its likelihood of survival. The mechanisms underlying these perceptual shifts are critical to our understanding of how neural circuits support animal cognition and behavior. Starved flies exhibit enhanced sensitivity to attractive odors and reduced sensitivity to aversive odors. Here, we show that a functional remodeling of the olfactory map is mediated by two parallel neuromodulatory systems that act in opposing directions on olfactory attraction and aversion at the level of the first synapse. Short neuropeptide F sensitizes an antennal lobe glomerulus wired for attraction, while tachykinin (DTK) suppresses activity of a glomerulus wired for aversion. Thus we show parallel neuromodulatory systems functionally reconfigure early olfactory processing to optimize detection of nutrients at the risk of ignoring potentially toxic food resources. © 2015, Ko et al.},

abstract={Dietary flavonoid intake is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases, possibly by affecting metabolic health. The relative potency of different flavonoids in causing beneficial effects on energy and lipid metabolism has not been investigated. Effects of quercetin, hesperetin, epicatechin, apigenin and anthocyanins in mice fed a high-fat diet (HF) for 12 weeks were compared, relative to normal-fat diet. HF-induced body weight gain was significantly lowered by all flavonoids (17–29 %), but most by quercetin. Quercetin significantly lowered HF-induced hepatic lipid accumulation (71 %). Mesenteric adipose tissue weight and serum leptin levels were significantly lowered by quercetin, hesperetin and anthocyanins. Adipocyte cell size and adipose tissue inflammation were not affected. The effect on body weight and composition could not be explained by individual significant effects on energy intake, energy expenditure or activity. Lipid metabolism was not changed as measured by indirect calorimetry or expression of known lipid metabolic genes in liver and white adipose tissue. Hepatic expression of Cyp2b9 was strongly downregulated by all flavonoids. In conclusion, all flavonoids lowered parameters of HF-induced adiposity, with quercetin being most effective. © 2015, The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Breastfeeding is associated with reduced risk of becoming overweight or obese later in life. Breastfed babies grow more slowly during infancy than formula-fed babies. Among offspring exposed in utero to maternal glucose intolerance, prospective data on growth during infancy have been unavailable. Thus, scientific evidence is insufficient to conclude that breastfeeding reduces the risk of obesity among the offspring of diabetic mothers (ODM). To address this gap, we devised the Study of Women, Infant Feeding and Type 2 Diabetes after GDM Pregnancy and Growth of their Offspring, also known as the SWIFT Offspring Study. This prospective, longitudinal study recruited mother-infant pairs from the SWIFT Study, a prospective study of women with recent gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The goal of the SWIFT Offspring Study is to determine whether breastfeeding intensity and duration, compared with formula feeding, are related to slower growth of GDM offspring during the first year life. This article details the study design, participant eligibility, data collection, and methodologies. We also describe the baseline characteristics of the GDM mother-infant pairs. Methods: The study enrolled 466 mother-infant pairs among GDM deliveries in northern California from 2009-2011. Participants attended three in-person study exams at 6-9 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after delivery for infant anthropometry (head circumference, body weight, length, abdominal circumference and skinfold thicknesses), as well as maternal anthropometry (body weight, waist circumference and percent body fat). Mothers also completed questionnaires on health and lifestyle behaviors, including infant diet, sleep and temperament. Breastfeeding intensity and duration were assessed via several sources (diaries, telephone interviews, monthly mailings and in-person exams) from birth through the first year of life. Pregnancy course, clinical perinatal and newborn outcomes were obtained from health plan electronic medical records. Infant saliva samples were collected and stored for genetics studies. Discussion: This large, racially and ethnically diverse cohort of GDM offspring will enable evaluation of the relationship of infant feeding to growth during infancy independent of perinatal characteristics, sociodemographics and other risk factors. The longitudinal design provides the first quantitative measures of breastfeeding intensity and duration among GDM offspring during early life. © 2015 Gunderson et al.},

Bioaccumulation differences can be explained by the biological behavior of juveniles whitemouth croaker, that remain in the estuary up to maturity, which makes them good indicators of local environmental impacts (0.110 mg Kg-1 HgT). It also can be explained by differences in nutritional requirements between the different life stages of two species. The analysis showed the presence of low levels of the metal.

abstract={The risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is determined by a complex interplay involving lifestyle factors and genetic predisposition. Despite this, many studies do not consider the relative contributions of this complex array of factors to identify relationships which are important in progression or prevention of complex diseases. We aimed to describe the integrated effect of a number of lifestyle changes (weight, diet and physical activity) in the context of genetic susceptibility, on changes in glycaemic traits in overweight or obese participants following 12-months of a weight management programme. A sample of 353 participants from a behavioural weight management intervention were included in this study. A graphical Markov model was used to describe the impact of the intervention, by dividing the effects into various pathways comprising changes in proportion of dietary saturated fat, physical activity and weight loss, and a genetic predisposition score (T2DM-GPS), on changes in insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR), insulin secretion (HOMA-B) and short and long term glycaemia (glucose and HbA1c). We demonstrated the use of graphical Markov modelling to identify the importance and interrelationships of a number of possible variables changed as a result of a lifestyle intervention, whilst considering fixed factors such as genetic predisposition, on changes in traits. Paths which led to weight loss and change in dietary saturated fat were important factors in the change of all glycaemic traits, whereas the T2DM-GPS only made a significant direct contribution to changes in HOMA-IR and plasma glucose after considering the effects of lifestyle factors. This analysis shows that modifiable factors relating to body weight, diet, and physical activity are more likely to impact on glycaemic traits than genetic predisposition during a behavioural intervention.

One of the most important additional sources of food for birds in human settlements is birdfeeders. At a large spatial scale, we experimentally provided birdfeeders with four different kinds of food to analyze exploitation and use of a novel food supply provided by humans. Nine species started foraging at the new birdfeeders. The species that exploited the new feeders the fastest was the great tit. Use of novel food sources was faster in urban habitats and the presence of other feeders reduced the time until a new feeder was located. Urbanization may be associated with behavioural skills, technical innovations and neophilia resulting in faster discovery of new food sources. This process is accelerated by the experience of feeder use in the vicinity, with a strong modifying effect of the number of domestic cats.},

abstract={Comparing different rewards automatically produces dynamic relative outcome effects on behavior. Each new outcome exposure is to an updated version evaluated relative to alternatives. Relative reward effects include incentive contrast, positive induction and variety effects. The present study utilized a novel behavioral design to examine relative reward effects on a chain of operant behavior using auditory cues. Incentive contrast is the most often examined effect and focuses on increases or decreases in behavioral performance after value upshifts (positive) or downshifts (negative) relative to another outcome. We examined the impact of comparing two reward outcomes in a repeated measures design with three sessions: a single outcome and a mixed outcome and a final single outcome session. Relative reward effects should be apparent when comparing trials for the identical outcome between the single and mixed session types. An auditory cue triggered a series of operant responses (nosepoke-leverpress-food retrieval), and we measured possible contrast effects for different reward magnitude combinations. We found positive contrast for trials with the greatest magnitude differential but positive induction or variety effects in other combinations. This behavioral task could be useful for analyzing environmental or neurobiological factors involved in reward comparisons, decision-making and choice during instrumental, goal-directed action. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Collective choices of a food source are generally thought to arise from the amplification of individual preferences. However, costs associated with foraging can also influence food choice: animals faced with a poor-quality food source may either continue feeding on it (a conservative strategy), or search for a potentially more profitable one (a more risky strategy). Groups of nomadic, trail-following Malacosoma disstria caterpillars were offered a leaf of two different hosts, either side by side to determine preference, or at a distance to investigate how exploration costs affect food choice. Arenas with and without pheromone trails were used to distinguish between direct travel costs and unknown territory costs. When two leaves were side by side, groups of second-instar caterpillars showed clear preferences between host trees, whereas groups of fourth-instar larvae did not. When the two leaves were distant from each other, groups of second-instar caterpillars usually remained on the known source, irrespective of food preference or group size. These groups were more likely to relocate to a preferred food source when pheromone trails were present, suggesting that trails effectively decrease unknown territory costs. Groups of fourth-instar caterpillars were more likely to leave the known food source even when no trail was present, suggesting a developmental shift in costs associated with exploration. Our results show that collective choices reflect food preference when exploration costs are low (second-instar larvae with pheromone trails), but not when they are high (second-instar larvae without trails). Such a conservative foraging strategy can be adaptive if the exploration costs of leaving a known food source are greater than the potential benefits of discovering a better alternative, for example, in a homogenous environment like that of a tree. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Chinese Americans are the largest and fastest growing Asian American subgroup, increasing about one-third during the 2000s. Despite the slender Asian stereotype, nearly one-third of 6-to-11 year old Chinese American children were found to be overweight (above the 85th percentile in BMI). Importantly, unique and severe health risks are associated with being overweight/obese in Chinese. Unfortunately, Chinese immigrant children have been neglected in the literature on obesity. This review aimed to identify factors at various levels of the ecological model that may place Chinese immigrant children at risk for being overweight/obese in the U.S. Key contextual factors at the micro-, meso-, exo-, macro- and chronosystem were identified guided by Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory. The corresponding mediating and moderating processes among the factors were also reviewed and proposed. By presenting a conceptual framework and relevant research, this review can provide a basic framework for directing future interdisciplinary research in seeking solutions to childhood obesity within this understudied population. © 2015.},

abstract={The current study evaluated 17 loads of cull beef cows transported in Canadian winter conditions to assess in-transit temperature and humidity, evaluation of events during loading and unloading, and animal condition and bruising. Regardless of the use of boards to block ventilation holes in trailers, temperatures were higher within trailers than at ambient locations during both travel and stationary periods (P < 0.01). Boarding was associated with smaller differences in trailer temperature, compared with ambient conditions, while the trailer was traveling at highway speeds versus when trailers were stationary (P < 0.01). Moisture levels within trailers were not different from ambient conditions when loads using boarding were traveling (P < 0.01), whereas loads without boarding had a larger difference (P < 0.01). The moisture within trailers relative to ambient conditions increased when trailers were stationary compared with traveling when boarding was used (P < 0.01). The majority of cattle transported were in good body condition (97.4% within BCS of 2 to 3.5) and had calm temperaments (96.7%). Although all comparisons were made, only the doghouse compartment had an increased risk of severe bruising compared with all other compartments (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 3.0 [1.6-5.5], 3.7 [2.1- 6.4], 2.2 [1.3-3.7] and 3.8 [1.5-9.6] in comparison with the back, belly, deck, and nose compartments, respectively; P < 0.05). Increasing the duration of waiting to unload 30 min relative to a 1 h duration increased the odds of severe bruising by 1.18 times (95% confidence interval: 1.09-1.29; P < 0.01). Scoring systems that have been developed for auditing unloading of cattle had limited variation across loads at both loading and unloading. Pretransport assessment of animal condition using the American Meat Institute’s compromised animal score was the only scoring system that was consistent with posttransport scores. We inferred from the temperature and humidity data in the current study that under commercial conditions, boarding may increase ventilation within trailers during travel and decrease ventilation during stationary periods. The current study provides the first indication that issues in Canadian cull cow transport may be related to pretransport animal condition and management of unloading. © 2015 American Society of Animal Science.

abstract={As landscapes across the globe experience increasing human development, it is critical to identify the behavioral responses of wildlife to this change given associated shifts in resource availability and risk from human activity. This is particularly important for large carnivores as their interactions with people are often a source of conflict, which can impede conservation efforts and require extensive management. To examine the adaptations of a large carnivore to benefits and risks associated with human development we investigated black bear behavior in three systems in the western United States. Our objectives were to (1) identify temporal patterns of selection for development within a year and across years based on natural food conditions, (2) compare spatial patterns of selection for development across systems, and (3) examine individual characteristics associated with increased selection for development. Using mixed effects resource selection models we found that bear selection for development was highly dynamic, varying as a function of changing environmental and physiological conditions. Bears increased their use of development in years when natural foods were scarce, throughout the summer-fall, as they aged, and as a function of gender, with males exhibiting greater use of development. While patterns were similar across systems, bears at sites with poorer quality habitat selected development more consistently than bears at sites with higher quality habitat. Black bears appear to use development largely for food subsidy, suggesting that conflicts with bears, and potentially other large carnivores, will increase when the physiological demand for resources outweighs risks associated with human activity. © 2015.},

abstract={Drilling predation is one of the unique scenarios where past biotic interactions can be studied quantitatively and used to model behavioural evolution of the involved groups. Although it is recognized that hunger plays an important role in determining the behaviour of terrestrial predatory groups, its specific effect on drilling gastropods is largely unexplored. Muricids have been shown to demonstrate change in prey preference and foraging behaviour when starved. Such behaviour is yet to be tested for naticid gastropods.In an experiment with live naticid gastropods, Natica tigrina and their bivalve prey Cardium sp., we evaluated the effect of hunger on the following aspects of predation: 1. Drilling frequency, 2. Size selectivity, and 3. Site selectivity. Comparing gastropods between satiated controlled group and starved experimental group we demonstrated a positive effect of hunger on drilling frequency. Using different stages of hunger, we found that hunger plays an important role in dictating prey size-selectivity. While hunger increases drilling frequency, it reduces the degree of prey size selectivity. Hunger is not found to initiate edge-drilling or incomplete drilling in N. tigrina.It has been postulated that prey selection by gastropods are correctly modelled by cost-benefit analysis; but the standard cost-benefit analysis does not account for hunger. However, our study demonstrates the relative importance of hunger in guiding drilling behaviour in naticids and hence it should be incorporated in future cost-benefit models. As hunger is often related to nutrient depleted conditions, these modifications in behaviour could be used to explain the spatial variation in drilling pattern by naticid gastropods. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objective Negative urgency (NU; tendency to act impulsively when experiencing negative emotions) is a risk factor for binge eating, although few studies have examined interviewer-assessed objective binge episodes (OBEs). Moreover, research has not investigated how NU relates to the core components of OBEs: loss of control (LOC) eating and objective overeating (OO). Understanding the relationship between NU and these core components will enhance etiologic models of eating disorder development. Thus, the current study examined the associations between NU, OBEs, and the components of OBEs by comparing levels of NU in women with OBEs, LOC eating only, and OO only to women with no pathological eating. Method Participants were 612 women who endorsed lifetime OBEs (5.4%), LOC eating outside of OBEs (5.7%), OO only (2.8%), or none of these eating episodes (85.9%). Results Women with OBEs, LOC only, and OO only had significantly higher levels of NU than women without these episodes, suggesting that NU is associated with both the LOC and OO components of OBEs. Discussion NU relates to the spectrum of pathology present in women with OBEs. Future research should examine the mechanisms underlying these associations, including impaired behavioral/psychological control and/or increased reward sensitivity in response to negative affect. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={When relatives mate, their inbred offspring often suffer a reduction in fitness-related traits known as "inbreeding depression."There is mounting evidence that inbreeding depression can be exacerbated by environmental stresses such as starvation, predation, parasitism, and competition. Parental care may play an important role as a buffer against inbreeding depression in the offspring by alleviating these environmental stresses. Here, we examine the effect of parental care on the fitness costs of inbreeding in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, an insect with facultative parental care. We used a 2 x 2 factorial design with the following factors: (i) the presence or absence of a caring female parent during larval development and (ii) inbred or outbred offspring. We examined the joint influence of maternal care and inbreeding status on fitness-related offspring traits to test the hypothesis that maternal care improves the performance of inbred offspring more than that of outbred offspring. Indeed, the female's presence led to a higher increase in larval survival in inbred than in outbred broods. Receiving care at the larval stage also increased the lifespan of inbred but not outbred adults, suggesting that the beneficial buffering effects of maternal care can persist long after the offspring have become independent. Our results show that parental care has the potential to moderate the severity of inbreeding depression, which in turn may favor inbreeding tolerance and influence the evolution of mating systems and other inbreedingavoidance mechanisms. © 2015.

abstract={Ontogenetic niche shifts are common among animals, yet most studies only investigate niche shifts at the population level, which may overlook considerable differences among individuals in the timing and dynamics of these shifts. Such divergent behaviors within size-/age-classes have important implications for the roles a population—and specific age-classes—play in their respective ecosystem(s). Using acoustic telemetry, we tracked the movements of juvenile bull sharks in the Shark River Estuary of Everglades National Park, Florida, and found that sharks increased their use of marine microhabitats with age to take advantage of more abundant resources, but continued to use freshwater and estuarine microhabitats as refuges from marine predators. Within this population-level ontogenetic niche shift, however, movement patterns varied among individual sharks, with 47 % of sharks exhibiting condition-dependent habitat use and 53 % appearing risk-averse regardless of body condition. Among sharks older than age 0, fifty percent made regular movements between adjacent regions of the estuary, while the other half made less predictable movements that often featured long-term residence in specific regions. Individual differences were apparently shaped by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including individual responses to food-risk trade-offs and body condition. These differences appear to develop early in the lives of bull sharks, and persist throughout their residencies in nursery habitats. The widespread occurrence of intraspecific variation in behavior among mobile taxa suggests it is important in shaping population dynamics of at least some species, and elucidating the contexts and timing in which it develops and persists is important for understanding its role within communities. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Binary choice experiments under natural solar radiation were used to test short-term behavioral responses of freshwater calanoid copepods to ultraviolet radiation (UV). Responses of the nine species from 15 populations spanning North and South America included both UV attraction and UV avoidance, and varied among habitats, species and populations. Copepods from more transparent lakes were more attracted to UV than those from less transparent lakes. When individuals were pre-exposed in the laboratory to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the presence and absence of UV, those pre-exposed to UV spent more time in the high UV environment than those exposed to PAR alone. However, these differences disappeared after 150 min, suggesting that the responses were short term and mediated in part by ambient UV conditions. Copepods represent a large proportion of the biomass of zooplankton in many aquatic ecosystems, and their ability to detect and respond behaviorally to UV may enable them to use this ubiquitous environmental cue to regulate their water column position. The use of UV as a habitat selection cue may permit copepods to exploit optimal food environments or limit overlap with less UV-tolerant competitors, predators or parasites, while minimizing damage resulting from longer term UV exposure. © The Author 2016.

abstract={An intermediate spatiotemporal scale of food procurement by large herbivores is evident within annual or seasonal home ranges. It takes the form of settlement periods spanning several days or weeks during which foraging activity is confined to spatially discrete foraging arenas, separated by roaming interludes. Extended by areas occupied for other activities, these foraging arenas contribute towards generating the home range structure. We delineated and compared the foraging arenas exploited by two African large herbivores, sable antelope (a ruminant) and plains zebra (a non-ruminant), using GPS-derived movement data. We developed a novel approach to specifically delineate foraging arenas based on local change points in distance relative to adjoining clusters of locations, and compared its output with modifications of two published methods developed for home range estimation and residence time estimation respectively. We compared how these herbivore species responded to seasonal variation in food resources and how they differed in their spatial patterns of resource utilization. Sable antelope herds tended to concentrate their space use locally, while zebra herds moved more opportunistically over a wider set of foraging arenas. The amalgamated extent of the foraging arenas exploited by sable herds amounted to 12-30 km2, compared with 22-100 km2 for the zebra herds. Half-day displacement distances differed between settlement periods and roaming interludes, and zebra herds generally shifted further over 12h than sable herds. Foraging arenas of sable herds tended to be smaller than those of zebra, and were occupied for period twice as long, and hence exploited more intensively in days spent per unit area than the foraging arenas of zebra. For sable both the intensity of utilization of foraging arenas and proportion of days spent in foraging arenas relative to roaming interludes declined as food resources diminished seasonally, while zebra showed no seasonal variation in these metrics. Identifying patterns of space use at foraging arena scale helps reveal mechanisms generating the home range extent, and in turn the local population density. Thereby it helps forge links between behavioural ecology, movement ecology and population ecology. © 2015 Owen-Smith, Martin.},

Improving our understanding of how environmental and ecological factors mechanistically interact and influence larval fish growth and survival is necessary to better predict year-class strength and expected physiological and behavioural responses to climate warming. We use a state-dependent optimality model for the behaviour of larval Atlantic cod Gadus morhua to analyse trade-offs related to growth and survival. Temperature-dependent maximum growth rates and vertical profiles of temperature and stochastic prey availability are used as inputs within a mechanistic modelling framework that finds optimal behavioural strategies of vertical migration and foraging activity. The fitness criterion used is maximization of survival probability until the larvae reach a given body size (15 mm). Detailed descriptions of predation, physiology, growth and survival of larval cod emerge from simulations of the optimal strategies. The model shows that the effect of temperature on survival is complex. Increasing temperature may lead to faster growth and higher survival, but only when there is sufficient food. In poor food environments, higher temperatures make larvae more susceptible to predation as they take higher risks to satisfy their metabolic costs. Overall, these results suggest that larval Atlantic cod, especially those from warmer-water stocks, may experience reduced survival and recruitment in climate-change scenarios that predict both elevated temperatures and reduced food supply. © Inter-Research 2015.},

abstract={Weight-loss dieting often leads to loss of control, rebound weight gain, and is a risk factor for binge pathology. Based on findings that food restriction (FR) upregulates sucrose-induced trafficking of glutamatergic AMPA receptors to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) postsynaptic density (PSD), this study was an initial test of the hypothesis that episodic "breakthrough" intake of forbidden food during dieting interacts with upregulated mechanisms of synaptic plasticity to increase reward-driven feeding. Ad libitum (AL) fed and FR subjects consumed a limited amount of 10% sucrose, or had access to water, every other day for 10 occasions. Beginning three weeks after return of FR rats to AL feeding, when 24-h chow intake and rate of body weight gain had normalized, subjects with a history of sucrose intake during FR consumed more sucrose during a four week intermittent access protocol than the two AL groups and the group that had access to water during FR. In an experiment that substituted noncontingent administration of d-amphetamine for sucrose, FR subjects displayed an enhanced locomotor response during active FR but a blunted response, relative to AL subjects, during recovery from FR. This result suggests that the enduring increase in sucrose consumption is unlikely to be explained by residual enhancing effects of FR on dopamine signaling. In a biochemical experiment which paralleled the sucrose behavioral experiment, rats with a history of sucrose intake during FR displayed increased abundance of pSer845-GluA1, GluA2, and GluA3 in the NAc PSD relative to rats with a history of FR without sucrose access and rats that had been AL throughout, whether they had a history of episodic sucrose intake or not. A history of FR, with or without a history of sucrose intake, was associated with increased abundance of GluA1. A terminal 15-min bout of sucrose intake produced a further increase in pSer845-GluA1 and GluA2 in subjects with a history of sucrose intake during FR. Generally, neither a history of sucrose intake nor a terminal bout of sucrose intake affected AMPA receptor abundance in the NAc PSD of AL subjects. Together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis, but the functional contribution of increased synaptic incorporation of AMPA receptors remains to be established. © 2015 IBRO.},

abstract={Coptotermes gestroi is an exotic species in Brazil that forages on several food items at the same time. Different laboratory tests were performed with 6-year-old colonies of this termite in order to follow the development and displacement of these colonies, considering which castes and instars were transferred or moved from their original chamber. Two bioassays were carried out, one with similar alternative foods (Pinus sp. sawdust), and the other with different alternative foods (large block of Pinus taeda and small block of Pinus elliottii). The colonies of C. gestroi did not show preferences in the allocation of foragers when they had alternative similar foods. However, they were found in the chamber that contained the small block of P. elliottii, when termites had the alternative of different blocks of Pinus, indicating an environment most favorable for the nucleus of the colony (royal cup and brood). Many factors may have influenced this choice as more nutritive alimentary resource for brood or the presentation of the food, which allowed better colony accommodation. C. gestroi did not have difficulties of migration from one chamber to another and this characteristic may be a risk factor in urban infestations of this severe pest. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objective: Overeating and obesity are associated with impulsivity. In studies among patients with a substance use disorder, impulsivity was found to be associated with substance-related attentional bias. This study examined whether obesity, impulsivity and food craving are associated with an attentional bias for high-calorie food. Methods: Obese (n = 185, mean BMI = 38.18 ± 6.17) and matched healthyweight (n = 134, mean BMI = 22.35 ± 1.63) men (27.9%) and women (72.1%), aged 18-45 years, took part in the study. Participants were tested on several self-report and behavioral measures of impulsivity (i.e., response inhibition and reward sensitivity) and self-reported trait craving. In addition, they performed a visual search task to measure attentional bias for high- and low-caloric foods. Results: Self-reported impulsivity influenced the relationship between weight status and detection speed of highand low-caloric food items: High-impulsive participants with obesity were significantly faster than high-impulsive healthy-weight participants in detecting a high-caloric food item among neutral items, whereas no such difference was observed among low-impulsive participants. No significant effects were found on low-caloric food items, for trait craving or any of the behavioral measures of impulsivity. Conclusion: Self-reported impulsivity, but not trait craving or behavioral measures of impulsivity, is associated with an attentional bias for high-caloric foods, but only in people with obesity. It is in particular the speedy detection of high-caloric foods in the environment that characterizes the impulsive person with obesity, which in turn may cause risky eating patterns in a society were high-caloric food is overly present. © 2014 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Objective: To describe multidimensional factors and maternal feeding practices that may correlate with infant overfeeding in Latina mothers. A secondary aim was to determine whether there was an association between these factors and infant weight. Design: A descriptive correlational cross‐sectional study. Setting: Participants were recruited through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Sample: Sixty‐two low‐income immigrant Latina mothers receiving WIC assistance and their infants age 4 to 12 months. Methods: A native Spanish speaking investigator who guided the participants through the options administered all the measures, including acculturation indicators, maternal feeding beliefs, maternal feeding practices, maternal knowledge and self‐efficacy, food availability/insecurity indicators, infant's temperament, infant's 24‐hour dietary recall, and infant's height and weight measures. Univariate and multiple linear regressions were used to examine relationships. Results: More than 46% of infants were at &gt;85th percentile for weight for length; of those, 21% were at &gt;98th percentile. Among infants at the &gt;85thpercentile for weight for length, 27% of the mothers wished their infants were heavier. Only one mother was breastfeeding exclusively. Almost one third of mothers (24%) preferred supplementing breast milk with formula feeding, and 74% used formula feeding. Healthier maternal feeding practices were inversely correlated with maternal age and the number of people living at home. Multiple regression results showed infant's age and maternal education as significant positive predictors of less controlling maternal feeding practices. None of the analyzed factors were significant predictors of infant weight. Conclusion/Implications for Nursing Practice: Future intervention efforts should focus primarily on the promotion of healthy feeding practices that encourage and support exclusive breastfeeding among this ethnic group. A clearer understanding of the socioeconomic and cultural contexts that promote conditions for infants becoming overweight is necessary for developing culturally sensitive screening tools to assess infants at risk and promoting targeted preventive interventions that begin early in life and are meaningful to Latina mothers. © 2015 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses},

abstract={Common carp that had been screened for stress coping style using a standard behavioural test (response to a novel environment) were given a learning task in which food was concealed in one of two compartments, its location randomised between trials and its presence in a given compartment signalled by either a red or a yellow light. All the fish learned to find food quickly, but did so in different ways. Fifty five percent learned to use the light cue to locate food; the remainder achieved the same result by developing a fixed movement routine. To explore this variation, we related learning strategy to stress coping style. Time to find food fell identically with successive trials in carp classified as reactive or proactive, but reactive fish tended to follow the light cue and proactive fish to adopt a fixed routine. Among fish that learned to follow the light, reactive individuals took fewer trials to reach the learning criterion than did proactive fish. These results add to the growing body of information on within-species variation in learning strategies and suggest a possible influence of stress coping style on the use of associative learning as opposed to algorithmic searching during foraging. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: We hypothesized intrauterine growth restricted offspring (IUGR) demonstrate higher rates of aggression and higher dominance ranks than control (CTR) offspring with normal weight at term; if aggressive behavior is advantageous during resource scarcity, developmental programming may lead to an association between aggression and IUGR. Methods: We studied 22 group-housed baboons (ages 3-5 years). CTR (male n = 8, female n = 5) mothers ate ad libitum. IUGR (male n = 4, female n = 5) mothers were fed 70% feed eaten by CTR mothers during pregnancy and lactation. Results: IUGR showed higher rates of aggressive displays (P < 0.01) and friendly displays (P < 0.02). Dominance ranks and physical aggression rates did not differ between groups. Conclusions: High rates of IUGR aggressive display might reflect developmental programming of behavioral phenotypes enhancing fitness. Friendly displays may reflect reconciliation. Potential mechanisms include neurodevelopment and learning. Exploration of IUGR as a risk factor for behavioral patterns is important for developing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.},

abstract={Abstract This study investigated the effects of β-alanine (BA) ingestion on the behavioral and neuroendocrine response of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a murine model. Animals were fed a normal diet with or without (PL) BA supplementation (100 mg kg-1) for 30 days. Animals were then exposed to a predator-scent stress (PSS) or a sham (UNEX). Behaviors were evaluated using an elevated plus maze (EPM) and acoustic startle response (ASR) 7 days following exposure to the PSS. Corticosterone concentrations (CS), expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and brain carnosine concentrations were analyzed a day later. Animals in PSS+PL spent significantly less time in the open arms and in the number of entries in the EPM than PSS+BA, UNEX+BA, or UNEX+PL. Animals in PSS+BA had comparable scores to UNEX+BA. Anxiety index was higher (p &lt; 0.05) in PSS+PL compared to PSS+BA or animals that were unexposed. ASR and freezing were greater (p &lt; 0.05) in animals exposed to PSS compared to animals unexposed. CS expression was higher (p &lt; 0.05) in animals exposed to PSS compared to unexposed animals. Brain carnosine concentrations in the hippocampus and other brain sections were significantly greater in animals supplemented with BA compared to PL. BDNF expression in the CA1 and DG subregions of the hippocampus was lower (p &lt; 0.05) in animals exposed and fed a normal diet compared to animals exposed and supplemented with BA, or animals unexposed. In conclusion, BA supplementation in rats increased brain carnosine concentrations and resulted in a reduction in PTSD-like behavior, which may be mediated in part by maintaining BDNF expression in the hippocampus. © 2015 The Author(s).},

abstract={Fight-or-flight stress responses allow animals to cope adaptively to sudden threats by mobilizing energy resources and priming the body for action. Because such responses can be costly and redirect behavior and energy from reproduction to survival, they are likely to be shaped by specific life-history stages, depending on the available energy resources and the commitment to reproduction. Here, we consider how heart rate (HR) responses to acute stressors are affected by the advancing breeding season in a colonial seabird, the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus). We subjected 77 birds (44 males, 33 females) at various stages of incubation and chick-rearing to three experimental stressors (metal sound, distant approach and capture) known to vary both in their intensity and associated risk, and monitored their HR responses. Our results show that HR increase in response to acute stressors was progressively attenuated with the stage of breeding from incubation to chick-rearing. Stress responses did not vary according to nutritional status or seasonal timing (whether breeding was initiated early or late in the season), but were markedly lower during chick-rearing than during incubation. This pattern was obvious for all three stressors. We discuss how fight-or-flight responses may be modulated by considering the energy commitment to breeding, nutritional status and reproductive value of the brood in breeding seabirds. © 2015 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.},

abstract={College students engage in many unhealthy behaviors, one of these, heavy alcohol use, is a major global public health problem. Objective: This longitudinal study examined whether students' mandated/voluntary status in a program to reduce college drinking was associated with overall health, ethnicity, gender, and personality traits. Both mandated and voluntary groups participated in the Motivational Intervention (MI) program to prevent high risk drinking. Methods: Freshmen (710 voluntary, 190 mandated, n = 900) between the ages of 18 and 21, received the MI at baseline and again at 2. weeks, with boosters at 3, 6 and 12. months. Participants completed three measures: the Daily Drinking Questionnaire (DDQ); the Substance Use Risk Profile Scale (SURPS), and the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile II (HPLPII). Mandated and voluntary participants were compared at baseline and following the intervention using two sample t-tests for continuous variables (overall health, personality traits, drinking measures), and chi-square for categorical variables (gender, ethnicity). Linear mixed models were used to identify associations between HPLP II scores and mandated/voluntary status, time, ethnicity gender and SURPS scale scores. Results: In both groups, alcohol consumption dropped significantly by 12. months. Overall health-promoting behaviors, physical activity, stress management, and interpersonal relations improved in both groups between baseline and 12. months. Associations were found between alcohol consumption, personality traits, gender, and lifestyle health-promoting behaviors. In particular, impulsivity and hopelessness were associated with poor health behaviors. Conclusions: Intervention programs to reduce drinking by college students need to address developmental dynamics of freshmen students, including gender, psychosocial factors, personality, and lifestyle health-promoting behaviors. © 2015.},

We evaluated the usefulness of commercially available trail-cameras for analyzing the diet of Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) as a model for nesting raptors during the period 2007-2011. We compared diet estimates obtained by direct camera monitoring of 80 nests with four indirect analyses of prey remains collected from the nests and surroundings (pellets, bones, feather-and-hair remains, and feather-hair-and-bone remains combined). In addition, we evaluated the performance of the trail-cameras and whether camera monitoring affected Goshawk behavior. The sensitivity of each diet-analysis method depended on prey size and taxonomic group, with no method providing unbiased estimates for all prey sizes and types. The cameras registered the greatest number of prey items and were probably the least biased method for estimating diet composition. Nevertheless this direct method yielded the largest proportion of prey unidentified to species level, and it underestimated small prey. Our trail-camera system was able to operate without maintenance for longer periods than what has been reported in previous studies with other types of cameras. Initially Goshawks showed distrust toward the cameras but they usually became habituated to its presence within 1-2 days. The habituation period was shorter for breeding pairs that had previous experience with cameras. Using trail-cameras to monitor prey provisioning to nests is an effective tool for studying the diet of nesting raptors. However, the technique is limited by technical failures and difficulties in identifying certain prey types. Our study also shows that cameras can alter adult Goshawk behavior, an aspect that must be controlled to minimize potential negative impacts. © 2015 García-Salgado et al.

abstract={Strategic ejaculation is a behavioural strategy shown by many animals as a response to sperm competition and/or as a potential mechanism of cryptic male choice. Males invest more mating resources when the risk of sperm competition increases or they invest more in high quality females to maximize their reproductive output. We tested this hypothesis in the false garden mantid Pseudomantis albofimbriata, where females are capable of multiply mating and body condition is an indicator of potential reproductive fitness. We predicted male mantids would ejaculate strategically by allocating more sperm to high quality females. To determine if and how males alter their ejaculate in response to mate quality, we manipulated female food quantity so that females were either in good condition with many eggs (i.e. high quality) or poor condition with few eggs (i.e. low quality). Half of the females from each treatment were used in mating trials in which transferred sperm was counted before fertilisation occurred and the other half of females were used in mating trials where fertilisation occurred and ootheca mass and total eggs in the ootheca were recorded. Opposed to our predictions, the total number of sperm and the proportion of viable sperm transferred did not vary significantly between female treatments. Male reproductive success was entirely dependent on female quality/fecundity, rather than on the number of sperm transferred. These results suggest that female quality is not a major factor influencing postcopulatory male mating strategies in P. albofimbriata, and that sperm number has little effect on male reproductive success in a single mating scenario. © 2015 Jayaweera, Barry.},

It enumerates major influences recognized in behavioural ecology as crucial with regard to individual foraging decisions, and considers the relevance of these ideas for how rapid environmental change might be accommodated. It also concludes the vital role of foraging behaviour, through flexibility, can moderate greatly the effects of changes in the amount and type of prey on offer. © Oxford University Press 2012.

abstract={Adolescent behavior is typified by increased risk-taking, reward- and novelty-seeking, as well as an augmented need for social and environmental stimulation. This behavioral phenotype may result from alterations in outcome valuation or reward learning. In the present set of experiments, we directly compared adult and adolescent animals on tasks measuring both of these processes. Additionally, we examined developmental differences in dopamine D1-like receptor (D1R), dopamine D2-like receptor (D2R), and polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) expression in animals that were trained on an effortful reward valuation task, given that these proteins play an important role in the functional development of the amygdala-prefrontocortical (PFC) circuit and mesocorticolimbic dopamine system. We found that adolescent animals were not different from adults in appetitive associative learning, but exhibited distinct pattern of responses to differences in outcome values, which was paralleled by an enhanced motivation to invest effort to obtain larger rewards. There were no differences in D2 receptor expression, but D1 receptor expression was significantly reduced in the striatum of animals that had experiences with reward learning during adolescence compared to animals that went through the same experiences in adulthood. We observed increased levels of PSA-NCAM expression in both PFC and amygdala of late adolescents compared to adults that were previously trained on an effortful reward valuation task. PSA-NCAM levels in PFC were strongly and positively associated with high effort/reward (HER) choices in adolescents, but not in adult animals. Increased levels of PSA-NCAM expression in adolescents may index increased structural plasticity and represent a neural correlate of a reward sensitive endophenotype. © 2015 Stolyarova and Izquierdo.

abstract={Despite a rising interest in behavioural syndromes (correlations between different behaviours across context and time), the development of these syndromes is not well understood. Using the swordtail fish Xiphophorus multilineatus, we looked at the effects of maternal investment and social environment during development on the formation of a behavioural syndrome. A previous study demonstrated that the diet on which mothers were reared, controlling for their size, influenced the growth rate and size of their sons: females reared on high-quality diets had sons that grew faster and were larger at sexual maturity. In addition, males that were exposed to an adult male during development grew faster. We examined the behaviours of these same males across two contexts: aggression towards a mirror image and boldness under threat of predation. We detected an influence of maternal investment but not of social environment on the formation of a behavioural syndrome. The sons of mothers reared on high-quality diets exhibited a positive correlation between boldness and aggression, while there was no correlation among the sons of mothers reared on low-quality diets. Maternal investment influenced the formation of the syndrome by producing changes in only one of the behaviours, the behaviour most closely linked to energy acquisition (boldness under risk of predation) rather than energy expenditure (aggression). Our results suggest that energy balances could help predict the circumstances that would favour the formation of behavioural syndromes. Our results also support the hypothesis that behaviours involved in energy acquisition as compared to energy use will be more sensitive to fluctuations in variation in resources. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Although intra-population variation in niches is a widespread phenomenon with important implications for ecology, evolution and management of a range of animal species, the causes and consequences of this variation remain poorly understood. We used stable isotope analysis to characterise foraging niches and to investigate the causes and consequences of individual niche variation in the European badger, a mustelid mammal that lives in territorial social groups, but forages alone. We found that the degree of individual niche variation within social groups was negatively related to the availability of farmland habitats, which represent an important foraging habitat for badgers; and was positively related to territory size, supporting the idea that resource limitation and ecological opportunity lead to increased individual specialisation. We also found that the degree of individual specialisation related to an individual’s body condition and that this effect varied with ecological context; such that specialisation had a stronger positive relationship with body condition in social groups with reduced availability of key farmland habitats. Body condition was also related to the utilisation of specific resources (woodland invertebrates), but again this relationship varied with the availability of farmland foraging habitats. This study supports the idea that resource availability plays an important role in determining patterns of individual niche variation, and identifies the potential adaptive consequences of specialised foraging strategies. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={We examined the potential for a trait-mediated indirect interaction (TMII), whereby a behavioural response to a predator (crab Cancer borealis) alters the per capita effect of a reacting species (sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) on its algal food (kelp Saccharina latissima), in field and laboratory experiments. We used time-lapse video to monitor sea urchin movement in response to either an attractant food cue (kelp) or a repellant predation-risk cue (crabs) placed in small cages at the centre of 7m2 circular plots in a wave-exposed sea urchin barrens off Nova Scotia. We found that sea urchins generally moved randomly over the rock substratum and showed a limited response to cues emanating from a cage with kelp, with a few individuals exhibiting directed movement towards kelp and greater proportion of urchins in contact with the cue cage (with kelp) compared to the control (without kelp) at the end of the experiment. Similarly, only a few individuals that came in close contact with a cage containing crabs showed a clear flight response, compared to the control. In experiments with individual kelp thalli that were systematically dispersed around the central cage in the same plots, we found that the presence of crabs in the cage did not reduce sea urchin grazing rates on kelp compared to a control without crabs. We observed similar results using a similar experimental design in large tanks (900L) under controlled flow conditions in the laboratory. We conclude that C. borealis does not significantly inhibit the foraging activity of S. droebachiensis under turbulent flow conditions in nature, and that a TMII is unlikely to contribute to a trophic cascade in the shallow rocky subtidal zone of the Northwest Atlantic. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Parental care often produces a trade-off between meeting nutritional demands of offspring and the duties of offspring protection, especially in altricial species. Parents have to leave their young unattended for foraging trips, during which nestlings are exposed to predators. We investigated how rodent mothers of altricial young respond to risk of nest predation in their foraging decisions. We studied foraging behavior of lactating bank voles (Myodes glareolus) exposed to a nest predator, the common shrew (Sorex araneus). We conducted the experiment in summer (high resource provisioning for both species) and autumn (less food available) in 12 replicates with fully crossed factors “shrew presence” and “season.” We monitored use of feeding stations near and far from the nest as measurement of foraging activity and strategic foraging behavior. Vole mothers adapted their strategies to shrew presence and optimized their foraging behavior according to seasonal constraints, resulting in an interaction of treatment and season. In summer, shrew presence reduced food intake from feeding stations, while it enhanced intake in autumn. Shrew presence decreased the number of visited feeding stations in autumn and concentrated mother’s foraging efforts to fewer stations. Independent of shrew presence or season, mothers foraged more in patches further away from the nest than near the nest. Results indicate that females are not investing in nest guarding but try to avoid the accumulation of olfactory cues near the nest leading a predator to the young. Additionally, our study shows how foraging strategies and nest attendance are influenced by seasonal food provision. © 2015, The Author(s).},

abstract={Innovations and problem-solving abilities can provide animals with important ecological advantages as they allow individuals to deal with novel social and ecological challenges. Innovation is a solution to a novel problem or a novel solution to an old problem, with the latter being especially difficult. Finding a new solution to an old problem requires individuals to inhibit previously applied solutions to invent new strategies and to behave flexibly. We examined the role of experience on cognitive flexibility to innovate and to find new problem-solving solutions with an artificial feeding task in wild redfronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons). Four groups of lemurs were tested with feeding boxes, each offering three different techniques to extract food, with only one technique being available at a time. After the subjects learned a technique, this solution was no longer successful and subjects had to invent a new technique. For the first transition between task 1 and 2, subjects had to rely on their experience of the previous technique to solve task 2. For the second transition, subjects had to inhibit the previously learned technique to learn the new task 3. Tasks 1 and 2 were solved by most subjects, whereas task 3 was solved by only a few subjects. In this task, besides behavioral flexibility, especially persistence, i.e., constant trying, was important for individual success during innovation. Thus, wild strepsirrhine primates are able to innovate flexibly, suggesting a general ecological relevance of behavioral flexibility and persistence during innovation and problem solving across all primates. © 2015, The Author(s).},

abstract={The trade-off between starvation and predation risk is of paramount importance to songbirds and many other small organisms. A contaminant with metabolic or neurological effects may hinder a bird's ability to manage these ecological risks, which are contingent on metabolic state and require cognitive assessments. Methylmercury (MeHg) is a ubiquitous pollutant that is associated with neurotoxicity, reproductive failure, altered behaviour and increased mortality in aquatic organisms. It was recently discovered that MeHg can enter terrestrial food webs and affect songbirds that eat contaminated invertebrates. Research on behavioural effects of environmentally relevant doses of MeHg in songbirds is a conservation priority as this pollutant is widespread, poorly regulated, increasing and understudied in terms of sublethal effects such as abnormal behaviours. To help close this knowledge gap, we examined how MeHg affects behavioural strategies in captive zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata. We quantified the birds' responses to risk by measuring regulation of body mass, vigilance behaviour, willingness to move away from dense cover in search of food and reluctance to return to foraging after a disturbance. Dosed and undosed birds were placed in an experimental arena and were videorecorded over 3 days of increasing perception of predation risk. We found that MeHg-exposed birds, compared to control birds, (1) lost significantly more mass and (2) waited significantly longer to forage under the highest predation risk. Our results indicate that MeHg-exposed birds may react more strongly to threat of predation and thereby increase their risk of starvation. To our knowledge this is the first mechanistic study of how a pervasive pollutant may alter optimal decision making, and therefore potentially survival, in songbirds. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Nutritional and social environmental problems during the early stages of life are closely associated with the pathophysiology of mood disorders such as depression. Disruption or dysfunction of the central norepinephrine (NE) system is also considered to play a role in mood disorders. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of zinc deficiency and/or social isolation on mood and changes in the central NE system using rats. Compared with the controls, the rats subjected to zinc deficiency or social isolation alone exhibited increased anxiety-related behavior in the elevated plus maze and greater depression-like behavior in the forced swim test. However, the co-occurrence of zinc deficiency and social isolation resulted in decreased anxiety-related behavior and control levels of depression-like behavior. Social isolation alone decreased the rats' cerebral NE concentrations. The expression of the NE transporter was not affected by social isolation alone, but its expression in the locus coeruleus was markedly decreased by the co-occurrence of social isolation and zinc deficiency, and this change was accompanied by an increase in the blood concentration of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, which is a marker of central NE system activity. These findings suggest that zinc deficiency or social isolation alone induce anxious or depressive symptoms, but the presence of both conditions has anxiolytic or antidepressive effects. Furthermore, these opposing effects of mood-related behaviors were found to be associated with changes in the central NE system. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Bean weevil, Acanthoscelides obtectus (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae, Bruchinae) is a cosmopolitan pest of legume stored products. Storages with various legume seeds can facilitate shifts of the weevil from its primary host, common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), to other legume species and enable host expansion, i.e. broadening of the range of acceptable plant-hosts. In the first generation of host shift, survival of an insect depends on ability to adjust its physiology to altered content of nutrients and secondary metabolites in novel host. On a long-term scale, physiological adaptations to a new host can comprise modifications both in level and plasticity of physiological traits. Changes in activity of phosphatases play an essential role in this process due to their involvement in diverse functions. This study investigated alterations in activity of total acid, lysosomal acid and alkaline phosphatases using laboratory populations of A.obtectus which were maintained either on the optimal host (common bean) or on the suboptimal host (chickpea, Cicer arietinum L.) for 28 years. To determine short-term (plastic) effects, subsets of individuals from each population were exposed to the alternative host for one generation. Our results revealed that one-generation shift to chickpea significantly increased phosphatases' activity reflecting immediate plastic response to nutritional/allelochemical stress where these enzymes might be involved in defense mechanisms. On the other hand, both level and plasticity of phosphatases' activities significantly declined as a long-term response to Cicer-based diet suggesting that selection on chickpea favored resistance mechanisms that were less costly than phosphatases. Considering diverse roles of phosphatases we suggest that such modifications could be crucial for expanding host range and might have implications on efficiency of chemical and botanical insecticides. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Condition- or context-dependent mate choice occurs when females modify their mate preferences depending on their internal or external environment. While the ecological and evolutionary factors that favor the evolution of such plasticity are emerging, relatively little is known of the mechanisms underlying such choice. Here we evaluated whether leptin, a protein hormone involved in the regulation of appetite, might affect the expression of condition-dependent mate choice decisions. To do so, we administered leptin to spadefoot toads, Spea bombifrons, which exhibit condition-dependent mate choice for males of their own species versus congeneric males of S. multiplicata. In particular, poor-condition S. bombifrons are more likely than are good-condition S. bombifrons to prefer S. multiplicata males, but only in environments where hybridization between the two species is beneficial. We found that our leptin treatment reduced appetite in S. bombifrons adults, as was expected from leptin's known effects on appetite. However, although we predicted that leptin would reduce female preferences for heterospecific males, we found the opposite. In particular, our leptin treatment generated a consistent, repeatable preference for heterospecifics in an environment where females generally prefer conspecifics regardless of condition. These results indicate that leptin has the potential to affect female mate choice, but that it might do so in non-intuitive ways. © 2015 Garcia et al.},

abstract={Aging evolved because the strength of natural selection declines over the lifetime of most organisms. Weak natural selection late in life allows the accumulation of deleterious mutations and may favor alleles that have positive effects on fitness early in life, but costly pleiotropic effects expressed later on. While this decline in natural selection is central to longstanding evolutionary explanations for aging, a role for sexual selection and sexual conflict in the evolution of lifespan and aging has only been identified recently. Testing how sexual selection and sexual conflict affect lifespan and aging is challenging as it requires quantifying male age-dependent reproductive success. This is difficult in the invertebrate model organisms traditionally used in aging research. Research using crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae), where reproductive investment can be easily measured in both sexes, has offered exciting and novel insights into how sexual selection and sexual conflict affect the evolution of aging, both in the laboratory and in the wild. Here we discuss how sexual selection and sexual conflict can be integrated alongside evolutionary and mechanistic theories of aging using crickets as a model. We then highlight the potential for research using crickets to further advance our understanding of lifespan and aging. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This study's objective was to determine seasonal and diurnal vs. nocturnal home range size, as well as predation for free-ranging farm cats at a livestock unit in Northwest Georgia. Seven adult cats were tracked with attached GPS units for up to two weeks for one spring and two summer seasons from May 2010 through August 2011. Three and five cats were tracked for up to two weeks during the fall and winter seasons, respectively. Feline scat was collected during this entire period. Cats were fed a commercial cat food daily. There was no seasonal effect (P > 0.05) on overall (95% KDE and 90% KDE) or core home range size (50% KDE). Male cats tended (P = 0.08) to have larger diurnal and nocturnal core home ranges (1.09 ha) compared to female cats (0.64 ha). Reproductively intact cats (n = 2) had larger (P < 0.0001) diurnal and nocturnal home ranges as compared to altered cats. Feline scat processing separated scat into prey parts, and of the 210 feline scats collected during the study, 75.24% contained hair. Of these 158 scat samples, 86 contained non-cat hair and 72 contained only cat hair. Other prey components included fragments of bone in 21.43% of scat and teeth in 12.86% of scat. Teeth were used to identify mammalian prey hunted by these cats, of which the Hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) was the primary rodent. Other targeted mammals were Peromyscus sp., Sylvilagus sp. and Microtus sp. Invertebrates and birds were less important as prey, but all mammalian prey identified in this study consisted of native animals. While the free-ranging farm cats in this study did not adjust their home range seasonally, sex and reproductive status did increase diurnal and nocturnal home range size. Ultimately, larger home ranges of free-ranging cats could negatively impact native wildlife. © 2015 Kitts-Morgan et al.},

In the present study, we assessed the risk posed by transgenic rice expressing a Cry1Ab/1Ac fusion protein (Huahui 1, HH1) on the development of Xenopus laevis. For 90 days, froglets were fed a diet with 30% HH1 rice, 30% parental rice (Minghui 63, MH63), or no rice as a control. Body weight and length were measured every 15 days. After sacrificing the froglets, we performed a range of biological, clinical, and pathological assessments. No significant differences were found in body weight (on day 90: 27.7 ± 2.17, 27.4 ± 2.40, and 27.9 ± 1.67 g for HH1, MH63, and control, respectively), body length (on day 90: 60.2 ± 1.55, 59.3 ± 2.33, and 59.7 ± 1.64 mm for HH1, MH63, and control, respectively), animal behavior, organ weight, liver and kidney function, or the microstructure of some tissues between the froglets fed on the HH1-containing diet and those fed on the MH63-containing or control diets.

abstract={This protocol describes the modified hole board (mHB), which combines features from a traditional hole board and open field and is designed to measure multiple dimensions of unconditioned behavior in small laboratory mammals (e.g., mice, rats, tree shrews and small primates). This paradigm is a valuable alternative for the use of a behavioral test battery, since a broad behavioral spectrum of an animal’s behavioral profile can be investigated in one single test. The apparatus consists of a box, representing the ‘protected’ area, separated from a group compartment. A board, on which small cylinders are staggered in three lines, is placed in the center of the box, representing the ‘unprotected’ area of the set-up. The cognitive abilities of the animals can be measured by baiting some cylinders on the board and measuring the working and reference memory. Other unconditioned behavior, such as activity-related-, anxiety-related- and social behavior, can be observed using this paradigm. Behavioral flexibility and the ability to habituate to a novel environment can additionally be observed by subjecting the animals to multiple trials in the mHB, revealing insight into the animals’ adaptive capacities. Due to testing order effects in a behavioral test battery, naïve animals should be used for each individual experiment. By testing multiple behavioral dimensions in a single paradigm and thereby circumventing this issue, the number of experimental animals used is reduced. Furthermore, by avoiding social isolation during testing and without the need to food deprive the animals, the mHB represents a behavioral test system, inducing if any, very low amount of stress. © 2015 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License.},

abstract={Many small mammals bask in the sun during rewarming from heterothermy, but the implications of this behaviour for their energy balance remain little understood. Specifically, it remains unclear whether solar radiation supplements endogenous metabolic thermogenesis (i.e., rewarming occurs through the additive effects of internally-produced and external heat), or whether solar radiation reduces the energy required to rewarm by substituting (i.e, replacing) metabolic heat production. To address this question, we examined patterns of torpor and rewarming rates in eastern rock elephant shrews (Elephantulus myurus) housed in outdoor cages with access to either natural levels of solar radiation or levels that were experimentally reduced by means of shade cloth. We also tested whether acclimation to solar radiation availability was manifested via phenotypic flexibility in basal metabolic rate (BMR), non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) capacity and/or summit metabolism (Msum). Rewarming rates varied significantly among treatments, with elephant shrews experiencing natural solar radiation levels rewarming faster than conspecifics experiencing solar radiation levels equivalent to approximately 20% or 40% of natural levels. BMR differed significantly between individuals experiencing natural levels of solar radiation and conspecifics experiencing approximately 20% of natural levels, but no between-treatment difference was evident for NST capacity or Msum. The positive relationship between solar radiation availability and rewarming rate, together with the absence of acclimation in maximum non-shivering and total heat production capacities, suggests that under the conditions of this study solar radiation supplemented rather than substituted metabolic thermogenesis as a source of heat during rewarming from heterothermy. © 2015 Thompson et al.},

abstract={Infants are born equipped to ingest nutrients, but have to learn what to eat. This must occur early, because the mode of feeding evolves dramatically, from “tube” feeding in utero to eating family foods. Eating habits established during early years contribute to the development of subsequent eating habits. Therefore, it is fundamental to understand the most important early periods (between birth and 2 years, i.e. onset of food neophobia) for the development of eating habits and the drivers of this development. The role of pleasure in eating is central, especially during childhood when cognitive drivers of food choices may be less prominent than later in life. It is not easy to define and measure pleasure of eating in early childhood. However, it is possible to identify the characteristics of the eating experience which contribute to drive infant's eating and to shape preferences (food sensory properties; food rewarding properties; social context of eating). The learning processes involve repeated exposure (including to a variety of flavours), association with post-absorptive consequences and with contextual signals (including family members). The important early periods for learning food pleasure start being well identified. Beyond the first flavour discoveries during the prenatal and lactation periods (through the infant's exposure to flavours from foods of the mother's diet), the most important phase may be the beginning of complementary feeding. Infants discover the sensory (texture, taste and flavour) and nutritional properties (energy density) of the foods that will ultimately compose their adult diet; parents are still in charge of providing appropriate foods, timing, context for eating. Inter-individual differences in food pleasure learning, related to temperamental dimensions, or to sensory sensitivity also have to be taken into account. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background Observational studies have repeatedly demonstrated relationships between habitual diet quality and depression. However, whilst reverse causality has not been the identified mechanism for these associations in prospective studies, the relationship between diet and depression is likely complex and bidirectional. Thus explicit investigation of the reverse causality hypothesis is warranted. Methods Data were drawn from the Personality and Total Health (PATH) Through Life Study, a longitudinal community survey following three age cohorts from Australia. Analyses evaluated the relationships between past depression and treatment, current depressive symptoms and dietary patterns. Results Individuals with current depression had lower scores on a healthy dietary pattern; however, those who had been previously depressed and sought treatment had higher scores on the healthy dietary pattern at the later baseline assessment. Moreover, those who had reported prior, but not current, depression also had lower scores on the western dietary pattern than those without prior depression, regardless of whether they had been previously treated for their symptoms. Limitations Self-report data and possible recall bias limit our conclusions. Conclusions In this study, prior depression was associated with better quality diets at the later time point. Thus, while current depression is associated with poorer dietary habits, a history of depression may prompt healthier dietary behaviours in the long term. Given the demonstrated relationships between diet quality and depressive illness, clinicians should advocate dietary improvement for their patients with depression and should not be pessimistic about the likelihood of adherence to such recommendations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Males often exercise mate choice when mating frequency is constrained, costs of choice are low and variation in female quality and/or expected paternity can be reliably detected. Across invertebrates, males use sex pheromones to discern female mating status, but there are few demonstrations that information about expected fecundity ('quality') is encoded in pheromones alone. Here we examine whether females' sex pheromones allow males to detect differences in female food intake and mass in two species of widow spiders (Latrodectus hesperus and Latrodectus hasselti) in which chemicals are deposited by females in silk. Recent work shows that male L.hesperus prefer well-fed females, and that these females produce more silk than hungry females. Thus, changes in diet could be mechanistically linked to changes in silk-bound pheromonal signals. We show that unmated females of both species lose more than half of their mass when food is withheld, and silk production is reduced by 48% (L.hesperus) to 67% (L.hasselti). Males had a significant sexual response to pheromones extracted from the females' silk in both species, although this response was not directly correlated with silk or female mass. In L.hesperus, but not in L.hasselti, males were less responsive to sex pheromones from food-deprived females compared to well-fed females. While females on good diets provide the benefit of higher fecundity in both species, the risk of being cannibalized by hungry females during courtship exists only in L.hesperus. We conclude that sex pheromones alone can provide information about recent female feeding history, possibly reducing the costs of males expressing choice in the field. The species difference in male response also suggests that male preferences in these spiders may depend less on the benefit of seeking a highly fecund female and more on avoiding the cost of risky mating attempts with a likely cannibal. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Animals frequently compete over limited resources such as food, territories or mating opportunities. Contest behaviour varies based on factors such as the value of the contested resources and the agonistic ability of rivals. Much work on animal contests has examined aggression, but vigilance, or a state of heightened alertness directed towards specific stimuli, may also be an important component of competition in many species. In this study, we measure the relationships among social vigilance, aggression, agonistic ability and resource value during staged contests over nest ownership in Polistes dominula nest-founding wasps. Our results show that both social vigilance and aggression are involved in mediating social risk during contests. Nest owner vigilance towards a rival increased with the time of season, a measure of nest value. Owner vigilance was also positively associated with aggression such that more aggressive owners were more vigilant. During contests, aggression of owners and rivals was influenced by different factors. Owner aggression was positively associated with nest size, another measure of nest value, while rival aggression was unrelated to nest size. Instead, rival aggression was associated with facial patterns that function as signals of agonistic ability; rivals were less aggressive to owners that signalled high agonistic ability than they were to owners that signalled low agonistic ability. The distinct predictors of contest behaviour between owners and rivals indicate that competitive role has a surprisingly strong influence on cues used to inform contest behaviour. Differences may occur because owners and rivals have different information and/or motivation. These results also suggest that social vigilance and aggression may be complementary behaviours that animals use to mitigate social threat. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Background The prevalence of mental illness, particularly depression and dementia, is increased by obesity. Here, we test the hypothesis that obesity-associated changes in gut microbiota are intrinsically able to impair neurocognitive behavior in mice. Methods Conventionally housed, nonobese, adult male C57BL/6 mice maintained on a normal chow diet were subjected to a microbiome depletion/transplantation paradigm using microbiota isolated from donors on either a high-fat diet (HFD) or control diet. Following re-colonization, mice were subjected to comprehensive behavioral and biochemical analyses. Results The mice given HFD microbiota had significant and selective disruptions in exploratory, cognitive, and stereotypical behavior compared with mice with control diet microbiota in the absence of significant differences in body weight. Sequencing-based phylogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of distinct core microbiota between groups, with alterations in α- and β-diversity, modulation in taxonomic distribution, and statistically significant alterations to metabolically active taxa. HFD microbiota also disrupted markers of intestinal barrier function, increased circulating endotoxin, and increased lymphocyte expression of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1, toll-like receptor 2, and toll-like receptor 4. Finally, evaluation of brain homogenates revealed that HFD-shaped microbiota increased neuroinflammation and disrupted cerebrovascular homeostasis. Conclusions Collectively, these data reinforce the link between gut dysbiosis and neurologic dysfunction and suggest that dietary and/or pharmacologic manipulation of gut microbiota could attenuate the neurologic complications of obesity. © 2015 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract={Dogs are able to solve different problems by trial and error learning, but it seems that they cannot understand the means-end connection. Some studies suggest that dogs' performance is influenced by their breed and by the level of familiarity with the person they interact with. In our study, we assess individual differences in both social and non-social responses in a problem-solving task during the acquisition, extinction, and reacquisition phases. In order to investigate the effect of familiarity, in the first experiment, the human present during the task was either a familiar (the dog's owner) or unfamiliar person. In the second experiment, we compared breeds (Retrievers and Shepherds) that had previously shown differences in a communicative task. The results revealed that all groups learned the task and became more efficient in the acquisition trials. These non-social responses diminished during extinction, where an increase in social responses was observed. With regard to individual differences, dogs were more persistent in searching the reward during the second extinction trial when the owner was present (in contrast with a stranger), and also looked longer at the unfamiliar person at the beginning of the acquisition trial. On the other hand, Retrievers showed greater social motivation during reacquisition and Shepherds picked up more bones during the third acquisition trial, thus suggesting a more persistent search of the reward. These findings highlight the relevance of studying different learning schedules as well as individual differences in problem-solving ability so as to improve selection and training techniques. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Aim: To examine whether prolonged dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibition can reverse learning and memory impairment in high-fat-fed mice. Methods: High-fat-fed mice received oral sitagliptin (50mg/kg body weight) once daily or saline vehicle over 21days. An additional group of mice on standard chow received saline vehicle. Energy intake, body weight, glucose and insulin concentrations were measured at regular intervals. Glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, novel object recognition, DPP-4 activity, hormone analysis, hippocampal gene expression and histology were performed. Results: Sitagliptin decreased circulating DPP-4 activity and improved glucose tolerance, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, and reduced plasma triglycerides and cholesterol levels. DPP-4 inhibition improved recognition memory (1.2-fold increase) without affecting hypermoteric activity or anxiety levels. Improvement in memory and learning was linked to reduced immunostaining for 8-oxoguanine and increased doublecortin staining in the hippocampus, which were indicative of reduced brain oxidative stress and increased hippocampal neurogenesis, respectively. These effects were associated with significant upregulation of hippocampal gene expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor, synaptophysin, sirtuin 1, glycogen synthase kinase 3β, superdioxide mutase 2, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 and vascular endothelial growth factor. Total plasma and brain GLP-1 concentrations were significantly increased after sitagliptin therapy, whereas DPP-4 activity in brain tissue was not altered. Conclusion: These studies show that sitagliptin can reverse memory impairment in high-fat-fed mice and is also associated with improved insulin sensitivity, enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis and reduced oxidative stress. DPP-4 inhibitors may therefore exhibit dual benefits by improving metabolic control and reducing the decline in cognitive function. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={The mutualistic interaction between scatter-hoarding rodents and seed plants have a long co-evolutionary history. Plants are believed to have evolved traits that influence the foraging behavior of rodents, thus increasing the probability of seed removal and caching, which benefits the establishment of seedlings. Tannin and nutrient content in seeds are considered among the most essential factors in this plant-animal interaction. However, most previous studies used different species of plant seeds, rendering it difficult to tease apart the relative effect of each single nutrient on rodent foraging behavior due to confounding combinations of nutrient contents across seed species. Hence, to further explore how tannin and different nutritional traits of seed affect scatter-hoarding rodent foraging preferences, we manipulated tannin, fat, protein and starch content levels, and also seed size levels by using an artificial seed system. Our results showed that both tannin and various nutrients significantly affected rodent foraging preferences, but were also strongly affected by seed size. In general, rodents preferred to remove seeds with less tannin. Fat addition could counteract the negative effect of tannin on seed removal by rodents, while the effect of protein addition was weaker. Starch by itself had no effect, but it interacted with tannin in a complex way. Our findings shed light on the effects of tannin and nutrient content on seed removal by scatter-hoarding rodents. We therefore, believe that these and perhaps other seed traits should interactively influence this important plant-rodent interaction. However, how selection operates on seed traits to counterbalance these competing interests/factors merits further study. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Anorexia nervosa and eating disorder not otherwise specified* (not fulfilling Anorexia Nervosa DSM IV criteria) are increasing in Singapore. Patients with eating disorders may also present with other psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. The paper aims to investigate the association of co-morbid psychiatric disorders with the improvement of body mass index (BMI) in these patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis of 182 patients with anorexia and eating disorder not otherwise specified at a tertiary hospital was done. The clinical course of co-morbid psychiatric disorders was correlated with the improvement of body mass index. Results: 109 patients were included in the analysis and the mean BMI on resolution of co-morbid psychiatric disorders was BMI 16.9. There is a significant association between the BMI groups and the resolution of co-morbid psychiatric disorders, χ2 = 10.2, p = .03. Patients in BMI group 5 (BMI 16.6 - 18.5) were noted to be significantly less likely to resolve their psychiatric co-morbidity compared to the other 4 groups. (OR = 0.323).Conclusion: Patients with anorexia nervosa and eating disorders not otherwise specified were at increased risk of having co-morbid psychiatric disorders and the clinical course of co-morbid psychiatric disorders appeared to correlate with improved BMI. Specifically patients with BMI < 16.5 with co-morbid psychiatric disorders were more likely to recover from their co-morbid psychiatric disorder with nutritional rehabilitation than patients with a higher BMI. © 2015 Goh.},

abstract={Phenotypic plasticity is the ability held in many organisms to produce different phenotypes with a given genome in response to environmental stimuli, such as temperature, nutrition and various biological interactions. It seems likely that environmental signals induce a variety of mechanistic responses that influence ontogenetic processes. Inducible defenses, in which prey animals alter their morphology, behavior and/or other traits to help protect against direct or latent predation threats, are among the most striking examples of phenotypic plasticity. The freshwater microcrustacean Daphnia pulex forms tooth-like defensive structures, "neckteeth," in response to chemical cues or signals, referred to as "kairomones," in this case released from phantom midge larvae, a predator of D. pulex. To identify factors involved in the reception and/or transmission of a kairomone, we used microarray analysis to identify genes up-regulated following a short period of exposure to the midge kairomone. In addition to identifying differentially expressed genes of unknown function, we also found significant up-regulation of genes encoding ionotropic glutamate receptors, which are known to be involved in neurotransmission in many animal species. Specific antagonists of these receptors strongly inhibit the formation of neckteeth in D. pulex, although agonists did not induce neckteeth by themselves, indicating that ionotropic glutamate receptors are necessary but not sufficient for early steps of neckteeth formation in D. pulex. Moreover, using co-exposure of D. pulex to antagonists and juvenile hormone (JH), which physiologically mediates neckteeth formation, we found evidence suggesting that the inhibitory effect of antagonists is not due to direct inhibition of JH synthesis/secretion. Our findings not only provide a candidate molecule required for the inducible defense response in D. pulex, but also will contribute to the understanding of complex mechanisms underlying the recognition of environmental changes, which form the basis of phenotypic plasticity. © 2015 Miyakawa et al.},

abstract={Energetic carrying capacity of habitats for wildlife is a fundamental concept used to better understand population ecology and prioritize conservation efforts. However, carrying capacity can be difficult to estimate accurately and simplified models often depend on many assumptions and few estimated parameters. We demonstrate the complex nature of parameterizing energetic carrying capacity models and use an experimental approach to describe a necessary parameter, a foraging threshold (i.e., density of food at which animals no longer can efficiently forage and acquire energy), for a guild of migratory birds. We created foraging patches with different fixed prey densities and monitored the numerical and behavioral responses of waterfowl (Anatidae ) and depletion of foods during winter. Dabbling ducks (Anatini) fed extensively in plots and all initial densities of supplemented seed were rapidly reduced to 10 kg/ha and other natural seeds and tubers combined to 170 kg/ha, despite different starting densities. However, ducks did not abandon or stop foraging in wetlands when seed reduction ceased approximately two weeks into the winter-long experiment nor did they consistently distribute according to ideal-free predictions during this period. Dabbling duck use of experimental plots was not related to initial seed density, and residual seed and tuber densities varied among plant taxa and wetlands but not plots. Herein, we reached several conclusions: 1) foraging effort and numerical responses of dabbling ducks in winter were likely influenced by factors other than total food densities (e.g., predation risk, opportunity costs, forager condition), 2) foraging thresholds may vary among foraging locations, and 3) the numerical response of dabbling ducks may be an inconsistent predictor of habitat quality relative to seed and tuber density. We describe implications on habitat conservation objectives of using different foraging thresholds in energetic carrying capacity models and suggest scientists reevaluate assumptions of these models used to guide habitat conservation. © 2015 Hagy, Kaminski.},

abstract={Transport infrastructure elements are widespread and increasing in size and length in many countries, with the subsequent alteration of landscapes and wildlife communities. Nonetheless, their effects on habitat selection by raptors are still poorly understood. In this paper, we analyzed raptors ' foraging habitat selection in response to conventional roads and high capacity motorways at the landscape scale, and compared their effects with those of other variables, such as habitat structure, food availability, and presence of potential interspecific competitors. We also analyzed whether the raptors' response towards infrastructure depends on the spatial scale of observation, comparing the attraction or avoidance behavior of the species at the landscape scale with the response of individuals observed in the proximity of the infrastructure. Based on ecological hypotheses for foraging habitat selection, we built generalized linear mixed models, selected the best models according to Akaike Information Criterion and assessed variable importance by Akaike weights. At the community level, the traffic volume was the most relevant variable in the landscape for foraging habitat selection. Abundance, richness, and diversity values reached their maximum at medium traffic volumes and decreased at highest traffic volumes. Individual species showed different degrees of tolerance toward traffic, from higher abundance in areas with high traffic values to avoidance of it. Medium-sized opportunistic raptors increased their abundance near the traffic infrastructures, large scavenger raptors avoided areas with higher traffic values, and other species showed no direct response to traffic but to the presence of prey. Finally, our cross-scale analysis revealed that the effect of transport infrastructures on the behavior of some species might be detectable only at a broad scale. Also, food availability may attract raptor species to risky areas such as motorways. © 2015 Planillo et al.},

abstract={Background: Eating disorders appear to be caused by a complex interaction between environmental and genetic factors, and compulsive eating in response to adverse circumstances characterizes many eating disorders. Materials and Methods: We compared compulsion-like eating in the form of conditioned suppression of palatable food-seeking in adverse situations in stressed C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice, two well-characterized inbred strains, to determine the influence of gene-environment interplay on this behavioral phenotype. Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that low accumbal D2 receptor (R) availability is a genetic risk factor of food compulsion-like behavior and that environmental conditions that induce compulsive eating alter D2R expression in the striatum. To this end, we measured D1R and D2R expression in the striatum and D1R, D2R and α1R levels in the medial prefrontal cortex, respectively, by western blot. Results Exposure to environmental conditions induces compulsion-like eating behavior, depending on genetic background. This behavioral pattern is linked to decreased availability of accumbal D2R. Moreover, exposure to certain environmental conditions upregulates D2R and downregulates α1R in the striatumand medial prefrontal cortex, respectively, of compulsive animals. These findings confirm the function of gene-environment interplay in themanifestation of compulsive eating and support the hypothesis that low accumbal D2R availability is a "constitutive" genetic risk factor for compulsion-like eating behavior. Finally, D2R upregulation and α1R downregulation in the striatum and medial prefrontal cortex, respectively, are potential neuroadaptive responses that parallel the shift from motivated to compulsive eating. © 2015 Patrono et al.},

abstract={Many complex factors have been linked to the recent marked increase in honey bee colony failure, including pests and pathogens, agrochemicals, and nutritional stressors. It remains unclear, however, why colonies frequently react to stressors by losing almost their entire adult bee population in a short time, resulting in a colony population collapse. Here we examine the social dynamics underlying such dramatic colony failure. Bees respond to many stressors by foraging earlier in life. We manipulated the demography of experimental colonies to induce precocious foraging in bees and used radio tag tracking to examine the consequences of precocious foraging for their performance. Precocious foragers completed far fewer foraging trips in their life, and had a higher risk of death in their first flights. We constructed a demographic model to explore how this individual reaction of bees to stress might impact colony performance. In the model, when forager death rates were chronically elevated, an increasingly younger forager force caused a positive feedback that dramatically accelerated terminal population decline in the colony. This resulted in a breakdown in division of labor and loss of the adult population, leaving only brood, food, and few adults in the hive. This study explains the social processes that drive rapid depopulation of a colony, and we explore possible strategies to prevent colony failure. Understanding the process of colony failure helps identify the most effective strategies to improve colony resilience.},

abstract={This chapter addresses the effects of various pollutants on the olfactory sense and behaviors associated with fish communication. Pollutants can affect chemical communication at several levels: production, detection and transmission, and behavioral responses to odors. Several studies using electrophysiological techniques (i.e., EOG and EEG) have demonstrated disturbances in the function of the olfactory receptor cells. In the majority of these studies, the olfactory epithelium was exposed to organic pesticides or heavy metal ions followed by olfactory stimulation with amino acids. Several pesticides and metals decreased electrical responses of the olfactory receptor cells. Another set of studies has addressed effects of pollutants on olfactory-mediated behaviors, and many of these have found effects on social behaviors. Examples also exist of the effects of pollutants on the transmission of odors and resulting effects on behavior responses to alarm cues, conspecific juvenile attractants, and endocrine priming pheromones. Although many fish are dependent on an intact olfactory sense to mediate social interactions, reproduce, detect predators, migrate, and find food, our knowledge of the effects of pollutants is unfortunately very limited. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

abstract={Objectives: Administration of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) is an effective strategy to treat and avoid malnutrition, a persisting issue in nursing homes. However, little is known about compliance in the NH population. This study aimed to analyse the effects of compliance of NH residents with a low-volume, nutrientand energy-dense ONS on nutritional status and to identify residents’ characteristics associated with compliance.
Design &amp; Setting: Randomized, controlled trial in nursing homes.
Participants &amp; Intervention: 87 nursing home residents (87±6y, 91% female) with malnutrition or at risk of malnutrition were randomly allocated to an intervention group (IG) receiving 2×125 ml ONS (2.4 kcal/ml)/d for 12 weeks, or the control group (CG) with usual care.
Measurements: ONS intake was recorded daily and compliance calculated. Low and high compliance were defined as ≤30% and ≥80% of provided ONS actually consumed, respectively. Body weight (BW), BMI, upper-arm (UAC) and calf-circumference (CC) and MNA-SF were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks. Associations between compliance and changes of nutritional parameters and residents’ characteristics were analysed.
Results: Compliance was high in 35.7% and low in 28.6% of the IG (n=42). BW change was significantly higher in subjects with high compliance (median +3.0 (interquartile range +2.1;+3.8) kg, n=15) than in those with low compliance (−0.2 (−2.2;+1.6) kg, n=12) and CG (−0.1 (−1.2; +0.6) kg, n=35; p<0.001), and significantly correlated with compliance in IG (r=0.691; p<0.001). Significant differences and correlations were also identified for BMI, UAC and MNA-SF. High compliance was more often observed in residents with malnutrition (66.7 vs. 27.3%) and chewing difficulties (77.8 vs. 24.2%) than in those without these conditions. Low compliance was more prevalent in residents who were immobile (45.0 vs. 13.6%), depressed (33.3 vs. 6.7%) or had gastrointestinal complaints (50.0 vs. 17.9%) (all p<0.05).
Conclusions: A high compliance of nursing home residents with a low volume, nutrient- and energy dense ONS was related to a significantly improved nutritional status in comparison to low compliance and therefore enhanced the effectiveness of ONS. A higher compliance may be achieved by consideration of different residents’ characteristics. © 2014, Serdi and Springer-Verlag France.},

abstract={We compared glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene expression in the hippocampus of rats subjected to a low protein, "malnourished" diet (M; 6% protein) or a control, "well-nourished" diet (W; 16% protein), exposed to different environmental stimulation (environmental enrichment, E; no enrichment, N) between postnatal day 8 (P8) and P35. Rats were tested on the elevated plus maze (EPM) on P36. Male Wistar rats were split into two groups at birth according to diet (M or W) and subdivided according to environmental stimulation (E or N). GR expression was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction and GR immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus. Our results showed that MN rats spent more time and made more entries into the open arms of the EPM compared to W rats. On the other hand, ME rats spent a similar percentage of time, and made a similar number of entries, in the open arms as WN rats. Following the EPM test, GR mRNA expression in the hippocampus was different in MN rats compared to W rats; expression was also different between M and ME rats; mRNA and expression of GR receptors in WN rats was similar to that observed in WE rats. These data also show that the effects of malnutrition on risk assessment in the EPM were reversed by E. Early malnutrition may alter GR expression in the hippocampus and environmental enrichment may exert a neuroprotective effect on malnutrition-induced brain injury. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-producing neurons of the amygdala have been implicated in behavioral and physiological responses associated with fear, anxiety, stress, food intake and reward. To overcome the difficulties in identifying CRF neurons within the amygdala, a novel transgenic mouse line, in which the humanized recombinant Renilla reniformis green fluorescent protein (hrGFP) is under the control of the CRF promoter (CRF-hrGFP mice), was developed. First, the CRF-hrGFP mouse model was validated and the localization of CRF neurons within the amygdala was systematically mapped. Amygdalar hrGFP-expressing neurons were located primarily in the interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure, but also present in the central amygdala. Secondly, the marker of neuronal activation c-Fos was used to explore the response of amygdalar CRF neurons in CRF-hrGFP mice under different experimental paradigms. C-Fos induction was observed in CRF neurons of CRF-hrGFP mice exposed to an acute social defeat stress event, a fasting/refeeding paradigm or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. In contrast, no c-Fos induction was detected in CRF neurons of CRF-hrGFP mice exposed to restraint stress, forced swimming test, 48-h fasting, acute high-fat diet (HFD) consumption, intermittent HFD consumption, ad libitum HFD consumption, HFD withdrawal, conditioned HFD aversion, ghrelin administration or melanocortin 4 receptor agonist administration. Thus, this study fully characterizes the distribution of amygdala CRF neurons in mice and suggests that they are involved in some, but not all, stress or food intake-related behaviors recruiting the amygdala. © 2015 IBRO.},

abstract={Behavioral responses to food deprivation are a fundamental aspect of nervous system function in all animals. Several signaling molecules in the mammalian brain act through G proteins of the Gi/o family to mediate response to food restriction. The present study examined whether food intake changes under a condition of little stimulation to eat, such as that elicited by 4 h of food deprivation, was altered by Gi/o isoform silencing induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (aODN) against the α subunit of Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, Go1 and Go2. The effect of aODN pretreatments on food intake was evaluated 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after food re-administration. Selective effects were noted on food intake with anti-Giα1 (3.12-25 nmol), Giα3 (1.56-12.5 nmol) and Goα2 (3.12-25 nmol) aODN exerting increase in food consumption, while anti-Giα2 (3.12-25 nmol) and Goα1 (3.12-25 nmol) aODN exerting decrease in food consumption. We observed the effect of the α-subunit silencing on food consumption as soon as 15 min after food readministration, that was still significant after 60 min. At the highest effective doses, different for each anti-Gαi/o subunit, any treatment did not impair motor coordination, nor modified spontaneous mobility and exploratory activity. These results indicate a relevant distinction between Gαi/o subunits on feeding behavior, and suggest that Gi/o proteins are critical for the integrative modulation of normal feeding behavior. Changes in Gi/o protein activity may be associated with modifications of feeding. ©2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Herbivory on Mediterranean seagrass species is generally low compared to consumption of some other temperate and tropical species of seagrasses. In this study we: (1) investigate the feeding preference of the two dominant Mediterranean seagrass herbivores, the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and the fish Sarpa salpa, on Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa and (2) elucidate the role of epiphytes in herbivore choices. We assessed consumption rates by tethering seagrass shoots, and preferences by food choice experiments with the following paired combinations: 1) Epiphytized leaves of both C.nodosa vs. P.oceanica (CE vs PE); 2) Non-epiphytized leaves of C.nodosa vs. P.oceanica (CNE vs. PNE); 3) Epiphytized vs non-epiphytized leaves of C.nodosa (CE vs. CNE) and 4) Epiphytized vs non-epiphytized leaves of P.oceanica (PE vs PNE). We found that preference for C.nodosa was weak for S.salpa, but strong for P.lividus, the species responsible for most consumption at our study. Overall both herbivores showed preference for epiphytized leaves. The higher nutritional quality of C.nodosa leaves and epiphytes together with the high coverage and diversity of the epiphyte community found on its leaves help explain the higher levels of herbivory recorded on epiphyted leaves of C.nodosa. Other factors such as seagrass accessibility, herbivore mobility and size, and behavioral responses to predation risks, may also affect the intensity of seagrass herbivory, and studies addressing the interactions with these factors are needed to improve our understanding of the nature, extent and implications of herbivory in coastal ecosystems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In two experiments rats received training on an object-in-context (OIC) task, in which they received preexposure to object A in context x, followed by exposure to object B in context y. In a subsequent test both A and B are presented in either context x or context y. Usually more exploration is seen of the object that has not previously been paired with the test context, an effect attributed to the ability to remember where an object was encountered. However, in the typical version of this task, object A has also been encountered less recently than object B at test. This is precisely the arrangement in tests of 'relatively recency' (RR), in which more remotely presented objects are explored more than objects experienced more recently. RR could contaminate performance on the OIC task, by enhancing the OIC effect when animals are tested in context y, and masking it when the test is in context x. This possibility was examined in two experiments, and evidence for superior performance in context y was obtained. The implications of this for theoretical interpretations of recognition memory and the procedures used to explore it are discussed. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={The objective of the present experiment was to investigate the implications of severe maternal undernutrition on the post-weaning behavior of rabbits. Thirty two does were randomly assigned to four groups: the control group (C) that was fed 100% of the recommended energy maintenance requirements throughout pregnancy and lactation and the U1, U2 and U3 groups that were fed 50% of the recommended energy maintenance requirements between the 6th and the 19th day of pregnancy, between the 20th and the 27th day of pregnancy and between the 3rd and the 10th day of lactation, respectively. At the age of 50 and 65. days, behavior of rabbits in cages was recorded and rabbits were further subjected to an open-field test; a paradigm used as an indicator of fear and emotional distress.Significant differences were found between the U2 and the other experimental groups for the duration of eating and drinking, and duration of locomotory and investigatory behaviors (P. <. 0.05). At the age of 65. days, duration of comfort behaviors was also lower in the U2 compared to the other groups (P. <. 0.05). On the other hand, duration of resting appeared to be the highest in the group of rabbits born from undernourished does between the 20th and the 27th day of pregnancy (P. <. 0.05). Duration of resting was significantly increased, although frequency and duration of eating and drinking were significantly decreased at the age of 65. days (P. <. 0.05). Male rabbits had greater values for locomotory and investigatory behaviors, and duration of eating and drinking compared to the females (P. <. 0.01). A decreased activity of rabbits during the light period was observed (as expected), whereas an increase in duration of locomotory and investigatory behaviors was observed during the first four and the last 4. h of the light and dark periods, respectively (P. <. 0.05).Rabbits born from the U1 and U2 group of does displayed increased rates of latency to leave the start position compared to the other groups during the implementation of the open-field test (P. <. 0.05). No other significant differences in the exhibition of the examined behaviors were found between the treatment groups, with the exception of 'moving forelegs' activity that had the lowest value in the U3 group of rabbits.It is concluded that severe maternal undernutrition (50% of the recommended maintenance requirements) especially between the 20th and the 27th day of pregnancy has significant effects on the exhibition of rabbits' post-weaning behavior, since the offspring from the U2 undernourished does were significantly less active compared to the other experimental groups. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Although speech and language deficits are common in children and strongly associated with poor educational and social outcomes, little attention has been paid to the antecedents. In this study we used the information from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children to examine preconception and prenatal environmental risk factors that were related to communication difficulties in children using the Children's Communication Checklist (CCC). We used an exposome-wide approach to identify environmental factors univariably associated with the CCC. Taking account of the False Discovery rate, we used a P value of 0.000157 to identify 621 of 3855 items tested. These were then subjected to a series of stepwise linear regression analyses, firstly within 10 domains: personal characteristics, health, development, education, socio-economic variables, lifestyle, home and social environments, life events and chemical and other exposures; and then with the predictive variables from each domain. The final model consisted of 19 variables independently associated with the communication scale. These variables suggested 6 possible mechanisms: stressors primarily associated with socio-economic disadvantage although other lifestyle choices such as a social network of family or friends can ameliorate these effects; indicators of future parenting skills primarily associated with aspects of parental personality; aspects of the home environment; poor maternal health with a novel finding concerning maternal hearing loss; and maternal education which was partially mediated by the child's IQ. Finally, there may be a mechanism via the maternal diet in pregnancy in particular the consumption of fatty or processed foods. This is the subject of ongoing investigation. © 2015 Steer et al.},

abstract={Stressful environmental conditions such as periods of poor nutrition have been shown to affect a variety of life history traits. Although nutrition-induced effects on the phenotype can appear through the entire life of an individual, it is becoming evident that there are sensitive periods during development when phenotypic traits have heightened sensitivity to nutritional conditions. Very few studies have investigated how nutrition can affect an important aspect of an organism's phenotype: the development of its 'personality'. In this study we manipulated the availability of the main micronutrients (i.e. vitamins and essential minerals) present in the diet of zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, during their postnatal development and/or during their sexual maturation. Later, once the birds were fully adult, we assessed a series of behavioural traits previously used to assess personality in birds. We found that low availability of dietary micronutrients during the postnatal period resulted in reduced boldness in males once they reached adulthood, but had no effect on adult stress responses or neophobic behaviour. No such effects were found in females. In contrast, a low micronutrient diet during sexual maturation led in both sexes to reduced stress responses and neophobic behaviours in adulthood. Interestingly, we also found that females became more aggressive as adults if they had received a low micronutrient diet during development, irrespective of when the availability of micronutrients was modified. Overall, our results demonstrate substantial effects of diet on the development of behavioural traits, and that these effects differ both between the sexes and over different developmental periods. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Mate selection can be stressful; time spent searching for mates can increase predation risk and/or decrease food consumption, resulting in elevated stress hormone levels. Both high predation risk and low food availability are often associated with increased variation in mate choice by females, but it is not clear whether stress hormone levels contribute to such variation in female behavior. We examined how the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) affects female preferences for acoustic signals in the green treefrog, Hyla cinerea. Specifically, we assessed whether CORT administration affects female preferences for call rate - an acoustic feature that is typically under directional selection via mate choice by females in most anurans and other species that communicate using acoustic signals. Using a dual speaker playback paradigm, we show that females that were administered higher doses of CORT were less likely to choose male advertisement calls broadcast at high rates. Neither CORT dose nor level was related to the latency of female phonotactic responses, suggesting that elevated CORT does not influence the motivation to mate. Results were also not related to circulating sex steroids (i.e., progesterone, androgens or estradiol) that have traditionally been the focus of studies examining the hormonal basis for variation in female mate choice. Our results thus indicate that elevated CORT levels decrease the strength of female preferences for acoustic signals. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Animals carefully regulate the amount of protein that they consume. The quantity of individual essential amino acids (EAAs) obtained from dietary protein depends on the protein source, but how the proportion of EAAs in the diet affects nutrient balancing has rarely been studied. Recent research using the Geometric Framework for Nutrition has revealed that forager honeybees who receive much of their dietary EAAs from floral nectar and not from solid protein have relatively low requirements for dietary EAAs. Here, we examined the nutritional requirements for protein and carbohydrates of foragers of the bufftailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris. By using protein (sodium caseinate) or an equimolar mixture of the 10 EAAs, we found that the intake target (nutritional optimum) of adult workers depended on the source and proportion of dietary EAAs. When bees consumed caseinate-containing diets in a range of ratios between 1:250 and 1:25 (protein to carbohydrate), they achieved an intake target (IT) of 1:149 (w/w). In contrast to those fed protein, bees fed the EAA diets had an IT more biased towards carbohydrates (1:560 w/w) but also had a greater risk of death than those fed caseinate. We also tested how the dietary source of EAAs affected free AAs in bee haemolymph. Bees fed diets near their IT had similar haemolymph AA profiles, whereas bees fed diets high in caseinate had elevated levels of leucine, threonine, valine and alanine in the haemolymph. We found that like honeybees, bumblebee workers prioritize carbohydrate intake and have a relatively low requirement for protein. The dietary source of EAAs influenced both the ratio of protein/EAA to carbohydrate and the overall amount of carbohydrate eaten. Our data support the idea that EAAs and carbohydrates in haemolymph are important determinants of nutritional state in insects. © 2015. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.},

abstract={Might there be parallels between category learning in animals and word learning in children? To examine this possibility, we devised a new associative learning technique for teaching pigeons to sort 128 photographs of objects into 16 human language categories. We found that pigeons learned all 16 categories in parallel, they perceived the perceptual coherence of the different object categories, and they generalized their categorization behavior to novel photographs from the training categories. More detailed analyses of the factors that predict trial-by-trial learning implicated a number of factors that may shape learning. First, we found considerable trial-by-trial dependency of pigeons' categorization responses, consistent with several recent studies that invoke this dependency to claim that humans acquire words via symbolic or inferential mechanisms; this finding suggests that such dependencies may also arise in associative systems. Second, our trial-by-trial analyses divulged seemingly irrelevant aspects of the categorization task, like the spatial location of the report responses, which influenced learning. Third, those trial-by-trial analyses also supported the possibility that learning may be determined both by strengthening correct stimulus-response associations and by weakening incorrect stimulus-response associations. The parallel between all these findings and important aspects of human word learning suggests that associative learning mechanisms may play a much stronger part in complex human behavior than is commonly believed. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={While perfectionism is widely considered to influence risk for eating disorders, results of longitudinal studies are mixed. The goal of the current study was to investigate a more complex model of how baseline perfectionism (both high personal standards and self-critical evaluative concerns) might influence change in risk status for eating disorders in young adolescent girls, through its influence on ineffectiveness. The study was conducted with 926 girls (mean age of 13 years), and involved three waves of data (baseline, 6- and 12-month follow-up). Latent growth curve modelling, incorporating the average rate at which risk changed over time, the intercept (initial status) of ineffectiveness, and baseline perfectionism, was used to explore longitudinal mediation. Personal standards was not supported as contributing to risk but results indicated that the higher mean scores on ineffectiveness over the three waves mediated the relationship between higher baseline self-critical evaluative concerns and both measures of eating disorder risk. The relationship between concern over mistakes and change in risk was small and negative. These results suggest the usefulness of interventions related to self-criticism and ineffectiveness for decreasing risk for developing an eating disorder in young adolescent girls. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background and Aims: Weight management is a cornerstone of treatment for overweight/obese persons with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This exploratory study sought to: (i) evaluate readiness to change weight-related behaviours; (ii) assess psychosocial characteristics that may interfere with weight loss; and (iii) evaluate how baseline psychosocial features associate with 6-month change in weight in persons with NAFLD receiving standard medical care. The purpose of this investigation was to develop hypotheses regarding relationships between psychosocial factors and weight for use in future fully powered studies and clinical interventions Methods: Fifty-eight overweight/obese participants with NAFLD completed baseline measures of personality, psychiatric symptoms and readiness for behaviour change and were followed up for 6 months in standard care. Results: One-third of participants (31.0%) were not interested in making weight-related behaviour changes; 58.6% were considering making a change, and 10.4% of individuals were actively working on or preparing to change. Six-month change in weight was non-significant and was not associated with baseline readiness for change. Depression, low conscientiousness and high neuroticism were associated with higher weight at 6-month follow-up with small to large effect sizes. Conclusions: Although participants received nutritional education and guidance, very few individuals presented in the active stage of change. Although readiness for change did not predict subsequent change in weight, personality factors and psychiatric symptoms were associated with weight outcomes. Integrated multidisciplinary approaches that address psychiatric needs and provide behavioural support for weight loss may help patients with NAFLD implement sustained lifestyle changes. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

abstract={Movement is a key mean for mobile species to cope with heterogeneous environments. While in herbivorous mammals large-scale migration has been widely investigated, finescale movement responses to local variations in resources and predation risk remain much less studied, especially in savannah environments. We developed a novel approach based on complementary movement metrics (residence time, frequency of visits and regularity of visits) to relate movement patterns of a savannah grazer, the blue wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus , to fine-scale variations in food availability, predation risk and water availability in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Wildebeests spent more time in grazing lawns where the grass is of higher quality but shorter than in seep zones, where the grass is of lower quality but more abundant. Although the daily distances moved were longer during the wet season compared to the dry season, the daily net displacement was lower, and the residence time higher, indicating a more frequent occurrence of area-concentred searching. In contrast, during the late dry season the foraging sessions were more fragmented and wildebeests moved more frequently between foraging areas. Surprisingly, predation risk appeared to be the second factor, after water availability, influencing movement during the dry season, when resources are limiting and thus expected to influence movement more. Our approach, using complementary analyses of different movement metrics, provided an integrated view of changes in individual movement with varying environmental conditions and predation risk. It makes it possible to highlight the adaptive behavioral decisions made by wildebeest to cope with unpredictable environmental variations and provides insights for population conservation. © 2015 Martin et al.},

abstract={Orthorexia nervosa describes a pathological obsession with proper nutrition that is characterized by a restrictive diet, ritualized patterns of eating, and rigid avoidance of foods believed to be unhealthy or impure. Although prompted by a desire to achieve optimum health, orthorexia may lead to nutritional deficiencies, medical complications, and poor quality of life. Despite its being a distinct behavioral pattern that is frequently observed by clinicians, orthorexia has received very little empirical attention and is not yet formally recognized as a psychiatric disorder. In this review, we synthesize existing research to identify what is known about the symptoms, prevalence, neuropsychological profile, and treatment of orthorexia. An examination of diagnostic boundaries reveals important points of symptom overlap between orthorexia and anorexia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD), somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, and psychotic spectrum disorders. Neuropsychological data suggest that orthorexic symptoms are independently associated with key facets of executive dysfunction for which some of these conditions already overlap. Discussion of cognitive weaknesses in set-shifting, external attention, and working memory highlights the value of continued research to identify intermediate, transdiagnostic endophenotypes for insight into the neuropathogenesis of orthorexia. An evaluation of current orthorexia measures indicates a need for further psychometric development to ensure that subsequent research has access to reliable and valid assessment tools. Optimized assessment will not only permit a clearer understanding of prevalence rates, psychosocial risk factors, and comorbid psychopathology but will also be needed to index intervention effectiveness. Though the field lacks data on therapeutic outcomes, current best practices suggest that orthorexia can successfully be treated with a combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychoeducation, and medication. © 2015 Gül et al.},

abstract={Small rodents with multi-annual population cycles strongly influence the dynamics of food webs, and in particular predator-prey interactions, across most of the tundra biome. Rodents are however absent from some arctic islands, and studies on performance of arctic predators under such circumstances may be very instructive since rodent cycles have been predicted to collapse in a warming Arctic. Here we document for the first time how three normally rodentdependent predator species-rough-legged buzzard, arctic fox and red fox - perform in a low-arctic ecosystem with no rodents. During six years (in 2006-2008 and 2011-2013) we studied diet and breeding performance of these predators in the rodent-free Kolguev Island in Arctic Russia. The rough-legged buzzards, previously known to be a small rodent specialist, have only during the last two decades become established on Kolguev Island. The buzzards successfully breed on the island at stable low density, but with high productivity based on goslings and willow ptarmigan as their main prey - altogether representing a novel ecological situation for this species. Breeding density of arctic fox varied from year to year, but with stable productivity based on mainly geese as prey. The density dynamic of the arctic fox appeared to be correlated with the date of spring arrival of the geese. Red foxes breed regularly on the island but in very low numbers that appear to have been unchanged over a long period - a situation that resemble what has been recently documented from Arctic America. Our study suggests that the three predators found breeding on Kolguev Island possess capacities for shifting to changing circumstances in low-arctic ecosystem as long as other small - medium sized terrestrial herbivores are present in good numbers. © 2015 Pokrovsky et al.},

abstract={Background: Food neophobia, the rejection of unknown or novel foods, may result in poor dietary patterns. This study investigates the cross-sectional relationship between neophobia in children aged 24 months and variety of fruit and vegetable consumption, intake of discretionary foods and weight. Methods: Secondary analysis of data from 330 parents of children enrolled in the NOURISH RCT (control group only) and SAIDI studies was performed using data collected at child age 24 months. Neophobia was measured at 24 months using the Child Food Neophobia Scale (CFNS). The cross-sectional associations between total CFNS score and fruit and vegetable variety, discretionary food intake and BMI (Body Mass Index) Z-score were examined via multiple regression models; adjusting for significant covariates. Results: At 24 months, more neophobic children were found to have lower variety of fruits (β = -0.16, p = 0.003) and vegetables (β = -0.29, p < 0.001) but have a greater proportion of daily energy from discretionary foods (β = 0.11, p = 0.04). There was no significant association between BMI Z-score and CFNS score. Conclusions: Neophobia is associated with poorer dietary quality. Results highlight the need for interventions to (1) begin early to expose children to a wide variety of nutritious foods before neophobia peaks and (2) enable health professionals to educate parents on strategies to overcome neophobia. © 2015 Perry et al.},

abstract={Behavioral coping refers to the ability to modify behavior to escape from stress, and is protective against the development of depressive disorders. Omega-3 fatty acid (n-3 FA) intake is inversely correlated with anxiety and depression in humans. The objective of this study was to determine if consumption of n-3 FAs promotes adaptive coping behaviors in a multiparous rat model. Twenty female rats were randomly assigned to diets with or without n-3 FA containing menhaden oil or sunflower oil as the fat source, respectively. Rats experienced two cycles of gestation and lactation. Behavioral testing began on the second day after the last parturition. Rats consuming n-3 FAs displayed improved escape learning in the shuttle box test. Specifically, rats consuming n-3 FAs escaped footshock more quickly and had a greater number of successful escapes in the shuttle box than rats not consuming n-3 FAs. Diet did not affect general activity in the open field, but rats consuming n-3 FAs showed less reactivity and habituation to novelty in the open field than rats not consuming n-3 FAs. Immobility and swimming in the forced swim test, risk-taking assessed by the light/dark test, sucrose drinking, and motor coordination were not significantly affected by diet. A diet enriched with n-3 FAs promoted behavioral escape changes consistent with increased adaptive coping to stressful events, suggesting that n-3 FAs may help prevent the development of stress-related depressive disorders. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Parental care is necessary for the survival of most mammalian offspring. However, this is especially true for neonatal sea otters (Enhydra lutris), which are the most altricial of marine mammals born at sea. The female not only feeds the pup but also protects it from environmental and predatory threats while maintaining the insulating properties of its fur for thermoregulation. We studied the behavior of female sea otters and their pups during the first three months postpartum in Simpson Bay, Alaska. Six behaviors for females and seven behaviors for pups were recorded to produce 24-h activity budgets. Pups were classified into three behavioral/size categories: Category 1 (C1) 0 – < 4 wks old; Category 2 (C2) 4 – < 8 wks old; Category 3 (C3) 8–12 wks. The percentage of time females spent feeding increased from 9% (C1) to 32% (C3) reflecting the increased nutritional requirements of the maturing pups. C1 females spent 21% of their time swimming in a meandering manner, possibly to protect young pups from predation, which decreased to 8% for females with C3 pups. The time spent resting by females (ca. 50%) was independent of pup category. C1 pups spent 83% of their day resting which decreased to 48% for C3 pups. Time spent nursing remained constant (ca. 8%) for all pup categories, but feeding on solid food provided mainly by the female increased to 17% (C3 pups). The percentage of time that pups spent swimming increased to 17% (C3 pups) as they developed strength and coordination. Our results provide a quantitative picture of the changes in female and pup behavior and activity patterns during the early and critical developmental stages of altricial pups at sea. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Predators can impact their prey via consumptive effects that occur through direct killing, and via non-consumptive effects that arise when the behaviour and phenotypes of prey shift in response to the risk of predation. Although predators' consumptive effects can have cascading population-level effects on species at lower trophic levels there is less evidence that predators' non-consumptive effects propagate through ecosystems. Here we provide evidence that suppression of abundance and activity of a mesopredator (the feral cat) by an apex predator (the dingo) has positive effects on both abundance and foraging efficiency of a desert rodent. Then by manipulating predators' access to food patches we further the idea that apex predators provide small prey with refuge from predation by showing that rodents increased their habitat breadth and use of ‘risky′ food patches where an apex predator was common but mesopredators rare. Our study suggests that apex predators' suppressive effects on mesopredators extend to alleviate both mesopredators' consumptive and non-consumptive effects on prey. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Adopting different behavioural strategies may reduce within-group conflict, selecting for behavioural consistency ('personality'). Personality may also affect grouping tendencies. The relationship between the personality dimensions sociability and boldness nevertheless remains unclear. This knowledge gap may reflect a failure to consider potential trade-offs between avoiding conspecifics, potentially alleviating social stress, and avoiding predation. Furthermore, the effects of personality and state (e.g. body condition or age affecting the costs and benefits of behavioural actions) on cooperativeness should be considered together. This is because state may explain predation vulnerability, which may affect boldness under predation risk, and thus antipredator grouping tendencies. To address the problem, we determined how group size preference and group-forming time depended on boldness (flight initiation distance, FID, in response to an approaching human), body condition and breeding experience in facultatively social eiders, Somateria mollissima, where females form coalitions or care for the young solitarily. Breeding adults and young are subject to high predation pressure, providing a strong incentive for brood-tending females to cooperate. Because hormonal differences may also explain differences in sociability, we included baseline and handling-induced serum corticosterone concentrations of incubating females as potential predictors of sociability. We also statistically controlled for availability of potential partners. The relationship between boldness (FID) and the number of coalition partners ranged from negative (females in poor body condition) to positive (females in good body condition), arguing against a uniform relationship between boldness and sociability. The number of coalition partners decreased with female breeding experience. The time taken to form a coalition was shortest close to the hatching peak in the population. Shyness (long FID) delayed group formation. Despite a need for safety in numbers by shy females in poor body condition, their entry into groups may be constrained by their personality, suggesting a possible trade-off between predator and conspecific avoidance. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={This article is part of a Special Issue "Chemosignals and Reproduction".Many terrestrial mammals must be able to distinguish between the myriad of scent marks they encounter in order for them to facilitate or deter direct interactions with their scent donors. I review studies that examine how rodents, mainly meadow voles (. Microtus pennsylvanicus), respond when they encounter the scent marks of conspecifics and heterospecifics, and how context, as well as the age and condition of senders and receivers, affect their responses. The review uses four broad hypotheses to discuss the response of rodents to scent marks. The four hypotheses are as follows: 1) Scent marks convey accurate information to the receiver about the sender's state and phenotype and genotype. 2) Scent marks are individually distinct. 3) The response of receivers to scent marks is flexible and would be modulated by the cognitive abilities of receivers. 4) Receivers respond to the information contained or conveyed by the scent mark in a manner that will increase their survival and fitness. The studies cited in this review show that scent marks signal accurate information about the sender's phenotype, genotype, and condition, which receivers use to distinguish among the scent marks of different conspecifics and heterospecifics, and by doing so, receivers tailor their response accordingly to increase their survival and fitness. Thus, the four broad hypotheses may serve as guide to increase our understanding of the response of receivers to scent marks and provide a conceptual framework for future research and the development of additional hypotheses. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Six factors were associated with a greater area of hair loss, including cows with locomotion score 3, a cleanliness score (10/28 to 18/28), high daily milk yield (25.1-58.1 kg), poor body condition score (1-1.5), duration of winter housing (≥41 days) and some combinations of cubicle base and bedding materials. Compared with cows housed in cubicles with a concrete base and whole straw or rape straw bedding, cows housed in cubicles with concrete bases with sand or chopped straw bedding had smaller areas of hair loss and cows housed on a mattress base with whole straw or rape straw bedding had larger areas of hair loss. Area of hair loss, as measured on hock maps, was not significantly different between cows with score 1 (median 23.6 cm2) and score 2 (median 20.3 cm2) on the categorical scale for hock lesions. This suggests that the categorical scale was not reflecting the extent of hair loss and that hock maps are a good alternative for studying the dynamics of hock lesions over time. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This article is part of a Special Issue "Chemosignals and Reproduction".Many lizards have diverse glands that produce chemosignals used in intraspecific communication and that can have reproductive consequences. For example, information in chemosignals of male lizards can be used in intrasexual competition to identify and assess the fighting potential or dominance status of rival males either indirectly through territorial scent-marks or during agonistic encounters. Moreover, females of several lizard species "prefer" to establish or spend more time on areas scent-marked by males with compounds signaling a better health or body condition or a higher genetic compatibility, which can have consequences for their mating success and inter-sexual selection processes. We review here recent studies that suggest that the information content of chemosignals of lizards may be reliable because several physiological and endocrine processes would regulate the proportions of chemical compounds available for gland secretions. Because chemosignals are produced by the organism or come from the diet, they should reflect physiological changes, such as different hormonal levels (e.g. testosterone or corticosterone) or different health states (e.g. parasitic infections, immune response), and reflect the quality of the diet of an individual. More importantly, some compounds that may function as chemosignals also have other important functions in the organism (e.g. as antioxidants or regulating the immune system), so there could be trade-offs between allocating these compounds to attending physiological needs or to produce costly sexual "chemical ornaments". All these factors may contribute to maintain chemosignals as condition-dependent sexual signals, which can inform conspecifics on the characteristics and state of the sender and allow making behavioral decisions with reproductive consequences. To understand the evolution of chemical secretions of lizards as sexual signals and their relevance in reproduction, future studies should examine what information the signals are carrying, the physiological processes that can maintain the reliability of the message and how diverse behavioral responses to chemosignals may influence reproductive success. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Experimentally naïve rats acquired lever pressing with delayed reinforcement when the immediate programmed consequence for lever pressing was the simultaneous retraction of two identical levers. Presses on one lever also produced access to sweetened condensed milk after a delay of 10. s following retraction. Presses on the second lever resulted in retraction only. Lever retraction prevented the possibility of adventitious reinforcement of contacting the operanda during the reinforcement delays. Several measures indicated that the delayed reinforcers strengthened behavior. The majority of responses for all rats were on the lever that initiated reinforcer delivery. Responding for seven out of eight rats decreased during a subsequent extinction phase in which retraction was the only consequence arranged for lever pressing. Responding recovered rapidly when food reinforcement was available again. Furthermore, when contingencies on the two levers were switched, rats allocated their behavior accordingly, showing control by the delayed reinforcers. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with multiple genetic and environmental risk factors. Choline is a fundamental nutrient for brain development and high choline intake during prenatal and/or early postnatal periods is neuroprotective. We examined the effects of perinatal choline supplementation on social behavior, anxiety, and repetitive behaviors in the BTBR T. +. Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) mouse model of autism. The BTBR or the more "sociable" C57BL/6J (B6) strain females were fed a control or choline-supplemented diet from mating, throughout pregnancy and lactation. After weaning to a control diet, all offspring were evaluated at one or two ages [postnatal days 33-36 and 89-91] using open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM), marble burying (MB), and three-chamber social interaction tests. As expected, control-diet BTBR mice displayed higher OF locomotor activity, impaired social preference, and increased digging behavior during the MB test compared to control-diet B6 mice. Choline supplementation significantly decreased digging behavior, elevated the percentage of open arm entries and time spent in open arms in the EPM by BTBR mice, but had no effect on locomotion. Choline supplementation did not alter social interaction in B6 mice but remarkably improved impairments in social interaction in BTBR mice at both ages, indicating that the benefits of supplementation persist long after dietary choline returns to control levels. In conclusion, our results suggest that high choline intake during early development can prevent or dramatically reduce deficits in social behavior and anxiety in an autistic mouse model, revealing a novel strategy for the treatment/prevention of autism spectrum disorders. © 2014 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={The effect of a high (chocolate) versus low fat/sugar (chow) food on a conditioned-place-preference (CPP) task was evaluated in marmoset monkeys. Anxiety-related behaviors and cortisol levels before and after the CPP task were also measured. Subjects were habituated to a two-compartment CPP box and then, on alternate days, had access to only one compartment during daily 15-min conditionings, for a total of 14 trials. Marmosets were provisioned with chocolate chips in the CC-paired compartment on odd-numbered trials and standard chow in the CW-paired compartment on even-numbered trials. They were then tested for preferring the CC-paired context after a 24-h interval. During the conditioning, a significantly greater amount (in kcal/trial) of chocolate was consumed than chow, yet the foraging pattern of both food types was similar. On the test trial, the time spent in the CC-paired context increased significantly compared to pre-CPP levels, yet this response was not readily predicted by baseline behavioral or cortisol levels. Also, the chocolate CPP response was positively correlated with foraging time, rather than the amount of calories consumed. The sudden absence of the food increased exploration, while the chocolate CPP effect was associated with vigilance - both anxiety-related behaviors in marmosets. This behavioral profile occurred regardless of any concomitant change or correlation with cortisol. Therefore, the high fat/sugar food was more prone to be overly consumed by the marmosets, to induce a CPP response and to lead to anxiety-related behavior in its absence. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Sulfur is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and development. Reaching a thorough understanding of the molecular basis for changes in plant metabolism depending on the sulfur-nutritional status at the systems level will advance our basic knowledge and help target future crop improvement. Although the transcriptional responses induced by sulfate starvation have been studied in the past, knowledge of the regulation of sulfur metabolism is still fragmentary. This work focuses on the discovery of candidates for regulatory genes such as transcription factors (TFs) using 'omics technologies. For this purpose a short term sulfate-starvation/re-supply approach was used. ATH1 microarray studies and metabolite determinations yielded 21 TFs which responded more than 2-fold at the transcriptional level to sulfate starvation. Categorization by response behaviors under sulfate-starvation/re-supply and other nutrient starvations such as nitrate and phosphate allowed determination of whether the TF genes are specific for or common between distinct mineral nutrient depletions. Extending this co-behavior analysis to the whole transcriptome data set enabled prediction of putative downstream genes. Additionally, combinations of transcriptome and metabolome data allowed identification of relationships between TFs and downstream responses, namely, expression changes in biosynthetic genes and subsequent metabolic responses. Effect chains on glucosinolate and polyamine biosynthesis are discussed in detail. The knowledge gained from this study provides a blueprint for an integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics and application for the identification of uncharacterized genes. © 2015 Bielecka, Watanabe, Morcuende, Scheible, Hawkesford, Hesse and Hoefgen.

abstract={The fear induced by predators on their prey iswell known to cause behavioural adjustments by prey that can ripple through food webs. Little is known, however, about the analogous impacts of humans as perceived top predators on the foraging behaviour of carnivores. Here, we investigate the influence of human-induced fear on puma foraging behaviour using location and prey consumption data from 30 tagged individuals living along a gradient of human development. We observed strong behavioural responses by female pumas to human development, whereby their fidelity to kill sites and overall consumption time of prey declined with increasing housing density by 36 and 42%, respectively. Females responded to this decline in prey consumption time by increasing the number of deer they killed in high housing density areas by 36% over what they killed in areas with little residential development. The loss of food from declines in prey consumption time paired with increases in energetic costs associated with killing more prey may have consequences for puma populations, particularly with regard to reproductive success. In addition, greater carcass availability is likely to alter community dynamics by augmenting food resources for scavengers. In light of the extensive and growing impact of habitat modification, our study emphasizes that knowledge of the indirect effects of human activity on animal behaviour is a necessary component in understanding anthropogenic impacts on community dynamics and food web function. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Evidence indicates that for most human cancers the problem is not that gene mutations occur but is more dependent upon how the body deals with damaged cells. It has been estimated that only about 1% of human cancers can be accounted for by unmistakable hereditary cancer syndromes, only up to 5% can be accounted for due to high-penetrance, single-gene mutations, and in total only 5%–15% of all cancers may have a major genetic component. The predominant contribution to the causation of most sporadic cancers is considered to be environmental factors contributing between 58% and 82% toward different cancers. A nutritionally poor lifestyle is associated with increased risk of many cancers, including those of the breast. As nutrition, energy balance, macronutrient composition of the diet, and physical activity levels are major determinants of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) bioactivity, it has been proposed that, at least in part, these increases in cancer risk and progression may be mediated by alterations in the IGF axis, related to nutritional lifestyle. Localized breast cancer is a manageable disease, and death from breast cancer predominantly occurs due to the development of metastatic disease as treatment becomes more complicated with poorer outcomes. In recent years, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition has emerged as an important contributor to breast cancer progression and malignant transformation resulting in tumor cells with increased potential for migration and invasion. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests a strong link between components of the IGF pathway, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and breast cancer mortality. Here, we highlight some recent studies highlighting the relationship between IGFs, IGF-binding protein 3, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. © 2015 Zielinska et al.},

abstract={Sensorimotor control in vertebrates relies on internal models. When extending an arm to reach for an object, the brain uses predictive models of both limb dynamics and target properties. Whether invertebrates use such models remains unclear. Here we examine to what extent prey interception by dragonflies (Plathemis lydia), a behaviour analogous to targeted reaching, requires internal models. By simultaneously tracking the position and orientation of a dragonfly's head and body during flight, we provide evidence that interception steering is driven by forward and inverse models of dragonfly body dynamics and by models of prey motion. Predictive rotations of the dragonfly's head continuously track the prey's angular position. The head-body angles established by prey tracking appear to guide systematic rotations of the dragonfly's body to align it with the prey's flight path. Model-driven control thus underlies the bulk of interception steering manoeuvres, while vision is used for reactions to unexpected prey movements. These findings illuminate the computational sophistication with which insects construct behaviour. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Animals respond to approaching predators by taking flight at a distance that optimizes the costs and benefits of such flight. Previous studies have shown that urban populations of birds have shorter flight initiation distances than rural populations of the same species, that this difference is partly explained by differences in the community of predators, and that a longer history of urbanization implies a greater reduction in flight initiation distance in urban populations. The use of birdfeeders may be an additional factor reducing flight initiation distance not only in cities but also elsewhere by among other effects increasing body condition, increasing availability and reliability of food, and hence reducing the relative cost of flight. Here, we tested the prediction that urban habitats and presence of feeders independently accounted for reductions in flight initiation distance using extensive samples from different cities in Poland. We found independent significant effects of urban habitat and presence of feeders on flight initiation distance. These findings suggest that different factors have contributed to the "tameness" of urban birds. © The Author 2014.

abstract={Trait compensation denotes the situation in which individuals offset the costs of one trait with the benefits of another trait. The phenomenon of trait compensation is best exemplified by a negative correlation between the degree of predator avoidance and the strength of morphological defence. In this study, we used the relationship between risk-taking tendency (boldness) and the propensity for tail autotomy in the brown anole lizards Anolis sagrei to address two important questions regarding trait compensation. First, we investigated whether trait compensation existed among individuals of similar age. Second, we examined how the relationship between boldness and the propensity for tail autotomy responded to changes in food availability. Overall, bolder individuals autotomized their tails more readily. Although mean values of boldness and the propensity for tail autotomy did not differ under high and low food availability, the compensatory effect between the two traits was only obvious when food was abundant. The existence of trait compensation among similarly aged individuals will serve as the first step to understanding the evolution of compensatory effects among traits observed at higher level. In addition, food availability affected the dynamics of trait compensation by influencing the amount of variation of traits involved, rather than altering the mean values of traits per se. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={Eating is a risky affair. All animals have to offset risks of feeding such as exposure to plant toxins, increased vulnerability to predation, or conspecific aggression with a food's energetic and nutritional return. What, when, and where an individual eats can impact fitness and, ultimately, species-level adaptations. Here, we explore the variables that influence primate feeding preference: food availability, chemical defense, and nutrient content. We present information demonstrating that consumers manipulate nutrient and energy intake, indicating that what may be a less-than-optimal food for one state of an animal's phenotype may not be for another. This evidence suggests that factors previously assumed to be constraints in Optimal Foraging Theory, Functional Response, and-recently-Fallback Food feeding models would be better categorized as variables. We conclude that "fallback" is not an intrinsic state of the food or the consumer and that this conclusion complicates the application of this concept to morphological features in the fossil record. © Copyright ©2015 by Annual Reviews.

abstract={Although individual environmental factors influence behavioral plasticity, animals live in complex environments wherein multiple environmental factors vary simultaneously. Here, we investigated whether temperature and food intake independently or interactively affected the boldness and feeding behavior of juvenile corn snakes (Pantherophis guttatus, Linnaeus). Because thermal environments in which animals can behaviorally thermoregulate by moving among microclimates are likely more realistic and ecologically relevant than fluctuating or constant temperature regimes, we manipulated the availability of preferred thermal microclimates (control vs. warm regimes) for 8 weeks and allowed individuals to move among microclimates. By also manipulating food intake and controlling for phenotypic repeatability of behavior, we demonstrate context-specific effects of temperature and food intake on behavioral plasticity. Temperature and food intake independently affected feeding behavior (i.e., unidimensional plasticity), but these factors interactively affected boldness in an open arena (i.e., multidimensional plasticity). Clearly, complex environments can exert multifaceted effects on behavior. Therefore, examining the effects of individual environmental factors (e.g., temperature or food availability) may be an overly simplistic approach to understanding how animals respond to rapidly changing environments. © The Author 2015.

abstract={Objective: The purpose of the present study was to examine the association between parental eating behaviours and dietary patterns and feeding practices of infants and young children. Design: Data on infant-feeding practices were collected from each infant's birth via parentally self-administered follow-up diaries. Three questionnaires, the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, the Food Neophobia Scale and the Index of Diet Quality, were administered when the children were aged 4 and 13 months. Setting: South-western Finland. Subjects: Families participating in the STEPS longitudinal cohort study (n 1797). Results: Mean duration of exclusive breast-feeding was 2·4 months and total duration of breast-feeding averaged 8·1 months. The first solid food was introduced into children's diets at the age of 3·9 months, on average. Mothers with highly restrictive eating were more likely to introduce solid foods sooner than mothers who ranked lower in these behaviours (3·8 months v. 4·0 months, P=0·012). Neophobic mothers breast-fed exclusively (2·0 v. 2·6 months, P=0·038) and in total (7·2 v. 8·5 months, P=0·039) for shorter times than average mothers, even after adjusting for various demographic characteristics. Fathers' diet quality was associated with total breast-feeding duration and with introduction of complementary foods in unadjusted analyses and with total breast-feeding duration also after adjusting for confounding factors. Conclusions: Mothers' and fathers' eating patterns and practices are associated with the feeding practices of infants and young children. Health promotion interventions seeking to improve parents' eating patterns might lead to more favourable feeding practices for infants and young children. Copyright © The Authors 2014.},

abstract={The aim of our study was to explore the association between dominance rank and body condition in outdoor group-living domestic horses, Equus caballus.Social interactions were recorded using a video camera during a feeding test, applied to 203 horses in 42 herds. Dominance rank was assigned to 194 individuals. The outcome variable body condition score (BCS) was recorded using a 9-point scale. The variables age and height were recorded and considered as potential confounders or effect modifiers. Results were analysed using multivariable linear and logistic regression techniques, controlling for herd group as a random effect.More dominant (p= 0.001) individuals generally had a higher body condition score ( p= 0.001) and this association was entirely independent of age and height. In addition, a greater proportion of dominant individuals fell into the obese category (BCS. ≥.7/9, p=0.005).There were more displacement encounters and a greater level of interactivity in herds that had less variation in age and height, lending strength to the hypothesis that phenotypic variation may aid cohesion in group-living species. In addition there was a strong quadratic relationship between age and dominance rank ( p<. 0.001), where middle-aged individuals were most likely to be dominant. These results are the first to link behavioural predictors to body condition and obesity status in horses and should prompt the future consideration of behavioural and social factors when evaluating clinical disease risk in group-living animals. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Intraspecific aggression is an important aspect of social behaviour that can significantly affect individual survivorship and population dynamics. Aggressiveness may be particularly important in food-deprived habitats, like caves, but few studies have investigated behavioural and ecological determinants of aggressiveness and cannibalism in cave vertebrates. In this study, we evaluated the role of density, competition for food, starvation and rearing history under cave-like conditions in promoting aggression. We performed a behavioural experiment on larvae collected from multiple underground springs and neighbouring streams, and we reared them under two different settings: total darkness and outdoor conditions. Intraspecific attacks were very scarce in hatchlings, and increased after 1 month. Starvation periods and high density clearly increased aggressiveness. Furthermore, aggressiveness strongly increased under competition conditions (presence of other larvae feeding). Aggressiveness increased with age more quickly in larvae from caves than in those from streams. Environmental features typically experienced by cave populations, such as starvation and high density, increase intraspecific attacks and might promote cannibalism. Strong plasticity for aggression may enhance the possibility to successfully colonize and exploit food-deprived environments where no other predators can survive, such as underground environments. © 2015 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract={Vigilance in prey species can serve many purposes, including predator detection and monitoring other group members, and is generally thought to impose a cost due to reduced food intake. However, previous studies have shown that herbivores are able to reduce the foraging cost of vigilance by chewing their food during vigilance bouts ('vigilance with chewing', as compared to 'vigilance without chewing'). How predation risk, food availability and competition affect both the functions and the foraging costs of vigilance remains an open question. We studied female eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, during winter and summer, when available food supplies were poor and rich, respectively, to investigate how group size, distance to cover, proximity between foragers and food patch quality affected decisions of foraging female kangaroos to exhibit antipredator or social vigilance, distinguishing vigilance with and without chewing. The use of antipredator vigilance was mainly driven by the perception of predation risk, and antipredator vigilance without chewing decreased with increased group size whereas antipredator vigilance with chewing increased nonlinearly with group size in winter. Distance to cover affected both forms of antipredator vigilance in summer only but there was no effect of nearest-neighbour distance. Social vigilance was affected positively by group size, and distance between foragers affected social vigilance without chewing positively, particularly in winter, and social vigilance with chewing negatively. Finally, patch quality increased the use of social vigilance with chewing in both seasons and decreased the use of antipredator vigilance with chewing in winter. This study provides new information on how animals make decisions about the functions and foraging costs of vigilance and allows a better understanding of how social foragers respond to an ever-changing environment. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Understanding how animals select for habitat and foraging resources therein is a crucial component of basic and applied ecology. The selection process is typically influenced by a variety of environmental conditions including the spatial and temporal variation in the quantity and quality of food resources, predation or disturbance risks, and inter- and intraspecific competition. Indeed, some of the most commonly employed ecological theories used to describe how animals choose foraging sites are: nutrient intake maximisation, density-dependent habitat selection, central-place foraging, and predation risk effects. Even though these theories are not mutually exclusive, rarely are multiple theoretical models considered concomitantly to assess which theory, or combination thereof, best predicts observed changes in habitat selection over space and time. Here, we tested which of the above theories best-predicted habitat selection of Svalbard-breeding pink-footed geese at their main spring migration stopover site in mid-Norway by computing a series of resource selection functions (RSFs) and their predictive ability (k-fold cross validation scores). At this stopover site geese fuel intensively as a preparation for breeding and further migration. We found that the predation risk model and a combination of the density-dependent and central-place foraging models best-predicted habitat selection during stopover as geese selected for larger fields where predation risk is typically lower and selection for foraging sites changed as a function of both distance to the roost site (i.e. central-place) and changes in local density. In contrast to many other studies, the nutritional value of the available food resources did not appear to be a major limiting factor as geese used different food resources proportional to their availability. Our study shows that in an agricultural landscape where nutritional value of food resources is homogeneously high and resource availability changes rapidly; foraging behaviour of geese is largely a tradeoff between fast refuelling and disturbance/predator avoidance. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract={Interactions with environmental parameters may alter the ecotoxicity of nanoparticles. The present study therefore assessed the (in)direct effects of nanoparticulate titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2) towards Gammarus fossarum, considering nano-TiO2's photocatalytic properties at ambient UV-intensities. Gammarids’ habitat selection was investigated using its feeding preference on leaf discs either exposed to or protected from UV-irradiation in presence of nano-TiO2 as proxy (n = 49). UV-irradiation alone induced a significant preference for UV-protected habitats, which was more pronounced in simultaneous presence of nano-TiO2. This behaviour may be mainly explained by the UV-induced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by nano-TiO2. Besides their direct toxicity, ROS may have lowered the leaf-quality in UV-exposed areas contributing (approximately 30%) to the observed behavioural pattern. Since the predicted no effect concentration of nano-TiO2 in combination with UV-irradiation falls below the predicted environmental concentration this study underpins the importance of considering environmental parameters during the risk assessment of nanoparticles. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Animals must balance the conflicting needs to forage and avoid predation. The optimal balance of risk and reward should depend on the individual’s state, particularly hunger status. Satiated individuals are hypothesized to react more strongly to risk than hungry individuals, for which the necessity for food overrides perceived danger. We tested this in wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) tadpoles by comparing the response of fasted and fed tadpoles to injured conspecifics (alarm cue) and uninjured conspecifics (control). Food restriction significantly affected the activity levels of tadpoles and the impact of injured conspecific cues on activity. Fed tadpoles responded little to these cues, tending to decrease activity. Hungry tadpoles were more active overall and responded to injured conspecific cues by increasing activity. We propose that hungry tadpoles increase their activity in response to an injured conspecific because, in addition to indicating danger, this cue represents a nutrient source for this opportunistically cannibalistic species, and hungry tadpoles should thus adopt risky behavior to acquire this valuable resource. Differences in hunger may therefore explain variation among studies of tadpole responses to injured conspecifics. Future studies in aquatic organisms should consider the role of hunger status when assessing antipredator behavior. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={'Personality traits' are behavioural differences between individuals that are stable within individuals. Different combinations of personality traits can correlate with fitness variation but the mechanisms remain unclear. There is the suggestion that personality reflects variation in physiology. For example, 'fast' (bold, active, fast exploring) individuals are predicted to maintain a higher metabolic rate than 'slow' animals. A raised metabolic rate can result in a proliferation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which, if unchecked, cause oxidative stress. Thus, the 'extended pace of life theory' predicts that 'fast' individuals will pay higher oxidative costs than 'slow' ones. Alternatively, stress hormones, which are often relatively high in 'slow' individuals, can also cause proliferation of ROS and subsequent oxidative damage. Here, we assessed co-variation between personality and oxidative profile in wild blue tits. The personality traits neophobia (latency to approach food near novel objects), activity level in a novel environment and exploratory tendency (controlling for differences in activity) assayed in captivity were repeatable within individuals but were uncorrelated with each other. Reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs an index of pro-oxidant status) and OXY (antioxidant capacity) were also uncorrelated with each other and did not vary with age or sex. Blood sampling birds within three minutes of capture from their familiar cage vs. after 15 min of exposure to a standardized stressor did not affect ROMs or OXY. Wintering blue tits that were both highly neophobic and exploratory had low OXY defences and individuals that showed low neophobia and low exploration had high OXY defences. Variation in ROMs was not explained by any personality trait. High exploratory tendency also correlated with a reduction in body condition in captivity, but body condition did not predict ROMs or OXY. Activity level in the exploration trial did not vary with oxidative profile or change in body condition. Personality types differed in antioxidant defences, and it was the combination of an individual's personality traits that proved important. ROS production and antioxidant defences will vary due to many processes for example resource allocation, not just metabolic rate and stress responsiveness. Consequently, the costs of personality traits and thus the predictions regarding fitness are complex. © 2014 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Periconceptional environment may influence embryo development, ultimately affecting adult health. Here, we review the rodent model of maternal low-protein diet specifically during the preimplantation period (Emb-LPD) with normal nutrition during subsequent gestation and postnatally. This model, studied mainly in the mouse, leads to cardiovascular, metabolic and behavioural disease in adult offspring, with females more susceptible. We evaluate the sequence of events from diet administration that may lead to adult disease. Emb-LPD changes maternal serum and/or uterine fluid metabolite composition, notably with reduced insulin and branched-chain amino acids. This is sensed by blastocysts through reduced mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 signalling. Embryos respond by permanently changing the pattern of development of their extra-embryonic lineages, trophectoderm and primitive endoderm, to enhance maternal nutrient retrieval during subsequent gestation. These compensatory changes include stimulation in proliferation, endocytosis and cellular motility, and epigenetic mechanisms underlying them are being identified. Collectively, these responses act to protect fetal growth and likely contribute to offspring competitive fitness. However, the resulting growth adversely affects long-term health because perinatal weight positively correlates with adult disease risk. We argue that periconception environmental responses reflect developmental plasticity and 'decisions' made by embryos to optimise their own development, but with lasting consequences. © CSIRO 2015.},

abstract={Bariatric surgery rapidly improves Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Our objective was to profile and compare the extent and duration of improved glycemic control following Roux-en-Y gastric (RYGB) bypass surgery and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and compare against calorie restriction/weight loss and medical combination therapy- based approaches using the Zucker diabetic fatty rat (ZDF) rodent model of advanced T2DM. Male ZDF rats underwent RYGB (n =15) or SG surgery (n = 10) at 18 wk of age and received postsurgical insulin treatment, as required to maintain mid-light-phase glycemia within a predefined range (10–15 mmol/l). In parallel, other groups of animals underwent sham surgery with ad libitum feeding (n = 6), with body weight (n = 8), or glycemic matching (n = 8) to the RYGB group, using food restriction or a combination of insulin, metformin, and liraglutide, respectively. Both bariatric procedures decreased the daily insulin dose required to maintain mid-light-phase blood glucose levels below 15 mmol/l, compared with those required by body weight or glycemia-matched rats (P < 0.001). No difference was noted between RYGB and SG with regard to initial efficacy. SG was, however, associated with higher food intake, weight regain, and higher insulin requirements vs. RYGB at study end (P < 0.05). Severe hypoglycemia occurred in several rats after RYGB. RYGB and SG significantly improved glycemic control in a rodent model of advanced T2DM. While short-term outcomes are similar, long-term efficacy appears marginally better after RYGB, although this is tempered by the increased risk of hypoglycemia. © 2015, American Physiological Society.

abstract={Top-down control by spider predators on grasshopper herbivores can produce trophic cascades, which may enhance plant biomass and alter plant community composition. These trophic level effects may be the result of either predator reduction in prey numbers (i.e., consumptive effects) or decreased prey foraging time in response to predator presence (i.e., non-consumptive effects). However, predator-prey interactions can be context dependent and do not always affect the plant trophic level. We conducted a field and laboratory experiment in a Northern Wisconsin (USA) old field ecosystem to uncover whether consumptive or non-consumptive effects of spider predation on grasshopper herbivores result in a trophic cascade, and if so to determine the underlying mechanisms that drive these trophic cascades. In a field experiment, four treatments examined the effects of multiple trophic-level interactions on plant biomass: 1) control treatment of vegetation only, 2) a two trophic-level interaction (grasshoppers and vegetation), and two different three trophic-level interactions: 3) the presence of "predator spiders" to examine consumptive effects, and 4) "risk spiders" with their chelicerae disarmed with beeswax to examine non-consumptive effects. In addition, a lab experiment was conducted to examine behavioral responses by grasshoppers in the presence of both an armed-spider predator and a risk spider to assess whether food quality (high vs low C:N ratios) had an effect on this interaction. Both risk and predator spiders decreased the impact of grasshoppers on plant biomass in the field experiment, and equally reduced overall grasshopper survival, indicating a non-consumptive effect. At the behavioral level, grasshoppers exhibited anti-predator behavior at the expense of reduced food intake. Food quality had no effect on the survival of grasshoppers as foraging was sacrificed for predator avoidance. Taken together, our results indicate that the resulting trophic cascade was the result of non-consumptive effects and that spider presence alone may reduce grasshopper herbivory rates. © 2015, Bio-One.

abstract={In comparison to core populations, peripheral populations have low density and recruitment, and are subject to different selective pressures, such as environmental conditions, food type and availability, predation, disease, etc., which may result in behavioural modifications to mating. We test the roam-to-mate hypothesis for a peripheral population of grizzly bears (. Ursus arctos) at the northern extent of their North American range, in Canada's Arctic. If bears are roaming-to-mate, we predicted greater range size and daily displacement, and more linear movements for receptive animals during the mating period compared to post-mating. In contrast to our predictions, we found that in general range size and displacement increased from mating to post-mating regardless of reproductive status. When considered across both periods, females with cubs-of-the-year had smaller range use metrics than other reproductive groups, which we attribute to a counter-strategy against sexually selected infanticide and the reduced mobility of cubs. Linearity of movements remained near zero during both periods across all groups, suggesting tortuous movements more characteristic of foraging than of mate-searching. We suggest that for this population, finding quality habitat takes precedence over mate-searching in this marginal Arctic landscape. Alternatively, a more monogamous mating system and sequestering behaviour may have obscured movement differences between the two periods. The behavioural differences in mating that we observed from what is typical of core populations may reflect local adaptation to marginal conditions and could benefit the species in the face of ongoing environmental change. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The foraging and anti-predator behaviour of captive-reared rainbow darters (Etheostoma caeruleum) was compared to their wild-caught counterparts. Wild-caught darters responded with appropriate anti-predator behaviour (reduced foraging activity) when exposed to alarm cues (e.g. stimuli from damaged skin) from both wild-caught and captive-reared darters, indicating that the diet in captivity did not inhibit the production of alarm cues. Captive-reared individuals did not change their level of activity when exposed to alarm cues; however, their significantly lower baseline activity (movement and prey consumption) makes it unclear as to whether they actually failed to recognize risk. Regardless, captive-reared darters showed little motivation to feed when food became available (i.e. they made few movements to obtain food) and appeared impervious to chemical cues indicating risk. Exposing captive-reared individuals to both semi-natural foraging opportunities and predator-recognition training before their release is recommended. © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Zooplankton inhabiting deep, oligotrophic, tropical lakes must cope with scenarios where the combination of resource limitation, high visual-predation risk, UV-induced damage and seasonal development of anoxic waters, entail particular challenges for organisms, uncommon in temperate environments. We assessed the diel vertical migration—DVM—(UV/predation-avoidance strategy), numerical response, and starvation resistance (physiological strategies to cope with food scarcity) of the copepod Leptodiaptomus garciai and the rotifers Hexarthra jenkinae and Brachionus sp. “Mexico,” which constitute the zooplankton assemblage of Alchichica, a high-altitude, deep, oligotrophic, hyposaline, warm-monomictic lake located in Mexico. L. garciai followed the normal pattern of DVM in all seasons; with organisms concentrated ≈ 20 m deeper than the depth of 1% photosynthetically active radiation at mid-day, with evasion from the planktivore Poblana alchichica as the most probable driver. However, copepods could not evade the euphotic zone owing to the anoxic conditions of the hypolimnion during the well-established stratification period. Rotifers did not migrate vertically. The dominance of copepods throughout the year can be explained by their low food threshold, high proportion of usable reserves and the lowest rate of mass loss at food deprivation. Contrastingly, rotifers are scarce and intermittent due to frequent resource limitation and because they lose mass at higher rates. However, they are able to suddenly increase due to their high growth rates. We demonstrated that the interaction between environmental constraints and the specific combinations of traits can explain zooplankton structure in the lake. This study enlightens the necessity to improve current limnological models with data from tropical lakes. © 2015 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography.},

abstract={Establishing connectivity via fish movements among restored estuaries is important for maintaining community structure, but data on the degree to which animals efficiently move among estuaries are limited. To test estuarine connectivity potential, we translocated 5 species of juvenile predatory fishes between 2 discrete estuaries approximately 10 km apart, and using passive acoustic telemetry, measured their ability to home back to their estuary of capture. Individuals from all species except Paralabrax maculatofasciatus (spotted sand bass) moved between the sites after translocation. Feeding guild and associated foraging behavior were found to greatly influence a species' connectivity potential, with estuarine resident ambush predators moving between sites less frequently compared to roving forager marine migrant predators. Time spent moving between sites was not significantly different among species, and 67% of homing fish completed the transit in <3 d. Fish showed no preference for one site over the other and returned to each site equally. Stable isotope analysis revealed that the availability of food (as indicated by diets) in each restored estuary could have affected Mustelus californicus (gray smoothhound) habitat use. Roving forager juvenile predatory fishes displayed high connectivity over a large scale, which suggests that newly restored estuaries should attract these species quickly. However, long-term use may depend on environmental conditions and succession of the prey community. © Inter-Research 2015.},

abstract={Climatic events affect the behaviour and ecology of many mammal species (e.g. activity, body condition, home range sizes or predation risk). We investigated short-term changes in movements, activity and habitat use of brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) in response to two major snowfall events in a grassland ecosystem in the southern South Island of New Zealand during winter of 2011. Global positioning system collars were deployed on 21 possums. Generalised linear mixed models showed that, on average, possums reduced their movements and activity (measured by distances between consecutive fixes) during periods of snow cover. One hundred percent minimum convex polygon areas decreased by 37% on average, and 95% and 50% kernel density contour ranges decreased by 34% and 36%, respectively. Two to three possums (depending on the snowfall event) actually increased their movements during snow cover. No dramatic changes in habitat use were observed during the study but rock habitats were used slightly more often during snow periods, probably because rocks provide warmer and drier shelters during harsh weather conditions. Our study illustrates the behaviour of possums in seasonally harsh conditions outside their native range. © New Zealand Ecological Society.},

abstract={Seed dispersal constrains the environmental heterogeneity to which a plant species is exposed through its life. Behavior of seed dispersers and seed predators could be influenced by food availability and vegetation cover. Consequently, recruitment probabilities are heterogeneous in space and time, and “regeneration windows” may appear. Aristotelia chilensis is the most abundant fleshy-fruited shrub in the temperate forest of southern South America (TFSA). TFSA exhibits an environmental patchiness that could influence fruit abundance and animal behavior. Our objective was to determine the regeneration windows of A. chilensis, and to detect how forest structure and animal behavior could affect the spatial distribution of this species. We characterized forest structure in two plots that included mature forest, young forest, and open areas. We assessed the spatio-temporal distribution of A. chilensis fruits and studied fruit removal by animals. Also, we experimentally evaluated germination and post-dispersal seed predation. We developed a conceptual model to relate A. chilensis recruitment with forest successional stages. The fruiting individuals of this shrub were mostly located in fire-opened areas or forest gaps, and the seed rain generated by the migratory bird Elaenia albiceps was denser in these areas. In contrast, seed predation by rodents was higher in closed, young forest areas. A. chilensis recruitment follows a nucleation dynamic around fruiting females. Concerning forest succession, A. chilensis recruitment was higher near re-sprouting females in open areas, and lowest in young forests, where fruiting process was hindered by light constraints. When forests mature, new nucleation processes start around females surviving in gaps. We conclude that areas opened by disturbances provide a regeneration window for A. chilensis shrubs. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Predators attack and plants defend, so herbivores face the dilemma of how to eat enough without being eaten. But do differences in the personality of herbivores affect the foraging choices of individuals? We explored the ecological impact of personality in a generalist herbivore, the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). After quantifying personality traits in wild individuals brought temporarily into captivity, we tested how these traits altered foraging by individuals when free-ranging in their natural habitat. To measure their responses to the dual costs of predation risk and plant toxin, we varied the toxin concentration of food in safe foraging patches against paired, non-toxic risky patches, and used a novel synthesis of a manipulative Giving-Up-Density (GUD) experiment and video behavioural analysis. At the population level, the cost of safe patches pivoted around that of risky patches depending on food toxin concentration. At the individual level, boldness affected foraging at risky high-quality food patches (as behavioural differences between bold and shy), and at safe patches only when food toxin concentration was low (as differences in foraging outcome). Our results ecologically validate the personality trait of boldness, in brushtail possums. They also reveal, for the first time, a nuanced link between personality and the way in which individuals balance the costs of food and fear. Importantly, they suggest that high plant defence effectively attenuates differences in foraging behaviour arising from variation in personality, but poorly defended plants in safe areas should be differentially subject to herbivory depending on the personality of the herbivore. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Species’ thermal limits play a key role in determining spatial distributions and understanding their response to changing environments. Manipulation of thermal habitat is a potential avenue of exploration for management of invasive species such as the cold-water rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), which has adverse effects on native fish communities in central North American inland lakes. In an effort to test the thermal limits and selectively eradicate rainbow smelt, we experimentally mixed Crystal Lake, Wisconsin, USA, during summer of 2012 and 2013 to warm the hypolimnion and eliminate cold-water habitat. This whole-ecosystem manipulation allowed for field testing of published thermal thresholds reported for rainbow smelt. The rainbow smelt population responded to the thermal manipulation by exhibiting unexpected shifts in behavior, intrapopulation divergence in body condition, and significant population declines. Small individuals of each adult age-class tended to survive the manipulation, and the population persisted despite high mortality rates. Our results indicate a high degree of size-based intrapopulation variation in thermal sensitivity for this species. Our findings also raise questions regarding applicability of lab- and model-derived thermal limits to field scenarios, highlighting a need for further field evaluations of species’ thermal limits. © 2015, National Research Council of Canada.

abstract={The mere presence of predators (i.e., predation risk) can alter consumer physiology by restricting food intake and inducing stress, which can ultimately affect prey-mediated ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling. However, many environmental factors, including conspecific density, can mediate the perception of risk by prey. Prey conspecific density has been defined as a fundamental feature that modulates perceived risk. In this study, we tested the effects of predation risk on prey nutrient stoichiometry (body and excretion). Using a constant predation risk, we also tested the effects of varying conspecific densities on prey responses to predation risk. To answer these questions, we conducted a mesocosm experiment using caged predators (Belostoma sp.), and small bullfrog tadpoles (Lithobates catesbeianus) as prey. We found that L. catesbeianus tadpoles adjust their body nutrient stoichiometry in response to predation risk, which is affected by conspecific density. We also found that the prey exhibited strong morphological responses to predation risk (i.e., an increase in tail muscle mass), which were positively correlated to body nitrogen content. Thus, we pose the notion that in risky situations, adaptive phenotypic responses rather than behavioral ones might partially explain why prey might have a higher nitrogen content under predation risk. In addition, the interactive roles of conspecific density and predation risk, which might result in reduced perceived risk and physiological restrictions in prey, also affected how prey stoichiometry responded to the fear of predation. © 2015 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

After this supplementation period, all rats went through a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) procedure, half of them being pre-exposed to the conditioned stimulus before the conditioning. Results: The results indicated that choline deficiency prevents LI of conditioned flavor aversion to cider vinegar (3%) induced by a LiCl (0.15 M; 2% body weight) intraperitoneal injection, while choline supplementation enhances CTA leading to slower extinction.

abstract={Baum and Davison (2014b) showed that Baum's (2012) recasting of reinforcement as induction may be quantified by assuming that induction follows a power function of reinforcer rate. This power-function induction is readily integrated with theory based on the matching law. Herrnstein (1970) originally assumed background activities (BO) and their associated reinforcers ro to be constant, but ro should vary with BO. Further, power-function induction implies that BO should vary with reinforcer rate. Baum (1993) reported performance on a wide range of variable-ratio (VR) and variable-interval (VI) schedules. Pigeons' VR peck rate followed an inverted U-shaped relation, but VI peck rate separated into three ranges of food rate: low-to-moderate, moderate-to-high, and extremely high. As food rate increases, the concave downward relation in the low range reaches an inflection point and gives way to a concave upward relation in the higher range. At the extremes of food rate, VI peck rate decreases. A model based on competition between induced pecking and BO accounted for VI peck rate in the moderate to extreme range of food rates. Further research will account for all three ranges, either by integrating power-function induction with matching theory or with a model based on competition between induced activities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Fibrous diets and the provision of straw have been suggested to reduce feeding motivation in pregnant sows. The present experiment investigated the separate and interactive effects of a fibrous diet and ad libitum access to straw on feeding motivation, oral behaviour and plasma levels of metabolites and hormones in pregnant sows. Ten groups of three pregnant sows were housed in pens with concrete floor where a limited amount of chopped straw (approx. 330. g/sow) was provided daily. In 5 of the 10 groups sows had free access to uncut straw in racks in addition to the chopped straw (Ad libitum straw), while the remaining 5 groups did not (Limited straw). The experimental period (week 2-9 of pregnancy) was divided into two 4-week periods and in a cross-over design sows within groups were fed a standard control diet (18% dietary fibre) during one period and a fibrous diet containing sugar beet pulp (35% dietary fibre) during the other period. Both diets were offered restrictively at 22. MJ net energy per day and throughout the experimental period sows were fed twice daily at 0800 and 1500. h. At the end of each 4-week period the undisturbed behaviour of the sows was recorded during two 24. h periods. Furthermore, the sows' feeding motivation was assessed during behavioural tests, and blood samples were draw via a jugular vein catheter, at 0700, 0900, 1200 and 1900. h in a balanced design. Feeding motivation was not affected by diet or straw. However, feeding motivation was highest 1. h before morning feeding indicated by a higher number of rewards earned during the entire test (P<0.01) and during the first 5. min of the test (P<0.001). In the period where sows were fed the fibrous diet they manipulated the floor less frequently (P<0.02) and drank water less frequently (P<0.02) than in the period they were fed the control diet. Sows with limited access to straw manipulated equipment less frequently during the period they were fed the fibre diet, while no effect of diet was seen among sows with ad libitum straw (diet. ×. straw interaction P<. 0.001). In conclusion, feeding motivation was not reduced by a fibrous diet or by ad libitum provision of straw. However, a fibrous diet did reduce frequency of drinking and floor directed explorative behaviour suggesting some alleviation of the adverse effects of hunger as supported by higher plasma levels of short-chain fatty acids and lower levels of the hunger hormone Ghrelin. Ad libitum straw did not reduce feeding motivation, but more lateral lying in sows with ad libitum straw suggests that the straw provided increased lying comfort. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Chicken products are suspected as a source of extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC), which causes diseases in humans. The zoonotic risk to humans from chicken-source E. coli is not fully elucidated. To clarify the zoonotic risk posed by Ex-PEC in chicken products and to fill existing knowledge gaps regarding ExPEC zoonosis, we evaluated the prevalence of ExPEC on shell eggs and compared virulence-associated phenotypes between ExPEC and non-ExPEC isolates from both chicken meat and eggs. The prevalence of ExPEC among egg-source isolates was low, i.e., 5/108 (4.7%). Based on combined genotypic and phenotypic screening results, multiple human and avian pathotypes were represented among the chicken-source ExPEC isolates, including avian-pathogenic E. coli (APEC), uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), neonatal meningitis E. coli (NMEC), and sepsis-associated E. coli (SEPEC), as well as an undefined ExPEC group, which included isolates with fewer virulence factors than the APEC, UPEC, and NMEC isolates. These findings document a substantial prevalence of human-pathogenic ExPEC-associated genes and phenotypes among E. coli isolates from retail chicken products and identify key virulence traits that could be used for screening. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.},

Likewise, the most found ants by Eurasian wryneck between January 2010 and February 2011 were Pheidole pallidula (Ii = 0.95) and T. nigerrimum (Ii = 0.92). The Eurasian wryneck well deserves its name because its menu is composed of 90% of ants; it is a myrmecophagy and possesses a large ability of adaptation on trophic plan.},

abstract={The response of aquatic organisms to flow regulation at hydro facilities has become a key issue for the development of sustainable management practices intending to reduce the impact in regulated rivers. In previous studies, unrestricted ramping rates have been found to have a negative effect on invertebrate communities and shortened the length of the food web. The decrease in the length of the food web was inferred from a significant decrease in the difference between macroinvertebrates and fish δ13N signatures, equivalent to the loss of the one trophic level. A before-after-control-impact (BACI) design was applied to determine the possible effects of ramping rate restrictions on the diet of small-bodied fishes in a boreal river in northern Ontario. Stomach contents were identified to the taxonomic level of order. Using these data, abundance, diversity and taxa composition were calculated to yield an understanding of the alterations that occurred in the food web, and how fish species diets may have changed to compensate for the shift in the invertebrate trophic level. It was found that unrestricted ramping rates were associated with an increase in invertebrate abundance within the stomach contents. There was no effect from the change to unlimited ramping for both stomach content EPT abundance and species diversity, as both rivers followed a similar trend over time. After unrestricted ramping rates, a greater frequency of baseline taxa and a lower frequency of predatory macroinvertebrates were found within the altered river stomach contents compared to what was expected. This demonstrates that the diets of small-bodied fishes have changed to compensate for the alterations to the food web due to unrestricted ramping rates, and implies that ramping rates should be taken into consideration in the regulation of operating regimes on altered rivers. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to apply a protocol to evaluate the welfare of horses used for reproduction purposes and to compare the welfare conditions of two management types. A protocol adapted to the equine species was carried out by direct observation of 45 indicators in two subpopulations (49 stabled stallions and 43 broodmares in semi-freedom). Welfare assessment included behaviour, health, and the way in which animals responded to two different managements. Results revealed significant differences (P≤0.05) of animal welfare under different management conditions.Regarding the individual area's safety and dimensions, the assessment showed that only in stallions the individual area was insufficient (85%) with a higher risk of injury (20.54%). In terms of feeding regime, a higher percentage of stallions left feed crumbs (26.19%) and presented increased scores of body condition (42.86%). In addition, abnormal behaviour was only observed on 8.16% of the housed animals. Health indicators showed higher incidence of lameness (41.68%), pain in the back (62.79%) and tail broken hairs (27.66%) in stallions; while the severity of injuries in the neck and back (55.81%) was higher in females as well as the rate of nasal discharge (11.63%). The methodology for evaluating welfare allowed to determine the incidence of health problems and behavioural responses, and the influence of the management system on animal welfare, which is of prime importance for future interventions for the improvement of the animal welfare status.},

abstract={Context The band-tailed pigeon (Patagioenas fasciata) is a migratory species occurring in western North America with low recruitment potential and populations that have declined an average of 2.4% per year since the 1960s. Investigations into band-tailed pigeon demographic rates date back to the early 1900s, and existing annual survival rate estimates were derived in the 1970s using band return data. Aims The primary purpose of the paper was to demonstrate that the apparent paradox between band-tailed pigeon population dynamics (long-term steady decline) and breeding season survival rates (very high) can be explained by changes in survival probability during the remainder of the year. Methods We trapped Pacific coast band-tailed pigeons during two separate periods: we equipped pigeons with very high frequency (VHF) radio-transmitters in 1999-2000 (1999=20; 2000=34); and outfitted pigeons with solar powered platform transmitting terminal (PTT) transmitters in 2006-08 (n=20). We used known fate models to estimate annual survival rates and seasonal survival variation among four periods based on an annual behavioural cycle based on phenological events (nesting, autumn migration, winter and spring migrations). We used model averaged parameter estimates to account for model selection uncertainty. Key results Neither body condition nor sex were associated with variation in band-tailed pigeon survival rates. Weekly survival during the nesting season did not differ significantly between VHF-marked (0.996; CI=0.984-0.999) and PTT-marked pigeons (0.998; CI=0.990-1.00). Model averaged annual survival of PTT-marked pigeons was 0.682 (95% CI=0.426-0.861) and was similar to annual survival estimated in previous studies using band return data. Survival probability was lowest during both migration periods and highest during the nesting period. Conclusions Our survival estimates are consistent with those of prior studies and suggest that mortality risk is greatest during migration. Weekly survival probability during winter was nearly the same as during the nesting season; however, winter was the longest period and survival throughout winter was lower than other seasons. Implications We present the first inter-seasonal analysis of survival probability of the Pacific coast race of band-tailed pigeons and illustrate important temporal patterns that may influence future species management including harvest strategies and disease monitoring. © 2015 CSIRO.},

abstract={Whereas pharmacological responses tend to be fairly rapid in onset and are therefore detectable after a single dose, some diminish on repeated dosing, and others increase in magnitude and therefore can be missed or underestimated in single-dose safety pharmacology studies. Safety pharmacology measurements can be incorporated into repeat-dose toxicity studies, either routinely or on an ad hoc basis. Drivers for this are both scientific (see above) and regulatory (e.g. ICH S6, S7, S9). There are inherent challenges in achieving this: the availability of suitable technical and scientific expertise in the test facility, unsuitable laboratory conditions, use of simultaneous (as opposed to staggered) dosing, requirement for toxicokinetic sampling, unsuitability of certain techniques (e.g. use of anaesthesia, surgical implantation, food restriction), equipment availability at close proximity and sensitivity of the methods to detect small, clinically relevant, changes. Nonetheless, ‘fit-for-purpose’ data can still be acquired without requiring additional animals. Examples include assessment of behaviour, sensorimotor, visual and autonomic functions, ambulatory ECG and blood pressure, echocardiography, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal and hepatic function. This is entirely achievable if the safety pharmacology measurements are relatively unobtrusive, both with respect to the animals and to the toxicology study itself. Careful pharmacological validation of any methods used, and establishing their detection sensitivity, is vital to ensure the credibility of generated data © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

abstract={Maternal periconceptional undernutrition is associated with altered development and increased risks of adverse outcomes in the offspring. The aim of this work was to determine the effect of periconceptional undernutrition on behavioural and reproductive aspects of the offspring. Fifty ewes were synchronized in oestrus (day 0) and allocated to two groups (n = 25) to be fed diets that provided 1.5 (C) or 0.5 (L) times the requirements for maintenance until day 15. Ewes were mated and fed the control diet from day 16 until lambing. Two months after lambing, 26 lambs were exposed to tests to determine their cognitive/emotional responses. Six ewe lambs were euthanized and in vitro oocyte maturation and fertilization procedures performed. The experimental diets produced no changes of mean live weight (LW) of C ewes, L ewes presenting a reduction in their initial LW with significant differences at day 15, in comparison with C ewes (p < 0.05). L ewes experienced a significant reduction in their body condition (BC) in comparison with C ewes (p < 0.05). Fourteen days after the onset of the experimental diets, mean LW and BC of L ewes was significantly lower than those of C ewes (p < 0.05). Undernourished ewes presented a trend to a reduction of prolificacy and fecundity (p < 0.10) in comparison with C ewes. Emotional and cognitive test revealed a similar response between groups. Ewe lambs from the undernourished ewes presented a population of oocytes 1.7 times higher than ovaries from control ewe lambs (66.0 ± 0.73 vs. 113.7 ± 15.6 oocytes; p < 0.05) and had more oocytes in the 'good' (p < 0.05) and 'healthy' (p < 0.05) categories. In conclusion, a low plane of nutrition around conception significantly increases quantity and quality of the oocyte population of 60-day-old female descendants. Modifications of the cognitive and emotional responses of the progeny have not been evidenced. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={A trophic niche shift can occur as an adaptive response to environmental change such as altered resource quality, abundance or composition. Alterations in digestive traits such as gut morphology and physiology may enable these niche shifts and affect the persistence of populations and species. Relatively few studies, however, have assessed how niche shifts influence suites of digestive traits through phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary mechanisms, and how these trait changes can subsequently alter the nutrition, fitness and life history of organisms. We investigated how population divergence and plasticity alter the gut physiology of wild Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), assessing whether variation in digestive traits correspond with enhanced nutrient assimilation under a pronounced dietary shift. We examined gut enzyme activity, and gut size and mass of wild guppies from both high-predation (HP) and low-predation (LP) habitats when reared in the laboratory and fed on high- or low-quality diets designed to reflect their dietary differences previously found in nature. After 10 weeks on the experimental diets, HP guppies maintained shorter and lighter guts than LP guppies on either diet. Guppies also differed in their digestive enzymatic profiles, more often reflecting nutrient balancing so that increased enzyme expression tended to correspond with more deficient nutrients in the diet. LP guppies had increased somatic phosphorus at the end of the experiment, possibly related to the higher alkaline phosphatase activity in their guts. Our results suggest that differences in gut physiology exist among populations of Trinidadian guppies that may reflect local adaptation to their disparate environments. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Environmental variation is a potent force affecting phenotypic expression. While freshwater fishes have provided a compelling example of the link between the environment and phenotypic diversity, few studies have been conducted with arid-zone fishes, particularly those that occur in geographically isolated regions where species typically inhabit intermittent and ephemeral creeks. We investigated morphological variation of a freshwater fish (the western rainbowfish, Melanotaenia australis) inhabiting creeks in the Pilbara region of northwest Australia to determine whether body shape variation correlated with local environmental characteristics, including water velocity, habitat complexity, predator presence, and food availability. We expected that the geographic isolation of creeks within this arid region would result in habitat-specific morphological specializations. We used landmark-based geometric morphometrics to quantify the level of morphological variability in fish captured from 14 locations within three distinct subcatchments of a major river system. Western rainbowfish exhibited a range of morphologies, with variation in body depth accounting for a significant proportion (>42%) of the total variance in shape. Sexual dimorphism was also apparent, with males displaying deeper bodies than females. While the measured local habitat characteristics explained little of the observed morphological variation, fish displayed significant morphological differentiation at the level of the subcatchment. Local adaptation may partly explain the geographic patterns of body shape variation, but fine-scale genetic studies are required to disentangle the effects of genetic differentiation from environmentally determined phenotypic plasticity in body shape. Developing a better understanding of environment-phenotype relationships in species from arid regions will provide important insights into ecological and evolutionary processes in these unique and understudied habitats. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract={Rapid changes to climate in the western Antarctic Peninsula region over the last 50 yr, which have led to decreases in the extent and duration of sea ice, are likely to have significant impacts upon the Antarctic ecosystem as a whole. Understanding the behaviour of higher trophic level animals occupying these regions is important, as they may be indicators of changes in prey availability and food-web structure. Leopard seals Hydrurga leptonyx are important components of the Antarctic ecosystem, because they are widespread and adapted to consuming prey at a range of trophic levels. They rely on sea ice for breeding, moulting and as a resting platform. Using tracks of 12 leopard seals, we calculated first-passage times (indicative of the intensity of area-restricted behaviour) and quantified relative habitat use, including both foraging and resting areas, using Cox proportional hazard models, in relation to coastline, bathymetry and sea ice. We also correlated monthly home range size with monthly sea-ice extent. We found that when sea-ice extent was low, leopard seals were restricted to coastal habitat, but that this effect was lost when sea-ice extent was greater. This was supported by the finding that leopard seal home range size decreased as the sea-ice extent decreased. Since leopard seals and other animals that consume krill are likely to be increasingly limited by sea-ice cover if the warming trend continues, we suggest that the krill fishery be restricted to offshore areas to avoid conflict with krill predators.},

abstract={Research has indicated that witnessing managemental procedures are stressful to laboratory rats. Yet there has been little investigation into whether the time of witnessing these procedures affects behaviour and welfare in these animals. Ninety-six rats, representing two batches, were used in this study. Forty-eight of them were housed, in groups of four, in either light phase witnessing group (LPWG) (n= 6) or dark phase witnessing group (DPWG) (n= 6) for five consecutive weeks. The remaining 48 rats were exposed to the managemental procedures (e.g. weighing, cage cleaning, restraint and vehicle injection) in either the light or the dark phase of the light/dark cycle, and were also housed in groups of four. At the beginning of the 5th week of the housing period, behaviour for all cages was sampled over the 1st 4. h of both the light and dark phases of the light/dark cycle. Physiological (e.g. body weight) and pathological (e.g. thymus and spleen weight) measures were collected at the end of the 5th week of the housing period. Principal component analyses yielded six factors, four of which revealed significant treatment differences. For the first, loaded positively on the body weight of animals, and negatively on relative weight of the adrenal gland, rats of the DPWG scored higher than those of the LPWG (P<. 0.01). Similarly, the second component loaded strongly positively on sleep and enrichment-directed behaviours and strongly negatively on awake non-active behaviour, and rats of the DPWG scored higher than those of the LPWG (P<. 0.01) on this factor. On the other hand, the third component loaded positively on agonism, feeding and bedding-directed behaviours and negatively on self-grooming, and for this factor rats of the LPWG scored higher than those of the DPWG (P<. 0.01). The fourth factor loaded positively on relative weight of thymus gland and negatively on exploration and rats of the DPWG scored higher than those of the LPWG (P<. 0.01). Therefore, witnessing experimental procedures during the light phase of the light/dark cycle appeared to be stressful and might compromise the welfare of laboratory rats. Taken together, the reported results demonstrate that the time in which managemental procedures are witnessed affect behaviour, performance and welfare of laboratory rats. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objective: Adolescents with mental disorders are at increased risk for being overweight or obese, and subsequently developing metabolic syndrome. However, data regarding risk factors for weight gain during psychiatric hospitalization of adolescents are limited and inconsistent. The aim of this study was to investigate the sociodemographic, clinical, and pharmacological risk factors for weight gain during psychiatric treatment, in order to improve prevention of subsequent metabolic syndrome. Methods: We conducted a historical prospective study of 146 adolescent patients (mean age 15.2±1.9 years, 52.7% males), consecutively admitted for day treatment in an adolescent day unit (length of stay 141±76 days). Anthropometric measurements and laboratory analyses of fasting glucose and lipid levels were conducted as part of the routine medical care at admission and discharge. Psychiatric diagnoses, medication histories, and sociodemographic data were obtained from the electronic medical records system. Results: A significant increase in age- and gender adjusted body mass index (BMI) (i.e., z score) was observed (0.5±1.2 vs. 0.7±1.1 at admission and discharge, respectively, p&lt;0.001). Male subjects were more prone to weight gain than females (odds ratio [OR]=3.5, 95% CI=1.2-10.3) and BMI z score at admission was inversely associated with weight gain (R2=0.2, p&lt;0.0001). Surprisingly, age at admission, psychiatric diagnoses, length of stay, and number of medications were not associated with weight gain. Despite weight gain, fasting blood glucose and lipid profile did not change significantly during the study period. Conclusions: Hospitalization of adolescents in a psychiatric day unit may be associated with a significant weight gain, especially in male subjects and those with normal weight at admission. Efforts should be aimed to reduce weight gain among youth with psychiatric disorders during treatment, to avoid a subsequent metabolic syndrome. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={Hales and Barkers alternative hypothesis moved beyond simplistic genetic or lifestyle explanations and eventually led to a new paradigm for understanding chronic disease risk.Their main contribution to the advancement of science was the recognition of the powerful role of developmental plasticity, the ability of a gene to generate a range of possible phenotypes depending on environmental experience.This pathway is typified by nutritional excess in early life (e.g., maternal high fat/sugar/energy diets), followed by a Western high-energy/low-fiber diet in adulthood.The forefront of the primary mechanisms that drive developmental programming and its transmission from one generation to the next is epigenetics.Both human and animal studies surmise that the effects of developmentally programmed traits may be transmitted to subsequent generations even if not exposed to the same environmental unbalances.Major example of this trans-generational programming is represented by the high prevalence of cardiovascular risks in the US native Indians and Afro-Americans.Beyond this, a new concept of multigenerational programming is emerging from epigenetic studies.For instance, when a pregnant mother is consuming an inadequate, low-protein diet, three generations are effectively being exposed simultaneously to this dietary insult: The pregnant mother (F0), her fetal offspring (F1), and the primordial germ cells (PGCs)the precursors of sperm and eggswithin the F1 fetus.Multigenerational (i.e., F1, F2) effects have been documented through extensive experimental animal studies as well as epidemiological studies.The existing worldwide obesity epidemic, in tandem with persistent undernutrition and poor food availability, emphasize the importance of research involving the developmental origins and the multigenerational transmission of cardiometabolic dysregulation.If it is true that maternal (and paternal) epigenomes do transmit multigenerational information that affects developmental programming, then this aspect of the evolution of phenotypic plasticity in humans must be accounted for in the structure and content of interventions to improve adult health. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

We compared such activities in 6 avian species: 3 psittaciforms (black-headed caiques, red-shouldered macaws, and Goffin cockatoos) and 3 corvids (New Caledonian crows, ravens, and jackdaws). Differences in the type and frequency of object combinations were consistent with species' ecology. Object caching was found predominately in common ravens, which frequently cache food. The most intrinsically structured object combinations were found in New Caledonian crows and Goffin cockatoos, which both stand out for their problem solving abilities in physical tasks. Object insertions prevailed in New Caledonian crows that naturally extract food using tools. Our results support the idea that playful manipulations of inedible objects are linked to physical cognition and problem-solving abilities. © 2014 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Nearly all Americans (97%) report eating candy at least once per year; yet, on a given day, only approximately one-fourth of the US population aged ≥2 y consumes candy. Among all Americans, candy contributes a relatively small proportion of calories, added sugars, and saturated fat to the total diet, and recent research suggests that current levels of candy consumption are not associated with risk of weight gain and cardiovascular disease in children and adults. Providing guidance for the consumption of candy in moderation requires an understanding of various behavioral health-related factors that influence candy consumption. A roundtable of behavioral nutrition experts, researchers, and nutrition educators met to discuss recent data on intakes of candy, health outcomes associated with usual candy intake, and the impact of behavioral strategies, including restriction, education, and environmental awareness, on modifying eating behaviors to achieve moderate intakes of candy. Restricting access to palatable foods, whether self-imposed or by parental control, may have potentially negative consequences. Techniques and insight into how to adopt "moderation" in candy consumption, from effective parental practices to environmental strategies that facilitate behavior change without a high degree of effort, were identified as important next steps toward sustainable dietary guidance related to the role of candy and other treats in a healthy lifestyle. © 2015 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Although diet affects growth and behaviour, the adaptive mechanisms that coordinate these processes in non-optimal food sources are unclear. Here we show that the C. Elegans tmc-1 channel, which is homologous to the mammalian tmc deafness genes, attenuates development and inhibits sexual behaviour in non-optimal food, the synthetic CeMM medium. In CeMM medium, signalling from the pharyngeal MC neurons and body wall muscles slows larval development. However, in the non-standard diet, mutation in tmc-1 accelerates development, by impairing the excitability of these cells. The tmc-1 larva can immediately generate ATP when fed CeMM, and their fast development requires insulin signalling. Our findings suggest that the tmc-1 channel indirectly affects metabolism in wild-type animals. In addition to regulating the development, we show that mutating tmc-1 can relax diet-induced inhibition of male sexual behaviour, thus indicating that a single regulator can be genetically modified to promote growth rate and reproductive success in new environments. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract={Phenotypic plasticity is a phenomenon in which the same genotype produces entirely different phenotypes in response to changes in the environment, and grants an organism the ability to adapt to environmental variations. Wing polymorphism is commonly observed in insects, including Homoptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Orthoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Isoptera, Psocoptera, and Dermaptera, as a strategy to tolerate trade-offs between flight capability and fecundity. As a result, it may confer an important adaptive value to the evolution of populations because these winged individuals can migrate long distances and find suitable habitats for development and reproduction of their offspring more easily. At the present time, there is limited knowledge of the mechanisms of wing polymorphism in varying populations. Both genes and the environment are usually considered to affect the developmental outcomes of insect wing morphs. It is easy to understand the contributions of genes to morphology as a consequence of the research of evolution and developmental biology. However, very little is known about the influential mechanism of environmental factors on the development of phenotypes. In fact, it is not yet clear that how the evolutionary shifts of character variation is realized between environmental and genetic control. So far, studies on wing polymorphism are mostly reported on phytophagous insects, very few are known in parasitoids, natural enemies of insect pests. Here we summarized the mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity for wing morph differentiation in insects. Both genetic and environmental factors can act on the wing development of insects. The genotypes have significant effects on the determination of insect wing morphs. External environmental conditions such as temperature, photoperiod, food quality, population density, exogenous hormones, etc., also play important roles in regulating the insect wing development, which produce wing polyphenism. In addition, the parasitism or predation of natural enemies may induce alternative variations across transgenerational wing morphs in some insects. The ecological significance of insect wing polymorphism and its functions during their evolutionary process are discussed. Polyphenism is one of the main reasons why insects have become so successful on the earth, and grants them the capability to effectively utilize the same genome in order to best adapt to predictable changes in the environment, such as degradation of survival conditions after overcrowding, by developing into different phenotypes. Wing polyphenism in insects is a clear example of adaptive phenotypic plasticity, which provides a very good model to study alternative phenotypes from both genetic and environmental perspectives. This may also be advantageous to evaluate how environmental and genetic factors jointly control the same developmental events. Further study recommendations were also discussed in this review, as well as the potential utilization of wing morph differentiation mechanisms of parasitic wasps in biological control, e.g., through artificially culturing the winged individuals of parasitoids for field release to improve the dispersal ability of natural enemies. Some critical aspects still need to be investigated further on the mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity for wing morph differentiation in insects. Further development in functional genomics and epigenetics may provide novel opportunities and technological support for revealing the mechanisms of polyphenism in insects completely. © 2015, Ecological Society of China.

abstract={Few studies have examined the influence of diet on larval proactive-reactive behavioural dimension of stress coping style responses. The present study evaluated the influence of using different vegetables oils (Linseed; Soybean; Olive) and fish oil (Cod liver) for Artemia metanauplii nutritional enrichment on the proactive-reactive behavioural responses of Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) post-larvae (40 days post hatch). Forty-two Senegalese sole larvae from each of the four replicate tanks per treatment were tested. Two tests were performed: a new environment individual-based test, which evaluate the larvae latency time to move, total activity time and total distance moved; and a risk group-based test, which consisted in evaluating the larval capacity to cross from a "comfort" zone to a "risk" zone. In the group-based test, proactive, intermediate and reactive individuals were identified depending on the time taken to cross between two zones. Larvae fed with Artemia metanauplii enriched with the cod liver oil emulsion were significantly (P= 0.01) larger and in the individual-based test presented significantly higher total activity time (P= 0.08) and total distance moved (P= 0.01) than larvae from the other dietary treatments. No significant correlations (P> 0.05) were observed between larvae total length and latency time to move, total activity time or total distance moved across all treatments or within any dietary treatment. In the group-based test, fish fed with Artemia enriched with the cod liver oil emulsion presented a significantly higher proportion of proactive larvae (P= 0.02) and the lower proportion of reactive larvae. The present study showed for the first time that (i) Senegalese sole presented a defined proactive-reactive behaviour from early ontogenesis and (ii) dietary fatty acid composition significantly influenced the proactive-reactive behavioural dimension of stress coping style of sole larvae. The current study has practical implications that open the possibility to produce organisms that have behavioural styles that could ultimately result in improved aquaculture productivity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Global change affects individual phenotypes and biotic interactions, which can have cascading effects up to the ecosystem level. However, the role of environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity in species interactions is poorly understood, leaving a substantial gap in our knowledge of the impacts of global change on ecosystems. Using a cladoceran-dragonfly system, we experimentally investigated the effects of thermal acclimation, acute temperature change and enrichment on predator functional response and metabolic rate. Using our experimental data, we next parameterized a population dynamics model to determine the consequences of these effects on trophic interaction strength and food-chain stability. We found that (1) predation and metabolic rates of the dragonfly larvae increase with acute warming, (2) warm-acclimated larvae have a higher maximum predation rate than cold-acclimated ones, and (3) long-term interaction strength increases with enrichment but decreases with both acclimation and acute temperatures. Overall, our experimental results show that thermal acclimation can buffer negative impacts of environmental change on predators and increase food-web stability and persistence. We conclude that the effect of acclimation and, more generally, phenotypic plasticity on trophic interactions should not be overlooked if we aim to understand the effects of climate change and enrichment on species interaction strength and food-web stability. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={The present study aimed to assess the effects of environmental enrichment (EA) on the welfare of mice in maternity of a vivarium. For this, Swiss mice of the maternity of the Positivo University vivarium were separated randomly into two groups of six females each, one group with enrichment (CE), consisting of paper for making the nest, and another group without enrichment (SE); two females were placed in each box. The behaviors evaluated were exploratory (EXP), agonistic (AGO), self-care (CUI), interaction with enrichment (IE), interaction with pups (IF), interaction between mothers (IM) and food (ALI), compared in general and throughout nine days of filming. Regarding the general comparison, the AGO behavior was lower in the CE group (P=0.047); however, the median was equal to 0% for both groups. Throughout the days, the behaviors EXP, IF, and ALI in both groups showed differences (P<0.05), with decreasing length of EXP and increasing length of IF and ALI. There were differences (P<0.05) in the median of CUI and IM, indicating variation throughout the days on the SE group, and no difference on the CE (P>0.05), meaning that in CE, CUI and IM occurred in a more continuous way. Still in the CE group, there was variation (P<0.05) of IE, showing a decrease throughout the days, from 29% in the first day to 1% on the last day. The CE group showed a greater variation in the expression of the AGO behavior (P<0.05), while in SE there was no difference (P>0.05), indicating that AGO did not vary throughout the days. We conclude that EA improves the interaction between animals, decreasing agonistic behaviors and encouraging the natural nesting behavior. Due to the positive impact, most studies on ways to EA for mice are relevant.},

abstract={Animals often exhibit consistent individual differences in behavior (i.e., animal personality) and correlations between behaviors (i.e., behavioral syndromes), yet the causes of those patterns of behavioral variation remain insufficiently understood. Many authors hypothesize that state-dependent behavior produces animal personality and behavioral syndromes. However, empirical studies assessing patterns of covariation among behavioral traits and state variables have produced mixed results. New statistical methods that partition correlations into between-individual and residual within-individual correlations offer an opportunity to more sufficiently quantify relationships among behaviors and state variables to assess hypotheses of animal personality and behavioral syndromes. In a population of wild Belding's ground squirrels (Urocitellus beldingi), we repeatedly measured activity, exploration, and response to restraint behaviors alongside glucocorticoids and nutritional condition. We used multivariate mixed models to determine whether between-individual or within-individual correlations drive phenotypic relationships among traits. Squirrels had consistent individual differences for all five traits. At the between-individual level, activity and exploration were positively correlated whereas both traits negatively correlated with response to restraint, demonstrating a behavioral syndrome. At the within-individual level, condition negatively correlated with cortisol, activity, and exploration. Importantly, this indicates that although behavior is state-dependent, which may play a role in animal personality and behavioral syndromes, feedback mechanisms between condition and behavior appear not to produce consistent individual differences in behavior and correlations between them. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={An exciting area in behavioural ecology focuses on understanding why animals exhibit consistent among-individual differences in behaviour (animal personalities). Animal personality has been proposed to emerge as an adaptation to individual differences in state variables, leading to the question of why individuals differ consistently in state. Recent theory emphasizes the role that positive feedbacks between state and behaviour can play in producing consistent among-individual covariance between state and behaviour, hence state-dependent personality. We review the role of feedbacks in recent models of adaptive personalities, and provide guidelines for empirical testing of model assumptions and predictions. We discuss the importance of the mediating effects of ecology on these feedbacks, and provide a roadmap for including state-behaviour feedbacks in behavioural ecology research. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background and objectives This study examined the effects of verbal information and approach-avoidance training on fear-related cognitive and behavioural responses about novel animals. Methods One hundred and sixty children (7-11 years) were randomly allocated to receive: a) positive verbal information about one novel animal and threat information about a second novel animal (verbal information condition); b) approach-avoidance training in which they repeatedly pushed away (avoid) or pulled closer (approach) pictures of the animals (approach-avoidance training), c) a combined condition in which verbal information was given prior to approach-avoidance training (verbal information + approach-avoidance training) and d) a combined condition in which approach-avoidance training was given prior to verbal information (approach-avoidance training + verbal information). Results Threat and positive information significantly increased and decreased fear beliefs and avoidance behaviour respectively. Approach-avoidance training was successful in training the desired behavioural responses but had limited effects on fear-related responses. Verbal information and both combined conditions resulted in significantly larger effects than approach-avoidance training. We found no evidence for an additive effect of these pathways. Limitations This study used a non-clinical sample and focused on novel animals rather than animals about which children already had experience or established fears. The study also compared positive information/approach with threat information/avoid training, limiting specific conclusions regarding the independent effects of these conditions. Conclusions The present study finds little evidence in support of a possible causal role for behavioural response training in the aetiology of childhood fear. However, the provision of verbal information appears to be an important pathway involved in the aetiology of childhood fear. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Increasing performance work in the horse is often associated with a reduction in the forage ration and an increase in concentrates, usually in the form of high-starch cereal grains. This type of diet has been associated with stereotypic behaviours and health problems. High-starch diets are also associated with a high glycaemic response, which has been hypothesised to cause increased reactivity in horses. The aim of this project, therefore, was to evaluate responses of horses to novel stimuli and handling tests when fed a high-starch or a high-fibre diet.A cross-over design study incorporating 2×28day periods was used to evaluate heart rates and behavioural responses during novel stimuli and handling tests when horses were fed a high-starch or a high-fibre diet. All measures were taken over five equally spaced sample points for each period. Data were initially assessed using factor analysis (Varimax rotation, SPSS) in order to produce combined traits of behavioural and heart rate measurements. A Generalised Linear Mixed Model (Genstat® edition 15) was used to analyse the effects of diet on mean data (over the five samples) for each factor as well as for all individual variables. In the handling test, factor 3 (heart rate reactivity) showed a significant relationship to diet (F1,3=27.77, p&lt;0.01). The individual handling test variables of maximum and average heart rates both showed a significant increase when horses were fed the high-starch diet compared to the high-fibre diet (F1,3=10.84, p=0.017 and F1,3=14.42, p=0.01). In the novel test factor 3 (eating reactivity) showed a significant relationship to diet (F1,3=8.02, p=0.03) with horses demonstrating more interrupted eating when they were fed the high-starch diet compared to the high-fibre diet. The individual novel test variables showed that when horses were fed the high-starch diets their maximum heart rates were significantly higher (F1,3=15.31, p&lt;0.01) compared to the high-fibre diet. The results demonstrate that the high-starch diet had some effect on the reactivity and handling behaviour of horses, in particular their heart rate reactivity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Developmental environments can have long-term effects on cognition. Multiple aspects of cognition may be affected by unfavourable conditions during development if underlying neuronal structures are maturing simultaneously. We investigated the effects of nutritional stress at different stages of development on adult associative learning, spatial memory, and behaviours towards a novel object in a songbird. Zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) were raised in consistently high or low food conditions until post-hatch day (PHD) 36 (i.e., nutritional independence), where half of the birds from each condition were switched to the other condition until PHD 61. Subjects were then tested as adults with two associative learning tasks, a hippocampus-dependent spatial memory task, and for responses toward a novel object. Surprisingly, low food treatment before independence facilitated spatial associative learning but impaired an aspect of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. Responses to a novel object were not altered by treatments. This study demonstrates that developmental stress is able to influence learning without simultaneously affecting a measure of personality. © 2015 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Experimental extinction serves as a model for psychiatric treatments based on associative learning. However, the effects of extinction are often transient, as evidenced by postextinction return of defensive behaviors. From a therapeutic perspective, an inherent problem with extinction may be that mere omission of threat is not sufficient to reduce future threat uncertainty. The current study tested an augmented form of extinction that replaced, rather than merely omitted, expected threat outcomes with novel nonthreat outcomes, with the goal of reducing postextinction return of defensive behaviors. METHODS: Thirty-two healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats and 47 human adults underwent threat conditioning to a conditioned stimulus paired with an electrical shock. Subjects then underwent a standard extinction protocol with shock omitted or an augmented extinction protocol wherein the shock was replaced by a surprising tone. Tests of postextinction recovery occurred 24 hours later in the absence of the tone. RESULTS: Replacing the shock with a novel nonthreat outcome, as compared with shock omission, reduced postextinction recovery (freezing in rats and anticipatory skin conductance responses in humans) when tested 24 hours later. Self-reported intolerance of uncertainty was positively correlated with recovery following standard extinction in humans, providing new evidence that postextinction recovery is related to sensitivity to future threat uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide cross-species evidence of a novel strategy to enhance extinction that may have broad implications for how to override associative learning that has become maladaptive and offer a simple technique that could be straightforwardly adapted and implemented in clinical situations. © 2015 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract={Mutualistic interactions typically involve the exchange of different commodities between species [1]. Nutritious secretions are produced by a number of insects and plants in exchange for services such as defense [2, 3]. These rewards are valuable metabolically and can be used to reinforce the behavior of symbiotic partners that can learn and remember them effectively [4, 5]. We show here novel effects of insect exocrine secretions produced by caterpillars in modulating the behavior of attendant ants in the food-for-defense interaction between lycaenid butterflies and ants [6]. Reward secretions from the dorsal nectary organ (DNO) of Narathura japonica caterpillars function to reduce the locomotory activities of their attendant ants, Pristomyrmex punctatus workers. Moreover, workers that feed from caterpillar secretions are significantly more likely to show aggressive responses to eversion of the tentacle organs of the caterpillars. Analysis of the neurogenic amines in the brains of workers that consumed caterpillar secretions showed a significant decrease in levels of dopamine compared with controls. Experimental treatments in which reserpine, a known inhibitor of dopamine in Drosophila, was fed to workers similarly reduced their locomotory activity. We conclude that DNO secretions of lycaenid caterpillars can manipulate attendant ant behavior by altering dopaminergic regulation and increasing partner fidelity. Unless manipulated ants also receive a net nutritional benefit from DNO secretions, this suggests that similar reward-for-defense interactions that have been traditionally considered to be mutualisms may in fact be parasitic in nature. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Urbanisation and agriculture cause declines for many wildlife, but some species benefit from novel resources, especially food, provided in human-dominated habitats. Resulting shifts in wildlife ecology can alter infectious disease dynamics and create opportunities for cross-species transmission, yet predicting host-pathogen responses to resource provisioning is challenging. Factors enhancing transmission, such as increased aggregation, could be offset by better host immunity due to improved nutrition. Here, we conduct a review and meta-analysis to show that food provisioning results in highly heterogeneous infection outcomes that depend on pathogen type and anthropogenic food source. We also find empirical support for behavioural and immune mechanisms through which human-provided resources alter host exposure and tolerance to pathogens. A review of recent theoretical models of resource provisioning and infection dynamics shows that changes in host contact rates and immunity produce strong non-linear responses in pathogen invasion and prevalence. By integrating results of our meta-analysis back into a theoretical framework, we find provisioning amplifies pathogen invasion under increased host aggregation and tolerance, but reduces transmission if provisioned food decreases dietary exposure to parasites. These results carry implications for wildlife disease management and highlight areas for future work, such as how resource shifts might affect virulence evolution. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract={Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) inhabiting the Aleutian Islands have stabilized at low abundance levels following a decline and currently exhibit restricted habitat-utilization patterns. Possible explanations for restricted habitat use by sea otters can be classified into two fundamentally different processes, bottom-up and top-down forcing. Bottom-up hypotheses argue that changes in the availability or nutritional quality of prey resources have led to the selective use of habitats that support the highest quality prey. In contrast, top-down hypotheses argue that increases in predation pressure from killer whales have led to the selective use of habitats that provide the most effective refuge from killer whale predation. A third hypothesis suggests that current restricted habitat use is based on a need for protection from storms. We tested all three hypotheses for restricted habitat use by comparing currently used and historically used sea otter foraging locations for: (1) prey availability and quality, (2) structural habitat complexity, and (3) exposure to prevailing storms. Our findings suggest that current use is based on physical habitat complexity and not on prey availability, prey quality, or protection from storms, providing further evidence for killer whale predation as a cause for restricted sea otter habitat use in the Aleutian Islands. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Summary: Life-history trade-offs are considered a major driving force in the emergence of consistent behavioural differences (personality variation); but empirical tests are scarce. We investigated links between a personality trait (escape response), life-history and state variables (growth rate, size and age at first reproduction, age-dependent reproductive rates, lifetime reproductive success, life span) in red and green colour morphs of clonal pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Escape response (dropping/non-dropping off a plant upon a predatory attack) was measured repeatedly to classify individuals as consistent droppers, consistent nondroppers or inconsistents. Red morphs experienced stronger trade-offs between early reproduction and life span than green morphs; and red consistent (non)droppers had highest lifetime reproductive success. Red droppers followed a risk-averse life-history strategy (high late reproduction), red nondroppers a risk-prone strategy (high early reproduction), while reproductive rates were equivalent for all green behavioural types and red inconsistents. This suggests that red morphs suffer the highest costs of dropping (they are most conspicuous to predators), which 'equivalates' fitness payoffs to both risk-takers (red non-droppers) and risk-averse red droppers. The strong trade-off also means that committing to a particular lifestyle (being consistent) maximises fitness. Our study suggests that life-history trade-offs likely mediate personality variation but effects might depend on interactions with other organismal characteristics (here: colour morph). © 2014 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Neurexins are neuronal presynaptic proteins that play a key role in mediation of synapse formation. Heterozygous partial deletions in the neurexin-1 gene (NRXN1, 2p16.3) have been observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. NRXN1-α knockout (KO) mice present behavioral impairments that resemble some of the core ASD symptoms of social impairment and inflexibility/stereotypy. At present, a thorough assessment of cognitive function has yet to be completed. Rats, containing a biallelic deletion of the NRNX1-α gene on a Sprague Dawley background were compared to littermate wild types across a range of tasks designed to test functional domains disrupted in ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders, including sensory perception (prepulse inhibition), attention (latent inhibition), associative learning (instrumental and Pavlovian conditioning), and memory (rewarded alternation T maze and spatial discrimination). NRXN1α KO rats were found to present with large and persistent nonsocial deficits, including hyperactivity, deficits in simple instrumental learning, latent inhibition, and spatialdependent learning. No deficit in sensorimotor gating was observed, despite the presence of an exaggerated startle response. Although KO animals were also able to learn a simple Pavlovian conditioning discrimination, they did display impaired latent inhibition. The presence of pronounced impairments in several domains in NRXN1α KO rats clearly suggests that nonsocial cognitive deficits can also be measured in an animal model of ASD. Further exploration of those deficits, both clinically and preclinically, as planned in the Innovative Medicines Initiative's European Autism Interventions: A Multicenter Study for Developing New Medications program, may help to better understand the brain circuitry involved in ASD and therefore open new avenues to advance novel therapies. © 2014 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Fear is an adaptive mechanism evolved to influence the primal decisions of foragers in "approach resource-avoid predator" conflicts [1-3]. To survive and reproduce, animals must attain the basic needs (food, water, shelter, and mate) while avoiding the ultimate cost of predation [4]. Consistent with this view, ecological studies have found that predatory threats cause animals to limit foraging to fewer places in their habitat and/or to restricted times [5-7]. However, the neurophysiological basis through which animals alter their foraging boundaries when confronted with danger remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated place cells in the hippocampus, implicated in processing spatial information and memory [8-10], in male Long-Evans rats foraging for food under risky situations that would be common in nature. Specifically, place cells from dorsal cornu ammonis field 1 (CA1) were recorded while rats searched for food in a semi-naturalistic apparatus (consisting of a nest and a relatively large open area) before, during, and after encountering a "predatory" robot situated remotely from the nest [11]. The looming robot induced remapping of place fields and increased the theta rhythm as the animals advanced toward the vicinity of threat, but not when they were around the safety of the nest. These neurophysiological effects on the hippocampus were prevented by lesioning of the amygdala. Based on these findings, we suggest that the amygdalar signaling of fear influences the stability of hippocampal place cells as a function of threat distance in rats foraging for food. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Bark beetles cause widespread tree mortality, so understanding how climate change will influence the distribution and magnitude of outbreaks by this group of herbivores is important. We first develop a framework of outbreak dynamics that emphasizes transitions from states dominated by negative feedback to those dominated by positive, density-dependent feedback. We then consider mechanisms by which temperature and precipitation changes can allow populations to breach critical thresholds, and the empirical data relating outbreaks to weather. Finally, we consider how anticipated climatic change, and relationships with new hosts and natural enemy guilds, may influence dynamics in new habitats. There is strong evidence that elevated temperature can increase overwintering survival and decrease generation times of bark beetles, although evolved traits can also constrain response to warming in some habitats. Moreover, combinations of phenotypic plasticity, genotypic variation and physiological thresholds yield a broad range of conditions under which adults emerge synchronously, and thus can mass attack trees. There is likewise strong evidence that severe drought reduces tree defences against attack. Drought stress can occur through lower precipitation and/ or higher temperatures that reduce soil moisture and/or raise vapour pressure defi- cit. We also delineate three categories of range modifications: increased and more persistent establishment in areas where trees experienced only intermittent exposure historically; establishment in areas dominated by host species but where local populations experienced little or no pressure historically; and movement into new areas containing susceptible species that have not been exposed previously. Each of these has been documented for bark beetles. Trees in areas that experienced minor or no exposure generally had lower defences than their more historically exposed counterparts. However, there can be lags in beetle behavioural responses. In some cases, more heterogeneous forest structure, more abundant local predators and competitors and low host nutritional quality could potentially lessen risk in new habitats. Direct comparative studies are needed to evaluate outbreak potentials following range expansions driven by climate warming. © CAB International 2015. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Avoidance behavior involves learning responses that prevent upcoming aversive events; these responses typically extinguish when the aversive events stop materializing. Stimuli that signal safety fromaversive events can paradoxically inhibit extinction of avoidance behavior. In animals, males and females process safety signals differently. These differences help explain why women are more likely to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and exhibit differences in symptompresentation and course compared to men. In the current study, we extend an existing model of strain differences in avoidance behavior to simulate sex differences in rats. The model successfully replicates data showing that the omission of a signal associated with a period of safety can facilitate extinction in females, but not males, and makes novel predictions that this effect should depend on the duration of the period, the duration of the signal itself, and its occurrence within that period. Non-reinforced responses during the safe period were also found to be important in the expression of these patterns. The model also allowed us to explore underlying mechanisms for the observed sex effects, such as whether safety signals serve as occasion setters for aversive events, to determine why removing them can facilitate extinction of avoidance. The simulation results argue against this account, and instead suggest the signal may serve as a conditioned reinforcer of avoidance behavior.},

abstract={A change in efficacy of hippocampal synapses is critical for memory formation. So far, the molecular analysis of synapses during learning has focused on small groups of proteins, whereas the dynamic global changes at these synapses have remained unknown. Here, we analyzed the temporal changes of the mouse hippocampal synaptic membrane proteome 1 and 4 h after contextual fear learning, comparing two groups; (1) a fear memory forming "delayed-shock" group and (2) a fear memory-deficient "immediate-shock" group. No changes in protein expression were observed 1 h after conditioning between the two experimental groups. However, 423 proteins were significantly regulated 4 h later of which 164 proteins showed a temporal regulation after a delayed shock and 273 proteins after the stress of an immediate shock. From the proteins that were differentially regulated between the delayed- and the immediate-shock groups at 4 h, 48 proteins, most prominently representing endocytosis, (amphiphysin, dynamin, and synaptojanin1), glutamate signaling (glutamate [NMDA] receptor subunit epsilon-1, disks large homolog 3), and neurotransmitter metabolism (excitatory amino acid transporter 1, excitatory amino acid transporter 2, sodium- and chloride-dependent GABA transporter 3) were regulated in both protocols, but in opposite directions, pointing toward an interaction of learning and stress. Taken together, this data set yields novel insight into diverse and dynamic changes that take place at hippocampal synapses over the time course of contextual fear-memory learning. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Background As a result of evolution, the biology of triatomines must have been significantly adapted to accommodate trypanosome infection in a complex network of vector-vertebrate-parasite interactions. Arthropod-borne parasites have probably developed mechanisms, largely still unknown, to exploit the vector-vertebrate host interactions to ensure their transmission to suitable hosts. Triatomines exhibit a strong negative phototaxis and nocturnal activity, believed to be important for insect survival against its predators. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we quantified phototaxis and locomotion in starved fifth instar nymphs of Rhodnius prolixus infected with Trypanosoma cruzi or Trypanosoma rangeli. T. cruzi infection did not alter insect phototaxis, but induced an overall 20% decrease in the number of bug locomotory events. Furthermore, the significant differences induced by this parasite were concentrated at the beginning of the scotophase. Conversely, T. rangeli modified both behaviors, as it significantly decreased bug negative phototaxis, while it induced a 23% increase in the number of locomotory events in infected bugs. In this case, the significant effects were observed during the photophase. We also investigated the expression of Rpfor, the triatomine ortholog of the foraging gene known to modulate locomotion in other insects, and found a 4.8 fold increase for T. rangeli infected insects. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrated for the first time that trypanosome infection modulates the locomotory activity of the invertebrate host. T. rangeli infection seems to be more broadly effective, as besides affecting the intensity of locomotion this parasite also diminished negative phototaxis and the expression of a behavior-associated gene in the triatomine vector. © 2015 Marliére et al.},

abstract={The epigenetic "revolution" in science cuts across many disciplines, and it is now one of the fastest-growing research areas in biology. Increasingly, claims are made that epigenetics research represents a move away from the genetic determinism that has been prominent both in biological research and in understandings of the impact of biology on society. We discuss to what extent an epigenetic framework actually supports these claims. We show that, in contrast to the received view, epigenetics research is often couched in language as deterministic as genetics research in both science and the popular press. We engage the rapidly emerging conversation about the impact of epigenetics on public discourse and scientific practice, and we contend that the notion of epigenetic determinism - or the belief that epigenetic mechanisms determine the expression of human traits and behaviors - matters for understandings of the influence of biology and society on population health. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={In many species, males possess conspicuous characteristics to attract females. These traits often attract predators as well, and males thus may have to balance the conspicuousness of their signals in relation to the prevailing predation risk. Here we develop a theoretical model of optimal signaling and risk-taking behavior for males differing in the attractiveness of their signals. All else being equal, more attractive males should behave more cautiously. Yet this prediction may drastically change if males differ in any additional characteristic, especially if basal mortality rate or signaling costs are higher or if the vulnerability to predators is lower for attractive males. A key insight from our model is that male competition will create a positive feedback so that selection on male risk-taking strategies is acting in opposite directions. If selection acts on one male type to behave more cautiously, this will strengthen selection on males of the other types to take higher risks and vice versa. Our results further demonstrate that the asset-protection principle, which states that individuals with higher future expectations should behave more cautiously, may often be violated. We also offer an alternative to the handicap principle explaining the often found positive association between male ornamentation and viability: attractive males may simply behave more cautiously. © 2014 The Society for the Study of Evolution.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: A subgroup of overweight and obese people is characterized by binge eating disorder (BED). Increased impulsivity has been suggested to cause binge eating and subsequent weight gain. In the current study, neuronal correlates of increased impulsivity in binge eating disorder during behavioral response inhibition were investigated. METHODS: Magnetic brain activity and behavioral responses of 37 overweight and obese individuals with and without diagnosed BED were recorded while performing a food-related visual go-nogo task. Trait impulsivity was assessed with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11). RESULTS: Specifically, increased attentional impulsiveness (a subscale of the BIS-11) in BED was related to decreased response inhibition performance and hypoactivity in the prefrontal control network, which was activated when response inhibition was required. Furthermore, participants with BED showed a trend for a food-specific inhibition performance decline. This was possibly related to the absence of a food-specific activity increase in the prefrontal control network in BED, as observed in the control group. In addition, an increase in activity related to the actual button press during prepotent responses and alterations in visual processing were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest an attentional impulsiveness-related attenuation in response inhibition performance in individuals with BED. This might have been related to increased reward responsiveness and limited resources to activate the prefrontal control network involved in response inhibition. Our results substantiate the importance of neuronal markers for investigating prevention and treatment of obesity, especially in specific subgroups at risk such as BED. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract={State dependent learning effects have been widely studied in a variety of drugs of abuse. However, they have yet to be studied in relation to sexual motivation. The current study investigated state-dependent learning effects of cocaine in male Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) using a sexual conditioning paradigm. Cocaine-induced state-dependent learning effects were investigated using a 2. ×. 2 factorial design with training state as one factor and test state as the other factor. During a 14-day training phase, male quail were injected once daily with 10. mg/kg cocaine or saline and then placed in a test chamber after 15. min. In the test chamber, sexual conditioning trials consisted of presentation of a light conditioned stimulus (CS) followed by sexual reinforcement. During the state dependent test, half of the birds received a shift in drug state from training to testing (Coc. →. Sal or Sal. →. Coc) while the other half remained in the same drug state (Coc. →. Coc or Sal. →. Sal). Results showed that male quail that were trained and tested in the same state (Coc. →. Coc or Sal. →. Sal) showed greater sexual conditioning than male quail that were trained and tested in different states (Sal. →. Coc) except when cocaine was administered chronically prior to the test (Coc. →. Sal). For the latter condition, sexual conditioning persisted from cocaine training to the saline test. The findings suggest that state dependent effects may alter sexual motivation and that repeated exposure to cocaine during sexual activity may increase sexual motivation which, in turn, may lead to high risk sexual activities. An alternative explanation for the findings is also discussed. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Preimplantation culture of mouse embryos has been suggested to result in reduced anxiety-like behavior in adulthood. Here, we investigated the effects of in vitro fertilization (IVF), embryo culture, and different diets on anxiety-like behavior using the elevated plus maze (EPM). We hypothesized that exposure to suboptimal conditions during the preimplantation stage would interact with the suboptimal diet to alter behavior. The expression of genes related to anxiety was then assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in various brain regions. When fed a normal diet during gestation and a moderately high-fat Western diet (WD) postnatally, naturally conceived (NC) and IVF mice showed similar anxiety-like behavior on the EPM. However, when fed a low-protein diet prenatally and a high-fat diet postnatally (LP/HF), NC mice showed a modest increase in anxiety-like behavior, whereas IVF mice showed the opposite: a strongly reduced anxiety-like behavior on the EPM. The robust reduction in anxiety-like behavior in IVF males fed the LP/HF diets was, intriguingly, associated with reduced expression of MAO-A, CRFR2, and GABA markers in the hypothalamus and cortex. These findings are discussed in relation to the developmental origin of health and disease hypothesis and the 2-hit model, which suggests that 2 events, occurring at different times in development, can act synergistically with long-term consequences observed during adulthood. © The Author(s) 2014.},

abstract={Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or concussion affects a large portion of the population and although many of these individuals recover completely, a small subset of people experience lingering symptomology and poor outcomes. Little is known about the factors that affect individual susceptibility or resilience to poor outcomes after mTBI and there are currently no biomarkers to delineate mTBI diagnosis or prognosis. Based upon the growing literature associated with caloric intake and altered neurological aging and the ambiguous link between repetitive mTBI and progressive neurodegeneration, the current study was designed to examine the effect of a high fat diet (HFD), developmental age, and repetitive mTBI on behavioral outcomes following a mTBI. In addition, telomere length was examined before and after experimental mTBI. Sprague Dawley rats were maintained on a HFD or standard rat chow throughout life (including the prenatal period) and then experienced an mTBI/concussion at P30, P30 and P60, or only at P60. Behavioral outcomes were examined using a test battery that was administered between P61-P80 and included; beam-walking, open field, elevated plus maze, novel context mismatch, Morris water task, and forced swim task. Animals with a P30 mTBI often demonstrated lingering symptomology that was still present during testing at P80. Injuries at P30 and P60 rarely produced cumulative effects, and in some tests (i.e. beam walking), the first injury may have protected the brain from the second injury. Exposure to the high fat diet exacerbated many of the behavioral deficits associated with concussion. Finally, telomere length was shortened following mTBI and was influenced by the animal's dietary intake. Diet, age at the time of injury, and the number of prior concussion incidents differentially contribute to behavioral deficits and may help explain individual variations in susceptibility and resilience to poor outcomes following an mTBI. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Environmental stressors including protein malnutrition (PMN) during pre-, neo- and post-natal age have been documented to affect cognitive development and cause increased susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders. Most studies have addressed either of the three windows and that does not emulate the clinical conditions of intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). Such data fail to provide a complete picture of the behavioral alterations in the F1 generation. The present study thus addresses the larger window from gestation to F1 generation, a new model of intra-generational PMN. Naive Sprague Dawley (SD) dams pre-gestationally switched to LP (8% protein) or HP (20% protein) diets for 45 days were bred and maintained throughout gestation on same diets. Pups born (HP/LP dams) were maintained on the respective diets post-weaningly. The present study aimed to show the sex specific differences in the neurobehavioral evolution and behavioral phenotype of the HP/LP F1 generation pups. A battery of neurodevelopmental reflex tests, behavioral (Open field and forelimb gripstrength test), and cognitive [Elevated plus maze (EPM) and Morris water maze (MWM)] assays were performed. A decelerated growth curve with significantly restricted body and brain weight, delays in apparition of neuro-reflexes and poor performance in the LP group rats was recorded. Intra-generational PMN induced poor habituation-with-time in novel environment exploration, low anxiety and hyperactive like profile in open field test in young and adult rats. The study revealed poor forelimb neuromuscular strength in LP F1 pups till adulthood. Group occupancy plots in MWM test revealed hyperactivity with poor learning, impaired memory retention and integration, thus modeling the signs of early onset Alzehemier phenotype. In addition, a gender specific effect of LP diet with severity in males and favoring female sex was also noticed. © 2015 Naik, Patro and Patro.},

abstract={African-American women experience disproportionately higher rates of obesity than do Caucasian women. The stress African-American women encounter from experiences of discrimination may influence their eating behaviours, which could contribute to weight gain. Emotional eating theory suggests some people increase their intake of high-calorie foods to cope with stressful experiences. We investigated the effects of social exclusion by other African-American women or by Caucasian women for African-American women’s distress and food consumption using a laboratory paradigm. As hypothesised, there were main effects of ostracism and interactions between ostracism and race, although not all of the interactions took the expected form. As hypothesised, African-American women ate more potato crisps after being excluded by Caucasians than by African-Americans. Unexpectedly, African-American women who were excluded by other African-American women self-reported more emotional distress than did African-American women excluded by Caucasian women. These findings suggest that ostracism by both in-group and out-group members are disturbing, although people may respond to in-group and out-group exclusion in different ways. Directions for future research are suggested that could elucidate the circumstances under which different emotional and behavioural coping responses are employed. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

In the postmenopausal obese group, ovariectomized (OVX) mice were maintained on a high-fat diet, and were referred to as OVX-HF. In the treated group, teneligliptin at 60 mg/kg per day was administrated to OVX-HF, and were referred to as Tene. After a 12-week food challenge, the metabolic phenotypes of these mice were analyzed. Body weight, fat accumulation, and glucose intolerance were greater in OVX-HF than in control, while these abnormalities were markedly improved without alterations in calorie intake in Tene. Teneligliptin effectively ameliorated the characteristics of metabolic abnormalities associated with postmenopausal obesity. Regarding chronic inflammation in visceral adipose tissue, the numbers of F4/80+CD11c+CD206-K M1-macrophages in flow cytometry, crown-like structure formation in immunohistochemistry, and proinflammatory cytokine expression were significantly attenuated in Tene. Hepatic steatosis was also markedly improved. Furthermore, decreased energy consumption in the dark and light phases, reduced locomotor activity in the dark phase, and lowered core body temperature in OVX-HF were ameliorated in Tene. Since obesity and reduced energy metabolism are a common physiology of menopause, teneligliptin appears to be beneficial as a treatment for type 2 diabetes in postmenopausal obesity. © 2015 Society for Endocrinology.},

abstract={Background: Growing evidence suggests that the dietary ratio of linoleic acid (LA) to a-linolenic acid (ALA), the precursors of arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), respectively, may affect behavior in mammals. Objective: This study aimed at evaluating the impact of dietary LA and ALA intake on behaviors of growing pigs, a pertinent model for human nutrition. Methods: At 7 wk of age, 32 pigswere allocated to 4 dietary treatments varying in daily intake of LA (1.3 and 2.6 g · kg body weight-0.75 d-1 for low- and high-LA groups, respectively) and ALA (0.15 and 1.5 g · kg body weight0.75 · d-1 for low- and high-ALA groups, respectively) for 4 wk. Between days 12 and 18, general behavior in the home pen was observed and pigs were subjected to an open field and novel object test. At 11 wk of age, brain fatty acid composition was analyzed. Results: Compared with high LA intake, low LA intake increased the time spent on exploration, particularly nosing in the home pen (P &lt; 0.05) and the open field (P &lt; 0.05), and tended to reduce the time spent lying with eyes open in the home pen (P5 0.09). Time spent lyingwith eyes open also tended to be affected by the interaction between LA and ALA (P = 0.08). A high-LA/high-ALA intake (ratio of 2; P &lt; 0.05) and a low-LA/high-ALA intake (ratio of 1; P = 0.06) decreased the latency to approach the novel object compared with a low-LA/low-ALA intake (ratio of 9). DHA in the frontal cortex was positively correlated with exploratory behaviors in the home pen (rs = 0.56, P &lt; 0.01), whereas AA was negatively correlated with time spent lying with eyes closed (rs = -0.48, P &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: Low LA intake and a low dietary LA:ALA ratio increased exploration and decreased anxiety-related behaviors in pigs. It is suggested that changes in brain DHA and AA induced by dietary LA and ALA intake mediate these behavioral changes. © 2015 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Obesity has become a major health risk in industrialized countries, with disturbed sleep identified as a correlate. This study used data drawn from Taiwan’s 2005 Social Development Trend Survey on Health and Safety and the propensity-score-matching method to shed light on gender-specific associations between sleep problems and obesity among 24,113 adults aged 20–64 years. The average increase in obesity prevalence among respondents with disrupted sleep was 1.85%, as compared to those who did not report disrupted sleep, with similar psycho-social attributes. Similarly, the prevalence of obesity among those who reported restless sleep was increased by an average of 1.40% compared to those who did not report restless sleep with similar psycho-social attributes. We also found gender-specific vulnerability to different types of sleep problems. Among men who reported disrupted sleep, we found a 3.12% increase in the prevalence of obesity. Among women exposed to restless sleep, the increase in obesity prevalence was 1.84%. The observed gender difference in the prevalence of increases in obesity may be attributed to gender-specific behavioral responses to poor sleep. With poor sleep, men may respond to hunger by overeating; women may respond by physical inactivity. Both can contribute to an elevated risk of obesity. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={People often crave for high-caloric sweet foods when facing stress and this 'emotional eating' is a most important cause for weight gain and obesity. Eating under stress contrasts with the normally expected response of a loss of appetite, yet in spite of intensive research from neurobiological and cognitive disciplines we still do not know why stress or negative affect triggers overeating in so many of us. Since the prevalence of overweight and obesity still rises, the discovery of crucial risk factors is a most desirable goal of today's research on sub-optimal eating habits. This paper summarizes the most relevant current knowledge from the (human) literature regarding cognitive and biological vulnerabilities for stress-induced emotional eating. A (non-systematic) review of the most relevant studies reveals that most studies contemplate a rather one-directional way of focusing on either cognitive or biological factors, showing inconsistent results. The current paper elaborates and/or integrates these findings into a biological-cognitive interaction model in which a specific combination of genetic and cognitive vulnerabilities are thought to increase our bio-behavioral response to stress, critically increasing the rewarding value of pleasant foods and, hence, emotional eating. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

The scores varied widely between farms (small and large) and between systems (p<0.001). Farms with hampered system (tied stalls), obtained lower scores for 'absence of prolonged thirst', 'ease of movement' and 'expression of other behaviour'; farms with Holstein cows obtained lower scores for 'absence of prolonged hunger', 'good human-animal relationship' and 'comfort around resting: particularly a long lying down times and high dirt frequency at three body areas (legs, udder and hindquarter).

abstract={Introduction: Overweight and obesity are serious public health problem, which is specially among children populations. Objective: To determine the effectiveness of educational interventions conducted in Latino America for the prevention of overweight and obesity in scholar children from 6 to 17 years old. Metodology: MEDLINE, LILACS and EMBASE were searched between february and may 2014 to retrieve randomized controlled trials and longitudinal studies that evaluated the effects of educational interventions intended to retrieve randomized controlled trials and longitudinal studies aiming to prevent overweight and obesity among Latinoamerican children. Risk of bias was evaluated using the PEDro scale and the CASPe tool. Results: Twenty one studies were included (n=12,092). Different types of educational interventions were identified, such as nutritional campaigns, physical activity practice and environmental changes. Mixed approaches combining nutritional campaigns, physical activity promotion and enviromental changes were the most effective interventions, since their results produced the largest improvements in the overweight and obesity of children. None evidence of reporting bias was observed. Conclusion: Educational interventions performed in the educational environment that combined an adequate nutrition and the promotion of physical activity practice, are more effective for preventing overweight and obesity in Latino American children, although familiar interventions are also encouraged approach, associated with better responses on the behavioral change in scholar children. © 2015, Grupo Aula Medica S.A.

abstract={1. Starvation tolerance is an important trait for animals, as most will encounter starvation within their lifetime. Sit-and-wait predators are better adapted to starvation owing to their naturally low encounter rate with prey. 2. Starvation tolerance was studied under three levels of disturbance of wormlion larvae, a strict sit-and-wait predator that constructs pits. 3. Frequently disturbed wormlions constructed pits less often, and larger individuals continued to construct pits more frequently than smaller ones. It was expected that a high disturbance level would lead to a high rate of mass loss, however, surprisingly, the rate of mass loss was not higher for the frequently disturbed group. This suggests that the energetic cost of pit construction and maintenance is not as high as previously suggested for other pit-building predators. 4. Larger individuals tolerated starvation better, in losing a lower proportion of their initial body mass and having higher chances of survival throughout the experiment. 5. The effect of starvation on the distance to neighbours was also investigated, and starved individuals were expected to maximise this distance in order to avoid interference competition. However, wormlions were usually clumped, and starvation or feeding had no effect on the pits' spatial pattern, suggesting that interference competition plays a minor role in this species. 6. Generally, wormlion larvae demonstrated a high starvation tolerance and low mortality rates even after 9 weeks of starvation. © 2015 The Royal Entomological Society.},

abstract={Most attention to size-time trade-offs of insects has focused on herbivore risk, with considerably less attention paid to parasitoids. Here, we focus on parasitoid risk, comparing the fates of unparasitised herbivore hosts and parasitised hosts that protect the parasitoids. Success of a koinobiont parasitoid (host grows after parasitisation) depends on maintaining a delicate balance with its host, thereby ensuring its own survival while the host grows. To evaluate growth rate-mortality rate relationships of host and parasitoid, we compared several aspects of the growth, phenology, and behaviour of unparasitised fern moth [Herpetogramma theseusalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)] larvae and larvae parasitised by Alabagrus texanus (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a solitary koinobiont (one parasitoid per host) wasp. Host larvae feed and construct shelters on sensitive fern, Onoclea sensibilis L. (Dryopteridaceae). Alabagrus texanus parasitise early-instar moths in late summer, which overwinter in their host, emerging in mid-summer to pupate and eclose. During the autumn following hatching and the immediately following spring, parasitised and unparasitised moth larvae did not differ in size, took similar time to choose between satisfactory and unsatisfactory foods, and built similar shelters. Prior to any other changes noted, more parasitised than unparasitised larvae also died when severely starved. Parasitised larvae subsequently grew less and pupated later than unparasitised ones (small size, slow growth), but consumed similar amounts of food. Although the numerically dominant parasitoid of fern moths, we concluded that A. texanus do not efficiently exploit their hosts. © 2015 The Netherlands Entomological Society.},

abstract={Objective: to investigate the presence of eating disorders (ED) and psychopathological traits in obese preadolescents and adolescents compared to normal-weight peers. Design: Overweight/obese patients aged 11 to 14 y and normal-weight peers’ data collected by means of self-report questionnaires administered to parents and children. Setting: Clinical Nutrition Units in the Municipalities of Rome, Naples, Gallipoli and Atri, Italy. Subjects: 376 preadolescents and adolescents. Patients were 187 (93 boys, BMI=27.9±;4.1; 94 girls, BMI=28.1±4.5); normal-weight controls were 189 subjects (94 boys, BMI=19.4±1.4; 95 girls, BMI=19.5±1.5). Measures of outcome: eating disorder behaviors, psychopathological traits and symptoms estimated by means of the eating disorders scales (EDI-2) and psychopathological scales (CBCL 4–18). Results: Patients reached higher scores than controls in most of the eating disorders scales and psychopathological scales. Twenty-one (11.2%) patients were considered at risk of developing an eating disorder and 75 (40%) presented social problems. With regard to weight status, age-group and gender, main significant interaction effects were seen in social problems (F= 6.50; p<0.05) and ineffectiveness (F= 4.15; p<0.05). Conclusions: Findings from our study demonstrate that in preadolescence and adolescence, obesity is significantly associated to some traits typical of ED and to psychological problems in general. Although no inference can be made with regard to direction of causality, it is possible to conclude that overweight preadolescents and adolescents can be prone to display problematic traits more commonly associated to eating disorders and to present a high degree of mental distress. © 2015, © American College of Nutrition.},

abstract={Most Americans do not eat enough fruits and vegetables with significant variation by state. State-level self-reported frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption is available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). However, BRFSS cannot be used to directly compare states' progress toward national goals because of incongruence in units used to measure intake and because distributions from frequency data are not reflective of usual intake. To help states track progress, we developed scoring algorithms from external data and applied them to BRFSS 2011 data to estimate the percentage of each state's adult population meeting US Department of Agriculture Food Patterns fruit and vegetable intake recommendations. We used 24-hour dietary recall data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2007-2010, to fit sex- and age-specific models that estimate probabilities of meeting recommendations as functions of reported consumption frequency, race/ethnicity, and poverty-income ratio adjusting for intraindividual variation. Regression parameters derived from these models were applied to BRFSS to estimate the percentage meeting recommendations. We estimate that 7%-18% of state populations met fruit recommendations and 5%-12% met vegetable recommendations. Our method provides a new tool for states to track progress toward meeting dietary recommendations. © The Author 2015.},

abstract={Background: Anemia during the third trimester of fetal development affects one-third of the pregnancies in the United States and has been associated with postnatal behavioral outcomes. This study examines how fetal iron deficiency (ID) interacts with the fetal monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) genotype. MAOA metabolizes monoamine neurotransmitters. MAOA polymorphisms in humans affect temperament and modify the influence of early adverse environments on later behavior. Objective: The aim of the study was to advance translation of developmental ID research in animal models by taking into account genetic factors that influence outcomes in human populations. Methods: Male infant rhesus monkeys 3-4 mo old born to mothers fed an ID (10 ppm iron) diet were compared with controls (100 ppm iron). Infant monkeys with high- or low-transcription rate MAOA polymorphisms were equally distributed between diet groups. Behavioral responses to a series of structured experiences were recorded during a 25-h separation of the infants from their mothers. Results: Infant monkeys with low-transcription MAOA polymorphisms more clearly demonstrated the following ID effects suggested in earlier studies: a 4% smaller head circumference, a 39% lower cortisol response to social separation, a 129% longer engagement with novel visual stimuli, and 33% lesser withdrawal in response to a human intruder. The high MAOA genotype ID monkeys demonstrated other ID effects: less withdrawal and emotionality after social separation and lower "fearful" ratings. Conclusion: MAOA × ID interactions support the role of monoamine neurotransmitters in prenatal ID effects in rhesus monkeys and the potential involvement of common human polymorphisms in determining the pattern of neurobehavioral effects produced by inadequate prenatal nutrition. © 2015 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Background Quantitative genetic analysis of basic mouse behaviors is a powerful tool to identify novel genetic phenotypes contributing to neurobehavioral disorders. Here, we analyzed genetic contributions to single-trial, long-term social and nonsocial recognition and subsequently studied the functional impact of an identified candidate gene on behavioral development. Methods Genetic mapping of single-trial social recognition was performed in chromosome substitution strains, a sophisticated tool for detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL) of complex traits. Follow-up occurred by generating and testing knockout (KO) mice of a selected QTL candidate gene. Functional characterization of these mice was performed through behavioral and neurological assessments across developmental stages and analyses of gene expression and brain morphology. Results Chromosome substitution strain 14 mapping studies revealed an overlapping QTL related to long-term social and object recognition harboring Pcdh9, a cell-adhesion gene previously associated with autism spectrum disorder. Specific long-term social and object recognition deficits were confirmed in homozygous (KO) Pcdh9-deficient mice, while heterozygous mice only showed long-term social recognition impairment. The recognition deficits in KO mice were not associated with alterations in perception, multi-trial discrimination learning, sociability, behavioral flexibility, or fear memory. Rather, KO mice showed additional impairments in sensorimotor development reflected by early touch-evoked biting, rotarod performance, and sensory gating deficits. This profile emerged with structural changes in deep layers of sensory cortices, where Pcdh9 is selectively expressed. Conclusions This behavior-to-gene study implicates Pcdh9 in cognitive functions required for long-term social and nonsocial recognition. This role is supported by the involvement of Pcdh9 in sensory cortex development and sensorimotor phenotypes. © 2015 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract={Few species of reptant decapod crustaceans thrive in the cold-stenothermal waters of the Southern Ocean. However, abundant populations of a new species of anomuran crab, Kiwa tyleri, occur at hydrothermal vent fields on the East Scotia Ridge. As a result of local thermal conditions at the vents, these crabs are not restricted by the physiological limits that otherwise exclude reptant decapods south of the polar front. We reveal the adult life history of this species by piecing together variation in microdistribution, body size frequency, sex ratio, and ovarian and embryonic development, which indicates a pattern in the distribution of female Kiwaidae in relation to their reproductive development. High-density 'Kiwa' assemblages observed in close proximity to sources of vent fluids are constrained by the thermal limit of elevated temperatures and the availability of resources for chemosynthetic nutrition. Although adult Kiwaidae depend on epibiotic chemosynthetic bacteria for nutrition, females move offsite after extrusion of their eggs to protect brooding embryos from the chemically harsh, thermally fluctuating vent environment. Consequently, brooding females in the periphery of the vent field are in turn restricted by low-temperature physiological boundaries of the deep-water Southern Ocean environment. Females have a high reproductive investment in few, large, yolky eggs, facilitating full lecithotrophy, with the release of larvae prolonged, and asynchronous. After embryos are released, larvae are reliant on locating isolated active areas of hydrothermal flow in order to settle and survive as chemosynthetic adults. Where the cold water restricts the ability of all adult stages to migrate over long distances, these low temperatures may facilitate the larvae in the location of vent sites by extending the larval development period through hypometabolism. These differential life-history adaptations to contrasting thermal environments lead to a disjunct life history among males and females of K. tyleri, which is key to their success in the Southern Ocean vent environment. We highlight the complexity in understanding the importance of life-history biology, in combination with environmental, ecological and physiological factors contributing to the overall global distribution of vent-endemic species. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={A striking feature of human decision making is the fourfold pattern of risk attitudes, involving risk-averse behavior in situations of unlikely losses and likely gains, but risk-seeking behavior in response to likely losses and unlikely gains. Current theories to explain this pattern assume particular psychological processes to reproduce empirical observations, but do not address whether it is adaptive for the decision maker to respond to risk in this way. Here, drawing on insights from behavioral ecology, we build an evolutionary model of risk-sensitive behavior, to investigate whether particular types of environmental conditions could favor a fourfold pattern of risk attitudes. We consider an individual foraging in a changing environment, where energy is needed to prevent starvation and build up reserves for reproduction. The outcome, in terms of reproductive value (a rigorous measure of evolutionary success), of a one-off choice between a risky and a safe gain, or between a risky and a safe loss, determines the risk-sensitive behavior we should expect to see in this environment. Our results show that the fourfold pattern of risk attitudes may be adaptive in an environment in which conditions vary stochastically but are autocorrelated in time. In such an environment the current options provide information about the likely environmental conditions in the future, which affect the optimal pattern of risk sensitivity. Our model predicts that risk preferences should be both path dependent and affected by the decision maker's current state. © 2015 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a cytokine classically linked with anti-inflammatory and protective functions in the central nervous system (CNS) in different neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory conditions. In order to study the specific role of local CNS produced IL-10, we have created a new transgenic mouse line with astrocyte-targeted production of IL-10 (GFAP-IL10Tg). In the present study, the effects of local CNS IL-10 production on microglia, astrocytes and neuronal connectivity under basal conditions were investigated using immunohistochemistry, molecular biology techniques, electrophysiology and behavioural studies. Our results showed that, in GFAP-IL10Tg animals, microglia displayed an increase in density and a specific activated phenotype characterised by morphological changes in specific areas of the brain including the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum that correlated with the level of transgene expressed IL-10 mRNA. Distinctively, in the hippocampus, microglial cells adopted an elongated morphology following the same direction as the dendrites of pyramidal neurons. Moreover, this IL-10-induced microglial phenotype showed increased expression of certain molecules including Iba1, CD11b, CD16/32 and F4/80 markers, "de novo" expression of CD150 and no detectable levels of either CD206 or MHCII. To evaluate whether this specific activated microglial phenotype was associated with changes in neuronal activity, the electrophysiological properties of pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus (CA3-CA1) were analysed in vivo. We found a lower excitability of the CA3-CA1 synapses and absence of long-term potentiation (LTP) in GFAP-IL10Tg mice. This study is the first description of a transgenic mouse with astrocyte-targeted production of the cytokine IL-10. The findings indicate that IL-10 induces a specific activated microglial phenotype concomitant with changes in hippocampal LTP responses. This transgenic animal will be a very useful tool to study IL-10 functions in the CNS, not only under basal conditions, but also after different experimental lesions or induced diseases. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Throughout the Hunger Games trilogy, the residents of the Capitol are associated with an array of physical, behavioral, and sartorial traits that have stereotypically been associated with homosexuality in general and gay men in particular. Although none of these characters is explicitly identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer/questioning (LGBTQ), they are routinely linked with queer forms of feyness, fussiness, and flamboyance. How are young adult readers to interpret these details? What social message or political stance is Suzanne Collins conveying by making some of the vainest, powerful, and heartless characters in her book also in dialogue with common conceptions about queerness? Does The Hunger Games include these elements to dismantle negative stereotypes about LGBTQ people, or does the book perpetuate and even affirm homophobic attitudes? In what ways do these details impact the presentation of Katniss, in many ways, as a genderqueer figure herself? In exploring these and other questions, I draw on Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's notion of “paranoid reading.” While Sedgwick's concept of paranoid reading is intended to address LGBTQ content exclusively, I make a case that it is also a productive lens for examining the Hunger Games trilogy as a whole. Using the portrayal of the Capitol residents as an entry point for the trilogy's engagement with nonheteronormative gender and sexuality, I examine how the series serves both to reinforce and to resist homophobia. In so doing, I demonstrate the risks as well as the rewards of finding what we fear seeing in any work of dystopian young adult (YA) fiction. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Background: Personality traits refer to habitual patterns of behaviour, thought and emotions, and have been shown to influence health professionals' career decisions, career development, job satisfaction and retention. There is an opportunity to better understand and support the career pathways of dietitians by exploring their personality traits. The two primary aspects of personality are: (i) temperament traits, which determine automatic emotional responses to experiences, and are generally stable over lifetime, and (ii) character traits, which reflect personal goals and values, and tend to develop with life experience. The present study explored the levels of temperament and character traits of dietitians, as well as their relationship to demographic variables. Methods: The study comprised a cross-sectional online survey of 346 Australian dietitians [95% female mean (SD) age 32 (10) years; mean (SD) time since graduation 7 (9) years]. Temperament and character traits were measured by the Temperament and Character Inventory. Key demographic variables were measured to describe career decisions and pathways of dietitians. Multivariate analyses of variance was used to investigate the relationship between demographic variables and personality traits. Results: Levels of several traits were significantly associated with gender, age and highest level of education. In comparison to the general population, the dietitians displayed average levels of Novelty Seeking; high levels of Harm Avoidance, Reward Dependence, Persistence, Self-Directedness and Cooperativeness; and low levels of Self-Transcendence. Conclusions: The dietitians in the present study displayed levels of personality traits that were similar to other health professionals, although they differed from the general population. These findings are the precursor to further work that may inform recruitment strategies and career counselling in dietetics. © 2014 The British Dietetic Association Ltd.},

Physical activity and diet choices were much better identified in a combined cluster (76%-87%) indicating that the decision about these two behaviors was affected by the same variables and the variables that could separate them may have been missing from the dataset.

abstract={The gut microbiota is intimately involved in numerous aspects of normal human physiology, including nutrition and metabolism, immunomodulation and behavior and stress response. Intestinal dysbiosis can be a contributing cause of many diseases, altering the function of both near and far organ systems. During pregnancy, the maternal body undergoes dramatic physiological changes to support the growth of fetus-placenta, while intestinal dysbiosis may directly or indirectly disturb the remodeling of physiological balance, leading to maternal maladaptation. Thus, intestinal dysbiosis, i.e., altered composition or metabolism of microbiota may adversely affect pregnancy outcome and lead to pregnancy complications via disrupting maternal adaptation. Indeed, pregnant women with potential maladaptations are at high risk of developing pregnancy disorders, which is increasingly observed in clinical cases. Here we discuss the hypothesis that intestinal dysbiosis may induce pregnancy complications via affecting maternal adaptation and the possible mechanistic pathways. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The purposes of this review are to assess the human exposure and human and experimental evidence for adverse effects of brominated flame-retardants (BFRs) with specific focus on intake from seafood. The leakage of BFRs from consumer products leads to exposure of humans from fetal life to adulthood. Fish and fish products contain the highest levels of BFRs and dominate the dietary intake of frequent fish eaters in Europe, while meat, followed by seafood and dairy products accounted for the highest US dietary intake. House dust is also reported as an important source of exposure for children as well as adults. The levels of BFRs in the general North American populations are higher than those in Europe and Japan and the highest levels are detected in infants and toddlers. The daily intake via breast milk exceeds the RfD in 10% of US infants.BFRs including PBDEs, HBCDs and TBBP-A have induced endocrine-, reproductive- and behavior effects in laboratory animals. Furthermore, recent human epidemiological data demonstrated association between exposure to BFRs and similar adverse effects as observed in animal studies.Fish including farmed fish and crude fish oil for human consumption may contain substantial levels of BFRs and infants and toddlers consuming these products on a daily basis may exceed the tolerable daily intake suggesting that fish and fish oil alone represent a risk to human health. This intake comes in addition to exposure from other sources (breast milk, other food, house dust). Because potential harmful concentrations of BFRs and other toxicants occur in fish and fish products, research on a wider range of products is warranted, to assess health hazard related to the contamination of fish and fish products for human consumption. © 2014.},

abstract={Physical inactivity and obesity are common problems among cancer survivors. Physical inactivity and obesity are risk factors for several forms of cancer, and weight gain and declines in physical activity often occur after a cancer diagnosis and during treatment. Low physical activity has been shown to lead to poor outcomes in breast and colon cancer survivors, and exercise interventions for survivors improve physical functioning and quality of life in several domains. Some evidence suggests that weight changes in breast cancer survivors may affect disease-free survival, but the evidence is conflicting on this point. Obesity can decrease cancer survivors’ quality of life, as well as increase their risks for comorbid health problems. The American Cancer Society has recently published nutrition, physical activity, and weight management recommendations for cancer survivors. Survivorship care should include giving survivors access to this information. In addition, encouraging survivors to adopt evidence-based behavioral strategies such as setting goals, monitoring themselves, changing their environment, and seeking social support can facilitate healthful behavior changes. © The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center 2015.},

The purpose of this review is to describe the nutritional needs of adolescents participating in sport and highlight the potential for nutritional risk. Endorsed by professional organizations, our recommendations emphasize a balanced eating pattern that includes a wide variety of fresh, minimally processed whole foods. Our approach is to empower and teach adolescents to take responsibility for planning, preparing, and providing themselves consistent access to foods and fluids that deliver nutrients needed for proper fueling and recovery.

abstract={Entre Familia: Reflejos de Salud was a successful family-based randomized controlled trial designed to improve dietary behaviors and intake among U.S. Latino families, specifically fruit and vegetable intake. The novel intervention design merged a community health worker (promotora) model with an entertainment-education component. This process evaluation examined intervention implementation and assessed relationships between implementation factors and dietary change. Participants included 180 mothers randomized to an intervention condition. Process evaluation measures were obtained from participant interviews and promotora notes and included fidelity, dose delivered (i.e., minutes of promotora in-person contact with families, number of promotora home visits), and dose received (i.e., participant use of and satisfaction with intervention materials). Outcome variables included changes in vegetable intake and the use of behavioral strategies to increase dietary fiber and decrease dietary fat intake. Participant satisfaction was high, and fidelity was achieved; 87.5% of families received the planned number of promotora home visits. In the multivariable model, satisfaction with intervention materials predicted more frequent use of strategies to increase dietary fiber (p ≤.01). Trends suggested that keeping families in the prescribed intervention timeline and obtaining support from other social network members through sharing of program materials may improve changes. Study findings elucidate the relationship between specific intervention processes and dietary changes. © 2015, © 2015 Society for Public Health Education.},

abstract={Assessment of the current status of marine ecosystems is necessary for the sustainable utilization of ecosystem services through fisheries and other human activities under changing environmental conditions. Understanding of historical changes in marine ecosystems can help us to assess their current status. In this study, we analyzed Japanese commercial fishery catch data and scientific survey data of the diet of northern fur seal (. Callorhinus ursinus, NFS) to investigate potential long-term ecosystem changes in the western North Pacific Ocean off northeastern Japan over the past 60 years. Total commercial catches experienced peaks around 1960 and during the 1980s, decreasing to low levels around 1970 and after 1990. Catches were substantively impacted by the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in 2011. Species composition of the commercial catch changed over time, resulting in changes in the mean trophic level (MTL) of the catches. Trends in observed commercial catches were affected by many factors, including species population fluctuations potentially related to large-scale environmental shifts, migration and distribution patterns of species related to local oceanography, changes in fishing technology, and the introduction of fishery management frameworks. The composition of NFS diet also changed over time: although overall changes were small, MTL derived from NFS stomach contents declined from the early 1970s to the late 1980s. This fall in the MTL of the diet of NFS is suggestive of a shift in pelagic fish fauna from a "mackerel-dominant regime" to a "sardine-dominant regime". Inconsistencies between changes in species composition and MTLs of the commercial catch and NFS diet resulted from differences in commercial fishing targeting and NFS foraging behavior strategies. Although commercial catch is a valuable source of information for investigating historical changes in fisheries, biological resources, and ecosystems, catch data should be interpreted carefully and other relevant information available should also be considered. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Impulsivity and sensation seeking are stimulus-oriented traits. Because they differ in degree of intention and planning, they may have distinct neurophysiological mechanisms. Impulsivity is prominent in bipolar disorder, and may be related to pre-attentional information filtering and stimulus-orientation. We investigated specificity of relationships between impulsivity and sensitivity to stimulus intensity in bipolar disorder and controls, using intensity-sensitivity of auditory evoked potentials. Seventy-six subjects (37 healthy controls, 39 with bipolar disorder) were administered an intensity-sensitivity paradigm. Additional measures included Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) and Eysenck Impulsivity and Venturesomeness scores. State-dependent rapid-response impulsivity was measured using the Immediate Memory Task. Intensity-sensitivities of the auditory evoked P1N1, N1P2, P1, N1, and P2 potentials were assessed as the slope of amplitude relative to loudness. Analyses used general linear models (GLM) with impulsivity-related measures as dependent variables and age, gender, education, and diagnosis as dependent variables. BIS-11 total, motor, and attentional impulsivity scores correlated positively with pre-attentional N1 and P1N1 intensity-sensitivity slopes in bipolar disorder, but not in controls. BIS-11 nonplanning and Eysenck Venturesomeness scores did not correlate with intensity-sensitivity. Intensity-sensitivity slopes did not correlate with rapid-response impulsivity. Correlations between N1 or P1N1 slopes and BIS-11 scores in bipolar disorder were not affected by age, education, WAIS, treatment, symptoms, or gender. Trait impulsivity in bipolar disorder may be related to poorly modulated stimulus-driven late pre-attentional responses to stimuli, potentially resulting in exaggerated responses to intense stimuli even before conscious awareness. Components of trait impulsivity are physiologically heterogenous relative to intensity-sensitivity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Behavioral inhibition (BI) is an early-appearing temperament characterized by strong reactions to novelty. BI shows a good deal of stability over childhood and significantly increases the risk for later diagnosis of social anxiety disorder (SAD). Despite these general patterns, many children with high BI do not go on to develop clinical, or even subclinical, anxiety problems. Therefore, understanding the cognitive and neural bases of individual differences in developmental risk and resilience is of great importance. The present review is focused on the relation of BI to two types of information processing: automatic (novelty detection, attention biases to threat, and incentive processing) and controlled (attention shifting and inhibitory control). We propose three hypothetical models (Top-Down Model of Control; Risk Potentiation Model of Control; and Overgeneralized Control Model) linking these processes to variability in developmental outcomes for BI children. We argue that early BI is associated with an early bias to quickly and preferentially process information associated with motivationally salient cues. When this bias is strong and stable across development, the risk for SAD is increased. Later in development, children with a history of BI tend to display normative levels of performance on controlled attention tasks, but they demonstrate exaggerated neural responses in order to do so, which may further potentiate risk for anxiety-related problems. We conclude by discussing the reviewed studies with reference to the hypothetical models and make suggestions regarding future research and implications for treatment.},

abstract={Systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease and affects worldwide population. Current environment including life style coupled with genetic programming have been attributed to the rising incidence of hypertension. Besides, environmental conditions during perinatal development such as maternal malnutrition can program changes in the integration among renal, neural, and endocrine system leading to hypertension. This phenomenon is termed phenotypic plasticity and refers to the adjustment of a phenotype in response to environmental stimuli without genetic change, following a novel or unusual input during development. Human and animal studies indicate that fetal exposure to an adverse maternal environment may alter the renal morphology and physiology that contribute to the development of hypertension. Recently, it has been shown that the maternal protein restriction alter the central control of SAH by a mechanism that include respiratory dysfunction and enhanced sympathetic-respiratory coupling at early life, which may contribute to adult hypertension. This review will address the new insights on the maternal diet induced-hypertension that include the potential role of the phenotypic plasticity, specifically the perinatal protein malnutrition, and sympathetic-respiratory overactivity. © 2015 Costa-Silva, de Brito-Alves, Barros, Nogueira, Paulino-Silva, de Oliveira-Lira, Nobre, Fragoso and Leandro.},

abstract={Behavioural innovation and morphological adaptation are intrinsically linked but their relationship is often poorly understood. In nematodes, a huge diversity of feeding morphologies and behaviours can be observed to meet their distinctive dietary and environmental demands. Pristionchus and their relatives show varied feeding activities, both consuming bacteria and also predating other nematodes. In addition, Pristionchus nematodes display dimorphic mouth structures triggered by an irreversible developmental switch, which generates a narrower mouthed form with a single tooth and a wider mouthed form with an additional tooth. However, little is known about the specific predatory adaptations of these mouth forms or the associated mechanisms and behaviours. Through a mechanistic analysis of predation behaviours, in particular in the model organism Pristionchus pacificus, we reveal multifaceted feeding modes characterised by dynamic rhythmic switching and tooth stimulation. This complex feeding mode switch is regulated by the neurotransmitter serotonin in a previously uncharacterised role, a process that appears conserved across several predatory nematode species. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of starvation, prey size and prey preference on P. pacificus predatory feeding kinetics, revealing predation to be a fundamental component of the P. pacificus feeding repertoire, thus providing an additional rich source of nutrition in addition to bacteria. Finally, we found that mouth form morphology also has a striking impact on predation, suppressing predatory behaviour in the narrow mouthed form. Our results therefore hint at the regulatory networks involved in controlling predatory feeding and underscore P. pacificus as a model for understanding the evolution of complex behaviours. © 2015.

abstract={A wide range of developmental, nutritional, environmental, and social factors affect the biological activities of epigenetic mechanisms. These factors change spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression in a variety of different ways and bring significant impacts to bear on development, physiology, and disease risk throughout the life course. Abundant evidence demonstrates that behavioral stressors and adverse nutritional conditions are particularly potent inducers of epigenetic changes and enhancers of chronic disease risks. Recent insights from both human clinical studies and research with model organisms further indicate that such experience-dependent changes to the epigenome can be transmitted through the germline across multiple generations, with important consequences for the heritability of both adaptive and maladaptive phenotypes. Epigenetics research thus offers many possibilities for developing informative biomarkers of acquired chronic disease risk and determining the effectiveness of preventive and therapeutic interventions. Moreover, the experience-sensitive nature of these disease risks raises important questions about societal and individual responsibilities for the prevention of ill-health and the promotion of well-being during development, across the life course and between generations. Better understanding of how epigenetic mechanisms regulate developmental plasticity and mediate the biological embedding of chronic disease risks is therefore likely to shed important new light on the nature of the pathophysiological mechanisms linking social and health inequalities, and will help to inform public policy initiatives in this area. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={The global pandemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes is often causally linked to changes in diet and lifestyle; namely increased intake of calorically dense foods and concomitant reductions in physical activity. Epidemiological studies in humans and controlled animal intervention studies have now shown that nutritional programming in early periods of life is a phenomenon that affects metabolic and physiological functions throughout life. This link is conceptualised as the developmental programming hypothesis whereby environmental influences during critical periods of developmental plasticity can elicit lifelong effects on the health and well-being of the offspring. The mechanisms by which early environmental insults can have long-term effects on offspring remain poorly defined. However there is evidence from intervention studies which indicate altered wiring of the hypothalamic circuits that regulate energy balance and epigenetic effects including altered DNA methylation of key adipokines including leptin. Studies that elucidate the mechanisms behind these associations will have a positive impact on the health of future populations and adopting a life course perspective will allow identification of phenotype and markers of risk earlier, with the possibility of nutritional and other lifestyle interventions that have obvious implications for prevention of non-communicable diseases. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Plants secrete extrafloral nectar (EFN) as an induced defense against herbivores. EFN contains not only carbohydrates and amino acids but also pathogenesis-related proteins and other protective enzymes, making EFN an exclusive reward. EFN secretion is commonly induced after wounding, likely owing to a jasmonic acid-induced cell wall invertase, and is limited by phloem sucrose availability: Both factors control EFN secretion according to the optimal defense hypothesis. Non-ant EFN consumers include parasitoids, wasps, spiders, mites, bugs, and predatory beetles. Little is known about the relevance of EFN to the nutrition of its consumers and, hence, to the structuring of arthropod communities. The mutualism can be established quickly among noncoevolved (e.g., invasive) species, indicating its easy assembly is due to ecological fitting. Therefore, increasing efforts are directed toward using EFN in biocontrol. However, documentation of the importance of EFN for the communities of plants and arthropods in natural, invasive, and agricultural ecosystems is still limited. © 2015 by Annual Reviews.

Salt-induced quiescent and recovery growth phases rely on modification of cell cycle activity, cell expansion, and cell wall extensibility. The period of initial growth arrest varies among different organs, leading to altered plant morphology.

abstract={Objectives Cross-species comparisons show that high extrinsic mortality favors the evolution of "faster" life histories. There is interest in applying this principle to human life history plasticity, based on the idea that psychosocial stressors that correlate with extrinsic mortality accelerate reproductive pace. Most prior studies have been conducted in settings in which psychosocial stressors co-occur with the maturation-accelerating influence of nutritional abundance. Materials and Methods We evaluate cues of local mortality (sibling death) or low parental investment (paternal instability; maternal absence) and energetic measures during development as predictors of life history scheduling among males (n-=-754) in a Philippine population with marginal developmental nutritional. Results Males who had more favorable nutritional status during childhood, as reflected in linear growth, skinfold thickness, and caloric intake, were more maturationally advanced in adolescence (all P-<-0.05). Taller stature and higher caloric intake during childhood also predicted earlier ages at first sex (both P-<-0.01), which persisted after controlling for the effect of nutrition on pubertal maturation. While psychosocial stressors did not predict accelerated maturation, males who as children grew up with an unstable paternal presence had sex earlier (P-<-0.05) and tended to become fathers sooner than those with a stable fatherly presence. Those who had a sibling die became fathers sooner than those who did not (P-<-0.05). Discussion Our findings point to important energetic constraints on the onset of reproductive maturity, while psychosocial stressors accelerate entry to parenthood, which may be comparatively more socially, rather than biologically, constrained. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Objective To present the conceptual foundations that explain how events occurring during intrauterine life may influence body development, emphasizing the interrelation between low birth weight and risk of obesity throughout life. Data sources Google Scholar, Library Scientific Electronic Online (SciELO), EBSCO, Scopus, and PubMed were the databases. "Catch-up growth", "life course health", "disease", "child", "development", "early life", "perinatal programming", "epigenetics", "breastfeeding", "small baby syndrome", "phenotype", "micronutrients", "maternal nutrition", "obesity", and "adolescence" were isolated or associated keywords for locating reviews and epidemiological, intervention and experimental studies published between 1934 and 2014, with complete texts in Portuguese and English. Duplicate articles, editorials and reviews were excluded, as well as approaches of diseases different from obesity. Data synthesis Within 47 selected articles among 538 eligible ones, the thrifty phenotype hypothesis, the epigenetic mechanisms and the development plasticity were identified as fundamental factors to explain the mechanisms involved in health and disease throughout life. They admit the possibility that both cardiometabolic events and obesity originate from intrauterine nutritional deficiency, which, associated with a food supply that is excessive to the metabolic needs of the organism in early life stages, causes endocrine changes. However, there may be phenotypic reprogramming for low birth weight newborns from adequate nutritional supply, thus overcoming a restrictive intrauterine environment. Therefore, catch-up growth may indicate recovery from intrauterine constraint, which is associated with short-term benefits or harms in adulthood. Conclusions Depending on the nutritional adequacy in the first years of life, developmental plasticity may lead to phenotype reprogramming and reduce the risk of obesity. © 2015 Sociedade de Pediatria de São Paulo.

abstract={G V Krishnarao (1914-1979), a Telugu poet, playwright, novelist, short-story writer, literary critic and translator, like many ancient Sanskrit play writers, borrowing an incident - Vȳasanishkramana, exit of Vȳasa from Kāsi - from Srinatha's Kāśī Khan{combining dot below}d{combining dot below}a and tweaking it in such a way that it reflects modernity in terms of 'dialectical materialism', wrote Bikshāpātra, a three-act Telugu playlet. It was translated into all the sixteen Indian languages and was broadcasted by All India Radio under its 'National Program of Drama'. An attempt is now made in this paper to trace how the playwright achieved universal validity for his dialectic interpretation of a purānic-incident to drive home the fact that even an aristocratic and the towering personality like Vȳasa could not escape the pangs of hunger - hunger for physical gratification and the hunger for truth, self-analysis, and ideation, all culminating into a reasoned exposition of the complex relationship between "infrastructure and superstructure spectrum" without of course, losing sight of Indian aesthetics. © 2015 GRK Murty.

abstract={Current policy and research around type 2 diabetes (T2D) interventions largely invoke a behavioral model. We suggest that activation of the physiologic stress response (PSR) from chronic exposure to stressors, low socioeconomic status (SES), severe mental health problems, or aggressive behavior increases the risk of T2D. This article is a comprehensive review of the literature on the link between T2D and psychosocial factors focusing on prospective studies of the risk for developing diabetes. The review found an increased risk for T2D in people: exposed to stressful working conditions or traumatic events; with depression; with personality traits or mental health problems that put them in conflict with others; of low SES, either currently or in childhood; and in racial/ethnic minority populations, independent of current SES. This review suggests that T2D prevention research would be more effective if (a) the PSR to psychosocial factors (especially social disparities) was recognized and (b) intervention programs evaluated reduction in social disparities as part of a comprehensive approach.

abstract={Maternal depression is a known risk factor for poor outcomes for children. Pathways to these poor outcomes relate to reduced maternal responsiveness or sensitivity to the child. Impaired responsiveness potentially impacts the feeding relationship and thus may be a risk factor for inappropriate feeding practices. The aim of this study was to examine the longitudinal relationships between self-reported maternal post-natal depressive symptoms at child age 4 months and feeding practices at child age 2 years in a community sample. Participants were Australian first-time mothers allocated to the control group of the NOURISH randomized controlled trial when infants were 4 months old. Complete data from 211 mothers (of 346 allocated) followed up when their children were 2 years of age (51% girls) were available for analysis. The relationship between Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score (child age 4 months) and child feeding practices (child age 2 years) was tested using hierarchical linear regression analysis adjusted for maternal and child characteristics. Higher EPDS score was associated with less responsive feeding practices at child age 2 years: greater pressure [β=0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.04-0.32, P=0.01], restriction (β=0.14, 95% CI: 0.001-0.28, P=0.05), instrumental (β=0.14, 95% CI: 0.005-0.27, P=0.04) and emotional (β=0.15, 95% CI: 0.01-0.29, P=0.03) feeding practices (ΔR2 values: 0.02-0.03, P<0.05). This study provides evidence for the proposed link between maternal post-natal depressive symptoms and lower responsiveness in child feeding. These findings suggest that the provision of support to mothers experiencing some levels of depressive symptomatology in the early post-natal period may improve responsiveness in the child feeding relationship. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Objectives Subjective halitosis is a growing concern in the fields of dentistry and psychology. This study was designed to determine the association between subjective halitosis and contributing psychological factors. Methods Data for this cross-sectional study were gathered from 4,763 participants who had answered questions on subjective halitosis and psychological factors (depression, anxiety, stress and personality traits) in the study on the epidemiology of psychological, alimentary health and nutrition (SEPAHAN). Binary logistic regression was used for data analysis. Result The mean age of all subjects was 36.58 years; and the majority of subjects were female (55.8%), married (81.2%) and graduates (57.2%). The prevalence of subjective halitosis was 52.8%. The majority of subjects with the complaint of subjective halitosis were married (P < 0.001) and young (P = 0.07). Participants with subjective halitosis were significantly more anxious [odds ratio (OR) = 1.76, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.38-2.24], stressed (OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.17-1.71) and depressed (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.09-1.57). Among personality traits, neuroticism was a risk factor (tertile 1 vs. tertile 2: OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.09-1.51; and tertile 1 vs. tertile 3: OR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.43-2.13) and conscientiousness was revealed to be a protective factor (tertile 1 vs. tertile 2: OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70-0.98; and tertile 1 vs. tertile 3: OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.53-0.80). Conclusion It seems that psychological factors, such as anxiety, depression and stress, as well as some personality traits, can be considered as risk factors for subjective halitosis. Multidisciplinary efforts by dental and psychological professionals must be considered to address this problem. © 2015 FDI World Dental Federation.},

abstract={Background Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is theorized to have temperamental precursors early in life. These are difficult to identify because many core features of ADHD, such as breakdowns in executive function and self-control, involve psychological and neural systems that are too immature to reliably show dysfunction in early life. ADHD also involves emotional dysregulation, and these temperamental features appear earlier as well. Here, we report a first attempt to utilize indices of emotional regulation to identify ADHD-related liability in infancy. Methods Fifty women were recruited in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, with overselection for high parental ADHD symptoms. Measures of maternal body mass index, nutrition, substance use, stress, and mood were examined during pregnancy as potential confounds. Offspring were evaluated at 6 months of age using LABTAB procedures designed to elicit fear, anger, and regulatory behavior. Mothers completed the Infant Behavior Questionnaire about their child's temperament. Results After control for associated covariates, including maternal depression and prenatal stress, family history of ADHD was associated with measures of anger/irritability, including infant negative vocalizations during the arm restraint task (p =.004), and maternal ratings of infant distress to limitations (p =.036). In the regulation domain, familial ADHD was associated with less parent-oriented attention seeking during the still face procedure (p <.001), but this was not echoed in the maternal ratings of recovery from distress. Conclusions Affective response at 6 months of age may identify infants with familial history of ADHD, providing an early indicator of ADHD liability. These preliminary results provide a foundation for further studies and will be amplified by enlarging this cohort and following participants longitudinally to evaluate ADHD outcomes. © 2015 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.},

abstract={Eating disorders, especially anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa have been classically described in young females in Western population. Recent research shows that they are also seen in developing countries including India. The classification of eating disorders has been expanded to include recently described conditions like binge eating disorder. Eating disorders have a multifactorial etiology. Genetic factor appear to play a major role. Recent advances in neurobiology have improved our understanding of these conditions and may possibly help us develop more effective treatments in future. Premorbid personality appears to play an important role, with differential predisposition for individual disorders. The role of cultural factors in the etiology of these conditions is debated. Culture may have a pathoplastic effect leading to non-conforming presentations like the non fat-phobic form of anorexia nervosa, which are commonly reported in developing countries. With rapid cultural transformation, the classical forms of these conditions are being described throughout the world. Diagnostic criteria have been modified to accommodate for these myriad presentations. Treatment of eating disorders can be quite challenging, given the dearth of established treatments and poor motivation/ insight in these conditions. Nutritional rehabilitation and psychotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment, while pharmacotherapy may be helpful in specific situations.},

abstract={Purpose – School connectedness is a well-established protective factor for young people’s physical, mental, and social health. The purpose of this paper is to explore the promotion of school connectedness through the practice of shared lunches within a secondary school context in New Zealand. Design/methodology/approach – An ethnographic methodology was used to explore in-depth the mechanisms by which food practices included indicators of school connectedness, and used interviews and observations with teachers and 16-18-year-old students in a New Zealand secondary school. Findings – The results describe six key mechanisms by which shared lunches fostered school connectedness: showing common humanity, creating an informal setting, encouraging sharing, enabling inclusive participation, demonstrating sacrifice for the communal good, and facilitating experiences of diversity. These mechanisms contributed to increased social interactions in which people got to know each other better and were able to gain insight into others’ personalities. This allowed for opportunities to establish and strengthen social relationships, and contributed to indicators of connectedness. Research limitations/implications – The study is exploratory with findings reported from one school. Further research in other contexts on the value of shared lunches for building school connectedness is required. Originality/value – Shared lunches, as part of an overall strategy to develop a well-connected school community, are adaptable and can fit into a multitude of situations to meet different needs. The findings of this study contribute to understanding the mechanisms by which shared lunches can affect indicators of school connectedness. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Tackling increasing rates of obesity is likely to be a defining feature of health care over the next several decades. Adult obesity is a persistent and treatment-resistant problem. Consequently, an emerging theme in the literature is to commence prevention efforts earlier in the developmental time course. This view is based primarily on epidemiological data demonstrating a link between traits manifesting early during development and increased obesity risk in adulthood. Physical activity is a perennial factor in discussions of obesity prevention. However, the optimal timing and type of physical activity interventions to commence remains unclear. Critical developmental windows of plasticity may afford time-limited opportunities to shape body composition across the life course; however, physical activity has not been explicitly considered in these discussions. Although animal models suggest that physical activity commenced earlier in development has differential effects on obesity onset compared to physical activity commenced in adulthood, human research is lacking. In this conceptual review, we consider physical activity during critical developmental periods as a way to mitigate obesity risk later in life. © 2015 International Association for the Study of Obesity.},

abstract={Background/aim: Malnutrition is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). In this study, we aimed to screen for malnutrition and geriatric syndromes and seek their associations in patients with AD. Materials and methods: The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), Katz Activities of Daily Living (ADL), and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) tests were applied. Mean daily oral fluid intake was assessed according to patients’ and relatives’ declarations. Results: Seventy-six patients with a mean age of 79 ± 7.4 years were included. Most of the patients had mild or moderate dementia. Malnutrition was associated with increased rates of hospitalization and falls, dysphagia, insomnia, agitation, delusions, hallucinations, immobility, and incontinence. A daily fluid intake of <1100 mL was associated with malnutrition risk. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed independent correlations of lower MNA score with lower ADL score, lower daily oral fluid intake, lower MMSE score, and female sex. Conclusion: Dependency, inadequate fluid intake, advanced dementia stage, and female sex were independently associated with malnutrition. Malnutrition also seemed to be associated with sleep disturbances, psychological problems, immobility, falls, and increased hospitalization risk in these patients. Daily oral fluid intake may be a practical tool in the screening of malnutrition. © TÜBİTAK.},

abstract={Objectives A significant proportion of geriatric patients experience suboptimal outcomes following episodes of emergency department (ED) care. Risk stratification screening instruments exist to distinguish vulnerable subsets, but their prognostic accuracy varies. This systematic review quantifies the prognostic accuracy of individual risk factors and ED-validated screening instruments to distinguish patients more or less likely to experience short-term adverse outcomes like unanticipated ED returns, hospital readmissions, functional decline, or death. Methods A medical librarian and two emergency physicians conducted a medical literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov using numerous combinations of search terms, including emergency medical services, risk stratification, geriatric, and multiple related MeSH terms in hundreds of combinations. Two authors hand-searched relevant specialty society research abstracts. Two physicians independently reviewed all abstracts and used the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies instrument to assess individual study quality. When two or more qualitatively similar studies were identified, meta-analysis was conducted using Meta-DiSc software. Primary outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) for predictors of adverse outcomes at 1 to 12 months after the ED encounters. A hypothetical test-treatment threshold analysis was constructed based on the meta-analytic summary estimate of prognostic accuracy for one outcome. Results A total of 7,940 unique citations were identified yielding 34 studies for inclusion in this systematic review. Studies were significantly heterogeneous in terms of country, outcomes assessed, and the timing of post-ED outcome assessments. All studies occurred in ED settings and none used published clinical decision rule derivation methodology. Individual risk factors assessed included dementia, delirium, age, dependency, malnutrition, pressure sore risk, and self-rated health. None of these risk factors significantly increased the risk of adverse outcome (LR+ range = 0.78 to 2.84). The absence of dependency reduces the risk of 1-year mortality (LR- = 0.27) and nursing home placement (LR- = 0.27). Five constructs of frailty were evaluated, but none increased or decreased the risk of adverse outcome. Three instruments were evaluated in the meta-analysis: Identification of Seniors at Risk, Triage Risk Screening Tool, and Variables Indicative of Placement Risk. None of these instruments significantly increased (LR+ range for various outcomes = 0.98 to 1.40) or decreased (LR- range = 0.53 to 1.11) the risk of adverse outcomes. The test threshold for 3-month functional decline based on the most accurate instrument was 42%, and the treatment threshold was 61%. Conclusions Risk stratification of geriatric adults following ED care is limited by the lack of pragmatic, accurate, and reliable instruments. Although absence of dependency reduces the risk of 1-year mortality, no individual risk factor, frailty construct, or risk assessment instrument accurately predicts risk of adverse outcomes in older ED patients. Existing instruments designed to risk stratify older ED patients do not accurately distinguish high- or low-risk subsets. Clinicians, educators, and policy-makers should not use these instruments as valid predictors of post-ED adverse outcomes. Future research to derive and validate feasible ED instruments to distinguish vulnerable elders should employ published decision instrument methods and examine the contributions of alternative variables, such as health literacy and dementia, which often remain clinically occult. © 2014 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.},

abstract={Articles related to the assessment and management of frailty in Primary Health Care, published between 2009 and 2011, have been reviewed in order to update a prior review conducted by the authors. We define "frail elderly" as the elderly person suffering a decrease in physiological reserves and an increased risk of decline and deterioration in a situation of greater vulnerability to external adverse conditions. As a result the person has a higher probability of presenting adverse health events (hospitalization, institutionalization, death, falls) and loss of function, disability or dependency. The most common methods used in detecting frail elderly in Primary Health Care focus on: conditions or factors that give a greater probability of suffering adverse health events and deterioration (very aged, hospitalization, falls, comorbidity, social adversity, polypharmacy), early loss of functionality, limited physical activity (e.g., using the "gait speed" test), specific phenotype. Investigation is progressing on the identification of biomarkers, with the final result being sarcopenia. There are several options for the management of fragility: physical activity, nutritional status, adequate approach and clinical disease and medication review. Other specific strategies include a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), inter-professional coordination, social support, and decrease stressors such as hospitalization.

abstract={Introduction: the studies on healthy lifestyles and habits cover various human life dimensions. Objective: to identify lifestyles of school adolescents living in the urban area of Villamaria municipality in Caldas, Colombia. Methods: descriptive and cross-sectional study carried out with FANTASTIC instrument which is the Chilean version adapted to the study population that includes 812 students from public and private educational centers. This instrument evaluates 10 lifestyle dimensions: associativity, physical activity, nutrition, toxicity, alcohol consumption, sleep and stress, type of personality and activities, selfimage, health and sexuality control and order. Results: the age mean was 12.5 years±1.16 years and 41.6 % of the group was females. In the analyzed dimensions, the highest mean was reached by type of personality and activities (5.67±1.36) whereas the lowest went to associativity and physical activity (2.26±1.2). Standard deviation ranged 0.83 to 1.36. There were differences in lifestyles, the more age the more tendency to risk and men reported better self-assessment (p= 0.000). Conclusions: lifestyles of the studied adolescents are assessed as adequate. It is necessary to carry out a comprehensive work on the protective factors rather than on risk factors at early stages, mainly affectivity as an avoided dimension in the field of health at adolescence. © 2015 Editorial Ciencias Medicas.

abstract={Urban areas are becoming increasingly important for wildlife as diminishing natural habitats no longer represent a suitable environment for many species. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are nowadays common in many cities worldwide, and in recent years they have colonized urban areas in Estonia. We used a public web-based questionnaire approach to evaluate the distribution and behaviour of Estonian urban foxes, to detect related problems and to assess health risks to humans and domestic animals. In total, 1205 responses were collected throughout the country. Foxes have colonized the majority of Estonian towns (33 out of 47) in a relatively short period of time, and have already established breeding dens in several towns. Despite their recent arrival, the behaviour of Estonian urban foxes is similar to that reported in longer-established urban fox populations: they are mostly active during night-time, often visit city centres and some also have dens in such locations. Certain characteristics of urban foxes serve as a basis for conflict with humans: foxes have entered houses and attacked domestic animals, killing cats and poultry. About 8% of reported foxes exhibited symptoms of sarcoptic mange, a disease that also infects domestic animals, especially dogs. The proportion of mange-infected foxes was higher in large urban areas. In addition to mange, a substantial fraction of red foxes in Estonia are known to be infected with the life-threatening tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis, the causative agent of alveolar echinococcosis. Therefore, urban foxes may represent a source of serious infectious disease for pets and humans.Copyright: © 2014 Plumer et al.},

Eating disorder groups reported greater risk exposure than non-psychiatric controls. AN and BED differed on premorbid personality/behavioral problems, childhood obesity, and family overeating. Risk factors for BN were shared with AN and BED. Dieting was the most common onset symptom in AN, whereas binge eating was most common in BN and BED. Migration between AN and BED was rare, but more frequent between AN and BN and between BN and BED. AN and BED have distinct risk factors and onset patterns, while BN shares similar risk factors and onset patterns with both AN and BED.

abstract={Objective: The impact of dietary factors on tinnitus has received limited research attention, despite being a considerable concern among people with tinnitus and clinicians. The objective was to examine the link between dietary factors and presence and severity of tinnitus.
Design: This study used the UK Biobank resource, a large cross-sectional study of adults aged 40-69. 171,722 eligible participants were asked questions specific to tinnitus (defined as noises such as ringing or buzzing in the head or ears). Dietary factors included portions of fruit and vegetables per day, weekly fish consumption (oily and non-oily), bread type, cups of caffeinated coffee per day, and avoidance of dairy, eggs, wheat and sugar. We controlled for lifestyle, noise exposure, hearing, personality and comorbidity factors.
Results: Persistent tinnitus, defined as present at least a lot of the time, was elevated with increased: (i) fruit/vegetable intake (OR51.01 per portion/day), (ii) bread (wholemeal/wholegrain, OR51.07; other bread, 1.20) and (iii) dairy avoidance (OR51.27). Persistent tinnitus was reduced with: (i) fish consumption (non-oily, OR50.91; oily, 0.95), (ii) egg avoidance (OR50.87) and (iii) caffeinated coffee consumption (OR50.99 per cup/day). Reports of ''bothersome'' tinnitus (moderate-severe handicap) increased with wholemeal/wholegrain bread intake (OR50.86). Reports of less frequent transient tinnitus increased with dairy avoidance (OR51.18) and decreased with caffeinated coffee (OR50.98 per cup/ day) and brown bread (OR50.94).
Conclusions: This is the first population study to report the association between dietary factors and tinnitus. Although individually dietary associations are mostly modest, particular changes in diet, such as switching between foodstuffs, may result in stronger associations. These findings offer insights into possible dietary associations with tinnitus, and this may be useful when discussing management options in combination with other lifestyle changes and therapies. © 2014 McCormack et al.},

abstract={Objectives: Functional abdominal pain (FAP) in youth is associated with substantial impairment in functioning, and prior research has shown that overprotective parent responses can heighten impairment. Little is known about how a range of parental behaviors (overprotection, minimizing, and/or encouragement) in response to their child's pain interact with child coping characteristics (eg, catastrophizing) to influence functioning in youth with FAP. In this study, it was hypothesized that the relation between parenting factors and child disability would be mediated by children's levels of maladaptive coping (ie, pain catastrophizing).
Methods: Seventy-five patients with FAP presenting to a pediatric pain clinic and their caregivers participated in the study. Youth completed measures of pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale), pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale), and disability (Functional Disability Inventory). Caregivers completed measures of parent pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale), and parent responses to child pain behaviors (Adult Responses to Child Symptoms: Protection, Minimizing, and Encouragement/Monitoring subscales).
Results: Increased functional disability was significantly related to higher child pain intensity, increased child and parent pain catastrophizing, and higher levels of encouragement/monitoring and protection. Parent minimization was not related to disability. Child pain catastrophizing fully mediated the relation between parent encouragement/monitoring and disability and partially mediated the relation between parent protectiveness and disability.
Conclusions: The impact of parenting behaviors in response to FAP on child disability is determined, in part, by the child's coping style. Findings highlight a more nuanced understanding of the parent-child interaction in determining pain-related disability levels, which should be taken into consideration in assessing and treating youth with FAP.

abstract={The subthalamic nucleus (STN)belongs to the basal ganglia and is the current target for the surgical treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's Disease (PD)and obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD), but also a proposed site for the treatment of addiction. It is therefore very important to understand its functions in order to anticipate and prevent possible side-effects in the patients. Although the involvement of the STN is well documented in motor, cognitive and motivational processes, less is known regarding emotional processes. Here we have investigated the direct consequences of STN inactivation by excitotoxic lesions on emotional processing and reinforcement in the rat. We have used various behavioral procedures to assess affect for neutral, positive and negative reinforcers in STN lesioned rats. STN lesions reduced affective responses for positive (sweet solutions)and negative (electric foot shock, Lithium Chloride-induced sickness)reinforcers while they had no effect on responses for a more neutral reinforcer (novelty induced place preference (NIPP)). Furthermore, when given the choice between saccharine, a sweet but non caloric solution, and glucose, a more bland but caloric solution, in contrast to sham animals that preferred saccharine, STN lesioned animals preferred glucose over saccharine. Taken altogether these results reveal that STN plays a critical role in emotional processing. These results, in line with some clinical observations in PD patients subjected to STN surgery, suggest possible emotional side-effects of treatments targeting the STN. They also suggest that the increased motivation for sucrose previously reported cannot be due to increased pleasure, but could be responsible for the decreased motivation for cocaine reported after STN inactivation. © 2014 Pelloux, Meffre, Giorla and Baunez.},

abstract={Folic acid antioxidants were successfully intercalated into layered double hydroxides (LDH) nanoparticles according to a previous method with minor modification. The resultant folic acid-LDH constructs were then characterized by X-ray powder diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The in vitro antioxidant activities, cytotoxicity effect, and in vivo anti-fatigue were examined by a series of assays. The results showed that folic acid-LDH antioxidant system can scavenge 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and hydroxyl free radicals and chelate pro-oxidative Cu2+. The in vitro cytotoxicity assays indicated that folic acid-LDH antioxidant system had no signifcant cytotoxic effect or obvious toxicity to normal cells. It also prolonged the forced swimming time of the mice by 32% and 51% compared to folic acid and control groups, respectively. It had an obvious effect on decreasing the blood urea nitrogen and blood lactic acid, while increasing muscle and hepatic glycogen levels. Therefore, folic acid-LDH might be used as a novel antioxidant and antifatigue nutritional supplement. © 2014 Qin et al.},

abstract={Mixed mammal species groups are common in East African savannah ecosystems. Yet, it is largely unknown if co-occurrences of large mammals result from random processes or social preferences and if interspecific associations are consistent across ecosystems and seasons. Because species may exchange important information and services, understanding patterns and drivers of heterospecific interactions is crucial for advancing animal and community ecology. We recorded 5403 single and multi-species clusters in the Serengeti-Ngorongoro and Tarangire-Manyara ecosystems during dry and wet seasons and used social network analyses to detect patterns of species associations. We found statistically significant associations between multiple species and association patterns differed spatially and seasonally. Consistently, wildebeest and zebras preferred being associated with other species, whereas carnivores, African elephants, Maasai giraffes and Kirk's dik-diks avoided being in mixed groups. During the dry season, we found that the betweenness (a measure of importance in the flow of information or disease) of species did not differ from a random expectation based on species abundance. In contrast, in the wet season, we found that these patterns were not simply explained by variations in abundances, suggesting that heterospecific associations were actively formed. These seasonal differences in observed patterns suggest that interspecific associations may be driven by resource overlap when resources are limited and by resource partitioning or anti-predator advantages when resources are abundant. We discuss potential mechanisms that could drive seasonal variation in the cost-benefit tradeoffs that underpin the formation of mixed-species groups. Copyright: © 2014 Kiffner et al.},

abstract={The fitness effects of symbionts on their hosts can be context-dependent, with usually benign symbionts causing detrimental effects when their hosts are stressed, or typically parasitic symbionts providing protection towards their hosts (e.g. against pathogen infection). Here, we studied the novel association between the invasive garden ant Lasius neglectus and its fungal ectosymbiont Laboulbenia formicarum for potential costs and benefits. We tested ants with different Laboulbenia levels for their survival and immunity under resource limitation and exposure to the obligate killing entomopathogen Metarhizium brunneum. While survival of L. neglectus workers under starvation was significantly decreased with increasing Laboulbenia levels, host survival under Metarhizium exposure increased with higher levels of the ectosymbiont, suggesting a symbiont-mediated anti-pathogen protection, which seems to be driven mechanistically by both improved sanitary behaviours and an upregulated immune system. Ants with high Laboulbenia levels showed significantly longer self-grooming and elevated expression of immune genes relevant for wound repair and antifungal responses (β-1,3-glucan binding protein, Prophenoloxidase), compared with ants carrying low Laboulbenia levels. This suggests that the ectosymbiont Laboulbenia formicarum weakens its ant host by either direct resource exploitation or the costs of an upregulated behavioural and immunological response, which, however, provides a prophylactic protection upon later exposure to pathogens. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Phenotypic correlations (rP) have frequently been observed between physiological and behavioural traits, and the nature of these associations has been shown to be modulated by a range of environmental stressors. Studies to date have examined the effects of acute stressors on physiology-behaviour interrelations, but the potential for permanent changes induced by exposure to stress during development remains unexplored. We exposed female zebra finches to dietary restriction during the nestling stage and tested how this affected rP among a variety of physiological traits (haematocrit, stress-induced corticosterone level and basal metabolic rate (BMR)) and behavioural traits (activity and feeding rates in novel and familiar environments). Developmental stress completely uncoupled the relationship between activity in a novel environment and two physiological traits: haematocrit and BMR. This suggests that nutritionally based developmental stress has provoked changes in the energy budget that alleviate the trade-off between maintenance (BMR) and locomotor activities. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={1. Behavioural responses to varying macronutrient availability are increasingly studied in highly invasive ant species to better understand their ecological success. However, such work is lacking in relation to native ant species confronted with biological invaders. 2. Here the link between diet and behaviour was examined in Prolasius advenus, a native ant from New Zealand facing intense competition for food with invasive insects, including social wasps. A long-term laboratory experiment was conducted to assess the impact of protein and carbohydrate restriction on several behavioural parameters. 3. Ants shifted their food-collecting activity towards the least available macronutrient in both protein-limited and carbohydrate-limited colonies. But when lacking carbohydrate, they also strongly increased their efforts to discover resources. After 10weeks, the proportion of the colony patrolling outside of the nest was eight times higher than at the initiation of the experiment. This high patrolling activity was then maintained for several weeks and resulted in a higher efficiency to explore a novel territory. Moreover, ants fed a carbohydrate-limited diet engaged in longer aggressive acts towards conspecifics. 4. These behavioural responses to carbohydrate scarcity may, in part, enhance the ability of P. advenus to resist a competing invader under natural conditions. While much of the previous research has linked diet and behavioural dominance in invasive ants, the present study shows that conducting similar investigations in the native species to which they are confronted may shed light on the mechanisms behind biotic resistance and the ability of some native species to coexist with highly abundant invaders. © 2014 The Royal Entomological Society.},

In this species, the behavioral response to host-derived odorants is modulated by both the time of the day and the starvation. Here I investigated the peripheral neural mechanisms underlying these modulatory effects. For this, I measured the electroantennogram (EAG) responses of insects towards different concentrations (from 0.5% to 75% vol/vol) of an attractive host-odorant, ammonia. I tested the responses of starved and fed animals during the middle of the day (when insects are inactive and aggregated in refuges) and at the beginning of the night (when insects become active and search for hosts). Regardless of the time of the day and the starvation status, EAG responses systematically increased with odorant concentration, thus accurately reflecting the response of olfactory receptor cells. Interestingly, the EAG responses of starved insects were larger than those of fed insects only during the night, with larger differences (6-7 times) observed at low-middle concentrations. This study is the first reporting modulation of sensory responses at the neural level in triatomines. This modulation, considering that triatomine hosts are mostly diurnal and are also potential predators, has an important adaptive value, ensuring that insects search for hosts only when they are hungry and at appropriate times. © 2014.},

abstract={The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether infant temperament and previous feeding history were associated with infants' acceptance and rejection of a novel food at 12 months of age. Mother-infant dyads (n = 89) were video-recorded during a novel food (hummus, cottage cheese) feeding task. Infants' reactions (acceptance and rejection behaviors) and maternal responsiveness and affect during the interaction were coded from the recordings by teams of coders. Mothers reported on their infants' temperamental approach via the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R) and their infants' feeding history (previous exposure to solid foods and exclusive breastfeeding). Regression analyses revealed that infants rated lower on approach showed less acceptance of the first offer of novel food than infants rated higher on approach. Additionally, low approach infants who were previously exposed to a greater number of solid foods showed fewer rejection behaviors in response to the later offers of food. Exclusive breastfeeding for 4 months did not appear to have an effect on acceptance or rejection. Finally, greater maternal responsiveness was related to the infants' acceptance of the new food whereas lower maternal responsiveness was associated with rejection of the novel food. These results suggest that the acceptance and rejection of new foods by infants is dependent upon their temperament and previous exposure to solid foods, as well as the manner in which mothers present the novel food. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Pontine para-brachial nucleus (PBN) neurons integrate visceral, oral, and other sensory information, playing an integral role in the neural control of feeding. Current experiments probed whether lateral PBN (lPBN) leptin receptor (LepRb) signaling contributes to this function. Intra-lPBN leptin microinjection significantly reduced cumulative chow intake, average meal size, and body weight in rats, independent of effects on locomotor activity or gastric emptying. In contrast to the effects observed following LepRb activation in other nuclei, lPBN LepRb stimulation did not affect progressive ratio responding for sucrose reward or conditioned place preference for a palatable food. Collectively, results suggest that lPBN LepRb activation reduces food intake by modulating the neural processing of meal size/satiation signaling, and highlight the lPBN as a novel site of action for leptin-mediated food intake control. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={The use of toxic chemical defences to repel and deter predators is widespread across living organisms, yet there are surprisingly few formal models of toxin evolution. Published models tend to focus on a trade-off between individual benefits and costs of toxicity, and treat predators as simple agents of selection, reducing future attacks when they encounter toxic prey. In this paper we argue, however, that the physiological characteristics of predators may be crucial in determining the nature and outcomes of toxin evolution. To examine this idea we devised and explored a model in which prey defence evolves in the context of predator physiology. We represented this as dose-effect relationships in predators for nutrition and toxins along with variable rates of predator metabolism. Incorporating variables of predator physiology can change views of toxin evolution. A key point is that inclusion of predator physiological variables requires that the nutritional value of prey is explicitly represented in the model, and this directly affects predictions for toxin evolution. In our model costly toxins generally evolve to the point that they are 'minimally unprofitable': just toxic enough to make prey typically unprofitable given their nutritional value to predators. As the nutritional value of prey increases, so the minimally unprofitable toxin level of prey tends to increase in step; hence another general prediction from this model is that toxin levels within prey should often correlate with the nutritional value of the prey. Predator physiology and cognition also contribute to variation in the social nature of defence. We argue that incorporating representations of predator physiology is important in the comprehension of toxin evolution and make suggestions for directions of future work. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={This study investigated the effectiveness of the 'Food Dudes' school-based intervention consisting of rewards, peer-modeling and food exposure on food neophobia and the liking of fruits and vegetables (FV) in a large cohort of children. Five-hundred sixty children recruited from three schools were assigned to the experimental or control group. For 16 days, children in the experimental group watched motivational videos, were read letters to encourage them to eat FV and received a small reward for eating one portion of both a fruit and a vegetable. The control group was only provided with FV for the same time period. Food neophobia and liking were measured in both groups of children before and after the intervention, and a follow-up measurement was carried out 6 months later. The intervention was effective in reducing food neophobia and, most importantly, a persistent effect was observed 6 months after the intervention as children of the experimental group showed significantly lower neophobia scores than the control group. Additionally, the program was effective in increasing liking for both FV; however, this effect was maintained only for fruit after 6 months. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={To address the role of mixed anxiety/mood disorder on appetitive associative learning, we verify whether previous chronic light deprivation changes ethanol-induced conditioned place preference and its respective expression of c-Fos and pCREB, markers of neuronal activity and plasticity. The experimental group was maintained in light deprivation for 24Â h for a period of 4Â wk. Subsequently, it was adapted to a standard light-dark cycle for 1Â wk. As a control, some mice were maintained in standard cycle for a period of 4Â wk (Naïve group). Then, all animals were submitted to behavioral tests to assess emotionality: elevated plus maze; open field; and forced swim. After that, they were submitted to ethanol-induced conditioned place preference. Ninety minutes after the place preference test, they were perfused, and their brains processed for c-Fos and pCREB immunohistochemistry. Light deprivation induced anxiety-like trait (elevated plus maze), despair (forced swim), and hyperlocomotion (open field), common features seen in other animal models of depression. Ethanol-induced conditioned place preference was accompanied by increases on c-Fos and pCREB in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and striatum. Interestingly, mice previously submitted to light deprivation did not develop either acquisition and/or expression of ethanol-induced conditioned place preference or increases in c-Fos and pCREB. Therefore, chronic light deprivation mimics several behavioral aspects of other animal models of depression. Furthermore, it could be useful to study the neurochemical mechanisms involved in the dual diagnosis. However, given its likely deleterious effects on appetitive associative memory, it should be used with caution to investigate the cognitive aspects related to the dual diagnosis. © CINP 2014.},

abstract={Many animals copy the choices of others but the functional and mechanistic explanations for copying are still not fully resolved. We relied on novel behavioral protocols to quantify the value of patch-choice copying in fruit flies. In a titration experiment, we quantified how much nutritional value females were willing to trade for laying eggs on patches already occupied by larvae (social patches). Females were highly sensitive to nutritional quality, which was positively associated with their offspring success. Females, however, perceived social, low-nutrition patches (33% of the nutrients) as equally valuable as non-social, high-nutrition ones (100% of the nutrients). In follow-up experiments, we could not, however, either find informational benefits from copying others or detect what females' offspring may gain from developing with older larvae. Because patch-choice copying in fruit flies is a robust phenomenon in spite of potential costs due to competition, we suggest that it is beneficial in natural settings, where fruit flies encounter complex dynamics of microbial communities, which include, in addition to the preferred yeast species they feed on, numerous harmful fungi and bacteria. We suggest that microbial ecology underlies many cases of copying in nature. Copyright: © 2014 Golden, Dukas.},

abstract={Introduction: Several studies reported the negative impact of elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) on outcomes in many surgical and medical conditions. Previous studies used arbitrary NLR cut-off points according to the average of the populations under study. There is no data on the average NLR in the general population. The aim of this study is to explore the average values of NLR and according to race in adult non-institutional United States individuals by using national data.
Methods: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of aggregated cross-sectional data collected from 2007 to 2010 was analyzed; data extracted included markers of systemic inflammation (neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, and NLR), demographic variables and other comorbidities. Subjects who were prescribed steroids, chemotherapy, immunomodulators and antibiotics were excluded. Adjusted linear regression models were used to examine the association between demographic and clinical characteristics and neutrophil counts, lymphocyte counts, and NLR.
Results: Overall 9427 subjects are included in this study. The average value of neutrophils is 4.3k cells/mL, of lymphocytes 2.1k cells/mL; the average NLR is 2.15. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic participants have significantly lower mean NLR values (1.76, 95% CI 1.71-1.81 and 2.08, 95% CI 2.04-2.12 respectively) when compared to non-Hispanic Whites (2.24, 95% CI 2.19-2.28-p<0.0001). Subjects who reported diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and smoking had significantly higher NLR than subjects who did not. Racial differences regarding the association of smoking and BMI with NLR were observed.
Conclusions: This study is providing preliminary data on racial disparities in a marker of inflammation, NLR, that has been associated with several chronic diseases outcome, suggesting that different cut-off points should be set according to race. It also suggests that racial differences exist in the inflammatory response to environmental and behavioral risk factors. © 2014 Azab et al.},

abstract={Foraging theory predicts that breath-hold divers adjust the time spent foraging at depth relative to the energetic cost of swimming, which varies with buoyancy (body density). However, the buoyancy of diving animals varies as a function of their body condition, and the effects of these changes on swimming costs and foraging behaviour have been poorly examined. A novel animal-borne accelerometer was developed that recorded the number of flipper strokes, which allowed us to monitor the number of strokes per metre swam (hereafter, referred to as strokes-per-metre) by female northern elephant seals over their months-long, oceanic foraging migrations.Asnegatively buoyant seals increased their fat stores and buoyancy, the strokes-per-metre increased slightly in the buoyancy-aided direction (descending), but decreased significantly in the buoyancy-hindered direction (ascending), with associated changes in swim speed and gliding duration. Overall, the round-trip strokes-per-metre decreased and reached a minimum value when seals achieved neutral buoyancy. Consistent with foraging theory, seals stayed longer at foraging depths when their round-trip strokes-per-metre was less. Therefore, neutrally buoyant divers gained an energetic advantage via reduced swimming costs, which resulted in an increase in time spent foraging at depth, suggesting a foraging benefit of being fat. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Adult female mosquitoes need blood to develop their eggs and both sexes use nectar and honeydew as carbohydrate resources for flight, survival and to enhance reproduction. However, there are also a few reports in the literature of mosquitoes feeding on haemolymph of soft-bodied insects such as caterpillars. The frequency and significance of this entomophagous behavior is not well understood, but is thought to be a vestige of ancestral feeding behavior or an opportunistic behavior that has evolved over time. In our current paper we investigated the extent to which the malaria mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, is attracted to, and can successfully feed on, larvae of two common moth species, Manduca sexta and Heliothis subflexa. Using y-tube olfactometer assays we found that female An. stephensi readily flew upwind to and landed on the caterpillars of both moth species. The nature of the volatile cues used in host location remains unclear but respirometer studies suggest a possible role of CO2. Laboratory cage assays further showed that the female mosquitoes were able to actively feed on moth larvae and gain sufficient nutritional benefit to influence survival. The extent to which such an opportunistic behavior occurs in the field has yet to be explored but our results suggest that this haemolymph feeding behavior could play a role in malaria mosquito life history and could provide a novel mechanism for horizontal transmission of pathogens and other micro-organisms between hosts. © 2014 George et al.},

abstract={Behavioural innovations have become central to our thinking about how animals adjust to changing environments. It is now well established that animals vary in their ability to innovate, but understanding why remains a challenge. This is because innovations are rare, so studying innovation requires alternative experimental assays that create opportunities for animals to express their ability to invent new behaviours, or use pre-existing ones in new contexts. Problem solving of extractive foraging tasks has been put forward as a suitable experimental assay. We review the rapidly expanding literature on problem solving of extractive foraging tasks in order to better understand to what extent the processes underpinning problem solving, and the factors influencing problem solving, are in line with those predicted, and found, to underpin and influence innovation in the wild. Our aim is to determine whether problem solving can be used as an experimental proxy of innovation. We find that in most respects, problem solving is determined by the same underpinning mechanisms, and is influenced by the same factors, as those predicted to underpin, and to influence, innovation. We conclude that problem solving is a valid experimental assay for studying innovation, propose a conceptual model of problem solving in which motor diversity plays a more central role than has been considered to date, and provide recommendations for future research using problem solving to investigate innovation.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Cognition in the wild. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The directed social learning hypothesis suggests that information does not spread evenly through animal groups, but rather individual characteristics and patterns of physical proximity guide the social transmission of information along specific pathways. Network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA) allows researchers to test whether information spreads following a social network. However, the explanatory power of different social networks has rarely been compared, and current models do not easily accommodate random effects (e.g. allowing for individuals within groups to correlate in their asocial solving rates). We tested whether the spread of two novel foraging skills through captive starling groups was affected by individual- and group-level random and fixed effects (i.e. sex, age, body condition, dominance rank and demonstrator status) and perching or foraging networks. We extended NBDA to include random effects and conducted model discrimination in a Bayesian context. We found that social learning increased the rate at which birds acquired the novel foraging task solutions by 6.67 times, and acquiring one of the two novel foraging task solutions facilitated the asocial acquisition of the other. Surprisingly, the spread of task solutions followed the perching rather than the foraging social network. Upon acquiring a task solution, foraging performance was facilitated by the presence of group mates. Our results highlight the importance of considering more than one social network when predicting the spread of information through animal groups.

abstract={Several studies show that most women do not consume enough fish during pregnancy (and afterward) to derive the maximum health benefits for themselves and their babies, according to the USDA guidelines. We engaged in a two-part study to better understand what might be done to encourage women of childbearing age to eat healthy fish-a mail survey of women who recently gave birth in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, and six focus groups with women of childbearing age living in the Great Lakes region. Similar to other studies, we found that many women changed their behavior and consumed less fish during pregnancy than before. Most women reported receiving information, primarily during pregnancy, about the types of fish and how much fish to eat. As a result, increasing access to information during pregnancy likely would not result in increasing many women[U+05F3]s fish consumption. Based on our examination of factors influencing women to try to follow the recommendations, the strongest connection with trying to follow the recommendations was receiving enough information to decide and believing that eating fish was good for the baby. Focus group participants also reported that messages about the specific health benefits of fish consumption for their children were particularly influential. These findings suggest that refining messages through testing might be a valuable approach toward increasing women[U+05F3]s consumption of less-contaminated fish. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The effects of low-level lead exposure on neuropsychological status in the United States (US) general adult population have been reported, and the relationship between neuropsychiatric dysfunction and health risk behaviors including substance use and sexual risk taking is well established. However, the potential influence of lead exposure on risk-taking behavior has received little attention. Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2010, we estimated multivariable logistic regression models to measure odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the cross-sectional associations between blood lead level and risk behaviors including binge drinking, drug use, and indicator of sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk. STI indicators included past 12 month sexual risk behaviors (age mixing with partners who were at least five years younger or older and multiple partnerships), self-reported STI, and biologically-confirmed herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection. Dose-response like relationships were observed between blood lead and substance use, age mixing with younger and older partners, self-reported STI, and HSV-2. In addition, participants with lead levels in highest quartile versus those with levels in the lowest quartile had over three times the odds of binge drinking and over twice the odds of injection drug or cocaine use in the past 12 months, while being in one of the top two quartiles was significantly associated with 30-70% increased odds of multiple partnerships, sex with older partners, and self-reported and biologically confirmed STI. Results from this study suggested that lead exposure may contribute to substance use, sexual risk-taking, and STI. However, given limitations inherent in the cross-sectional nature of the study, additional studies that use longitudinal data and measure detailed temporal information are warranted. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Size at birth, postnatal weight gain, and adult risk for type 2 diabetes may reflect environmental exposures during developmental plasticity and may be mediated by epigenetics. Both low birth weight (BW), as a marker of fetal growth restraint, and high birth weight (BW), especially after gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), have been linked to increased risk of adult type 2 diabetes. We assessed DNA methylation patterns using a bead chip in cord blood samples from infants of mothers with GDM (group 1) and infants with prenatal growth restraint indicated by rapid postnatal catch-up growth (group 2), compared with infants with normal postnatal growth (group 3). Seventy-five CpG loci were differentially methylated in groups 1 and 2 compared with the controls (group 3), representing 72 genes, many relevant to growth and diabetes. In replication studies using similar methodology, many of these differentially methylated regions were associated with levels of maternal glucose exposure below that defined by GDM [the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study] or were identified as changes observed after randomized periconceptional nutritional supplementation in a Gambian cohort characterized by maternal deprivation. These studies provide support for the concept that similar epigenetic modifications may underpin different prenatal exposures and potentially increase long-term risk for diseases such as type 2 diabetes.-Quilter, C.

From birth to 24 months, development and language acquisition were assessed via the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development and a modified MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory. Other measures were infant temperament, the child's environment, maternal psychological adjustment, and maternal reasoning abilities. We developed standard operating procedures and used multiple techniques to ensure appropriate adaptation and quality assurance across the sites. Test adaptation required significant time and human resources but is essential for data quality; funders should support this step in future studies.

abstract={Introduction: Food availability is an important environmental cue for animals for deciding how much to invest in reproduction, and it ultimately affects population size. The importance of food limitation has been extensively studied in terrestrial vertebrate populations, especially in birds, by experimentally manipulating food supply. However, the factors explaining variation in reproductive decisions in response to food supplementation remain unclear. By performing meta-analyses, we aim to quantify the extent to which supplementary feeding affects several reproductive parameters in birds, and identify the key factors (life-history traits, behavioural factors, environmental factors, and experimental design) that can induce variation in laying date, clutch size and breeding success (i.e., number of fledglings produced) in response to food supplementation. Results: Food supplementation produced variable but mostly positive effects across reproductive parameters in a total of 201 experiments from 82 independent studies. The outcomes of the food effect were modulated by environmental factors, e.g., laying dates advanced more towards low latitudes, and food supplementation appeared not to produce any obvious effect on bird reproduction when the background level of food abundance in the environment was high. Moreover, the increase in clutch size following food addition was more pronounced in birds that cache food, as compared to birds that do not. Supplementation timing was identified as a major cause of variation in breeding success responses. We also document the absence of a detectable food effect on clutch size and breeding success when the target species had poor access to the feed due to competitive interactions with other animals. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that, from the pool of bird species and environments reviewed, extra food is allocated to immediate reproduction in most cases. Our results also support the view that bird species have evolved different life-history strategies to cope with environmental variability in food supply. However, we encourage more research at low latitudes to gain knowledge on how resource allocation in birds changes along a latitudinal gradient. Our results also emphasize the importance of developing experimental designs that minimise competition for the supplemented food and the risk of reproductive bottle-necks due to inappropriate supplementation timings. © 2014 Ruffino et al.},

abstract={Background: Interventions are needed to reduce poor perinatal health. We trained community health workers (CHWs) as home visitors to address maternal/infant risks.
Methods: In a cluster randomised controlled trial in Cape Town townships, neighbourhoods were randomised within matched pairs to 1) the control, healthcare at clinics (n=12 neighbourhoods; n = 594 women), or 2) a home visiting intervention by CBW trained in cognitive-behavioural strategies to address health risks (by the Philani Maternal, Child Health and Nutrition Programme), in addition to clinic care (n = 12 neighbourhoods; n = 644 women). Participants were assessed during pregnancy (2% refusal) and 92% were reassessed at two weeks post-birth, 88% at six months and 84% at 18 months later. We analysed 32 measures of maternal/infant well-being over the 18 month follow-up period using longitudinal random effects regressions. A binomial test for correlated outcomes evaluated overall effectiveness over time. The 18 month post-birth assessment outcomes also were examined alone and as a function of the number of home visits received.
Results: Benefits were found on 7 of 32 measures of outcomes, resulting in significant overall benefits for the intervention compared to the control when using the binomial test (p = 0.008); nevertheless, no effects were observed when only the 18 month outcomes were analyzed. Benefits on individual outcomes were related to the number of home visits received. Among women living with HIV, intervention mothers were more likely to implement the PMTCT regimens, use condoms during all sexual episodes (OR = 1.25; p = 0.014), have infants with healthy weight-for-age measurements (OR = 1.42; p = 0.045), height-for-age measurements (OR=1.13, p<0.001), breastfeed exclusively for six months (OR = 3.59; p<0.001), and breastfeed longer (OR = 3.08; p<0.001). Number of visits was positively associated with infant birth weight ≥2500 grams (OR = 1.07; p = 0.012), healthy head-circumference-for-age measurements at 6 months (OR =1.09, p = 0.017), and improved cognitive development at 18 months (OR = 1.02, p = 0.048).
Conclusions: Home visits to neighbourhood mothers by CHWs may be a feasible strategy for enhancing maternal/child outcomes. However, visits likely must extend over several years for persistent benefits.},

abstract={Objective: To provide an overview of the current evidence about biological risk factors that predispose people to antisocial and violent behaviour, and determine its usefulness in forensic assessment.
Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using articles from PsycINFO, Embase and Pubmed published between 2000 and 2013.
Results: This review shows that much research on the relationship between genetic predisposition and neurobiological alterations with aggression is performed on psychiatric patients or normal populations. However, the number of studies comparing offenders is limited. There is still a great need to understand how genetic and neurobiological alterations and/or deficits are related to violent behaviour, specifically criminality. Most studies focus on only one of the genetic or neurobiological fields related to antisocial and/or violent behaviour. To reliably correlate the findings of these fields, a standardization of methodology is urgently needed.
Conclusion: Findings from the current review suggest that violent aggression, like all forms of human behaviour, both develops under specific genetic and environmental conditions, and requires interplay between these conditions. Violence should be considered as the end product of a chain of life events, during which risks accumulate and potentially reinforce each other, displaying or triggering a specific situation. This systematic review did not find evidence of predispositions or neurobiological alterations that solely explain antisocial or violent behaviour. With better designed studies, more correlation between diverse fields, and more standardisation, it might be possible to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Thus, we advocate maintaining the current case-by-case differentiated approach to evidence-based forensic assessment.
Background: With the increased knowledge of biological risk factors, interest in including this information in forensic assessments is growing. Currently, forensic assessments are predominantly focused on psychosocial factors. A better understanding of the neurobiology of violent criminal behaviour and biological risk factors could improve forensic assessments. © 2014 van der Gronde et al.},

abstract={Balancing of macronutrient intake has only recently been demonstrated in predators. In particular, the ability to regulate carbohydrate intake is little studied in obligate carnivores, as carbohydrate is present at very low concentrations in prey animal tissue. In the present study, we determined whether American mink (Neovison vison) would compensate for dietary nutritional imbalances by foraging for complementary macronutrients (protein, lipid and carbohydrate) when subsequently given a dietary choice. We used three food pairings, within which two macronutrients differed relative to each other (high v. low concentration), while the third was kept at a constant level. The mink were first restricted to a single nutritionally imbalanced food for 7 d and then given a free choice to feed from the same food or a nutritionally complementary food for three consecutive days. When restricted to nutritionally imbalanced foods, the mink were willing to overingest protein only to a certain level ('ceiling'). When subsequently given a choice, the mink compensated for the period of nutritional imbalance by selecting the nutritionally complementary food in the food choice pairing. Notably, this rebalancing occurred for all the three macronutrients, including carbohydrate, which is particularly interesting as carbohydrate is not a major macronutrient for obligate carnivores in nature. However, there was also a ceiling to carbohydrate intake, as has been demonstrated previously in domestic cats. The results of the present study show that mink regulate their intake of all the three macronutrients within limits imposed by ceilings on protein and carbohydrate intake and that they will compensate for a period of nutritional imbalance by subsequently selecting nutritionally complementary foods. © The Authors 2014.},

abstract={Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), one of the most common chronic diseases and a leading cause of death, has historically been considered a disease of men. However, there has been a rapid increase in the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality of COPD in women over the last two decades. This has largely been attributed to historical increases in tobacco consumption among women. But the influence of sex on COPD is complex and involves several other factors, including differential susceptibility to the effects of tobacco, anatomic, hormonal, and behavioral differences, and differential response to therapy. Interestingly, nonsmokers with COPD are more likely to be women. In addition, women with COPD are more likely to have a chronic bronchitis phenotype, suffer from less cardiovascular comorbidity, have more concomitant depression and osteoporosis, and have a better outcome with acute exacerbations. Women historically have had lower mortality with COPD, but this is changing as well. There are also differences in how men and women respond to different therapies. Despite the changing face of COPD, care providers continue to harbor a sex bias, leading to underdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis of COPD in women. In this review, we present the current knowledge on the influence of sex on COPD risk factors, epidemiology, diagnosis, comorbidities, treatment, and outcomes, and how this knowledge may be applied to improve clinical practices and advance research. © 2014 Aryal et al.},

abstract={Pesticide coated seeds are known to be potentially toxic for birds, but the risk of poisoning will depend on how likely the individuals are to consume them. To refine the risk assessment of coated seed consumption by birds we studied the consumption and avoidance of seeds treated with imidacloprid, thiram, maneb or rhodamine B under different scenarios of food unpredictability (diversity or changes in food sources). In a first set of experiments, we examined during four days the amount of ingested food by red-legged partridges (. Alectoris rufa) when offered untreated seeds, treated seeds or both. In the latter case, we also assessed the effect of a daily interchange in the position of feeders containing treated and untreated food. A second experiment, conducted with imidacloprid only, consisted of offering, during 27. h, fixed overall amounts of treated and untreated food, equally distributed in a different number of feeders per pen (1, 2, 4 or 8 feeders of each type of food) in order to diversify food sources. All the tested pesticide-treated seeds were avoided in two-choice experiments, and imidacloprid and thiram were also avoided in one-choice experiments. We found that imidacloprid treated seeds were avoided, probably as a consequence of a conditioned aversion effect due to the post-ingestion distress. However, under a diversification of two-choice food sources with multiple feeders, imidacloprid-treated seeds were ingested by partridges at increasing amounts that can produce sublethal effects or even death. Thiram treated seeds were also initially avoided in one-choice experiment, but probably mediated by a sensory repellence that progressively decreased with time. Our results reveal that the risk of pesticide exposure in birds may increase by unpredictability of food resources or prolonged availability of coated seeds, so pesticide registration for seed coating should consider worst-case scenarios to avoid negative impacts on farmland birds. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Adaptive developmental plasticity allows individuals experiencing poor environmental conditions in early life to adjust their life-history strategy in order to prioritize short-term fitness benefits and maximize reproductive output in challenging environments. Much research has been conducted to test whether such adoption of a "faster" life-history strategy is accompanied by concordant changes in behavior and physiology, with mixed results. As research in this field has focused on comparison of mean-level responses of treatment groups, few studies include repeated measures of response variables and the effect that developmental stress may have on repeatability per se. We investigated how early-developmental stress affects the mean expression of (and repeatability in) a variety of behavioral and physiological traits in female zebra finches. We predicted that: (1) individuals subjected to nutritional restriction in the nestling phase would have higher feeding and activity rates, with associated increases in hematocrit and basal metabolic rates (BMRs), (2) nutritional restriction in early life would alter adults' stress-induced corticosterone level, and (3) developmental stress would, respectively, influence the amount of among-individual and within-individual variation in behavioral and physiological traits, hence affecting the repeatability of these traits. In comparison to control females, stressed females did not differ in activity rate or stress-induced corticosterone level, but they did have higher levels of feeding, hematocrit, and BMR. Among-individual variance and repeatability were generally higher in stressed females than in controls. Finally, we found that developmental dietary restriction significantly reduced the amount of within-individual variance both in activity rate in the novel environment and in stress-induced corticosterone level. Our results not only confirm previous findings on the effect of early-developmental stress on BMR, but also extend its effect to feeding rate and hematocrit, suggesting that developmental plasticity in these traits is ontogenetically linked. Early-developmental stress may disable particular genetic canalizing processes, which would release cryptic genetic variation and explain why repeatability and among-individual variance were generally higher in the stressed groups than in controls. For activity rate in the novel environment and with stress-induced corticosterone level, however, early-developmental stress significantly reduced within-individual variance, which may be a consequence of increased canalization of these traits at the micro-environmental level. © The Author 2014.

abstract={Results Oral hyposensitivity or hypersensitivity, adverse behaviors, and risk for dysphagia were seen in ∼65% of the children with SLOS. Thirteen of the 26 children experienced failure to thrive, and 10 children required gastrostomy. Plasma concentration of 7-dehydrocholesterol, as a measure of severity, was correlated with total feeding score and oral function subcategory score (P <.001) and less so with oral structure score, adverse behaviors, or dysphagia. Correlations with cholesterol concentrations were less statistically significant. A plasma 7-dehydrocholesterol concentration >0.24 mmol/L or cholesterol concentration <1.95 mmol/L was predictive of gastrostomy tube use. Feeding impairments may improve with age.
Objective To quantitatively evaluate feeding impairment in children with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) and to correlate feeding impairment with clinical and biochemical indices of disease severity.
Study design The study subjects were 26 children with SLOS ranging in age from 0.4 to 19 years. Clinical severity was measured using an existing scoring system. We created a tool to quantitatively evaluate feeding. Plasma sterol concentrations were measured, and statistical associations (correlations) with feeding scores were calculated.
Conclusion Feeding impairment is common and complex in patients with SLOS. Our findings confirm that oral sensitivities, adverse feeding behaviors, and risk of oral phase dysphagia are amenable to quantitative evaluation and analysis. Feeding difficulties in children with SLOS are correlated with plasma sterol concentrations, suggesting a link between the biochemical severity of SLOS and feeding function. These findings expand the behavioral phenotype of SLOS and begin to provide insight into the biological causes of feeding difficulties. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The adaptability of organisms to novel environmental conditions depends on the amount of genetic variance present in the population as well as on the ability of individuals to adjust their phenotype through phenotypic plasticity. Here, we investigated the phenotypic plasticity induced by a single generation's exposure to three different temperature regimes with respect to several life-history and stress-resistance traits in a natural population of Drosophila simulans. We studied a constant as well as a predictably and an unpredictably fluctuating temperature regime. We found high levels of phenotypic plasticity among all temperature regimes, suggesting a strong influence of both temperature fluctuations and their predictability. Increased heat tolerance was observed for flies developed in both types of fluctuating thermal environments compared with flies developed in a constant environment. We suggest that this was due to beneficial hardening when developing in either fluctuating temperature environment. To our surprise, flies that developed in constant and predictably changing environments were similar to each other in most traits when compared to flies from the unpredictably fluctuating environment. The unpredictably changing thermal environment imposed the most stressful condition, resulting in the lowest performance for stress-related traits, even though the absolute temperature changes never exceeded that of the predictably fluctuating environment. The overall decreased stress resistance of flies in the unpredictably fluctuating environment may be the consequence of maladaptive phenotypic plasticity in this setting, indicating that the adaptive value of plasticity depends on the predictability of the environment.

abstract={The rise in rates of non-communicable diseases that emerged over the past 20 years is without precedent. The causes of the epidemic remain enigmatic. The usual explanation, that disease is caused by poor genes or detrimental lifestyle choices are inadequate to explain the rapid time course. However, the work of David Barker and colleagues, published some 25 years ago, showed powerful relationships between low birthweight and risk for adult onset type 2 diabetes and offered new ways of thinking regarding the origins of chronic disease. It is now evident that (i) programming later life health or disease begins at conception or earlier, at different windows of developmental plasticity through altered structural or epigenetic responses; (ii) prenatal changes predispose to altered post natal environmental responses (epigenome x environment, E2, interaction) and (iii) the placenta has a central role in mediating these effects. While the placenta is known to be the conduit through which maternal nutrients reach the embryo and fetus, the mechanisms that underlie the transport of the vast number of nutrients is complex and includes, diffusion, active transport and vesicular transport. These transport systems are influenced by maternal body composition and physiological state. The predilection for various chronic diseases among adults is associated with placental size and shape. The physiological features of the maternal, fetal and placental units are important in regulating transport function of the placenta. Levels of 11β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase influence the degree to which maternal cortisol reaches the fetal circulation. Maternal under and over-nutritional states affect the fetal HPA axis beyond birth. Five year old offspring of periconceptional undernourished ewes have reduced hypothalamic GR promoter methylation, increased levels of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and protein and increased adiposity. Thus, the research task of the next generation will be to determine 1) the appropriate use of glucocorticoids in clinical practice balancing potential detrimental effects on offspring, 2) the roles of maternal nutritional state before and during pregnancy and their short term effects on placental function and long term effects on offspring and 3) the degree to which biomarkers associated with maternal conditions can predict disease in offspring. © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={Background: Early introduction of complementary feeding may interfere with breastfeeding and the infant's self-controlled appetite resulting in increased growth. The aim of the present study was to investigate predictors for early introduction of solid food. Methods: In an observational study Danish mothers filled in a self-administered questionnaire approximately six months after birth. The questionnaire included questions about factors related to the infant, the mother, attachment and feeding known to influence time for introduction of solid food. The study population consisted of 4503 infants. Data were analysed using ordered logistic regression models. Outcome variable was time for introduction to solid food. Results: Almost all of the included infants 4386 (97%) initiated breastfeeding. At weeks 16, 17-25, 25+, 330 infants (7%); 2923 (65%); and 1250 (28%), respectively had been introduced to solid food. Full breastfeeding at five weeks was the most influential predictor for later introduction of solid food (OR = 2.52 CI: 1.93-3.28). Among infant factors male gender, increased gestational age at birth, and higher birth weight were found to be statistically significant predictors. Among maternal factors, lower maternal age, higher BMI, and being primipara were significant predictors, and among attachment factors mother's reported perception of the infant as being temperamental, and not recognising early infant cues of hunger were significant predictors for earlier introduction of solid food. Supplementary analyses of interactions between the predictors showed that the association of maternal perceived infant temperament on early introduction was restricted to primiparae, that the mother's pre-pregnancy BMI had no impact if the infant was fully breastfed at week five, and that birth weight was only associated if the mother had reported early uncertainty in recognising infant's cues of hunger. Conclusions: Breastfeeding was the single most powerful indicator for preventing early introduction to solid food. Modifiable predictors pointed to the importance of supporting breastfeeding and educating primipara and mothers with low birth weight infants to be able to read and respond to their infants' cues to prevent early introduction to solid food. © 2014 Kronborg et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The ability to exert self-control in the face of appetitive, alluring cues is a critical component of healthy development. The development of behavioral measures that use disease-relevant stimuli can greatly improve our understanding of cue-specific impairments in self-control. To produce such a tool relevant to the study of eating and weight disorders, we modified the traditional go/no-go task to include food and non-food targets. To confirm that performance on this new task was consistent with other go/no-go tasks, it was given to 147 healthy, normal weight volunteers between the ages of 5 and 30. High-resolution photos of food or toys were used as the target and nontarget stimuli. Consistent with expectations, overall improvements in accuracy were seen from childhood to adulthood. Participants responded more quickly and made more commission errors to food cues compared to nonfood cues (F(1,140)=21.76, P<0.001), although no behavioral differences were seen between low- and high-calorie food cues for this non-obese, healthy developmental sample. This novel food-specific go/no-go task may be used to track the development of self-control in the context of food cues and to evaluate deviations or deficits in the development of this ability in individuals at risk for eating problem behaviors and disorders. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract={Organisms exhibit plasticity in response to their environment, but there is large variation even within populations in the expression and magnitude of response. Maternal influence alters offspring survival through size advantages in growth and development. However, the relationship between maternal influence and variation in plasticity in response to predation risk is unknown. We hypothesized that variation in the magnitude of plastic responses between families is at least partly due to maternal provisioning and examined the relationship between maternal condition, egg provisioning and magnitude of plastic response to perceived predation risk (by dragonfly larvae: Aeshna spp.) in northern leopard frogs (Lithobates pipiens). Females in better body condition tended to lay more (clutch size) larger (egg diameter) eggs. Tadpoles responded to predation risk by increasing relative tail depth (morphology) and decreasing activity (behaviour). We found a positive relationship between morphological effect size and maternal condition, but no relationship between behavioural effect size and maternal condition. These novel findings suggest that limitations imposed by maternal condition can constrain phenotypic variation, ultimately influencing the capacity of populations to respond to environmental change. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Short-term abstinence from food intake, planned or unplanned, is unavoidable in modern life, but negatively correlated with appetite control and obesity. This study investigated the role of estradiol in feeding and body weight (BW) reactions to short-span cessation of feeding. During acute 1-6-h re-feeding, 12-h food-deprived (FD), estradiol benzoate (EB)-implanted ovariectomized rats ate less food and gained less weight than FD animals implanted with oil (O). Full fed (FF)- and FD-EB consumed equal amounts of food over 24 h, but weight gain was greater in the latter; 24-h food intake and BW gain in FD-O exceeded FD-EB. Caudal fourth ventricular administration of the AMPK activator AICAR increased dorsal vagal complex AMPK activity in FD-EB and FD-O, but elicited dissimilar adjustments in hypothalamic metabolic neuropeptide transmitter expression, while respectively enhancing or reducing acute re-feeding in these animals and reversing FD-O weight gain. Drug-treated FD-EB and FD-O exhibited respective feeding and weight gain increases between 6-24 h. AICAR enhanced 24-h consumption in FD-EB vs. FF-EB, but cumulative intake and BW gain were greater in AICAR-treated FD-O vs. FD-EB. Results show that estradiol limits acute re-feeding after short-term feeding suspension, but augments acute re-feeding when energy depletion coincides with suspended feeding. This compound metabolic stress exerts steroid-dependent effects during later resumption of circadian-induced feeding, for example, increased consumption vs. weight gain in the presence vs. absence of estradiol. These studies provide novel evidence that estrogen mitigates acute and post-acute adverse effects of disrupted fuel acquisition on energy balance. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.},

abstract={Prematurity and neonatal growth restriction (GR) are risk factors for autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Leptin production is suppressed during periods of undernutrition, and we have shown that isolated neonatal leptin deficiency leads to adult hyperactivity while neonatal leptin supplementation normalizes the brain morphology of GR mice. We hypothesized that neonatal leptin would prevent the development of GR-associated behavioral abnormalities. From postnatal day 4-14, C57BL/6 mice were randomized to daily injections of saline or leptin (80. ng/g), and GR was identified by a weanling weight below the tenth percentile. The behavioral phenotypes of GR and control mice were assessed beginning at 4 months. Within the tripartite chamber, GR mice had significantly impaired social interaction. Baseline escape times from the Barnes maze were faster for GR mice (65+/-6 s vs 87+/-7 s for controls, p&#60;. 0.05), but GR mice exhibited regression in their escape times on days 2 and 3 (56% regressed vs 22% of control saline mice, p&#60; 0.05). Compared to controls, GR mice entered the open arms of the elevated plus maze more often and stayed there longer (72+/-10 s vs 36+/-5 s, p&#60; 0.01). Neonatal leptin supplementation normalized the behavior of GR mice across all behavioral assays. In conclusion, GR alters the social interactions, learning and activity of mice, and supplementation with the neurotrophic hormone leptin mitigates these effects. We speculate neonatal leptin deficiency may contribute to the adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with postnatal growth restriction, and postnatal leptin therapy may be protective. © 2014.},

abstract={Calorie restriction (CR) was shown previously to improve cognition and decrease pathology in transgenic mouse models with Alzheimer-like amyloid deposition. In the present study, we investigated the effects of CR on the Tg4510 model of tau deposition. Mice in the calorie restriction group had food intake gradually decreased until they reached an average of 35% body weight reduction. Body weight and food intake were monitored throughout the study. After being on their respective diets for 3 months, all animals were submitted to behavioral testing. Tg4510 mice fed ad libitum showed lower body weight than nontransgenic littermates despite their increased food intake. Additionally, Tg4510 showed increased locomotor activity in the open field regardless of diet. Calorie restricted Tg4510 mice performed significantly better than ad libitum fed mice in the novel object recognition test, suggesting improved short-term memory. CR Tg4510 mice also performed significantly better in contextual fear conditioning than mice fed ad libitum. However, in a modified version of the novelty test that allows for interaction with other mice instead of inanimate objects, CR was not able to rescue the deficit found in Tg4510 mice in this ethologically more salient version of the task. No treatment differences in motor performance or spatial memory were observed in the rotarod or radial arm water maze tests, respectively. Histopathological and biochemical assessments showed no diet-induced changes in total or phospho-tau levels. Moreover, increased activation of both astrocytes and microglia in Tg4510 mice was not rescued by calorie restriction. Taken together, our data suggests that, despite an apparent rescue of associative memory, CR had no consistent effects on pathological outcomes of a mouse model of tau deposition. © 2014.},

abstract={Since the birth of the first cloned sheep, somatic cell nuclear transfer technology has been successfully used to clone a variety of mammals. Cloned livestock have no apparent health risks, and the quality and safety of the cloned animal products are similar to non-cloned animals. The social behavior and environmental adaptability of postnatal cloned animals, especially when used for grassland farm production purposes, is unknown. In the present study, the cloned Dorper sheep equipped with GPS location devices were free-grazed in a harsh natural environment similar to conditions commonly experienced by Mongolian sheep. The main findings of this research were as follows. (1) Under free-grazing conditions, the cloned sheep showed excellent climatic and ecological adaptability. In extreme temperature conditions ranging from - 30 to 40°C, the cloned sheep maintained acceptable body condition and behaved as other sheep. (2) The cloned sheep quickly adapted from a herd feeding strategy to the harsh environment and quickly exhibited a grazing regimen as other free-grazing sheep. (3) The cloned sheep exhibited free-grazing patterns and social behavior as other sheep. (4) The cloned sheep in the harsh environment thrived and produced healthy lambs. Overall, the cloned Dorper sheep exhibited excellent ecological adaptation, which is an important consideration for breeding meat sheep by cloning. The Dorper sheep readily adapted to the free-grazing conditions on the Mongolian plateau grassland, which attests to their ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. © The Author(s) 2014.},

abstract={The hedonic value of food has been conceptualised as a combination of how much a food is liked and how much a food is wanted in a given moment. These psychobiological constructs help to explain choices about which foods to eat and have a primary role in how much energy is consumed. Moreover the processes of liking and wanting for food are not always equivalent and may differ by degree according to the food in question, state of satiety, body composition and individual differences in dispositional eating behaviour traits. Here we report progress on the behavioural quantification of food hedonics in the laboratory setting through assessment of 'explicit liking' and 'implicit wanting' according to perceived fat content and/or sweet taste of common foods. We review recent experimental evidence examining the role of liking and wanting as features of 'trait binge eating' (assessed using the Binge Eating Scale)-a non-clinical psychometric marker for susceptibility to overeating and increased risk of weight gain. Our data show that trait binge eating can be viewed as an ecologically valid, behavioural phenotype of obesity, characterised by reliable psychological and anthropometric characteristics. Enhanced implicit wanting for sweet foods with high fat content is a psychobiological feature of susceptibility to overeating and offers a potential target for improving appetite control. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Early life events, such as calorie restriction (CR) and elevated glucocorticoids, can calibrate the lifelong behavioural and physiological profile of an individual. Stress reactivity in adulthood is particularly sensitive to early life events; however, the consequence to fear and anxiety-like behaviour is less clear. Consequently, the current study sought to examine the effects of post-natal CR and glucocorticoid elevation, long considered powerful programming stimuli, on the subsequent fear and anxiety behaviour of the adult offspring. Rat dams received either corticosterone (200. μg/ml) supplementation in drinking water (CORT) or a 25% CR from post-natal day (PND) 1 to 11. Responses to the elevated plus maze (EPM), open field and a predator odour (TMT; 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline) were characterised in the adult male offspring. Both treatment conditions resulted in enhanced fear responses to TMT, characterised by heightened risk assessment and increased avoidance of TMT. CORT nursed offspring further demonstrated an anxiogenic profile in the open field. Basal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function was unchanged in CORT adult offspring, whilst corticosterone concentration was elevated by post-natal CR. CR and CORT treated dams both exhibited greater anxiety-like behaviour in the EPM. A modest and temporary enhancement of maternal care was observed in CR and CORT treated dams, with CR dams further exhibiting rapid pup retrieval latencies. The results indicate enhanced emotionality in the adult male progeny of dams exposed to CR and corticosterone supplementation during the post-natal period. The modest enhancement of maternal care observed by both treatments is unlikely to have influenced the behavioural profile of the offspring. © 2014.},

abstract={Energy is typically a limiting factor for animals during boreal winters, when low temperatures increase the cost of thermoregulation at the same times as short day-lengths and snow cover constrain foraging opportunities. Under these circumstances animals use a suite of behavioural and physiological adaptations to avoid overnight starvation. However, it is poorly understood how such strategies are affected by increased energy demands from other physiological systems. Thus, we used free-ranging blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, to test if competing demands for energy (here induced by a non-inflammatory, antibody-mediated immune challenge) would affect nocturnal body temperature (a predictor of energy expenditure in small animals) and energy-saving nest box roosting behaviour. We also assessed if the immune challenge incurred long-term survival costs. We found no evidence that body temperature regulation differed between immune-challenged and saline-injected birds. Nor did the immune challenge reduce survival to the next breeding season. However, old (second winter or older) immune-challenged birds continued roosting in nest boxes to a larger extent at the peak immune response, despite increased perceived predation risk induced by the preceding capture and immunization. In contrast, old control birds were less prone to roost in nest boxes after capture and saline injection. This difference was less pronounced in young (first winter) birds. We interpret the increased risk-taking behaviour in immune-challenged birds as a consequence of a higher need for exploiting the thermal benefits of nest box roosting to reduce energy loss. This suggests that resource deficiency might be a stronger predictor of overnight survival than the threat of nocturnal predation in this system. As such, our study provides insights into the classic tradeoff between starvation and predation risk, in suggesting that priority is given to minimizing the risk of starvation in situations where both starvation and predation risks increase during cold winter nights. © 2014 The Authors},

abstract={Background: The need for improving throughput, validity, and reliability in the behavioral characterization of rodents may benefit from integrating automated intra-home-cage-screening systems allowing the simultaneous detection of multiple behavioral and physiological parameters in parallel. New method: To test this hypothesis, transgenic Huntington's disease (tgHD) rats were repeatedly screened within phenotyping home-cages (PhenoMaster and IntelliCage for rats), where spontaneous activity, feeding, drinking, temperature, and metabolic performance were continuously measured. Cognition and emotionality were evaluated within the same environment by means of operant learning procedures and refined analysis of the behavioral display under conditions of novelty. This investigator-independent approach was further correlated with behavioral display of the animals in classical behavioral assays. Multivariate analysis (MVA) including Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was used to explore correlation patterns of variables within and across the two genotypes. Results: The automated systems traced previously undetected aspects in the phenotype of tgHD rats (circadian activity, energy metabolism, rearing), and out of those spontaneous free rearing correlated with individual performance in the accelerod test. PCA revealed a segregation by genotype in juvenile tgHD rats that differed from adult animals, being further resolved by PLS-DA detecting "temperature" (juvenile) and "rearing" (adult) as phenotypic key variables in the tgHD model. Conclusions: Intra-home-cage phenotyping in combination with MVA, is capable of characterizing a complex phenotype by detecting novel physiological and behavioral markers with high sensitivity and standardization using fewer human resources. A broader application of automated systems for large-scale screening is encouraged. © 2014 .},

abstract={Background: Anesthetic exposure early in life affects neural development and long-term cognitive function, but our understanding of the types of memory that are altered is incomplete. Specific cognitive tests in rodents that isolate different memory processes provide a useful approach for gaining insight into this issue. Methods: Postnatal day 7 (P7) rats were exposed to either desflurane or isoflurane at 1 Minimum Alveolar Concentration for 4 h. Acute neuronal death was assessed 12 h later in the thalamus, CA1-3 regions of hippocampus, and dentate gyrus. In separate behavioral experiments, beginning at P48, subjects were evaluated in a series of object recognition tests relying on associative learning, as well as social recognition. Results: Exposure to either anesthetic led to a significant increase in neuroapoptosis in each brain region. The extent of neuronal death did not differ between groups. Subjects were unaffected in simple tasks of novel object and object-location recognition. However, anesthetized animals from both groups were impaired in allocentric object-location memory and a more complex task requiring subjects to associate an object with its location and contextual setting. Isoflurane exposure led to additional impairment in object-context association and social memory. Conclusion: Isoflurane and desflurane exposure during development result in deficits in tasks relying on associative learning and recognition memory. Isoflurane may potentially cause worse impairment than desflurane. © 2014 Lee et al.},

abstract={Spatial position within a group affects the value of group-living benefits such as reduced predation risk and improved foraging. The threat of predation, poor nutrition or increased competition from conspecifics can all cause stress. In many species, central positions are known to be more beneficial than peripheral positions in terms of reduced predation, vigilance and foraging. In this study, we examine whether spatial position within a group is associated with stress and anxiety in a troop of olive baboons (. Papio anubis). We predicted that the benefits of occupying central positions would be reflected by a reduction in stress and anxiety for animals who spent the most time in the centre of the group. The study subjects appeared to compete actively for the centre of the group. Physiological stress measures (faecal glucocorticoid concentrations) were positively correlated with time spent in central positions. Time spent in central positions was positively correlated with proximity but negatively correlated with vigilance behaviours (alarm barks). Vigilance rates were positively correlated with measures of anxiety (self-scratch frequency). It is suggested that individuals experience chronic stress due to proximity to conspecifics in central positions, whilst perceived predation risk causes anxiety, with perceived predation risk experienced more by individuals on the periphery. © 2014.},

abstract={Background: Maternal perception of decreased fetal movements is a specific indicator of fetal compromise, notably in the context of poor fetal growth. There is currently no agreed numerical definition of decreased fetal movements, with the subjective perception of a decrease on the part of the mother being the most significant definition clinically. Both qualitative and quantitative aspects of fetal activity may be important in identifying the compromised fetus. Yet, how pregnant women perceive and describe fetal activity is under-investigated by qualitative means. The aim of this study was to explore normal fetal activity, through first-hand descriptive accounts by pregnant women. Methods: Using qualitative descriptive methodology, interviews were conducted with 19 low-risk women experiencing their first pregnancy, at two timepoints in their third trimester. Interview transcripts were later analysed using qualitative content analysis and patterns of fetal activity identified were then considered along-side the characteristics of the women and their birth outcomes. Results: This paper focuses on a novel finding; the description by pregnant women of fetal behaviour indicative of hunger and satiation. Full findings will be presented in later papers. Most participants (74% 14 of 19) indicated mealtimes were a time of increased fetal activity. Eight participants provided detailed descriptions of increased activity around meals, with seven (37% 7 of 19) of these specifying increased fetal activity prior to meals or in the context of their own hunger. These movements were interpreted as a fetal demand for food often prompting the mother to eat. Interestingly, the women who described increased fetal activity in the context of hunger subsequently gave birth to smaller infants (mean difference 364 gm) than those who did not describe a fetal response to hunger. Conclusions: Food seeking behaviour may have a pre-birth origin. Maternal-fetal interaction around mealtimes could constitute an endocrine mediated communication, in the interests of maintaining optimal intrauterine conditions. Further research is warranted to explore this phenomenon and the potential influence of feeding on the temporal organisation of fetal activity in relation to growth. © 2014 Bradford and Maude; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={A healthy and active life is a key issue for elderly citizens, above all when psychological complications such as depression and anxiety disorders, late delusion or loneliness can be observed. Moreover, medical pathologies in elderly patients often have a multi-factorial etiology and many psychopathological dimensions and psychosocial risk factors are underestimated. From the perspective of clinical health psychology, psychogeriatrics could play an important role in promoting active ageing and a healthy lifestyle in elderly persons through tailored clinical approaches based on specific research and advanced professional training in this area. More research is needed in order to study which determinants affect the process of an active and functional ageing. Possible research ageing areas are: 1) evaluation of psychosocial risk-protective factors related to the individual's biography and personality. 2) Evaluation of enrichment programs and clinical protocols focused on the management of different topics such as health system areas, behavioral areas, social and physical environment areas, psychological factors and economic determinants. The goal of Psychogeriatrics endeavors to develop and evaluate interventions designed to stimulate improvement in friendship, self-esteem and subjective well-being, as well as to reduce loneliness among older citizens. 3) Evaluation of self-management programs in chronic disease conditions (such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, poor nutrition, physical inactivity, alcohol abuse and tobacco smoking), that could enhance risk factors for health in elderly citizens. Typical key elements of self-management, such as decision making, problem solving, motivation, self-efficacy, resource utilization, and citizen's empowerment have to be studied. © 2014 The authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={We developed recently a binge-eating model in which female rats with a history of intermittent food restriction show binge-like palatable food consumption after 15 min exposure to the sight of the palatable food. This "frustration stress" manipulation also activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis. Here, we determined the role of the stress neurohormone corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in stress-induced binge eating in our model. We also assessed the role of CRF receptors in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a brain region implicated in stress responses and stress-induced drug seeking, in stress-induced binge eating. We used four groups that were first exposed or not exposed to repeated intermittent cycles of regular chow food restriction during which they were also given intermittent access to high-caloric palatable food. On the test day, we either exposed or did not expose the rats to the sight of the palatable food for 15 min (frustration stress) before assessing food consumption for 2 h. We found that systemic injections of the CRF1 receptor antagonist R121919 (2,5-dimethyl-3-(6-dimethyl-4-methylpyridin-3-yl)-7 dipropylamino pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine) (10-20 mg/kg) and BNST (25-50 ng/side) or ventricular (1000 ng) injections of the nonselective CRF receptor antagonist D-Phe-CRF(12-41) decreased frustration stress-induced binge eating in rats with a history of food restriction. Frustration stress also increased Fos (a neuronal activity marker) expression in ventral and dorsal BNST. Results demonstrate a critical role of CRF receptors in BNST in stress-induced binge eating in our rat model. CRF1 receptor antagonists may represent a novel pharmacological treatment for bingeing-related eating disorders. © 2014 the authors.},

abstract={This study examined whether dietary supply of DHA and phospholipids during early ontogeny affected the outcome of behavioural challenges in pike perch larvae and fry, and whether the history of lipid nutrition carried over in long-term effects on learning ability. Pike perch larvae were fed Artemia enriched with either refined olive oil high in oleic acid (A); refined olive oil supplemented with a low (B) or a high (C) level of DHA; or refined olive oil acid supplemented with fish oil with a high content of phospholipids (PL) and DHA (D). The enriched live diets were provided until 28. days post hatch (dph), at which time larval behavioural responses to visual and mechano-sensory stimuli were assessed. All dietary groups were subsequently fed an identical enriched live feed (diet D) and gradually weaned to an extruded dry feed, on which they were maintained for 112. days. At the end of this period, assessment of fry avoidance behaviour was repeated and individuals were tested for spatial learning ability in a maze. At the larval stage, individuals maintained on Artemia rich in DHA showed a 5-8 fold increase in swimming speed when subjected to a visually simulated predator test, a response that was not observed for larvae on diets low in DHA content. Independent of the predator simulation, larvae deficient or low in DHA exhibited significantly more time swimming along the edge of a test arena and had overall higher locomotor activities compared to larvae fed a diet with a high DHA content. Larvae on DHA rich diets showed an ability to achieve significantly higher peak acceleration rates during the escape response, which was maintained at 112 dph. Time spent locating the exit of a maze decreased with repetitious training sessions, although fish fed diets low in DHA spent longer time in the maze, caused by extended periods of inactivity or "freezing" behaviour (time lag) prior to the onset of active searching behaviour.The consistency of behavioural responses to mechano-sensory stimuli in larvae and fry suggests long-term effects on the neuromuscular path-way involved in escape responses. A longer period of freezing in the learning test may reflect a more anxious and fragile behaviour profile in fish fed low levels of DHA. Further studies should aim at verifying whether this affects performance related traits, such as immune competence and robustness. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder affecting 5-10% of children. One of the suggested mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of ADHD is insufficient energy supply to neurons. Here, we investigated the role of omega 3 fatty acids in altering neural energy metabolism and behavior of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), which is an animal model of ADHD. To this end, we employed Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H MRS) to evaluate changes in brain neurochemistry in the SHR following consumption of one of three experimental diets (starting PND 21): fish oil enriched (FOE), regular (RD) and animal fat enriched (AFE) diet. Behavioral tests were performed to evaluate differences in locomotor activity and risk-taking behavior (starting PND 44). Comparison of frontal lobe metabolites showed that increased amounts of omega 3 fatty acids decreased total Creatine levels (tCr), but did not change Glutamate (Glu), total N-Acetylaspartate (tNAA), Lactate (Lac), Choline (Cho) or Inositol (Ino) levels. Although behavior was not significantly affected by different diets, significant correlations were observed between brain metabolites and behavior in the open field and elevated plus maze. SHR with higher levels of brain tCr and Glu exhibited greater hyperactivity in a familiar environment. On the other hand, risk-taking exploration of the elevated plus maze's open arms correlated negatively with forebrain tNAA and Lac levels. These findings support the possible alteration in energy metabolites in ADHD, correlating with hyperactivity in the animal model. The data also suggest that omega 3 fatty acids alter brain energy and phospholipid metabolism. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a chronic eating disorder affecting females and males, defined by body weight loss, higher physical activity levels and restricted food intake. Currently, the commonalities and differences between genders in etiology of AN are not well understood. Animal models of AN, such as activity-based anorexia (ABA), can be helpful in identifying factors determining individual susceptibility to AN. In ABA, rodents are given an access to a running wheel while food restricted, resulting in paradoxical increased physical activity levels and weight loss. Recent studies suggest that different behavioral traits, including voluntary exercise, can predict individual weight loss in ABA. A higher inherent drive for movement may promote development and severity of AN, but this hypothesis remains untested. In rodents and humans, drive for movement is defined as spontaneous physical activity (SPA), which is time spent in low-intensity, non-volitional movements. In this paper, we show that a profile of body weight history and behavioral traits, including SPA, can predict individual weight loss caused by ABA in male and female rats with high accuracy. Analysis of the influence of SPA on ABA susceptibility in males and females rats suggests that either high or low levels of SPA increase the probability of high weight loss in ABA, but with larger effects in males compared to females. These results suggest that the same behavioral profile can identify individuals at-risk of AN for both male and female populations and that SPA has predictive value for susceptibility to AN. © 2013.},

abstract={Food and beverage intake is the only behavior that animals, including human beings, must continually repeat in order to provide energy and chemical materials to the body. Recent epidemiological findings are poised to usher the science of nutrition into in a new era in which the consumption of specific whole foods, now called functional foods, is strongly associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. These findings have led to the hypothesis that specific food components, in particular phenolic compounds, interact with the human organism at the organ, cellular, and molecular levels to trigger a preventive action against chronic diseases. Numerous bioactive compounds have been identified and isolated from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and are now present in all drugstores as dietary supplements to the usual intake of amino acids, vitamin, botanical compounds, and so on, although much basic information about their action in humans remains limited. For example, no stratification by sex has been performed in studies of their effects. Although human beings are mainly made up of men and women, in recent years it has become accepted that both biological sex and gender are prominent players in health and medicine. Until the last decade of the 20th century, research on women was neglected and results obtained in men were directly translated to women, both in medicine and in nutrition. Different strategies have been developed in order to maintain male and female body homeostasis, implying that there are important differences in the bioavailability, metabolism, distribution, and elimination of bioactive compounds in males and in females. This article will review some of these differences underlying the possibility that plant-derived phenolic compounds can differently influence the health of male and female individuals. © 2014 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

abstract={Analysis of selective sweeps to pinpoint causative genomic regions involved in chicken domestication has revealed a strong selective sweep on chromosome 4 in layer chickens. The autoregulatory α-adrenergic receptor 2C (ADRA2C) gene is the closest to the selective sweep and was proposed as an important gene in the domestication of layer chickens. The ADRA2C promoter region was also hypermethylated in comparison to the non-selected ancestor of all domesticated chicken breeds, the Red Junglefowl, further supporting its relevance. In mice the receptor is involved in the fight-or-flight response as it modulates epinephrine release from the adrenals. To investigate the involvement of ADRA2C in chicken domestication, we measured gene expression in the adrenals and radiolabeled receptor ligand in three brain regions comparing the domestic White Leghorn strain with the wild ancestor Red Junglefowl. In adrenals ADRA2C was twofold greater expressed than the related receptor gene ADRA2A, indicating that ADRA2C is the predominant modulator of epinephrine release but no strain differences were measured. In hypothalamus and amygdala, regions associated with the stress response, and in striatum, receptor binding pIC50 values ranged between 8.1-8.4, and the level was not influenced by the genotyped allele. Because chicken strains differ in morphology, physiology and behavior, differences attributed to a single gene may be lost in the noise caused by the heterogeneous genetic background. Therefore an F10 advanced intercross strain between White Leghorn and Red Junglefowl was used to investigate effects of ADRA2C alleles on fear related behaviors and fecundity. We did not find compelling genotype effects in open field, tonic immobility, aerial predator, associative learning or fecundity. Therefore we conclude that ADRA2C is probably not involved in the domestication of the stress response in chicken, and the strong selective sweep is probably caused by selection of some unknown genetic element in the vicinity of the gene. © 2014 Elfwing et al.},

abstract={Broiler breeders (parents of meat chickens) are selected for fast growth and become obese if fed ad libitum. To avoid this and maintain good health and reproductive ability, they are feed restricted to about 1/3 of what they would eat ad libitum. As a result, they experience chronic hunger and exhibit abnormal behaviour patterns that may indicate stress and frustration. One approach to measuring hunger is to observe how much birds will work, such as pecking a key, for access to more or different types of food. However, the sight, smell, and feedback from consumption of the feed reward changes the context and may artificially raise feeding motivation. To avoid this, we tested broiler breeders in an apparatus in which they could work for access to a wooden platform covered in wood shavings by crossing a water runway which increased in length and depth in 8 successive tests. In the wood shavings area, they could perform exploratory and foraging behaviour (the appetitive phase of feeding) but were never rewarded with feed. Sixty birds were divided into three feed quantity treatments: commercial restriction (R), and twice (2R) or three times (3R) this amount. Overall, birds fed R worked harder to reach the wood shavings area (reached it in a larger number of tests) than 2R and 3R birds (P<0.001). More restricted birds took less time to reach the area (P<0.001, R<2R<3R) and spent more time foraging while there (P<0.001, R>2R>3R). This indicates that restricted-fed birds were hungry and willing to work for the opportunity to forage even though food was never provided, suggesting that their motivation to perform the appetitive component of feeding behaviour (foraging/food searching) was sufficient to sustain their response. Thus food restriction in broiler breeders is a welfare concern. However these methods could be used to test alternative feeding regimes to attempt to find ways of alleviating hunger while still maintaining healthy growth and reproduction in these birds. © 2014 Dixon et al.},

abstract={Background: Because early life growth has long-lasting metabolic and behavioral consequences, intervention during this period of developmental plasticity may alter long-term obesity risk. While modifiable factors during infancy have been identified, until recently, preventive interventions had not been tested. The Intervention Nurses Starting Infants Growing on Healthy Trajectories (INSIGHT). Study is a longitudinal, randomized, controlled trial evaluating a responsive parenting intervention designed for the primary prevention of obesity. This " parenting" intervention is being compared with a home safety control among first-born infants and their parents. INSIGHT's central hypothesis is that responsive parenting and specifically responsive feeding promotes self-regulation and shared parent-child responsibility for feeding, reducing subsequent risk for overeating and overweight.Methods/Design: 316 first-time mothers and their full-term newborns were enrolled from one maternity ward. Two weeks following delivery, dyads were randomly assigned to the " parenting" or " safety" groups. Subsequently, research nurses conduct study visits for both groups consisting of home visits at infant age 3-4, 16, 28, and 40 weeks, followed by annual clinic-based visits at 1, 2, and 3 years. Both groups receive intervention components framed around four behavior states: Sleeping, Fussy, Alert and Calm, and Drowsy. The main study outcome is BMI z-score at age 3 years; additional outcomes include those related to patterns of infant weight gain, infant sleep hygiene and duration, maternal responsiveness and soothing strategies for infant/toddler distress and fussiness, maternal feeding style and infant dietary content and physical activity. Maternal outcomes related to weight status, diet, mental health, and parenting sense of competence are being collected. Infant temperament will be explored as a moderator of parenting effects, and blood is collected to obtain genetic predictors of weight status. Finally, second-born siblings of INSIGHT participants will be enrolled in an observation-only study to explore parenting differences between siblings, their effect on weight outcomes, and carryover effects of INSIGHT interventions to subsequent siblings.Discussion: With increasing evidence suggesting the importance of early life experiences on long-term health trajectories, the INSIGHT trial has the ability to inform future obesity prevention efforts in clinical settings.Trial registration: NCT01167270.

abstract={Individual variation in behavioural traits (including responses to social cues) may influence the success of invasive populations. We studied the relationship between sociality and personality in invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) from a recently established population in tropical Australia. In our field experiments, we manipulated social cues (the presence of a feeding conspecific) near a food source. We captured and compared toads that only approached feeding sites where another toad was already present, with conspecifics that approached unoccupied feeding sites. Subsequent laboratory trials showed correlated personality differences (behavioural syndromes) between these two groups of toads. For example, toads that approached already-occupied rather than unoccupied feeding sites in the field, took longer to emerge from a shelter-site in standardized trials, suggesting these individuals are 'shy' (whereas toads that approached unoccupied feeding stations tended to be 'bold'). Manipulating hunger levels did not abolish this difference. In feeding trials, a bold toad typically outcompeted a shy toad under conditions of low prey availability, but the outcome was reversed when multiple prey items were present. Thus, both personality types may be favored under different circumstances. This invasive population of toads contains individuals that exhibit a range of personalities, hinting at the existence of a wide range of social dynamics in taxa traditionally considered to be asocial. © 2014 González-Bernal et al.},

abstract={The delayed onset of therapeutic outcomes is a major drawback of the current antidepressants. The blood-brain barrier is the most important bottleneck impeding drug transport into the brain. Therefore, development of novel antidepressant medications with rapid onset and sustained activity is urgent. RGD liposomes showed an excellent effect of brain-targeting drug delivery and increased the entering rate to the brain. In the present study, we prepared cyclic RGD liposomes loaded with edaravone (cRGD-ERLs) and evaluated the potential antidepressant-like effects of this drug delivery system in rats. The results showed single injection of cRGD-ERLs produced significant antidepressant-like effects in both forced swim and novelty suppressed feeding test. Moreover, acute cRGD-ERLs increased the expression of c-fos in the medial prefrontal cortex, suggesting that cRGD-ERLs could activate the neuronal function. Furthermore, cRGD-ERLs reversed the increase of lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced plasma cytokine IL-1β and IL-6, suggesting that normalization of cytokine level might be involved in the behavioral response of cRGD-ERLs. Finally, cRGD-ERLs prevented the increase of immobility induced by LPS in the forced swim test. Overall, the current data revealed a novel brain-target drug delivery system, which can be used to improve the therapeutic outcomes of antidepressants by increase of crossing rate to the brain. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={When individuals disperse, they modify the physical and social composition of their reproductive environment, potentially impacting their fitness. The choice an individual makes between dispersal and philopatry is thus critical, hence a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the decision to leave the natal area is crucial. We explored how combinations of behavioural (exploration, mobility, activity and stress response) and morphological (body mass) traits measured prior to dispersal were linked to the subsequent dispersal decision in 77 roe deer Capreolus capreolus fawns. Using an unusually detailed multi-trait approach, we identified two independent behavioural continuums related to dispersal. First, a continuum of energetic expenditure contrasted individuals of low mobility, low variability in head activity and low body temperature with those that displayed opposite traits. Second, a continuum of neophobia contrasted individuals that explored more prior to dispersal and were more tolerant of capture with those that displayed opposite traits. While accounting for possible confounding effects of condition- dependence (body mass), we showed that future dispersers were less neophobic and had higher energetic budgets than future philopatric individuals, providing strong support for a dispersal syndrome in this species. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Human studies indicate that alcohol exposure during gestation not only increases the chance for later alcohol abuse, but also nicotine dependence. The flavor attributes of both alcohol and nicotine can be important determinants of their initial acceptance and they both share the component chemosensory qualities of an aversive odor, bitter taste and oral irritation. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating epigenetic chemosensory mechanisms through which fetal alcohol exposure increases adolescent alcohol acceptance, in part, by decreasing the aversion to alcohol's bitter and oral irritation qualities, as well as its odor. Given that alcohol and nicotine have noteworthy chemosensory qualities in common, we investigated whether fetal exposure to alcohol increased the acceptability of nicotine's odor and taste in adolescent rats. Study rats were alcohol-exposed during fetal development via the dams' liquid diet. Control animals received ad lib access to an iso-caloric, iso-nutritive diet throughout gestation. Odorant-induced innate behavioral responses to nicotine odor (Experiment 1) or orosensory-mediated responses to nicotine solutions (Experiment 2) were obtained, using whole-body plethysmography and brief access lick tests, respectively. Compared to controls, rats exposed to fetal alcohol showed an enhanced nicotine odor response that was paralleled by increased oral acceptability of nicotine. Given the common aversive component qualities imbued in the flavor profiles of both drugs, our findings demonstrate that like postnatal alcohol avidity, fetal alcohol exposure also influences nicotine acceptance, at a minimum, by decreasing the aversion of both its smell and taste. Moreover, they highlight potential chemosensory-based mechanism(s) by which fetal alcohol exposure increases the later initial risk for nicotine use, thereby contributing to the co-morbid expression with enhanced alcohol avidity. Where common chemosensory mechanisms are at play, our results suggest broader implications related to the consequence of fetal exposure with one substance of abuse and initial acceptability of others. © 2014 Mantella, Youngentob.},

abstract={Brain cholinergic dysfunction is associated with neuropsychiatric illnesses such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Maternal stress exposure is associated with these same illnesses in adult offspring, yet the relationship between prenatal stress and brain cholinergic function is largely unexplored. Thus, using a rodent model, the current study implemented an intervention aimed at buffering the potential effects of prenatal stress on the developing brain cholinergic system. Specifically, control and stressed dams were fed choline-supplemented or control chow during pregnancy and lactation, and the anxiety-related behaviors of adult offspring were assessed in the open field, elevated zero maze and social interaction tests. In the open field test, choline supplementation significantly increased center investigation in both stressed and nonstressed female offspring, suggesting that choline-supplementation decreases female anxiety-related behavior irrespective of prenatal stress exposure. In the elevated zero maze, prenatal stress increased anxiety-related behaviors of female offspring fed a control diet (normal choline levels). However, prenatal stress failed to increase anxiety-related behaviors in female offspring receiving supplemental choline during gestation and lactation, suggesting that dietary choline supplementation ameliorated the effects of prenatal stress on anxiety-related behaviors. For male rats, neither prenatal stress nor diet impacted anxiety-related behaviors in the open field or elevated zero maze. In contrast, perinatal choline supplementation mitigated prenatal stress-induced social behavioral deficits in males, whereas neither prenatal stress nor choline supplementation influenced female social behaviors. Taken together, these data suggest that perinatal choline supplementation ameliorates the sex-specific effects of prenatal stress. © 2014.},

abstract={Alcohol use is common in adolescence, with a large portion of intake occurring during episodes of binging. This pattern of alcohol consumption coincides with a critical period for neurocognitive development and may impact decision-making and reward processing. Prior studies have demonstrated alterations in adult decision-making following adolescent usage, but it remains to be seen if these alterations exist in adolescence, or are latent until adulthood. Here, using a translational model of voluntary binge alcohol consumption in adolescents, we assess the impact of alcohol intake on risk preference and behavioral flexibility during adolescence. During adolescence (postnatal day 30-50), rats were given 1-hour access to either a 10% alcohol gelatin mixture (EtOH) or a calorie equivalent gelatin (Control) at the onset of the dark cycle. EtOH consuming rats were classified as either High or Low consumers based on intake levels. Adolescent rats underwent behavioral testing once a day, with one group performing a risk preference task, and a second group performing a reversal-learning task during the 20-day period of gelatin access. EtOH-High rats showed increases in risk preference compared to Control rats, but not EtOH-Low animals. However, adolescent rats did a poor job of matching their behavior to optimize outcomes, suggesting that adolescents may adopt a response bias. In addition, adolescent ethanol exposure did not affect the animals' ability to flexibly adapt behavior to changing reward contingencies during reversal learning. These data support the view that adolescent alcohol consumption can have short-term detrimental effects on risk-taking when examined during adolescence, which does not seem to be attributable to an inability to flexibly encode reward contingencies on behavioral responses. © 2014 McMurray et al.},

abstract={Background: The consumption of sweetened beverages is a known common risk factor for the development of obesity and dental caries in children and children consume sweet drinks frequently and in large volumes from an early age. The aim of this study was to examine factors that influence mothers when choosing drinks for their children. Method. Semi-structured interviews (n = 32) were conducted with a purposive sample of mothers of young children from Victoria's Barwon South Western Region (selected from a larger cohort study to include families consuming different types of water, and different socioeconomic status and size). Inductive thematic analysis was conducted on transcribed interviews. Results: Several themes emerged as influencing child drink choice. Child age: Water was the main beverage for the youngest child however it was seen as more acceptable to give older children sweetened beverages. Child preference and temperament: influencing when and if sweet drinks were given; Family influences such as grandparents increased children's consumption of sweet drinks, often providing children drinks such as fruit juice and soft drinks regardless of maternal disapproval. The Setting: children were more likely to be offered sweetened drinks either as a reward or treat for good behaviour or when out shopping, out for dinner or at parties. Conclusions: Limiting intake of sweet drinks is considered an important step for child general and oral health. However, the choice of drinks for children has influences from social, environmental and behavioural domains, indicating that a multi-strategy approach is required to bring about this change. © 2014 Hoare et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Acute ethanol administration is associated with sedation and analgesia as well as behavioral disinhibition and memory loss but the mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be elucidated. During the past decade, insects have emerged as important model systems to understand the neural and genetic bases of alcohol effects. However, novel assays to assess ethanol's effects on complex behaviors in social or isolated contexts are necessary. Here we used the honey bee as an especially relevant model system since bees are typically exposed to ethanol in nature when collecting standing nectar crop of flowers, and there is recent evidence for independent biological significance of this exposure for social behavior. Bee's inhibitory control of the sting extension response (SER) and a conditioned-place aversion assay were used to study ethanol effects on analgesia, behavioral disinhibition, and associative learning. Our findings indicate that although ethanol, in a dose-dependent manner, increases SER thresholds (analgesic effects), it disrupts the ability of honey bees to inhibit SER and to associate aversive stimuli with their environment. These results suggest that ethanol's effects on analgesia, behavioral disinhibition and associative learning are common across vertebrates and invertebrates. These results add to the use of honey bees as an ethanol model to understand ethanol's effects on complex, socially relevant behaviors. © 2014 Giannoni-Guzmán et al.},

abstract={A growing body of research over the past decade indicates that interindividual variation in behavior can result from a variety of factors. Two important sources of this variation are behavioral plasticity (adaptive variation in behavior) and behavioral type (i.e., an individual with consistent behavioral differences across one or more situations). Although oviposition-site selection (OS) is widespread and affects both parents and offspring, it has been overlooked in the context of the behavioral type. Thus, we used the Texas field cricket (Gryllus texensis) to determine if OS could be integrated into the behavioral type paradigm and if a relevant environmental variable (food limitation) influences behavioral type. We found that behavioral type was consistent across contexts because individuals exhibiting riskier (bolder) behavior in a novel environment also exhibited riskier behavior during oviposition. Also, individuals traded off safety with food availability during oviposition - that is, fasted crickets were more likely to choose food over safety (shelter) when making an oviposition decision. Last, relative to fed crickets, those that were fasted oviposited fewer eggs during overnight trials in which food was available. By integrating a behavior tightly linked to multigenerational fitness with an established behavioral assay (behavior to novel stimuli), we show that behavioral type can be both consistent across contexts and plastic in response to a ubiquitous environmental factor (food limitation). © The Author 2014.},

abstract={The relationship between intake rate and food density can provide the foundation for models that predict the spatiotemporal distribution of organisms across a range of resource densities. The functional response, describing the relationship between resource density and intake rate is often interpreted mechanistically as the relationships between times spend searching and handling. While several functional response models incorporate anti-predator vigilance (defined here as an interruption of feeding or some other activity to visually scan the environment, directed mainly towards detecting potential predators), the impacts of environmental factors influencing directly anti-predator vigilance remains unclear. We examined the combined effects of different scenarios of predation risk and food density on time allocation between foraging and anti-predator vigilance in a granivorous species. We experimentally exposed Skylarks to various cover heights and seed densities, and measured individual time budget and pecking and intake rates. Our results indicated that time devoted to different activities varied as a function of both seed density and cover height. Foraging time increased with seed density for all cover heights. Conversely, an increased cover height resulted in a decreased foraging time. Contrary to males, the decreased proportion of time spent foraging did not translate into a foraging disadvantage for females. When vegetation height was higher, females maintained similar pecking and intake rates compared to intermediate levels, while males consistently decreased their energy gain. This difference in anti-predator responses suggests a sexually mediated strategy in the food-safety trade-off: when resource density is high a females would adopt a camouflage strategy while an escape strategy would be adopted by males. In other words, males would leave risky-areas, whereas females would stay when resource density is high. Our results suggest that increased predation risk might generate sexually mediated behavioural responses that functional response models should perhaps better consider in the future. © 2014 Powolny et al.},

abstract={Background: Epidemiological studies have shown associations between vitamin D, mental health and glucose homeostasis in the elderly. Causal evidence, however, is still lacking. Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the importance of vitamin D in the prevention of emotional disturbances and cognitive decline in aging C57BL/6 mice, with pre-diabetes type II as potential effect modifier. Methods: Mice were exposed to one of four diets from 10 months till 24 months of age: low fat vitamin D adequate (LFD), LF vitamin D deficient (LF), moderate fat vitamin D adequate (MFD), and MF vitamin D deficient (MF). The MFD/MF diet was applied to induce a condition resembling pre-diabetes type II. Behavior was assessed twice in the same group of mice at 6-8 and at 22-23 months of age using the Open Field Test (OFT), Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), Object Recognition Test (ORT) and the Morris Water Maze (MWM). Results: We successfully induced vitamin D deficiency in the LF/MF mice. Moreover, fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels were significantly higher in MFD/MF mice than in LFD/LF mice. A significant aging effect was observed for most behavioral parameters. A MF(D) diet was shown to delay or prevent the age-related increase in emotional reactivity in the EPM. No effect of vitamin D or vitamin D*fat on behavioral outcomes was measured. Conclusion: Aging significantly affected emotional reactivity and cognitive performance. Although other studies have shown effects of vitamin D on emotional reactivity and cognitive performance in mice, these findings could not be confirmed in aged C57BL/6 mice in this study. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Early human food cultures were plant-based. Major religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism have recommended a vegetarian way of life since their conception. The recorded history of vegetarian nutrition started in the sixth century BC by followers of the Orphic mysteries. The Greek philosopher Pythagoras is considered the father of ethical vegetarianism. The Pythagorean way of life was followed by a number of important personalities and influenced vegetarian nutrition until the 19th century. In Europe, vegetarian nutrition more or less disappeared during the Middle Ages. In the Renaissance era and in the Age of Enlightenment, various personalities practiced vegetarianism. The first vegetarian society was started in England in 1847. The International Vegetarian Society was founded in 1908 and the first vegan society began in 1944. Prominent vegetarians during this time included Sylvester Graham, John Harvey Kellogg, and Maximilian Bircher-Benner. A paradigm shift occurred at the turn of the 21st century. The former prejudices that vegetarianism leads to malnutrition were replaced by scientific evidence showing that vegetarian nutrition reduces the risk of most contemporary diseases. Today, vegetarian nutrition has a growing international following and is increasingly accepted. The main reasons for this trend are health concerns and ethical, ecologic, and social issues. The future of vegetarian nutrition is promising because sustainable nutrition is crucial for the well-being of humankind. An increasing number of people do not want animals to suffer nor do they want climate change; they want to avoid preventable diseases and to secure a livable future for generations to come. © 2014 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={We present a complete hardware and software system for collecting and quantifying continuous measures of feeding behaviors in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. The FLIC (Fly Liquid-Food Interaction Counter) detects analog electronic signals as brief as 50 ms that occur when a fly makes physical contact with liquid food. Signal characteristics effectively distinguish between different types of behaviors, such as feeding and tasting events. The FLIC system performs as well or better than popular methods for simple assays, and it provides an unprecedented opportunity to study novel components of feeding behavior, such as time-dependent changes in food preference and individual levels of motivation and hunger. Furthermore, FLIC experiments can persist indefinitely without disturbance, and we highlight this ability by establishing a detailed picture of circadian feeding behaviors in the fly. We believe that the FLIC system will work hand-in-hand with modern molecular techniques to facilitate mechanistic studies of feeding behaviors in Drosophila using modern, high-throughput technologies. © 2014 Ro et al.},

abstract={Affective disorders such as depression and anxiety disorders have a high lifetime prevalence. Risk for these devastating diseases is increased by genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, and gene by environment interactions which are believed to be mediated, in part, by epigenetic mechanisms. To better investigate epigenetic modifications, animal models of environmental challenges are employed and changes in gene expression and behaviors that model aspects of affective disorders are assessed. These animal models include maternal exposure to stress, toxins, and nutritional deficiencies in the prenatal period; maternal care in the postnatal period; and exposure to social stress and hormonal changes in adulthood. Behavior and gene expression changes in response to these manipulations have been linked to changes in DNA methylation and histone acetylation of specific genes, including Bdnf, Nr3c1 (. GR), and Crh in the brain. Existing treatments for anxiety and depression are not efficacious for many patients, and a better understanding of the etiology of these diseases may improve treatment options. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Objective: We investigated the association between late-life cynical distrust and incident dementia and mortality (mean follow-up times of 8.4 and 10.4 years, respectively) in the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia Study. Methods: Cynical distrust was measured based on the Cook-Medley Scale and categorized into tertiles. Cognitive status was evaluated with a 3-step protocol including screening, clinical phase, and differential diagnostic phase. Dementia was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria. Complete data on exposure, outcome, and confounders were available from622 persons (46 dementia cases) for the dementia analyses and from 1,146 persons (361 deaths) for the mortality analyses. Age, sex, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, fasting glucose, bodymass index, socioeconomic background, smoking, alcohol use, self-reported health, and APOE genotype were considered as confounders. Results: Cynical distrust was not associated with dementia in the crude analyses, but those with the highest level of cynical distrust had higher risk of dementia after adjusting for confounders (relative risk 3.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-8.55). Higher cynical distrust was associated with higher mortality in the crude analyses (hazard ratio 1.40; 95% CI 1.05-1.87) but the association was explained by confounders (adjusted hazard ratio 1.19; 95% CI 0.86-1.61). Conclusions: Higher cynical distrust in late life was associated with higher mortality, but this association was explained by socioeconomic position, lifestyle, and health status. Association between cynical distrust and incident dementia became evident when confounders were considered. This novel finding suggests that both psychosocial and lifestyle-related risk factors may be modifiable targets for interventions.

abstract={The global pandemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes is often causally linked to marked changes in diet and lifestyle; namely marked increases in dietary intakes of high energy diets and concomitant reductions in physical activity levels. However, less attention has been paid to the role of developmental plasticity and alterations in phenotypic outcomes resulting from altered environmental conditions during the early life period. Human and experimental animal studies have highlighted the link between alterations in the early life environment and increased risk of obesity and metabolic disorders in later life. This link is conceptualised as the developmental programming hypothesis whereby environmental influences during critical periods of developmental plasticity can elicit lifelong effects on the health and well-being of the offspring. In particular, the nutritional environment in which the fetus or infant develops influences the risk of metabolic disorders in offspring. The late onset of such diseases in response to earlier transient experiences has led to the suggestion that developmental programming may have an epigenetic component, as epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation or histone tail modifications could provide a persistent memory of earlier nutritional states. Moreover, evidence exists, at least from animal models, that such epigenetic programming should be viewed as a transgenerational phenomenon. However, the mechanisms by which early environmental insults can have long-term effects on offspring are relatively unclear. Thus far, these mechanisms include permanent structural changes to the organ caused by suboptimal levels of an important factor during a critical developmental period, changes in gene expression caused by epigenetic modifications (including DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA) and permanent changes in cellular ageing. A better understanding of the epigenetic basis of developmental programming and how these effects may be transmitted across generations is essential for the implementation of initiatives aimed at curbing the current obesity and diabetes crisis. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Background: Sensory properties of foods promote and guide consumption in hunger states, whereas satiation should dampen the sensory activation of ingestive behaviors. Such activation may be disordered in obese individuals. Objective: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we studied regional brain responses to food odor stimulation in the sated state in obese and normal-weight individuals targeting ventral frontal regions known to be involved in coding for stimulus reward value. Design: Forty-eight women (25 normal weight; 23 obese) participated in a 2-day (fed compared with fasting) fMRI study while smelling odors of 2 foods and an inedible, nonfood object. Analyses were conducted to permit an examination of both general and sensory- specific satiation (satiation effects specific to a given food). Results: Normal-weight subjects showed significant blood oxygen level-dependent responses in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) to food aromas compared with responses induced by the odor of an inedible object. Normal-weight subjects also showed general (but not sensory-specific) satiation effects in both the vmPFC and orbitofrontal cortex. Obese subjects showed no differential response to the aromas of food and the inedible object when fasting. Within- and between-group differences in satiation were driven largely by changes in the response to the odor of the inedible stimulus. Responses to food aromas in the obese correlated with trait negative urgency, the tendency toward negative affect-provoked impulsivity. Conclusions: Ventral frontal signaling of reward value may be disordered in obesity, with negative urgency heightening responses to food aromas. The observed nature of responses to food and nonfood stimuli suggests that future research should independently quantify each to fully understand brain reward signaling in obesity.

abstract={Objectives: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has greater efficacy for weight loss in obese patients than gastric banding (BAND) surgery. We hypothesise that this may result from different effects on food hedonics via physiological changes secondary to distinct gut anatomy manipulations. Design: We used functional MRI, eating behaviour and hormonal phenotyping to compare body mass index (BMI)-matched unoperated controls and patients after RYGB and BAND surgery for obesity. Results: Obese patients after RYGB had lower brain-hedonic responses to food than patients after BAND surgery. RYGB patients had lower activation than BAND patients in brain reward systems, particularly to high-calorie foods, including the orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens and hippocampus. This was associated with lower palatability and appeal of high-calorie foods and healthier eating behaviour, including less fat intake, in RYGB compared with BAND patients and/or BMI-matched unoperated controls. These differences were not explicable by differences in hunger or psychological traits between the surgical groups, but anorexigenic plasma gut hormones (GLP-1 and PYY), plasma bile acids and symptoms of dumping syndrome were increased in RYGB patients. Conclusions: The identification of these differences in food hedonic responses as a result of altered gut anatomy/physiology provides a novel explanation for the more favourable long-term weight loss seen after RYGB than after BAND surgery, highlighting the importance of the gut-brain axis in the control of reward-based eating behaviour.},

abstract={We tested the hypothesis that rats consuming bovine lactoferrin (bLf) during postnatal development would show better performance of stressful tasks during adolescence. In the first study, we orally administered bLf (750 mg/kg) once daily between postnatal days 16-34. Rats then underwent a battery of behavioral tests: open field (forced exploration of risky environment), light-dark emergence (voluntary exploration of risky environment), baited holeboard (working and reference memory), food neophobia (preference for familiar versus novel food), forced swim (test for antidepressant efficacy), and shuttle-box escape (learning to escape footshock). bLf-supplemented rats showed less exploration of the risky environment, greater preference for the familiar food odor, and faster escape responses. The effect of bLf on forced-swim behavior depended on sex: immobility increased for males and decreased for females. In the next study, we replaced the forced-swim test with an escape-swim test in which rats learned to use a visual cue to locate an escape platform, and we tested the dose response of bLf on this and the shuttle-box escape test, with subjects receiving vehicle or bLf at 500, 1,000, or 2,000 mg/kg. Under this modified testing battery, improvement of escape from footshock was not observed at any dose. However, males, but not females, showed a significant dose-dependent effect of bLf on acquisition of the water-escape task. On average, males receiving a higher dose mastered the task 20-25 % sooner than rats receiving a lower dose or vehicle. These results offer preliminary evidence that bLf supplementation during development can improve subsequent cognitive performance during stress. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) fishery in the Bering Sea is one of the largest fisheries in the world. The North Pacific Fishery Management Council (NPFMC) provides management advice for this fishery, including the development of measures to minimize salmon bycatch to the extent practicable, one of the stated objectives of the US Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act National Standard Guidelines. Salmon have a unique cultural and nutritional importance in the State of Alaska and are the subject of fully allocated mixed commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries. Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) stocks in Alaska have been declining for the last decade, and all sources of mortality are being considered to help in rebuilding stocks. Given the extensive scientific National Marine Fisheries Service observer data collection programme, the NPFMC has developed bycatch management measures that place limits by fishery sector on the allowable catch of Chinook salmon. Part of this programme includes industry-proposed incentive programmes designed to encourage lower bycatch. Evaluating the efficacy of the new measures poses a number of challenges, particularly in light of changing ocean conditions (perhaps affecting the degree of overlap between pollock and salmon). In this study, data on pre- and post-programme implementation were evaluated to determine if the programme is meeting stated goals and objectives or if modifications are needed. These evaluations included consideration of fleet-level bycatch numbers and rates, seasonality of bycatch by sector, and individual vessel bycatch rates. Results suggest that revised management regulations appear to have resulted in reduced bycatch of salmon overall. Also, lower bycatch rates seem to reflect changing behaviour in response to new management measures. However, the extent to which the programme is effective at the vessel level remains difficult to ascertain without explicit vessel-specific benchmarks developed for evaluating programme efficacy. © Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2014.},

abstract={Cognitive impairment associated with prefrontal cortical dysfunction is a major component of disability in traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors. Specifically, deficits of cognitive flexibility and attentional set-shifting are present across all levels of injury severity. Though alterations in spatial learning have been extensively described in experimental models of TBI, studies investigating more complex cognitive deficits are relatively scarce. Hence, the aim of this preclinical study was to expand on this important issue by evaluating the effect of three injury levels on executive function and behavioral flexibility performance as assessed using an attentional set-shifting test (AST). Isoflurane-anesthetized male rats received a controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury (2.6, 2.8, and 3.0 mm cortical depth at 4 m/sec) or sham injury, whereas an additional group had no surgical manipulation (naïve). Four weeks postsurgery, rats were tested on the AST, which involved a series of discriminative tasks of increasing difficulty, such as simple and compound discriminations, stimulus reversals, and intra- and extradimensional (ED) shifts. TBI produced accompanying impact depth-dependent increases in cortical lesion volumes, with the 3.0-mm cortical depth group displaying significantly larger injury volumes than the 2.6-mm group (p=0.05). Further, injury severity-induced deficits in ED set-shifting and stimulus reversals, as well as increases in total response error rates and total set loss errors, were observed. These novel findings demonstrate executive function and behavioral flexibility deficits in our animal model of CCI injury and provide the impetus to integrate the AST in the standard neurotrauma behavioral battery to further evaluate cognitive dysfunction after TBI. Ongoing experiments in our laboratory are assessing AST performance after pharmacological and rehabilitative therapies post-TBI, as well as elucidating possible mechanisms underlying the observed neuropsychological deficits. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.},

abstract={For animals in confinement housing the housing structure has tremendous potential to impact well being. Dogs in animal shelters are often housed in one of two types of confinement housing - single kennels and rooms or double compartment kennels and rooms most often separated by a guillotine door. This study examines the effect of housing on the location of elimination behavior in dogs housed in double compartment kennels were the majority of the dogs were walked daily. One side of the kennel contained the food, water and bed and the other side was empty and available except during cleaning time. Location of urination and defecation was observed daily for 579 dogs housed in indoor double compartment kennels for a total of 4440 days of observation. There were 1856 days (41.9%) when no elimination was noted in the kennel. Feces, urine or both were observed in the kennel on 2584 days (58.1%). When elimination occurred in the kennel the probability of fecal elimination on the opposite side of the bed/food/water was 72.5% (95% CI 69.05% to 75.69%). The probability of urination on the opposite side of the bed/food/water was 77.4% (95% CI 74.33% to 80.07%). This study demonstrates the strong preference of dogs to eliminate away from the area where they eat, drink and sleep. Double compartment housing not only allows this - it allows staff the ability to provide safe, efficient, humane daily care and confers the added benefits of reducing risks for disease transmission for the individual dog as well as the population. © 2014 Wagner et al.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to identify overeating phenotypes and their correlates in overweight and obese children. One hundred and seventeen treatment-seeking overweight and obese 8-12. year-old children and their parents completed the study. Children completed an eating in the absence of hunger (EAH) paradigm, the Eating Disorder Examination interview, and measurements of height and weight. Parents and children completed questionnaires that evaluated satiety responsiveness, food responsiveness, negative affect eating, external eating and eating in the absence of hunger. Latent profile analysis was used to identify heterogeneity in overeating phenotypes in the child participants. Latent classes were then compared on measures of demographics, obesity status and nutritional intake. Three latent classes of overweight and obese children were identified: High Satiety Responsive, High Food Responsive, and Moderate Satiety and Food Responsive. Results indicated that the High Food Responsive group had higher BMI and BMI-Z scores compared to the High Satiety Responsive group. No differences were found among classes in demographics or nutritional intake. This study identified three overeating phenotypes, supporting the heterogeneity of eating patterns associated with overweight and obesity in treatment-seeking children. These finding suggest that these phenotypes can potentially be used to identify high risk groups, inform prevention and intervention targets, and develop specific treatments for these behavioral phenotypes. © 2014.},

abstract={Predators influence prey populations not only through predation itself, but also indirectly through prompting changes in prey behaviour. The behavioural adjustments of prey to predation risk may carry nutritional costs, but this has seldom been studied in the wild in large mammals. Here, we studied the effects of an ambush predator, the African lion (Panthera leo), on the diet quality of plains zebras (Equus quagga) in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. We combined information on movements of both prey and predators, using GPS data, and measurements of faecal crude protein, an index of diet quality in the prey. Zebras which had been in close proximity to lions had a lower quality diet, showing that adjustments in behaviour when lions are within short distance carry nutritional costs. The ultimate fitness cost will depend on the frequency of predator-prey encounters and on whether bottom-up or top-down forces are more important in the prey population. Our finding is the first attempt to our knowledge to assess nutritionally mediated risk effects in a large mammalian prey species under the threat of an ambush predator, and brings support to the hypothesis that the behavioural effects of predation induce important risk effects on prey populations. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Avoiding predation is one of the most important challenges that an animal faces. Several anti-predation behaviours can be employed, yet simply using the presence of conspecifics can be a good signal of safety in an environment with potential predation hazards. Here, we show, for the first time, that past experience of predation causes bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) to aggregate with conspecifics, facilitating the identification of safe foraging patches. Bees were trained to differentiate between flowers that harboured predators and flowers that were predator free. When test subjects were subsequently presented solely with the previously predator-infested flower species, there was a significant preference to only land on flowers occupied by other feeding conspecifics. Yet, when safe flowers were made available to subjects previously entrained to discriminate safe from predator-occupied flowers, subjects ignored other bees and the social information potentially provided by them, demonstrating that attraction towards conspecifics is confined to dangerous situations. Our findings demonstrate a previously unknown social interaction in pollinators which may have important implications for plant-pollinator interactions. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={The performance of herbivorous insects depends on a balance of nutrient uptake and toxin avoidance. Whereas high concentrations of defensive plant metabolites impair both generalists and specialists, generalists are likely less adapted to particular hosts and thus more negatively affected by plant defense traits. Furthermore, resulting diet-dependent differences in the physiological state and the gained experience of an animal may shape its behavior. Here, we investigated the effects of life-long experience with leaves of different quality on the performance and various behavioral traits of the generalist leaf beetle Galeruca tanaceti. Rearing individuals continuously on three different diets [young leaves, old leaves, or leaves of different age of cabbage (Brassicaceae) in alternating order every other day], we found that relative growth rates (RGRs) of the larvae were higher when feeding on young leaves than when feeding on the other diets. Feeding on leaves of different age in alternating order reduced the performance of G. tanaceti, indicating costs involved in diet mixing. The experience gained by the respective food qualities shaped the preference behavior in adult beetles. Positive and negative feedbacks of animals reared on young or old leaves, respectively, led to a preference towards young leaves. In contrast, feedback was probably prevented for animals reared on alternating diet, which did not exhibit any preferences. Older adults did not show any diet-dependent differences in body mass due to physiological changes during adult development. A battery of behavioral tests with the older adults revealed that the behavior was consistent over context and partially over time but behaviors did not differ in dependence of the diet experience. We retrieved three personality dimensions for this species, namely boldness, activity, and exploration. The behavioral structure was very similar to earlier findings for another chrysomelid species, indicating a broader validity of the concept of personality dimensions in insects. Our results demonstrate the importance of both experience- and state-dependence when investigating behavioral phenotypes. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The main goals of this study were to classify dams according to the level of voluntary physical activity before breeding and during pregnancy/lactation and to evaluate the effects on growth trajectory and reflex ontogenesis of offspring. Voluntary physical activity was ranked by traveled distance, time and daily estimated calorie burned. Thirty-five female Wistar rats were classified as control (C, n. = 5), inactive (I, n. = 10), active (A, n. = 8) and very active (VA, n. = 12). During 30. d before breeding, traveled distance, average speed, time and calorie burned were daily recorded for active and very active groups. Traveled distance was recorded each 2. h every day of adaptation. Body weight, food intake and fasting glycemia were measured throughout the experiment. During lactation, litters were evaluated in terms of physical features and reflex ontogeny. VA showed a progressive increase in the traveled distance and time while A dams presented constant values. VA rats showed lower body weight and higher food intake. During pregnancy, both groups performed less than 1. km/day. Pups from A and VA dams showed higher lateral-lateral axis of the skull, longitudinal axis, tail length, and anticipation of the pavilion and auditory canal opening, and erupting incisors. I, A and VA groups showed a delay of righting, cliff aversion and vibrissae placing reflexes. In conclusion, active maternal phenotype is established before breeding allowing mothers to fit ecological and influencing growth trajectory outcomes and reflex ontogeny of the offspring based on matrilineal experience. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Malnutrition is a worldwide problem affecting millions of unborn and young children during the most vulnerable stages of their development. In humans, poor maternal nutrition is a major cause of intrauterine growth restriction which is associated with an increased risk of perinatal mortality and long-term morbidity. In addition, intrauterine growth restriction correlates with neurodevelopmental delays and alterations of brain structure and neurochemistry. While there is no doubt that maternal malnutrition is a principal cause of perturbed development of the fetal brain and that all nutrients have certain influence on brain maturation, proteins appear to be the most critical for the development of neurological functions. In the present study we assessed male and female mouse offspring, born to dams protein restricted during pregnancy and lactation, in physical growth and neurobehavioral development and also in social interaction, motivation, anxiety and depressive behaviors. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of the low protein diet on dams in relation to their maternal care and anxiety-related behavior given that these clearly affect pups development. We observed that maternal protein restriction during pregnancy and lactation delayed the physical growth and neurodevelopment of the offspring in a sex-independent manner. In addition, maternal undernutrition negatively affected offspring's juvenile social play, motivation, exploratory activity and risk assessment behaviors. These findings show that protein restriction during critical periods of development detrimentally program progeny behavior. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Maternal obesity is a risk factor for the development of metabolic syndrome and childhood obesity, and early overnutrition seems to induce the development of pathologies in adulthood, including insulin resistance, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a higher BMI. In addition, it is known that obesity can negatively affect fertility and reproductive function in men. The objective of this work was to investigate the impact of maternal obesity induced by the consumption of cafeteria diet on metabolic, endocrine and reproductive outcomes in the male offspring. Body weight, abdominal fat content and concentrations of insulin, leptin, glucose and total cholesterol were analyzed in dams. The same parameters were evaluated in pups when in adulthood, in addition to the analysis of sexual behavior, followed by measurement of plasma luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, testosterone, and prolactin. Maternal consumption of cafeteria diet affected reproductive hormone regulation in the offspring and such modifications were reflected on sexual performance. Also, these modifications were independent of time and of the reproductive period during which dams consumed the diet. Our results indicate, for the first time, that maternal nutrition may have a deep impact on the reproductive function of the adult male offspring. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Predators are a ubiquitous presence in most natural environments. Opportunities to contrast the behaviour of a species in the presence and absence of predators are thus rare. Here we report on the behaviour of howler monkey groups living under radically different conditions on two land-bridge islands in Lago Guri, Venezuela. One group of 6 adults inhabited a 190-ha island (Danto) where they were exposed to multiple potential predators. This group, the control, occupied a home range of 23 ha and contested access to food resources with neighbouring groups in typical fashion. The second group, containing 6 adults, was isolated on a remote, predator-free 0.6 ha islet (Iguana) offering limited food resources. Howlers living on the large island moved, fed and rested in a coherent group, frequently engaged in affiliative activities, rarely displayed agonistic behaviour and maintained intergroup spacing through howling. In contrast, the howlers on Iguana showed repulsion, as individuals spent most of their time spaced widely around the perimeter of the island. Iguana howlers rarely engaged in affiliative behaviour, often chased or fought with one another and were not observed to howl. These behaviors are interpreted as adjustments to the unrelenting deprivation associated with bottom-up limitation in a predatorfree environment. © 2014 Orihuela et al.},

abstract={High fat, low carbohydrate diets have become popular, as short-term studies show that such diets are effective for reducing body weight, and lowering the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There is growing evidence from both humans and other animals that diet affects behaviour and intake of fat has been linked, positively and negatively, with traits such as exploration, social interaction, anxiety and fear. Animal models with high translational value can help provide relevant and important information in elucidating potential effects of high fat, low carbohydrate diets on human behaviour. Twenty four young, male Göttingen minipigs were fed either a high fat/cholesterol, low carbohydrate diet or a low fat, high carbohydrate/sucrose diet in contrast to a standard low fat, high carbohydrate minipig diet. Spontaneous behaviour was observed through video recordings of home pens and test-related behaviours were recorded during tests involving animalhuman contact and reaction towards a novel object. We showed that the minipigs fed a high fat/cholesterol, low carbohydrate diet were less aggressive, showed more non-agonistic social contact and had fewer and less severe skin lesions and were less fearful of a novel object than minipigs fed low fat, high carbohydrate diets. These results found in a porcine model could have important implications for general health and wellbeing of humans and show the potential for using dietary manipulations to reduce aggression in human society. © 2014 Haagensen et al.},

abstract={Experimental evidence of the interactions among mammalian predators that eat or compete with one another is rare, due to the ethical and logistical challenges of managing wild populations in a controlled and replicated way. Here, we report on the opportunistic use of a replicated and controlled culling experiment (the Randomised Badger Culling Trial) to investigate the relationship between two sympatric predators: European badgers Meles meles and western European hedgehogs Erinaceus europaeus. In areas of preferred habitat (amenity grassland), counts of hedgehogs more than doubled over a 5-year period from the start of badger culling (from 0.9 ha-1 pre-cull to 2.4 ha -1 post-cull), whereas hedgehog counts did not change where there was no badger culling (0.3-0.3 hedgehogs ha-1). This trial provides experimental evidence for mesopredator release as an outcome of management of a top predator. © 2014 Trewby et al.},

abstract={Some of the unique properties of room temperature ionic liquids are remarkably manifest in their thermal behaviour, viz. they exhibit low melting points despite being salts, difficulty in crystallisation, premelting over a wide temperature range, excessive supercooling, and complex thermal histories. In addition, 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium ionic liquids show peculiar thermal behaviour at the phase changes, namely "rhythmic melting and crystallisation," "intermittent crystallization," in the premelting regions, and ultra-slow phase changes. These thermal behaviours could be detected only by the use of an ultra-sensitive differential scanning calorimeter with nano-Watt stability, and simultaneous measurements of calorimetry and Raman scattering. This unique thermal behaviour is attributed to the flexibility of the alkyl chains bonded to the imidazolium ring, and linkage of the phase transition or structural relaxation with the conformational changes. © 2014 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

abstract={Obesity-induced changes in the metabolic and endocrine milieu elicit deficits in neuroplasticity, including increased risk for development of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depressive illness. We previously demonstrated that downregulation of hypothalamic insulin receptors (hypo-IRAS) elicits a phenotype that is consistent with features of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and that rats with this phenotype exhibit deficits in neuronal plasticity, including depressive-like behaviors such as anhedonia. Since food restriction paradigms effectively inhibit obesity-induced neuroplasticity deficits, the aim of the current study was to determine whether food restriction could reverse obesity-induced anhedonia in hypo-IRAS rats. Compared to hypo-IRAS rats provided ad lib food access, food restriction paradigms that were initiated either prior to increases in body weight or following development of the MetS/obesity phenotype effectively restored sucrose intake in hypo-IRAS rats. Moreover, food restriction paradigms were able to prevent and reverse the changes in the endocrine/metabolic/inflammatory milieu observed in hypo-IRAS, such as increases in plasma leptin and triglyceride levels and increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP). Collectively, these results demonstrate that obesity-induced anhedonia is a reversible process and identify some potential mechanistic mediators that may be responsible for co-morbid depression in obesity. © 2014.},

abstract={Selenoproteins are a unique family of proteins, characterized by the co-translational incorporation of selenium as selenocysteine, which play key roles in antioxidant defense. Among selenoproteins, selenoprotein P (Sepp1) is particularly distinctive due to the fact that it contains multiple selenocysteine residues and has been postulated to act in selenium transport. Within the brain, Sepp1 delivers selenium to neurons by binding to the ApoER2 receptor. Upon feeding a selenium-deficient diet, mice lacking ApoER2 or Sepp1 develop severe neurological dysfunction and exhibit widespread brainstem neurodegeneration, indicating an important role for ApoER2-mediated Sepp1 uptake in normal brain function. Selenocysteine lyase (Scly) is an enzyme that plays an important role in selenium homeostasis, in that it catalyzes the decomposition of selenocysteine and allows selenium to be recycled for additional selenoprotein synthesis.We previously reported that constitutive deletion of Scly results in neurological deficits only when mice are challenged with a low selenium diet. To gain insight into the relationship between Sepp1 and Scly in selenium metabolism, we created novel transgenic mice constitutively lacking both genes (Scly-/-Sepp1-/-) and characterized the neurobehavioral phenotype.Wereport that deletion of Scly in conjunction with Sepp1 further aggravates the phenotype of Sepp1-/- mice, as these mice needed supraphysiological selenium supplementation to survive,andsurviving mice exhibited impaired motor coordination, audiogenic seizures, and brainstem neurodegeneration. These findings provide the first in vivo evidence that SclyandSepp1workcooperatively to maintain selenoprotein function in the mammalian brain. © 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract={Populations of stream fishes exposed to different hydrodynamic, trophic, and physicochemical conditions may vary in their phenotypic traits in ways that influence local persistence. For example, gut morphology frequently varies with trophic position and food quality. As a result, one might expect gut morphology to differ between populations from watersheds with unique ecosystem characteristics, such as those occurring in urbanized streams. This study was an initial exploration to determine whether gut morphology of Campostoma oligolepis (Largescale Stoneroller) differed between an urbanized stream and a less urbanized stream in northwest Georgia, USA. Individuals were collected in May and June 2011 and dissected to quantify the gut length and gut quotient. With standard length as a covariate, gut length was shorter in the urbanized stream, and gut quotients were significantly lower. Gut lengths were also significantly longer in May than in June. One possible explanation for this difference is spatial and temporal variation in food sources associated with urbanization, although alternative explanations exist. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Recent studies on environmental enrichment (EE) have shown cytokines, cellular immune components [e.g., T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells], and glial cells in causal relationship to EE in bringing out changes to neurobiology and behavior. The purpose of this review is to evaluate these neuroimmune mechanisms associated with neurobiological and behavioral changes in response to different EE methods. We systematically reviewed common research databases. After applying all inclusion and exclusion criteria, 328 articles remained for this review. Physical exercise (PE), a form of EE, elicits anti-inflammatory and neuromodulatory effects through interaction with several immune pathways including interleukin (IL)-6 secretion from muscle fibers, reduced expression of Toll-like receptors on monocytes and macrophages, reduced secretion of adipokines, modulation of hippocampal T cells, priming of microglia, and upregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 in central nervous system. In contrast, immunomodulatory roles of other enrichment methods are not studied extensively. Nonetheless, studies showing reduction in the expression of IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α in response to enrichment with novel objects and accessories suggest anti-inflammatory effects of novel environment. Likewise, social enrichment, though considered a necessity for healthy behavior, results in immunosuppression in socially defeated animals. This has been attributed to reduction in T lymphocytes, NK cells and IL-10 in subordinate animals. EE through sensory stimuli has been investigated to a lesser extent and the effect on immune factors has not been evaluated yet. Discovery of this multidimensional relationship between immune system, brain functioning, and EE has paved a way toward formulating environ-immuno therapies for treating psychiatric illnesses with minimal use of pharmacotherapy. While the immunomodulatory role of PE has been evaluated extensively, more research is required to investigate neuroimmune changes associated with other enrichment methods. © 2014 Singhal, Jaehne, Corrigan and Baune.},

abstract={Forming foraging groups may help to improve protection from predators, foraging efficiency and exchange of information, but to benefit from these advantages, animals need to maintain group cohesion. Several studies have investigated how social status or behavioural and physiological traits promote leadership and followership in various species, but the potential role of ecological factors in modulating social cohesion of foraging groups has received less attention. We used social network analysis to investigate how a temporary shortage of food affects within-group following behaviour in house sparrow, Passer domesticus, flocks and which individual characteristics influence birds' positions in the following networks. To test this, we observed nine captive house sparrow flocks, composed of 12 individuals each, in three consecutive sessions, in which the food availability was altered. We found that food reduction did not modify the following network structure and that individuals had consistent positions within the flocks, as males and adults were followed more often than females and juveniles, respectively. However, short-term food reduction affected individuals' following behaviour according to their age: adults increased their following rates during food scarcity, whereas the opposite trend was found in juveniles. This pattern also remained after the re-establishment of initial conditions, suggesting that ecological changes can also induce individual-level lasting effects. Our study provides empirical evidence that food reduction does not affect the global social structure of house sparrow flocks but nevertheless individuals respond differently to ecological changes according to their age. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Animals generally live in multisensory worlds; however, our understanding of multisensory perception is rather limited, despite its relevance for explaining the mechanisms behind social interactions, such as collective detection while foraging in groups. We tested how multisensory stimuli affected the antipredator behavior of dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) using alarm calls as an auditory signal and flushing behavior as a visual cue. We varied the degree of risk within the group by manipulating the number of group mates alarm calling and/or flushing using robotic birds. We assumed that alarm calling and flushing were redundant stimuli and predicted that they could generate one of three types of responses (enhancement, equivalence, or antagonism) depending on the mechanism of multisensory perception. We set up an artificial flock with three robotic juncos surrounding a live junco and controlled for multiple confounding factors (e.g., identity of the focal, body mass, food deprivation time). We found that the degree of alarm of live juncos increased when at least one robot flushed. However, the time it took the live individuals to react to the robots' behavior increased, rather than decreased, with at least one alarm call. This could be the result of an orienting response or sensory overload, as live juncos increased scanning behavior after being exposed solely to alarm calls. Contrary to some theoretical assumptions, alarm calling and flushing behavior elicited independent unimodal responses, suggesting that they are non-redundant stimuli and that together they could reduce the occurrence of false alarms and facilitate flock cohesion. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Subgroups based on flavor preferences were identified and their genetic and behavior related characteristics investigated using extensive data from 331 Finnish twins (21-25. years, 146 men) including 47 monozygotic (MZ) and 93 dizygotic (DZ) pairs, and 51 twin individuals. The subgroup identification (hierarchical and K-means clustering) was based on liking responses to food names representing sour, umami, and spicy flavor qualities. Furthermore, sensory tests were conducted, a questionnaire on food likes completed, and various eating behavior related traits measured with validated scales. Sensory data included intensity ratings of PROP (6-n-propylthiouracil-impregnated filter paper), hedonic and intensity responses to sourness (orange juice with and without added citric acid, 0.42%), pungency (strawberry jelly with and without added capsaicin 0.00013%) and umami ('mouthfeel flavor' taste solution). Ratings of liking of 41 general food names were categorized into salty-and-fatty, sweet-and-fatty, fruits and vegetables and fish foods. Subgroup differences (complex samples procedure) and the genetics underlying the subgroups (structural equation modeling) were investigated. Of the resulting two groups (basic, n= 140, adventurous n= 152; non-grouped n= 39), the adventurous expressed higher liking for sour and spicy foods, and had more tolerance for capsaicin burn in the sensory-hedonic test. The adventurous were also less food neophobic (25.9. ±. 9.1 vs. 32.5. ±. 10.6, respectively) and expressed higher liking for fruits and vegetables compared to the basic group. Genetic effects were shown to underlie the subgroups (heritability 72%, CI: 36-92%). Linkage analysis for 27 candidate gene regions revealed suggestively that being adventurous is linked to TAS1R1 and PKD1L3 genes. These results indicate that food neophobia and genetic differences may form a barrier through which individual flavor preferences are generated. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Literature on maternal exposures and the risk of epigenetic changes or diseases in the offspring is growing. Paternal contributions are often not considered. However, some animal and epidemiologic studies on various contaminants, nutrition, and lifestyle-related conditions suggest a paternal influence on the offspring's future health. The phenotypic outcomes may have been attributed to DNA damage or mutations, but increasing evidence shows that the inheritance of environmentally induced functional changes of the genome, and related disorders, are (also) driven by epigenetic components. In this essay we suggest the existence of epigenetic windows of susceptibility to environmental insults during sperm development. Changes in DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNAs are viable mechanistic candidates for a non-genetic transfer of paternal environmental information, from maturing germ cell to zygote. Inclusion of paternal factors in future research will ultimately improve the understanding of transgenerational epigenetic plasticity and health-related effects in future generations. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={Distribution and aggregation patterns of pelagic fish in marine ecosystems are difficult to predict and understand, particularly since focussed studies are typically limited to single field efforts. Our study targeted coastal pre-spawning herring Clupea harengus in a small semi-enclosed coastal marine ecosystem, investigating their spatial and intra-school dynamic characteristics during the pre-spawning period over 6 consecutive years by means of hydro-acoustic surveying. Prior to spawning, the herring were consistently located at a specific site characterised by a deep trench that led to the deepest basin in the system and provided a potential escape route from predators. As the herring approached spawning, they moved in the direction of the spawning grounds, mimicking the long-distance spawning migration of Norwegian spring-spawning herring. There were consistent trends across years in the school characteristics demonstrating statedependent schooling dynamics. Schools were found closer to the bottom and more densely packed during late than early pre-spawning. Furthermore, a higher diversity in maturity stage between individual herring, assumed to be associated with stronger motivational conflicts, resulted in increased heterogeneity in school packing density. Our repeated investigations from a small site pinpoint some key behavioural traits in herring, trading off survival, energy saving and reproductive success. © Inter-Research 2014.},

abstract={Food hoarding is an evolutionary adaptation whereby animals store food for later consumption when food is limited or when predation risk while foraging is high. It also occurs as part of normal appetitive behavior by humans and non-human animals when they are hungry. Contrary to popular belief, humans do not overeat after food restriction/fasting, rather they increase food hoarding, as do hamster species, but not in laboratory rats or mice. Thus, this aspect of human appetitive behavior is better modeled by hamsters than laboratory rats and mice. Here we tested whether male Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) modify their daily food hoard size under ad libitum-feeding and after food deprivation when we artificially increased or removed their food hoard. When the food hoard was completely removed, hamsters hoarded more food the next day than did animals where the hoard was surreptitiously increased. Hamsters that had alternating daily hoard increases/decreases rapidly adjusted their food hoarding inversely proportional to food hoard size. Similarly, after 48. h of food deprivation, a stimulus that initiates high levels of food hoarding upon refeeding in this species, hamsters with artificially increased food hoard size hoarded significantly less than did hamsters where we left the hoard unaltered additionally suggesting that food hoard size directly affects food hoarding. Collectively, as we previously found when the caloric value of the food offered was increased or decreased, food hoard size is in some sense 'regulated' and not simply a reflexive response triggered by inter-meal hunger or food deprivation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Scatter hoarders must allocate time to assess items for caching, and to carry and bury each cache. Such decisions should be driven by economic variables, such as the value of the individual food items, the scarcity of these items, competition for food items and risk of pilferage by conspecifics. The fox squirrel, an obligate scatter-hoarder, assesses cacheable food items using two overt movements, head flicks and paw manipulations. These behaviors allow an examination of squirrel decision processes when storing food for winter survival. We measured wild squirrels' time allocations and frequencies of assessment and investment behaviors during periods of food scarcity (summer) and abundance (fall), giving the squirrels a series of 15 items (alternating five hazelnuts and five peanuts). Assessment and investment per cache increased when resource value was higher (hazelnuts) or resources were scarcer (summer), but decreased as scarcity declined (end of sessions). This is the first study to show that assessment behaviors change in response to factors that indicate daily and seasonal resource abundance, and that these factors may interact in complex ways to affect food storing decisions. Food-storing tree squirrels may be a useful and important model species to understand the complex economic decisions made under natural conditions. © 2014 Delgado et al.},

abstract={The eusocial termites are well accomplished in chemical communication, but how they achieve the communication using trace amount of no more than two pheromone components is mostly unknown. In this study, the foraging process and trail pheromones of the fungus-growing termite Odontotermes formosanus (Shiraki) were systematically studied and monitored in real-time using a combination of techniques, including video analysis, solid-phase microextraction, gas chromatography coupled with either mass spectrometry or an electroantennographic detector, and bioassays. The trail pheromone components in foraging workers were (3Z)-dodec-3-en-1-ol and (3Z,6Z)-dodeca-3,6-dien-1-ol secreted by their sternal glands. Interestingly, ratio of the two components changed according to the behaviors that the termites were displaying. This situation only occurs in termites whereas ratios of pheromone components are fixed and species-specific for other insect cuticular glands. Moreover, in bioassays, the active thresholds of the two components ranged from 1 fg/cm to 10 pg/ cm according to the behavioral contexts or the pheromonal exposure of tested workers. The two components did not act in synergy. (3Z)-Dodec-3-en-1-ol induced orientation behavior of termites that explore their environment, whereas (3Z,6Z)-dodeca-3,6-dien-1-ol had both an orientation effect and a recruitment effect when food was discovered. The trail pheromone of O. formosanus was regulated both quantitatively by the increasing number of workers involved in the early phases of foraging process, and qualitatively by the change in ratio of the two pheromone components on sternal glandular cuticle in the food-collecting workers. In bioassays, the responses of workers to the pheromone were also affected by the variation in pheromone concentration and component ratio in the microenvironment. Thus, this termite could exchange more information with nestmates using the traces of the two trail pheromone components that can be easily regulated within a limited microenvironment formed by the tunnels or chambers. © 2014 Wen et al.},

abstract={Behavioural flexibility is thought to be a major factor in evolution. It may facilitate the discovery and exploitation of new resources, which in turn may expose populations to novel selective forces and facilitate adaptive radiation. Darwin's finches are a textbook example of adaptive radiation. They are fast learners and show a range of unusual foraging techniques, probably as a result of their flexibility. In this study we aimed to test whether variability of the environment is correlated with flexibility. We compared woodpecker finches from a dry area (hereafter, Arid Zone), where food availability is variable, with individuals from a cloud forest (hereafter, Scalesia zone) where food abundance is stable. As parameters for flexibility, we measured neophilia and neophobia, which are two aspects of reaction to novelty, reversal learning and problem-solving. We found no differences in performance on a problem-solving task but, in line with our prediction, individuals from the Arid Zone were significantly faster reversal learners and more neophilic than their conspecifics from the Scalesia zone. The latter result supports the notion that environmental variability drives flexibility. In contrast to our prediction, Arid Zone birds were even more neophobic than birds from the Scalesia Zone. The latter result could be the consequence of differences in predation pressure between the two vegetation zones. Copyright: © 2014 Tebbich, Teschke.},

abstract={Rationale: Approach behavior is regulated by the brain integrating information about environment and body state. Psychoactive drugs interact with this process. Objectives: We examined the extent to which caloric (i.e., food) restriction, amphetamine (AMPH) and lithium interact in potentiating locomotor activity and responding reinforced by visual stimulus (VS), a reward unrelated to energy homeostasis. Methods: Rats either had ad libitum access to food or received daily rations that maintained 85-90 % of their original body weights. Leverpressing turned on a cue light for 1 s and turned off house light for 5 s. AMPH and lithium were administered through intraperitoneal injections and diet, respectively. Results: Food restriction or AMPH (1 mg/kg) alone had little effect on VS-reinforced responding; however, the combination of the two conditions markedly potentiated VS-reinforced responding (fourfold). Food restriction lasting 7 days or longer was needed to augment AMPH's effect on VS-reinforced responding. AMPH (0.3-3 mg/kg) potentiated locomotor activity similarly between food-restricted and ad libitum groups. Repeated injections of AMPH-sensitized locomotor activity, but not VS-reinforced responding. In addition, while chronic lithium treatments (0.2 % lithium carbonate chow) reduced VS-reinforced responding, chronic lithium further augmented AMPH-potentiated VS-reinforced responding. Conclusions: Food restriction interacts with psychoactive drugs to potentiate goal-directed responding unrelated to food seeking in a much more powerful manner than previously thought. The novel finding that lithium can augment a psychostimulant effect of AMPH suggests caution when combining lithium and psychostimulant drugs in clinical settings. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).},

abstract={Risk assessment in ectotherms is strongly affected by an organism's energy expenditure and acquisition because these will alter the motivation to feed, which is balanced against antipredator behaviours. Temperature and food availability are known to affect the physiological condition of ectotherms, but how interactions between these variables may influence predator-prey dynamics is still poorly understood. This study examined the interactive effects of food availability and temperature on the trade-offs between predator avoidance behaviour and foraging in juveniles of a marine damselfish, Pomacentrus chrysurus. Predator avoidance behaviour was tested by exposing fish to chemical alarm cues obtained from skin extract of conspecifics. When detected, these cues elicit an antipredator response in fish, typically characterized by decreased foraging. Fish maintained under high food ration displayed distinct antipredator responses to chemical alarm cues, regardless of temperature. However, fish maintained in conditions of low food ration and 3. °C above ambient temperature did not display an antipredator response when exposed to chemical alarm cues, whereas those in ambient temperature did. These results suggest that individuals in low physiological condition because of limited food availability are more susceptible to increased temperature and may therefore take greater risks under predation threats to satisfy their energetic requirements. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Prey animals often need to learn the identity of unknown predators, and not surprisingly, nearby conspecifics provide a rich source of information about both the identity and risk level posed by unknown predators. Individuals that learn from watching conspecifics that show a weak response to a predator often learn that the predator is a mild threat, while those that observe conspecifics that show a strong response to the predator, learn that the predator is a high-level threat. This means that any factor that influences the intensity of the antipredator response of the tutor can potentially influence the efficacy of information transfer to the observer. We know that food resources influence the activity levels of prey, making them more or less conspicuous to nearby conspecifics. We also know that prey often ignore risk if they have restricted access to food resources. This means that food resources have the potential to dramatically change social learning dynamics. In the present study, we found that tadpoles fed restricted diets had much higher activity levels than those fed ad libitum food resources. Their high activity made them more conspicuous to nearby conspecifics, causing them to be much more efficient as tutors. Our work highlights the dynamic nature of social learning, as information transfer is likely to change considerably from place to place and year to year as resources change through space and time. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Mammalian embryos have evolved to adjust their organ and tissue development in response to an atypical environment. This adaptation, called phenotypic plasticity, allows the organism to thrive in the anticipated environment in which the fetus will emerge. Barker and colleagues proposed that if the environment in which the fetus emerges differs from that in which it develops, phenotypic plasticity may provide an underlying mechanism for disease. Epidemiological studies have shown that humans born small- or large-for-gestational-age, have a higher likelihood of developing obesity as adults. The amount and quality of food that the mother consumes during gestation influences birth weight, and therefore susceptibility of progeny to disease in later life. Studies in experimental animals support these observations, and find that obesity occurs as a result of maternal nutrient-restriction during gestation, followed by rapid compensatory growth associated with ad libitum food consumption. Therefore, obesity associated with maternal nutritional restriction has a developmental origin. Based on this phenomenon, one might predict that gestational exposure to a westernized diet would protect against future obesity in offspring. However, evidence from experimental models indicates that, like maternal dietary restriction, maternal consumption of a westernized diet during gestation and lactation interacts with an adult obesogenic diet to induce further obesity. Mechanistically, restriction of nutrients or consumption of a high fat diet during gestation may promote obesity in progeny by altering hypothalamic neuropeptide production and thereby increasing hyperphagia in offspring. In addition to changes in food intake these animals may also direct energy from muscle toward storage in adipose tissue. Surprisingly, generational inheritance studies in rodents have further indicated that effects on body length, body weight, and glucose tolerance appear to be propagated to subsequent generations. Together, the findings discussed herein highlight the concept that maternal nutrition contributes to a legacy of obesity. Thus, ensuring adequate supplies of a complete and balanced diet during and after pregnancy should be a priority for public health worldwide.

abstract={Previous work examining animal models of cognitive flexibility have focused on tasks where animals are required to shift between cues in order to reach a food reward from among a limited set of choices. Performance by nonhuman animals on these tasks, including reversal learning, intradimensional set-shifting, and extradimensional set-shifting, are affected by pharmacological action on serotonergic, dopaminergic, and alpha-adrenergic, but not beta-adrenergic receptors. However, beta-adrenergic antagonists, such as propranolol, are widely utilized for conditions such as test anxiety. Propranolol improves performance in humans during cognitive flexibility tasks where there is a broad set of potential solutions. The current investigation utilized a digging task where the rodent must develop a novel solution in order to obtain a reward. Similar to the effects observed in humans, propranolol improved performance on this task, while not affecting performance on set-shifting tasks, as with previous animal studies. This may allow future investigation of the neurobiological mechanism by which propranolol affects context-specific anxiety, and could provide insight into the neurobiology of creativity. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The persistence of behavioral types in situ and the drivers of persistence are central to predicting the ecological effects of intraspecific behavioral variation. We surveyed individual refuge use of mud crabs (Panopeus herbstii), a behavior related to the strength of a trait-mediated trophic cascade in oyster reefs, in the absence and presence of toadfish (Opsanus tau) predation threat. We then released these crabs into the field and using mark-recapture, measured the repeatability of this behavior in the absence and presence of threat, and how behavioral change was affected by time in the field (a month on average, up to 81 days), crab size, and sex. Because crabs exhibited some evidence of a circatidal rhythm in refuge use, we also tested how tidal height during observation influenced behavioral change. Predation threat increased refuge use, and small crabs used the refuge more than large crabs, particularly under threat. In recaptured crabs, refuge use was more repeatable under threat. Neither time in the field, crab size, crab sex, nor tidal height had any effect on behavioral change. Our results support the non-mutually exclusive hypotheses that (1) prey organisms in the presence, rather than absence, of predation threat should exhibit less behavioral variability because the fear of dying (a severe fitness consequence) should take precedence over less immediately important influences on behavior (e.g., hunger) and that (2) individual behaviors tied to fixed traits (e.g., the body size dependence of refuge use under threat in this study), rather than variable traits, should be more repeatable over time. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Effective foraging behaviour is essential for animals to survive and reproduce, and depends on many intrinsic and environmental factors. There is increasing evidence that man-made (anthropogenic) factors can affect the behaviour of a wide range of taxa. However, few experimental studies have investigated how foraging behaviour is affected by exposure to increased noise levels, an issue of growing global concern. In our laboratory study, we examined how exposure to playback of noise originally recorded from ships, a prevalent source of human-generated underwater noise, affects the feeding behaviour of two sympatric fish species: the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and the European minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus. Both species consumed significantly fewer live Daphnia magna, and showed startle responses significantly more often during playback of additional noise than during control conditions. However, whereas minnows showed a qualitative shift in activity away from foraging behaviour (greater inactivity, more social behaviour) under increased noise conditions, consistent with a classic stress- or fear-related defence cascade, sticklebacks maintained foraging effort but made more mistakes, which may result from an impact of noise on cognition. These findings indicate that additional noise in the environment can lead to reduced food consumption, but that the effects of elevated noise are species specific. It remains to be tested whether these interspecific differences translate into different ultimate impacts, but differential disruptions to foraging may have potential consequences for relative individual fitness and community structure. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

This investigation assessed factors associated with post-RYGB substance misuse. Post-RYGB patients (N = 141; at least 24 months postsurgery) completed an online survey assessing variables hypothesized to contribute to post-RYGB SUDs. Fourteen percent of participants met criteria for postoperative substance misuse. Those with a lower percent total weight loss (%TWL) were more likely to endorse substance misuse. Family history of substance misuse was strongly associated with postoperative substance misuse. Eating-related variables including presurgical food addiction and postsurgical nocturnal eating, subjective hunger, and environmental responsiveness to food cues were also associated with a probable postoperative SUD. These findings have clinical utility in that family history of substance misuse can be easily assessed, and at-risk patients can be advised accordingly. In addition, those who endorse post-RYGB substance misuse appear to have stronger cognitive and behavioral responses to food, providing some support for the theory of behavioral substitution (or "addiction transfer"). © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

abstract={Research has previously identified relationships between child temperament and BMI during childhood. However, few studies have addressed the broader implications of child temperament on the development of obesogenic risk factors, such as maternal feeding, child eating and body mass index (BMI) of pre-schoolers. Hence, the current study evaluated cross-sectional and prospective associations between child temperament, maternal feeding, maternal parenting styles, mother-child interaction, preschoolers' eating behaviours and BMI. Child irritability, cooperation-manageability and easy-difficult temperaments, mother-child dysfunctional interaction, maternal pressure to eat and restriction were significantly cross-sectionally associated with child eating behaviours. Child enjoyment of food was significantly associated with child BMI. Child easy-difficult temperament and mother-child dysfunctional interaction predicted child eating behaviours longitudinally and baseline child BMI measures predicted child BMI longitudinally. Average maternal ratings of child temperament were relatively neutral, potentially explaining why most associations were not robust longitudinally. Future research should include a sample of greater socio-economic and BMI diversity as well as objective measures of child temperament, diet composition, maternal feeding practices, and mother-child interaction. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Maternal undernutrition increases the risk of adult arterial hypertension. The present study investigated the short-and long-term effects of a maternal low-protein diet on respiratory rhythm, O2/CO2 chemosensitivity and arterial blood pressure (ABP) of the offspring. Male Wistar rats were divided into two groups according to their mothers' diets during gestation and lactation: control (NP, 17A % of casein) and low-protein (LP, 8A % of casein) groups. Direct measurements of ABP, respiratory frequency (RF), tidal volume (V T) and ventilation (VE), as well as hypercapnia (7A % CO 2) and hypoxia (7A % O2) evoked respiratory responses were recorded from the awake male offspring at the 30th and 90th days of life. Blood samples were collected for the analyses of protein, creatinine and urea concentrations. The LP offspring had impaired body weight and length throughout the experiment. At 30A d of age, the LP rats showed a reduction in the concentrations of total serum protein (approximately 24A %). ABP in the LP rats was similar to that in the NP rats at 30A d of age, but it was 20A % higher at 90A d of age. With respect to ventilatory parameters, the LP rats showed enhanced RF (approximately 34A %) and VE (approximately 34A %) at 30A d of age, which was associated with increased ventilatory responses to hypercapnia (approximately 21A % in VE) and hypoxia (approximately 82A % in VE). At 90A d of age, the VE values and CO2/O2 chemosensitivity of the LP rats were restored to the control range, but the RF values remained elevated. The present data show that a perinatal LP diet alters respiratory rhythm and O2/CO2 chemosensitivity at early ages, which may be a predisposing factor for increased ABP at adulthood. © 2013 The Authors.},

abstract={We develop a decision tree based game-theoretical approach for constructing functional responses in multi-prey/multipatch environments and for finding the corresponding optimal foraging strategies. Decision trees provide a way to describe details of predator foraging behavior, based on the predator's sequence of choices at different decision points, that facilitates writing down the corresponding functional response. It is shown that the optimal foraging behavior that maximizes predator energy intake per unit time is a Nash equilibrium of the underlying optimal foraging game. We apply these game-theoretical methods to three scenarios: the classical diet choice model with two types of prey and sequential prey encounters, the diet choice model with simultaneous prey encounters, and a model in which the predator requires a positive recognition time to identify the type of prey encountered. For both diet choice models, it is shown that every Nash equilibrium yields optimal foraging behavior. Although suboptimal Nash equilibrium outcomes may exist when prey recognition time is included, only optimal foraging behavior is stable under evolutionary learning processes. © 2014 Cressman et al.},

abstract={We describe a high-throughput, high-volume, fully automated, live-in 24/7 behavioral testing system for assessing the effects of genetic and pharmacological manipulations on basic mechanisms of cognition and learning in mice. A standard polypropylene mouse housing tub is connected through an acrylic tube to a standard commercial mouse test box. The test box has 3 hoppers, 2 of which are connected to pellet feeders. All are internally illuminable with an LED and monitored for head entries by infrared (IR) beams. Mice live in the environment, which eliminates handling during screening. They obtain their food during two or more daily feeding periods by performing in operant (instrumental) and Pavlovian (classical) protocols, for which we have written protocol-control software and quasi-real-time data analysis and graphing software. The data analysis and graphing routines are written in a MATLAB-based language created to simplify greatly the analysis of large time-stamped behavioral and physiological event records and to preserve a full data trail from raw data through all intermediate analyses to the published graphs and statistics within a single data structure. The data-analysis code harvests the data several times a day and subjects it to statistical and graphical analyses, which are automatically stored in the "cloud" and on in-lab computers. Thus, the progress of individual mice is visualized and quantified daily. The data-analysis code talks to the protocol-control code, permitting the automated advance from protocol to protocol of individual subjects. The behavioral protocols implemented are matching, autoshaping, timed hopper-switching, risk assessment in timed hopper-switching, impulsivity measurement, and the circadian anticipation of food availability. Open-source protocol-control and data-analysis code makes the addition of new protocols simple. Eight test environments fit in a 48 in × 24 in × 78 in cabinet; two such cabinets (16 environments) may be controlled by one computer.},

abstract={Aggressive encounters occur between competitors (particularly males) throughout the animal kingdom, and in some species can result in severe injury and death. Here we describe for the first time lethal interactions between male nematodes and provide evidence that the expression of this behaviour is developmentally controlled. Males of the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema longicaudum coil around each other, resulting in injuries, paralysis and frequently death. The probability of death occurring between pairs of males was affected by the developmental pathway followed, being much greater among males that had passed through the infective juvenile (IJ, or dauer) stage than among males that had not. Post-IJ males are found only in newly colonised hosts, typically with few competing males present. Killing those few competitors may secure valuable resources (both females and a host cadaver for nourishment of offspring). Non-IJ males develop in subsequent generations within a host cadaver, where the presence of many closely related male competitors increases the risk:benefit ratio of fighting. Thus, passage through the IJ stage primes males for enhanced aggression in circumstances where this is more likely to result in increased reproductive success. Fighting occurred between males developing in mixed-sex social groups, indicating that it is an evolved trait and not an abnormal response to absence of females. This is supported by finding high mortality of males, but not of females, across a range of population densities in insect cadavers. We propose that these nematodes, with their relatively simple organization, may be a useful model for studies of aggression. © 2014 Zenner et al.},

We show that worms in WormSpa are neither stressed nor starved, and in particular exhibit pumping and egg-laying behaviors equivalent to those of freely behaving worms. We demonstrate the applicability of WormSpa for studying stress response and physiological processes. WormSpa is simple to make and easy to operate, and its design is modular, making it straightforward to incorporate available microfluidic technologies.

abstract={Summary: The body condition of free-ranging animals affects their response to stress, decisions, ability to fulfil vital needs and, ultimately, fitness. However, this key attribute in ecology remains difficult to assess, and there is a clear need for more integrative measures than the common univariate proxies. We propose a systems biology approach that positions individuals along a gradient from a 'normal/optimal' to 'abnormal/suboptimal' physiological state based on Mahalanobis distance computed from physiological biomarkers. We previously demonstrated the validity of this approach for studying ageing in humans; here, we illustrate its broad potential for ecological studies. As an example, we used biomarker data on shorebirds and found that birds with an abnormal condition had a lower maximal thermogenic capacity and higher scores of inflammation, with important implications for their ecology and health. Moreover, Mahalanobis distance captured a signal of condition not detected by the individual biomarkers. Overall, our results on birds and humans show that individuals with abnormal physiologies are indeed in worse condition. Moreover, our approach appears not to be particularly sensitive to which set of biomarkers is used to assess condition. Consequently, it could be applied easily to existing ecological data sets. Our approach provides a general, powerful way to measure condition that helps resolve confusion as to how to deal with complex interactions and interdependence among multiple physiological and condition measures. It can be applied directly to topics such as the effect of environmental quality on body condition, risks of health outcomes, mechanisms of adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and mechanisms behind long-term processes such as senescence. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={The trophic ecology of non-native species is a key aspect to understand their invasion success and the community effects. Despite the important role of caprellid amphipods as trophic intermediates between primary producers and higher levels of marine food webs, there is very little information on their feeding habits. This is the first comprehensive study on the trophic strategies of two co-occurring introduced caprellids in the Spanish coasts: Caprella scaura and Paracaprella pusilla. The diet of 446 specimens of C.scaura and 230 of P.pusilla was analyzed to investigate whether there were differences in the feeding habits in relation to habitat characteristics (natural vs artificial hard substrata), type of host substrata (bryozoans and hydroids) and native vs introduced distribution ranges (Brazil vs Spain). Results revealed differences in diet preferences of the two species that have important implications for their trophic behaviour and showed a limited food overlap, which may favour their coexistence in introduced areas. In general terms, P.pusilla is a predator species, showing preference by crustacean prey in all of its life stages, while C.scaura feeds mainly on detritus. Although no sex-related diet shifts were observed in either of the species, evidence of ontogenetic variation in diet of C.scaura was found, with juveniles feeding on more amount of prey than adults. No diet differences were found between native and introduced populations within the same habitat type. However, P.pusilla exhibited a shift in its diet when different habitats were compared in the same distribution area, and C.scaura showed a flexible feeding behaviour between different host substrata in the same habitat type. This study shows that habitat characteristics at different scales can have greater influence on the feeding ecology of exotic species than different distribution ranges, and support the hypothesis that a switch between feeding strategies depending on habitat characteristics could favour invasion success. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The increasing global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) requires the implementation of preventive strategies to halt this trend, tailored to the specific needs of individual regions. Risk factors for T2DM are among the main targets for improving health outcomes and curbing the development of diabetes; excessive weight and obesity are two of the most important risk factors that need to be addressed. A growing body of evidence suggests that subjects with pre-diabetes who lose body weight and increase physical activity can delay or prevent the onset of T2DM, and in some cases, blood glucose levels may return to normal. Several studies have shown that moderate to intensive levels of exercise are effective in reducing both intra-abdominal and total adiposity among obese subjects, both improving cardiovascular risk profile and reducing the risk of T2DM development. These consistent observations have given rise to large-scale randomized controlled trials that use lifestyle intervention (including behavioural strategies for the reinforcement of prescribed changes in nutritional intake, physical activity or both), with or without pharmacological treatment, in populations at high risk of developing T2DM. In this review, large-scale national trials that have focused on the prevention of T2DM are critically evaluated. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={A wide variety of organisms show morphologically plastic responses to environmental stressors but in general these changes are not reversible. Though less common, reversible morphological structures are shown by a range of species in response to changes in predators, competitors or food. Theoretical analysis indicates that reversible plasticity increases fitness if organisms are long-lived relative to the frequency of changes in the stressor and morphological changes are rapid. Many sea urchin species show differences in the sizes of jaws (demi-pyramids) of the feeding apparatus,Aristotle's lantern, relative to overall body size, and these differences have been correlated with available food. The question addressed here is whether reversible changes of relative jaw size occur in the field as available food changes with season. Monthly samples of the North American Pacific coast sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus were collected from Gregory Point on the Oregon (USA) coast and showed an annual cycle of relative jaw size together with a linear trend from 2007 to 2009. Strongylocentrotus purpuratus is a long-lived species and under field conditions individuals experience multiple episodes of changes in food resources both seasonally and from year to year. Their rapid and reversible jaw plasticity fits well with theoretical expectations. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus (L.) are successful invaders in Europe, where this species exerts multiple ecological effects, mainly through trophic interactions. Behavioural interference represents a potential impact for native fauna and this is of particular conservation concern in the Iberian Peninsula because of the highly valuable endemic fauna inhabiting streams of this region. However, aggressive interactions have not previously been examined under natural conditions in Iberian fresh waters. To address this gap in knowledge, the aim of the present study was to assess the effect of pumpkinseed aggression on endemic fauna of an Iberian stream, the River Bullaque (central Spain). In September 2009, we analysed the aggression and environmental contexts of these behavioural interactions by snorkelling: aggressor size, aggression type, shoal size, previous activity to aggression, recipient species, response to aggression, microhabitat structure and prey availability. Small pumpkinseed displayed more threat and fewer pursuit behaviours relative to medium and large individuals, reflecting an ontogenetic behavioural shift from low to high aggression intensity. Small aggressors came from large shoals, with bottom feeding being the most frequently observed activity prior to an aggressive interaction; whereas large pumpkinseed were less gregarious and they were mostly ambulating within the water column prior to aggression. Recipient species of aggression included non-native crayfish and fishes, and more importantly, endemic fishes and frogs. Retreat was the most common response to aggression, irrespective of aggressor size. Small pumpkinseed displayed aggressive behaviours over coarse substrata containing elevated macrobenthos biomass; whereas aggression by large individuals was observed in deeper waters. These findings suggest that small and large pumpkinseed exert a high impact on other stream residents through aggression in competition for food and territory defence, respectively. This study highlights the usefulness of direct observations in the wild for assessing the effects of behavioural interference of invasive fishes on Iberian aquatic communities. © 2014 Almeida et al.},

Parents reported on their use of restrictive feeding practices and their child's inhibitory control and approach. Overall, the findings replicated those of Fisher and Birch (1999b) and revealed that the effects of restriction differed by children's regulatory and appetitive tendencies. Greater increases in intake in response to restriction were observed among children lower in inhibitory control, higher in approach, who found the restricted food highly reinforcing, and who had previous experience with parental use of restriction. Results confirm that the use of restriction does not reduce children's consumption of these foods, particularly among children with lower regulatory or higher appetitive tendencies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Food caching is a paramount model for studying relations between cognition, brain organisation and ecology in corvids. In contrast, behaviour towards inedible objects is poorly examined and understood. We review the literature on object caching in corvids and other birds, and describe an exploratory study on object caching in ravens, New Caledonian crows and jackdaws. The captive adult birds were presented with an identical set of novel objects adjacent to food. All three species cached objects, which shows the behaviour not to be restricted to juveniles, food cachers, tool-users or individuals deprived of cacheable food. The pattern of object interaction and caching did not mirror the incidence of food caching: the intensely food caching ravens indeed showed highest object caching incidence, but the rarely food caching jackdaws cached objects to similar extent as the moderate food caching New Caledonian crows. Ravens and jackdaws preferred objects with greater sphericity, but New Caledonian crows preferred stick-like objects (similar to tools). We suggest that the observed object caching might have been expressions of exploration or play, and deserves being studied in its own right because of its potential significance for tool-related behaviour and learning, rather than as an over-spill from food-caching research.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: CO3 2013. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Food choice and consumption behaviour are influenced by many interacting factors. In this paper we present an empirical effort to enhance understanding of the neophobia-neophilia forces affecting food choice. Starting from the analysis of consumer preferences for some of the most familiar highly processed foods, namely fat-reduced, functional (enriched drinks and yogurt) and ready-to-eat frozen food, our study investigates the role of traditional demographic variables vs attitudes to new food technologies in predicting the consumption behaviour of a sample of Italians buying such products. Consumer attitudes toward food technologies were collected by means of the Food Technology Neophobia Scale (FTNS). Moreover, this paper explicitly analyses the value of the information provided by the FTNS. Underlying the research is the hypothesis that the FTNS may contribute to provide a comprehensive picture of the driving forces behind consumers' behavioural responses towards processed foods which are the end-result of mature technologies. The four FTNS components, once measured and used independently, help clarify the influence on food choices of each neophobia-neophilia force (risk perception and novelty seeking, media influence, own health and environmental concerns) into a single, comprehensive framework. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Prenatal ethanol exposure modifies postnatal affinity to the drug, increasing the probability of ethanol use and abuse. The present study tested developing rats (5-day-old) in a novel operant technique to assess the degree of ethanol self-administration as a result of prenatal exposure to low ethanol doses during late gestation. On a single occasion during each of gestational days 17-20, pregnant rats were intragastrically administered ethanol 1g/kg, or water (vehicle). On postnatal day 5, pups were tested on a novel operant conditioning procedure in which they learned to touch a sensor to obtain 0.1% saccharin, 3% ethanol, or 5% ethanol. Immediately after a 15-min training session, a 6-min extinction session was given in which operant behavior had no consequence. Pups were positioned on a smooth surface and had access to a touch-sensitive sensor. Physical contact with the sensor activated an infusion pump, which served to deliver an intraoral solution as reinforcement (Paired group). A Yoked control animal evaluated at the same time received the reinforcer when its corresponding Paired pup touched the sensor. Operant behavior to gain access to 3% ethanol was facilitated by prenatal exposure to ethanol during late gestation. In contrast, operant learning reflecting ethanol reinforcement did not occur in control animals prenatally exposed to water only. Similarly, saccharin reinforcement was not affected by prenatal ethanol exposure. These results suggest that in 5-day-old rats, prenatal exposure to a low ethanol dose facilitates operant learning reinforced by intraoral administration of a low-concentration ethanol solution. This emphasizes the importance of intrauterine experiences with ethanol in later susceptibility to drug reinforcement. The present operant conditioning technique represents an alternative tool to assess self-administration and seeking behavior during early stages of development. © 2014.},

abstract={The effects of social stimulation on ethanol drinking in humans may depend on the gender of the drinker, the gender of the social stimulus, and the availability of ethanol provided to the social stimulus. The present study employed the Proximal Cagemate Drinking (PCD) Procedures to evaluate the effects of the gender of the social stimulus Cagemate mouse and the effects of providing ethanol to the Cagemate mouse on the drinking of ethanol and water by the male or female CD-1 Drinker mouse. Twelve groups of subjects were arranged in a 3×2×2 factorial design with 3 levels of Cagemate Gender (Male vs. Female vs. None), 2 levels of Drinker Gender (Male vs. Female), and 2 levels of Cagemate Ethanol (Ethanol vs. No Ethanol). In the 8 groups assigned to social housing conditions, each Drinker mouse was housed with a Cagemate mouse on opposite sides of a clear plastic shoebox cage equipped with a clear plastic barrier that divided the cage lengthwise into 2 equal compartments. Six groups of Drinkers and 4 groups of Cagemates were provided with continuous access to 2 bottles (ethanol vs. water), while the 4 groups of Cagemates in the No Ethanol condition were provided with 2 bottles containing water. Results revealed that providing the Cagemate with ethanol elevated ethanol intake and ethanol preference but reduced water intake in Drinkers in Other-Gender Pairings (Male Drinker-Female Cagemate or Female Drinker-Male Cagemate) relative to Drinkers in Same-Gender Pairings (Male Drinker-Male Cagemate or Female Drinker-Female Cagemate). In contrast, when the Cagemate was not provided with access to ethanol, the opposite effects were observed. These novel PCD procedures reveal that the gender of the Cagemate and the Cagemate's access to ethanol influenced ethanol drinking in proximal-housed CD-1 Drinker mice. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The common minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) is the most abundant mammalian top predator in Icelandic continental shelf waters. Here, an account is given on the first systematic research programme into the feeding ecology of common minke whales in Icelandic waters based on an analysis of minke whale stomach contents data collected in Icelandic waters during 2003-2007. The results show pronounced spatial and temporal variation in the diet. The temporal changes include a decrease in the proportion of sandeel in the diet over the study period and a corresponding increase in herring (Clupea haerengus) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), particularly in the southern area. The diet also differed markedly from the previously available, limited data from Icelandic waters with less krill and the cold water species capelin (Mallotus villosus) and more gadoids and herring in the more recent period. These changes in diet composition are consistent with recent changes in the Icelandic continental shelf ecosystem, including increased sea surface and bottom temperatures and changes in distribution and abundance of several fish species, including sandeel (Ammodytidae) and capelin. Although natural fluctuations cannot be ruled out at this stage, these dietary changes, together with decreased abundance in coastal waters, may reflect the responses of minke whales to a changed environment possibly driven by global warming. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Winter tourism in the European Alps has developed rapidly over the past few decades, leading to the expansion of ski resorts, growing numbers of visitors and a massive increase in snow sport activities such as free-ride skiing and snowboarding, backcountry skiing and snowshoeing. Wildlife is often disturbed by these largely unpredictable activities, and animals may have limited opportunities to adapt. Mountain hares Lepus timidus are affected by this increase in alpine tourism, but their physiological and behavioural reactions to tourist activity are still unknown. We measured the levels of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (GCM) in wild mountain hares living in areas that had no, medium or high levels of tourist activity during winter in 2011. Furthermore, we compared the changes in GCM excretion, behaviour and food intake of six captive mountain hares following predator challenge experiments from early to mid-winter. Our field results showed that GCM excretion is positively correlated with increased tourism intensity. In the predator challenge experiments, hares spent less time resting and grooming (including re-ingesting faecal pellets) during and after the stress treatments. These stress events lead to higher energy demands due to flushing, increased GCM levels, and disrupted the energy intake that hares derive from faeces. We conclude that mountain hares living in areas with frequent human winter recreational activities show changes in physiology and behaviour that demand additional energy in winter, when access to food resources is limited by snow. Synthesis and applications. To bring down the frequency of stress threats for mountain hares, we recommend that managers keep forests inhabited by mountain hares free of tourism infrastructure and retain undisturbed forest patches within skiing areas. Other species such as black grouse Tetrao tetrix and/or capercaillie Tetrao urogallus are also likely to benefit from such management activities because they share similar habitat requirements with mountain hares. © 2013 The Authors.

abstract={Mammalian pheromones control a myriad of innate social behaviors and acutely regulate hormone levels. Responses to pheromones are highly robust, reproducible, and stereotyped and likely involve developmentally predetermined neural circuits. Here, I review several facets of pheromone transduction in mammals, including (a) chemosensory receptors and signaling components of the main olfactory epithelium and vomeronasal organ involved in pheromone detection; (b) pheromone-activated neural circuits subject to sex-specific and state-dependent modulation; and (c) the striking chemical diversity of mammalian pheromones, which range from small, volatile molecules and sulfated steroids to large families of proteins. Finally, I review (d) molecular mechanisms underlying various behavioral and endocrine responses, including modulation of puberty and estrous; control of reproduction, aggression, suckling, and parental behaviors; individual recognition; and distinguishing of own species from predators, competitors, and prey. Deconstruction of pheromone transduction mechanisms provides a critical foundation for understanding how odor response pathways generate instinctive behaviors. © Copyright ©2014 by Annual Reviews.

abstract={After several public notifications of domiciliary invasions, palm trees were investigated in downtown Monte Alto City, São Paulo State, Brazil, in proximity to the city hall building, the main church, condominiums and marketing establishments. One hundred seventy four palm trees of 10 species were investigated, in which 72 specimens of Rhodnius neglectus, a potential Chagas disease vector, were captured via manual methods. All insects were collected from dead leaves, organic debris and bird nests in the only three Livistona australis palm trees in the central park square. This was the first record of R. neglectus colonizing this palm species. Although no Trypanosoma cruzi was found by abdominal compression followed by light microscopy, the poor nutritional status of the bugs hampered the examination of gut contents for parasite detection. Furthermore, the central crowns of the trees, which shelter bats (Chiroptera: Mammalia), could not be carefully searched for insects due to difficult access. This new finding highlights the sudden alteration in insect behavior, probably as a result of man's interference.

abstract={Stressful or stochastic environments may have significant selective effects, leading to increased plasticity or stress resistance. Starvation is a type of stress commonly encountered among organisms inhabiting stochastic environments. Indeed, starvation endurance is an important trait, especially in sit-and-wait predators, which experience frequent fluctuations in prey arrivals because of their limited mobility. Differences in starvation endurance between antlions originating from Mediterranean (benign and predictable) and desert (harsher and stochastic) regions were investigated by exposing them to starvation in a fully factorial experiment using climate chambers simulating Mediterranean or desert climatic conditions. A trade-off between growth rate and starvation endurance was also investigated by feeding the antlions at two different frequencies pre-starvation. Additionally, the existence of growth compensation was tested for by measuring relative growth rate when feeding was resumed post-starvation. Population of origin did not significantly affect rates of body mass loss during starvation or relative growth rates when feeding was resumed. Antlions that were fed less frequently during the feeding phase lost mass faster during the starvation phase, but grew faster during the compensation phase. This study emphasises the importance of testing responses to stress when investigating life-history trade-offs. Some phenotypic differences between populations might be apparent only when exposing the experimental organisms to external stress. Conversely, phenotypic differences apparent under stress-free conditions might be masked by the effects of the stress factor. Adopting such an integrative approach allows elucidation of the level of plasticity in response to stress in different populations. © 2013 The Royal Entomological Society.},

In this prospective study, alexithymic levels were evaluated before, during and after an anxious episode. Therefore, the alexithymic levels, the presence of PD and the severity of anxious-depressive symptoms were evaluated, at intervals of about 1 month, in pregnant women, attending the Centers for Prenatal Care, using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Twenty-one women affected by PD and 256 healthy women (controls) were included in the study. Women who developed PD, compared to controls, showed similar TAS-20 and HADS scores during the pre-morbid phase, a significant increase of them during PD and a significant decrease after symptoms improvement, whereas no change was observed in controls.

abstract={Introduction: Recent research suggests that diet quality influences depression risk; however, a lack of experimental evidence leaves open the possibility that residual confounding explains the observed relationships. The aim of this study was to document the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between dietary patterns and symptoms of depression and to undertake a detailed examination of potential explanatory factors, particularly socioeconomic circumstances, in the diet-depression relationship. Methods: Data were drawn from the Personality and Total Health (PATH) Through Life Study, a longitudinal community study following three age cohorts (20+; 40+; 60+yrs) from south-eastern Australia over three assessment periods (n = 3663). Regression analyses evaluated the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between dietary patterns, depressive symptoms, age, detailed measures of socioeconomic circumstances, other health behaviours, and cardiovascular risk factors. Results: The lowest tertile of prudent (healthy) dietary pattern and the highest tertile of western (unhealthy) dietary pattern were associated with an increased likelihood of depressive symptoms. However, these contemporaneous associations were explained by adjustment for detailed measures of socioeconomic circumstances and physical activity. In prospective analyses, lower scores on the healthy dietary pattern and higher scores on the unhealthy dietary pattern independently predicted increased depressive symptoms across time, before and after adjustment for potential confounders and baseline depressive symptoms, but only for those in the oldest cohort. Dietary patterns did not explain the relationship between socioeconomic position and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: The results of this study confirm that the relationship between habitual dietary intake and depressive symptoms is somewhat explained by socioeconomic circumstances and other health behaviours, but suggest that long term exposure to unhealthy dietary habits independently predisposes to depression over the lifecourse. © 2014 Jacka et al.},

abstract={Defense of a limited resource, such as space or food, has recently been discovered in snakes and has been widely documented in lizards. Garter snakes (Thamnophis spp.) are historically considered generalist predators such that food is not a limiting resource. However, in this study we show that the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) and the aquatic garter snake (Thamnophis atratus) show a strong preference for amphibians as their primary food source at the Santa Lucia Preserve (SLP), Monterey County, California. This food preference forces these snake species at SLP to exploit aquatic habitats. Our principle goal was to investigate the aggressive behavior of T. sirtalis and the potential that this aggression displaces T. atratus from its preferred habitat. We found that when individuals from either species are alone, a 100% preference for aquatic or near aquatic habitat is observed. In contrast, when these species are together, T. sirtalis occupy the aquatic habitat and T. atratus occupy an area far removed from water. Thamnophis sirtalis often physically force T. atratus from the aquatic habitat through repeated biting and other displays of aggression. © 2014 Edgehouse et al.},

abstract={Arboreal herbivory is rare among mammals. The fewspecies with this lifestyle possess unique adaptions to overcome size-related constraints on nutritional energetics. Sloths are folivores that spend most of their time resting or eating in the forest canopy. A three-toed sloth will, however, descend its tree weekly to defecate, which is risky, energetically costly and, until now, inexplicable. We hypothesized that this behaviour sustains an ecosystem in the fur of sloths, which confers cryptic nutritional benefits to sloths. We found that the more specialized three-toed sloths harboured more phoretic moths, greater concentrations of inorganic nitrogen and higher algal biomass than the generalist two-toed sloths. Moth densitywas positively related to inorganic nitrogen concentration and algal biomass in the fur. We discovered that sloths consumed algae from their fur, which was highly digestible and lipid-rich. By descending a tree to defecate, sloths transport moths to their oviposition sites in sloth dung, which facilitates moth colonization of sloth fur. Moths are portals for nutrients, increasing nitrogen levels in sloth fur, which fuels algal growth. Sloths consume these algae-gardens, presumably to augment their limited diet. These linked mutualisms between moths, sloths and algae appear to aid the sloth in overcoming a highly constrained lifestyle. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Low-birth-weight (LBW) children are born with several risk factors for disease, morbidity and neonatal mortality, even if carried to term. Placental insufficiency leading to hypoxemia and reduced nutritional supply is the main cause for LBW. Brain damage and poor neurological outcome can be the consequence. LBW after being carried to term gives better chances for survival, but these children are still at risk for poor health and the development of cognitive impairments. Preventive therapies are not yet available. We studied the risk/efficacy of chronic prenatal treatment with the anti-oxidative drug allopurinol, as putative preventive treatment in piglets. LBW piglets served as a natural model for LBW. A cognitive holeboard test was applied to study the learning and memory abilities of these allopurinol treated piglets after weaning. Preliminary analysis of the plasma concentrations in sows and their piglets suggested that a daily dose of 15 mg.kg-1 resulted in effective plasma concentration of allopurinol in piglets. No adverse effects of chronic allopurinol treatment were found on farrowing, birth weight, open field behavior, learning abilities, relative brain, hippocampus and spleen weights. LBW piglets showed increased anxiety levels in an open field test, but cognitive performance was not affected by allopurinol treatment. LBW animals treated with allopurinol showed the largest postnatal compensatory body weight gain. In contrast to a previous study, no differences in learning abilities were found between LBW and normal-birth-weight piglets. This discrepancy might be attributable to experimental differences. Our results indicate that chronic prenatal allopurinol treatment during the third trimester of pregnancy is safe, as no adverse side effects were observed. Compensatory weight gain of treated piglets is a positive indication for the chronic prenatal use of allopurinol in these animals. Further studies are needed to assess the possible preventive effects of allopurinol on brain functions in LBW piglets. © 2014 Gieling et al.},

abstract={Resource subsidies increase the productivity of recipient food webs and can affect ecosystem dynamics. Subsidies of prey often support elevated predator biomass which may intensify top-down control and reduce the flow of reciprocal subsidies into adjacent ecosystems. However, top-down control in subsidized food webs may be limited if primary consumers posses morphological or behavioral traits that limit vulnerability to predation. In forested streams, terrestrial prey support high predator biomass creating the potential for strong top-down control, however armored primary consumers often dominate the invertebrate assemblage. Using empirically based simulation models, we tested the response of stream food webs to variations in subsidy magnitude, prey vulnerability, and the presence of two top predators. While terrestrial prey inputs increased predator biomass (+12%), the presence of armored primary consumers inhibited top-down control, and diverted most aquatic energy (∼75%) into the riparian forest through aquatic insect emergence. Food webs without armored invertebrates experienced strong trophic cascades, resulting in higher algal (∼50%) and detrital (∼1600%) biomass, and reduced insect emergence (-90%). These results suggest prey vulnerability can mediate food web responses to subsidies, and that top-down control can be arrested even when predator-invulnerable consumers are uncommon (20%) regardless of the level of subsidy. © 2014 Atlas, Palen.},

abstract={Background: Environmental factors during perinatal development may influence developmental plasticity and disease susceptibility via alterations to the epigenome. Developmental exposure to the endocrine active compound, bisphenol A (BPA), has previously been associated with altered methylation at candidate gene loci. Here, we undertake the first genome-wide characterization of DNA methylation profiles in the liver of murine offspring exposed perinatally to multiple doses of BPA through the maternal diet.Results: Using a tiered focusing approach, our strategy proceeds from unbiased broad DNA methylation analysis using methylation-based next generation sequencing technology to in-depth quantitative site-specific CpG methylation determination using the Sequenom EpiTYPER MassARRAY platform to profile liver DNA methylation patterns in offspring maternally exposed to BPA during gestation and lactation to doses ranging from 0 BPA/kg (Ctr), 50 μg BPA/kg (UG), or 50 mg BPA/kg (MG) diet (N = 4 per group). Genome-wide analyses indicate non-monotonic effects of DNA methylation patterns following perinatal exposure to BPA, corroborating previous studies using multiple doses of BPA with non-monotonic outcomes. We observed enrichment of regions of altered methylation (RAMs) within CpG island (CGI) shores, but little evidence of RAM enrichment in CGIs. An analysis of promoter regions identified several hundred novel BPA-associated methylation events, and methylation alterations in the Myh7b and Slc22a12 gene promoters were validated. Using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, a number of candidate genes that have previously been associated with BPA-related gene expression changes were identified, and gene set enrichment testing identified epigenetically dysregulated pathways involved in metabolism and stimulus response.Conclusions: In this study, non-monotonic dose dependent alterations in DNA methylation among BPA-exposed mouse liver samples and their relevant pathways were identified and validated. The comprehensive methylome map presented here provides candidate loci underlying the role of early BPA exposure and later in life health and disease status. © 2014 Kim et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Latency to feed in a novel environment assesses anxious behavior in rodents, but it is unclear whether it distinguishes anxiety from consumption or appetite. New method: The anxiety-related feeding/exploration conflict (AFEC) test was used here to assess anxious behavior in Syrian hamsters for which increased cheek-pouching of food, but not overconsumption of it, reflects appetitive drive, and orexigenic stimuli do not increase consumption. The setup of the test prevented cheek-pouching. Comparison with existing methods: Latency to approach test food provided an additional control for non-emotional effects of treatments. Feed and approach latencies in the test cage were normalized to those in the home cage to factor out non-emotional effects. Results: Feed latency and the feed latency ratio (test cage/home cage) were reduced by acute treatment with benzodiazepine, diazepam, or beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol, or chronic treatment with norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, desipramine. Reductions of feed latency and the feed latency ratio were not associated with hyperphagia, and these behaviors were unaltered by acute treatment with opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone. Latency to approach food in the test cage, with and without normalization, was unaltered by these treatments. Finally, overnight fasting elevated feed latency without hyperphagia, and this effect was attenuated by chronic desipramine treatment. Conclusions: These results suggest that the AFEC test assesses anxious, but not appetitive or consummatory, behavior, and that its sensitivity increases with food deprivation of hamsters. © 2013.},

abstract={Background: Using senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8), we examined whether reduced mastication from a young age affects hippocampal-dependent cognitive function. We anesthetized male SAMP8 mice at 8 weeks of age and extracted all maxillary molar teeth of half the animals. The other animals were treated similarly, except that molar teeth were not extracted. At 12 and 24 weeks of age, their general behavior and their ability to recognize novel objects were tested using the open-field test (OFT) and the object-recognition test (ORT), respectively.Results: The body weight of molarless mice was reduced significantly compared to that of molar-intact mice after the extraction and did not recover to the weight of age-matched molar-intact mice throughout the experimental period. At 12 weeks of age, molarless mice showed significantly greater locomotor activity in the OFT than molar-intact mice. However, the ability of molarless mice to discriminate a novel object in the ORT was impaired compared to that of molar-intact mice. The ability of both molarless and molar-intact SAMP8 mice to recognize objects was impaired at 24 weeks of age. These results suggest that molarless SAMP8 mice develop a deficit of cognitive function earlier than molar-intact SAMP8 mice. Interestingly, both at 12 and 24 weeks of age, molarless mice showed a lateralized preference of object location in the encoding session of the ORT, in which two identical objects were presented. Their lateralized preference of object location was positively correlated with the rightward turning-direction preference, which reached statistical significance at 24 weeks of age.Conclusions: Loss of masticatory function in early life causes malnutrition and chronic stress and impairs the ability to recognize novel objects. Hyperactivation and lateralized rotational behavior are commonly observed with dysfunction of the dopaminergic system, therefore, reduced masticatory function may deplete the mesolimbic and mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic systems to impair the cognitive functions of selective attention and recognition memory in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. © 2014 Kawahata et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={For foraging herbivores, both food quality and predation risk vary across the landscape. Animals should avoid low-quality food patches in favour of high-quality ones, and seek safe patches while avoiding risky ones. Herbivores often face the foraging dilemma, however, of choosing between high-quality food in risky places or low-quality food in safe places. Here, we explore how and why the interaction between food quality and predation risk affects foraging decisions of mammalian herbivores, focusing on browsers confronting plant toxins in a landscape of fear. We draw together themes of plant–herbivore and predator–prey interactions, and the roles of animal ecophysiology, behaviour and personality. The response of herbivores to the dual costs of food and fear depends on the interplay of physiology and behaviour. We discuss detoxification physiology in dealing with plant toxins, and stress physiology associated with perceived predation risk. We argue that behaviour is the interface enabling herbivores to stay or quit food patches in response to their physiological tolerance to these risks. We hypothesise that generalist and specialist herbivores perceive the relative costs of plant defence and predation risk differently and intra-specifically, individuals with different personalities and physiologies should do so too, creating individualised landscapes of food and fear. We explore the ecological significance and emergent impacts of these individual-based foraging outcomes on populations and communities, and offer predictions that can be clearly tested. In doing so, we provide an integrated platform advancing herbivore foraging theory with food quality and predation risk at its core. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Food availability can impact group formation in Carnivora. Specifically, it has been suggested that temporal variation in food availability may allow a breeding pair to tolerate additional adults in their territory at times when food abundance is high. We investigate group occurrence and intraspecific tolerance during breeding in a socially flexible canid, the arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus). We compare Iceland and Sweden where resource conditions differ considerably. A breeding pair was the most common social unit in both populations, but as predicted, groups were more frequent where food abundance varied substantially between years (Sweden: 6 %) than where food availability was stable (Iceland: ≤2 %). Within Sweden, supplemental feeding increased group occurrence from 6 to 21 %, but there was no effect of natural variation in lemming (Lemmus lemmus) availability since group formation was rare also at lemming highs. Thus, additional factors appeared to influence the trade-off between intraspecific territoriality and tolerance. We report two cases where related females showed enduring social relationships with good-neighbour strategies. Related females also engaged in alloparental behaviour in a 'fox town' with 31 foxes (4 adults, 3 litters). In contrast, when unrelated foxes bred close to each other, they moved or split their litters during summer, presumably because of territorial conflict. We suggest that fluctuating food availability is linked to group formation in this Arctic carnivore, but also when food availability increases, additional factors such as relatedness, alloparental benefits, competition and predator defence appear necessary to explain group formation. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Dietary restriction (DR) extends lifespan in a wide variety of organisms. Although several genes and pathways associated with this longevity response have been identified, the specific mechanism through which DR extends lifespan is not fully understood. We have recently developed a novel methodology to screen for transcriptional changes in response to acutely imposed DR upon adult Drosophila melanogaster and identified groups of genes that switch their transcriptional patterns from a normal diet pattern to a restricted diet pattern, or 'switching genes'. In this current report we extend our transcriptional data analysis with gene set enrichment analysis to generate a pathway-centered perspective. The pattern of temporal behavior in response to the diet switch is strikingly similar within and across pathways associated with mRNA processing and protein translation. Furthermore, most genes within these pathways display an initial spike in activity within 6-8. h from the diet switch, followed by a coordinated, partial down-regulation after 24. h. We propose this represents a stereotypical response to DR, which ultimately leads to a mild but widespread inhibition of transcriptional and translational activity. Inhibition of the protein synthesis pathway has been observed in DR in other studies and has been shown to extend lifespan in several model organisms. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Rapid human urbanization can have strong and varied impacts on the behavior and fitness of wild animals. The credit-card hypothesis predicts that low predation and high food predictability in cities lead to the presence of many weak competitors in urban populations. However, no experimental studies to date have found support for this hypothesis. Here, we studied the relationship between urbanization and aggressiveness in males of a widespread North American songbird (the house finch, Haemorhous mexicanus) while taking into account the degree of sexual signal elaboration (plumage coloration), which is known to impact competitive outcomes. In paired laboratory experiments, we found that colorful urban males were less aggressive than drab urban males, whereas there was no significant difference in aggressiveness between colorful and drab rural males. Moreover, we found that colorful urban males were less aggressive than colorful rural males, whereas there was no significant difference in aggressiveness between drab urban and drab rural males. In 4-bird trials (i.e., trials with colorful and drab males from both urban and rural environments), we found that colorful urban males were consistently less aggressive than all others. Taken together, these results support the credit-card hypothesis and the idea that plumage color is an important predictor of social status in urban environments. Finally, in a model-presentation study, we found that urban males with lower body condition avoided drab male models. Urban settings, along with the social and foraging conditions they create, may exert novel selection pressures that shape the competitiveness and status signaling systems of animals. © The Author 2014.},

abstract={The nutritional status of an animal is maintained through a balance between energy intake and energy expenditure, and in the natural environment can fluctuate due to limited food availability and behavioural changes that remove the animal from its food. The integrated physiological processes that underlie an animal's nutritional status can be measured biophysically or biochemically. The Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus has been shown to survive long periods of time without food, which is advantageous when food availability is low, such as during the winter months or when access to food is reduced due to risks associated with predation. In this study N. norvegicus was subjected to nutritional stress (starvation) for a period of 20weeks and various biophysical measures (hepatosomatic index [HSI], length: weight ratio, tissue water content, carbon: nitrogen ratio) and biochemical measures (copper, carbohydrate, lipids, protein, stable isotopes δ15N δ13C) were used to determine how these animals maintain themselves over this period of forced starvation. Results indicate that while there was no variation in the whole weight of each individual, the organ-specific weight of the hepatopancreas (HSI) decreased and there was a corresponding increase in the water content of the hepatopancreas (and tail muscle). In contrast to the findings of previous studies, reserves of lipids decreased within the hepatopancreas. Fuel resources of protein from the tail muscle were not utilised, but reciprocal change in the copper content of the haemolymph to the hepatopancreas is suggestive of a breakdown of haemocyanin. The results provide an initial indication of how N. norvegicus can survive for long periods of time without food, and identify some potential biomarkers for starvation that can be applied to animals caught from the field. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Gape-limited predators are restricted in the shape and size of prey items they can ingest by their trophic morphology. Evolutionary theory predicts that gape-limited predators, such as rattlesnakes, should possess plasticity in their trophic morphology to allow them to respond to environmental cues about their prey base. This study examined the effects of two possible influences over trophic morphology in the pit-viper Crotalus viridis viridis. Snakes from six litters were exposed to diet manipulations performed over 480 days. By day 480, snakes from two prey-size treatments exhibited significantly different head shapes. Snakes reared on whole rodents had broader heads, whereas snakes force-fed homogenized prey had narrower heads. Shape differences varied among litters, suggesting that not all litters responded the same to diet manipulations. Results suggest that trophic morphology of rattlesnakes is plastic, at least in some litters, and can be induced by prey items. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Maternal effects are increasingly recognized to impact upon infectious diseases. Stressful environmental conditions that coincide with high infection prevalence are potential cues for adaptive maternal effects on offspring resistance to infection. We studied how maternal temperature (15 °C, 20 °C and 25 °C), as well as maternal food availability (high and low food) influenced the ability of the crustacean, Daphnia magna, to resist its bacterial parasite, Pasteuria ramosa. Mothers held at a higher temperature and mothers fed a restricted diet produced offspring that were more resistant to P. ramosa infection. Maternal temperature also influenced the progression of disease in infected offspring. Parasite spore production and host reproduction were affected by maternal temperature, but these effects differed in the two genotypes used. As Daphnia populations experience regular summer epidemics of P. ramosa, temperature may be an environmental signal of infection risk. Thus, the enhanced resistance we observed under stressful food and temperature is conceivably an adaptation to looming epidemics. Thus, this study identifies novel ways in which the maternal environment impacts upon disease resistance and indicates how phenotypic plasticity might both alter co-evolution and mitigate epidemics driven by environmental change in a wide range of taxa. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Animals, including fish, display individually consistent behavioral differences that may affect an individual’s vulnerability not only to predation, but also to fishing. Compared with complex natural environments, plain hatchery environments might induce development of behaviors that increase vulnerability to fishing, which would in turn have major implications for the management of stocks by supportive releases. We studied whether the vulnerability of hatchery-reared brown trout (Salmo trutta) to angling could be predicted by rearing method (standard versus enriched) or behavioral variation that was assessed using long-term observations of moving activity in groups. High moving activity in the beginning of the behavioral tests (i.e., exploration behavior) predicted increased vulnerability to angling independently of fish body size. Standard rearing promoted high exploration rate among fish, whereas enriched rearing promoted improvement in body condition in (semi-)natural conditions. However, the driving influence of hunger on vulnerability could not be ruled out, as the most explorative standard-reared fish appeared unable to maintain their body condition during the experiments. This study provides direct evidence that standard hatchery rearing method promotes behaviors that directly predict vulnerability to angling. © 2014, National Research Council of Canada.

abstract={Salamanders are among the few vertebrates that have successfully colonized and exploited subterranean habitats, demonstrating flexibility in behavior and physiology. However, our knowledge of the ecology and life history of many subterranean salamanders is poor because of the limits and challenges of studying organisms in subterranean habitats. The Grotto Salamander (Eurycea spelaea) is an obligate subterranean plethodontid salamander, endemic to the Ozark Plateau Ecoregion of North America, and a top predator in many caves. We conducted a 25-mo mark-releaserecapture study of E. spelaea within a 440-m section of a cave in Delaware County, Oklahoma to better understand the life history and demography of the species. We also examined this salamander’s association with another cave-dependent species, the federally endangered Gray Bat (Myotis grisescens). We found that Grotto Salamanders spend typically 2–5 years as larvae, although some individuals delay metamorphosis several additional years, and that adults could live at least 9 years. We estimated population size to be 305 ± 126 individuals between December 2001 and February 2002, but decreased during subsequent surveys to a low of 101 ± 48 individuals. Body condition varied seasonally; in general, body condition was greater from May to November, when bats were roosting and depositing fresh guano, and lower from December to April when bats were absent. Presumably, fresh guano produced pulses in nutrient availability and invertebrate densities, the latter of which are important food sources for E. spelaea. Declines in bat populations could have detrimental effects throughout subterranean food webs, including negative impacts on E. spelaea populations. © 2014. Danté Fenolio. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={It is a well-appreciated fact that in many organisms the process of ageing reacts highly plastically, so that lifespan increases or decreases when the environment changes. The perhaps best-known example of such lifespan plasticity is dietary restriction (DR), a phenomenon whereby reduced food intake without malnutrition extends lifespan (typically at the expense of reduced fecundity) and which has been documented in numerous species, from invertebrates to mammals. For the evolutionary biologist, DR and other cases of lifespan plasticity are examples of a more general phenomenon called phenotypic plasticity, the ability of a single genotype to produce different phenotypes (e.g. lifespan) in response to changes in the environment (e.g. changes in diet). To analyse phenotypic plasticity, evolutionary biologists (and epidemiologists) often use a conceptual and statistical framework based on reaction norms (genotype-specific response curves) and genotype × environment interactions (G × E; differences in the plastic response among genotypes), concepts that biologists who are working on molecular aspects of ageing are usually not familiar with. Here I briefly discuss what has been learned about lifespan plasticity or, more generally, about plasticity of somatic maintenance and survival ability. In particular, I argue that adopting the conceptual framework of reaction norms and G × E interactions, as used by evolutionary biologists, is crucially important for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying DR and other forms of lifespan or survival plasticity.

abstract={Individual variation in physiology and behaviour can have strong effects on ecological and evolutionary processes. Natal habitat, one source of individual variation, can influence individual phenotype, behaviour and fitness through effects on eventual habitat selection. Natal habitat preference induction occurs when individuals match stimuli in their selected habitat to those of their natal habitat. Natal habitat can also affect habitat selection through its influence on body condition (silver spoon effect). We tested for natal habitat preference induction and body-condition-dependent habitat selection in two species with complex life histories, the spotted salamander, Ambystoma maculatum, and the small-mouthed salamander, Ambystoma texanum. We reared salamanders from hatchlings in mesocosms with leaf, grass or control substrate, and tested juvenile habitat selection through two behavioural assays. We found weak evidence of larger salamanders having decreased latency and sampling more habitats, lending support to the body-condition-dependent habitat selection hypothesis in these species. Juveniles preferred grass litter cues regardless of the substrate in their natal mesocosm, suggesting natal habitat preference induction may not occur in species with complex life histories. We propose that species with complex life histories use simple movement rules, such as moving along habitat gradients, to select postnatal habitat when moving through a novel environment. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Studies of animal ranging patterns and the influencing ecological factors are useful for understanding the relationship between aspects of animal behavior and ecology. In a year-long study, we investigated the ranging behavior and other determining factors for a group of Francois' langur in an isolated habitat of approximately 25.7 ha in Fusui Reserve, China. The Francois' langur home range was estimated to be 15.3 ha, covering ∼60% of their total habitat. The mean yearly day range length estimate was 802.5 m (SD =295.5 m). Langurs changed sleeping sites approximately every 3 days, resulting in increases in the amount of grid cells used and the range length. Food availability of flowers and fruits were seasonal, whereas both mature and immature leaves of most trees were perennial. Ranging behavior was not significantly correlated with the availability of mature leaves, immature leaves, buds, fruits (ripe and unripe fruits) or seeds (p =0.05). These results suggested that variations in food type availability were not factors influencing ranging behavior for this langur group, whereas sleeping site changes, and probably predation avoidance, are factors that influence the ranging patterns of the langur group.},

abstract={Tadpoles show considerable behavioral plasticity. When population densities become high, tadpoles often become cannibalistic, likely in response to intense competition. Conspecific tissues are potentially an ideal diet by composition and should greatly improve growth and development. However, the potential release of alarm cues from the tissues of injured conspecifics may act to deter potential cannibals from feeding. We conducted multiple feeding experiments to test the relative effects that a diet of conspecifics has on tadpole growth and development. Results indicate that while conspecific tissues represent a better alternative to starvation and provide some benefits over low-protein diets, such a diet can have detrimental effects to tadpole growth and/or development relative to diets of similar protein content. Additionally, tadpoles raised individually appear to avoid consuming conspecific tissues and may continue to do so until they suffer from the effects of starvation. However, tadpoles readily fed upon conspecific tissues immediately when raised with competitors. These results suggest that cannibalism may occur as a result of competition rather than the specific quality of available diets, unless such diets lead to starvation. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The hypothalamic-pituitary thyroid (HPT) axis modulates energy homeostasis. Its activity decreases in conditions of negative energy balance but the effects of chronic exercise on the axis are controversial and unknown at hypothalamic level. Wistar male rats were exposed for up to 14 days to voluntary wheel running (WR), or pair-feeding (PF; 18% food restriction), or to repeated restraint (RR), a mild stressor. WR and RR diminished food intake; body weight gain decreased in the 3 experimental groups, butWATmass and serum leptin more intensely in theWRgroup. WR, but not RR, produced a delayed inhibition of central markers of HPT axis activity. At day 14, in WR rats paraventricular nucleus-pro-TRH mRNA and serum TSH levels decreased, anterior pituitary TRHreceptor 1 mRNA levels increased, but serum thyroid hormone levels were unaltered, which is consistent with decreased secretion of TRH and clearance of thyroid hormones. A similar pattern was observed if WR animals were euthanized during their activity phase. In contrast, in PF animals the profound drop of HPT axis activity included decreased serum T3 levels and hepatic deiodinase 1 activity; these changes were correlated with an intense increase in serum corticosterone levels. WR effects on HPT axis were not associated with changes in the activity of the hypothalamicpituitary adrenal axis, but correlated positively with serum leptin levels. These data demonstrate that voluntaryWRadapts the status of the HPT axis, through pathways that are distinct from those observed during food restriction or repeated stress. © 2014 by the Endocrine Society.},

abstract={This study compared the motivation of the blue and yellow macaw (n= 8) and the tufted capuchin (n= 3) to manipulate objects that presented different features, their manipulative repertoires, and their ability to solve complex manipulation tasks. Results show that both species seem to be more motivated to manipulate objects that look like food items and that manipulative behavior may be considered as play behavior in the blue and yellow macaws, and would improve foraging motor skills. The tufted capuchins performed more different action styles than the macaws when manipulating objects, and performed substrate-use behavior - the object is put in relationship with a substrate - while the macaws did not. This is an interesting difference because these characteristics are supposed to be precursory of tool-use, behavior never observed in this macaw species. It may be due to the arboreal lifestyle of the macaw and its neophobic character that do not allow it to easily contact objects. Following the same method and using more individuals, further comparative studies should be conducted in order to test these hypotheses. Both species were able to solve complex manipulation tasks. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

To sidestep these confounds, we tested whether EPP is associated with habitat structure variables and with local conspecific density in a species whose nesting habitat is not used for feeding and lacks predators. In a blue-footed booby, Sula nebouxii, colony, the probability of EPP in a female's nest was highest in parts of the study plot where there were few obstacles to locomotion, and was quadratically related to local density of sexually active males, even though local males did not sire the EP chicks. The probability of a male breeder siring EP (extrapair) chicks elsewhere was quadratically related to local density of sexually active males around his nest. From these patterns we infer that both sexes may foray for EP interactions, that males and females nesting at intermediate density are most likely to be accessed by forayers, and that obstacles in the vicinity of a female's nest constrain access of foraying males. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that individual variation in EPP is associated with habitat structure in the absence of confounding variation in food availability, predation pressure or breeder quality, and the first evidence that EPP opportunities of female and male breeders are reduced by high density of conspecific breeders above a particular threshold. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The system of Circadian Rhythms is a mechanism that, in the forms of animal life, has evolved in order to synchronize the behavior and physiological responses to environmental periodical stimuli, so as to allow faster response and better adaptation to environmental changes. These stimuli (light, food availability, presence of predators, availability of a partner for reproduction) in turn depend on the rotation of the earth on its axis and around the sun. In mammals, there is a central hypothalamic clock, said Master Clock, directly regulated by light in its periodicity, which therefore plays the role of primary synchronizer, and several peripheral clocks, Slave Clock, synchronized with each other and constantly reset the MC. Between external stimuli food plays a fundamental role, as capable of take the place of the light in certain conditions. In recent years there has emerged a direct correlation between alteration of Circadian Rhythm, variously induced, and the development of multifactorial diseases such as obesity and diabetes. The biological clock is involved in the maintenance of energy homeostasis and thus in search of food and in the regulation of body weight. The recent concept of chrono-nutrition, expressed perfectly the influence of food, through times of intake but also by its specific composition, is able to exert on the expression of regulatory genes of circadian rhythms, and therefore the maintenance or alteration of energy homeostasis of the organism.},

abstract={The study objective was to evaluate the feasibility of a telephone delivered intervention consisting of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural strategies aimed at improving diet and physical activity in people diagnosed with psychotic disorders. Twenty participants diagnosed with a non-acute psychotic disorder were recruited. The intervention consisted of eight telephone delivered sessions targeting fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption and leisure screen time, as well as smoking and alcohol use (as appropriate). F&V frequency and variety, and overall diet quality (measured by the Australian Recommended Food Score, ARFS), leisure screen time, overall sitting and walking time, smoking, alcohol consumption, mood, quality of life, and global functioning were examined before and 4-weeks post-treatment. Nineteen participants (95%) completed all intervention sessions, and 17 (85%) completed follow-up assessments. Significant increases from baseline to post-treatment were seen in ARFS fruit, vegetable and overall diet quality scores, quality of life and global functioning. Significant reductions in leisure screen time and overall sitting time were also seen. Results indicated that a telephone delivered intervention targeting key cardiovascular disease risk behaviours appears to be feasible and relatively effective in the short-term for people diagnosed with psychosis. A randomized controlled trial is warranted to replicate and extend these findings. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract={Four visual censuses targeting Octopus vulgaris living in dens on sandy bottoms were carried out from June to October 2013 in the National Park of the Atlantic Galician Islands (NW Spain). Censuses were undertaken by scuba diving between 5 and 21 m depth in daytime. The total area swept was 13.75 ha. There were no significant differences between octopus presence in dens during open and closed fishing seasons. Depth had a significant negative relationship with occupancy. The average number of dens per 1000 m2 was 3.84±0.84 in June and 3.89 in October. The area per den was 260 m2. Den number estimations varied between 1586 and 2057. The largest number of dens (76.5%) was found between 5 and 10 m depth. Den distribution was clumped. No significant differences were found between octopus size classes (small, medium and large) and den diameter. Associate dens were observed. There were no significant differences in den diameter and shell types found around the middens. Many dens could be “permanent”. Drilling bivalve shell behaviour is discussed. The surveyed area had around 1100 individuals, mainly small specimens. No significant differences were found between octopus size and depth. Substrate, den type and food abundance and availability (especially razors Ensis arcuatus) seem to be the main factors influencing dens and octopus density and distribution. Den availability does not appear to be a limiting factor in this case. Temperature, den availability, predators and fishing pressure influencing density and distribution are discussed. Rodas inlet may be a preferential habitat for O. vulgaris individuals ranging from 200 to 2000 g, but especially small specimens (≤1000 g). © 2014 CSIC.},

abstract={Conclusions We find that modulated expression of a single chemoreceptor plays a key role in naturally occurring variation in the prioritization of feeding and exploration. The convergence of three independent regulatory inputs - somatic sex, age, and feeding status - on chemoreceptor expression highlights sensory function as a key source of plasticity in neural circuits.
SummaryBackground Adaptive behavioral prioritization requires flexible outputs from fixed neural circuits. In C. Elegans, the prioritization of feeding versus mate searching depends on biological sex (males will abandon food to search for mates, whereas hermaphrodites will not) as well as developmental stage and feeding status. Previously, we found that males are less attracted than hermaphrodites to the food-associated odorant diacetyl, suggesting that sensory modulation may contribute to behavioral prioritization.
Results We show that somatic sex acts cell autonomously to reconfigure the olfactory circuit by regulating a key chemoreceptor, odr-10, in the AWA neurons. Moreover, we find that odr-10 has a significant role in food detection, the regulation of which contributes to sex differences in behavioral prioritization. Overexpression of odr-10 increases male food attraction and decreases off-food exploration; conversely, loss of odr-10 impairs food taxis in both sexes. In larvae, both sexes prioritize feeding over exploration; correspondingly, the sexes have equal odr-10 expression and food attraction. Food deprivation, which transiently favors feeding over exploration in adult males, increases male food attraction by activating odr-10 expression. Furthermore, the weak expression of odr-10 in well-fed adult males has important adaptive value, allowing males to efficiently locate mates in a patchy food environment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The theory of predation risk effects predicts behavioral responses in prey when risk of predation is not homogenous in space and time. Prey species are often faced with a tradeoff between food and safety in situations where food availability and predation risk peak in the same habitat type. Determining the optimal strategy becomes more complex if predators with different hunting mode create contrasting landscapes of risk, but this has rarely been documented in vertebrates. Roe deer in southeastern Norway face predation risk from lynx, as well as hunting by humans. These two predators differ greatly in their hunting methods. The predation risk from lynx, an efficient stalk-and-ambush predator is expected to be higher in areas with dense understory vegetation, while predation risk from human hunters is expected to be higher where visual sight lines are longer. Based on field observations and airborne LiDAR data from 71 lynx predation sites, 53 human hunting sites, 132 locations from 15 GPS-marked roe deer, and 36 roe deer pellet locations from a regional survey, we investigated how predation risk was related to terrain attributes and vegetation classes/structure. As predicted, we found that increasing cover resulted in a contrasting lower predation risk from humans and higher predation risk from lynx. Greater terrain ruggedness increased the predation risk from both predators. Hence, multiple predators may create areas of contrasting risk as well as double risk in the same landscape. Our study highlights the complexity of predator-prey relationship in a multiple predator setting. Synthesis In this study of risk effects in a multi-predator context, LiDAR data were used to quantify cover in the habitat and relate it to vulnerability to predation in a boreal forest. We found that lynx and human hunters superimpose generally contrasting landscapes of fear on a common prey species, but also identified double-risk zones. Since the benefit of anti-predator responses depends on the combined risk from all predators, it is necessary to consider complete predator assemblages to understand the potential for and occurrence of risk effects across study systems. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={The robust jaws and large, thick-enameled molars of the Plio?Pleistocene hominins Australopithecus and Paranthropus have long been interpreted as adaptations for hard-object feeding. Recent studies of dental microwear indicate that only Paranthropus robustus regularly ate hard items, suggesting that the dentognathic anatomy of other australopiths reflects rare, seasonal exploitation of hard fallback foods. Here, we show that hard-object feeding cannot explain the extreme morphology of Paranthropus boisei. Rather, analysis of long-term dietary plasticity in an animal model suggests year-round reliance on tough foods requiring prolonged postcanine processing in P. boisei. Increased consumption of such items may have marked the earlier transition from Ardipithecus to Australopithecus, with routine hard-object feeding in P. robustus representing a novel behaviour. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Seabirds foraging on pelagic fish develop behavioral strategies specifically adapted to locate inconspicuous prey that are aggregated in spatially dynamic patches. In the marine environment, they may use various mechanisms to detect cues of prey availability. The aggregation of predators at a patch of food is a particularly obvious cue to locate prey, a mechanism known as local enhancement. Pioneering studies described the formation of foraging groups at sea, showing that seabirds are attracted to feeding conspecifics. Improved foraging success due to local enhancement has been suggested from modeling studies, but no direct validation of these results exists. We deployed video cameras concomitantly with GPS loggers on Cape gannets to study the behavioral responses of equipped birds to the aggregation of predators at food patches. We showed that the reaction distances of equipped birds increased with the size of an aggregation, demonstrating that predator aggregations enhance food detectability for foragers. For small aggregations (<50 gannets), reaction distances were mostly less than 10 km, and they increased up to almost 40 km for larger aggregations (100-150 gannets). In addition, we showed that the number and frequency of dives increased with the number of conspecifics aggregated, up to a threshold. The predator aggregations on a patch of food could, therefore, not only inform about the presence of prey but also entail information about foraging conditions. From direct observations on the various components involved, our study provides justification of the use and advantages of local enhancement in foraging seabirds. © 2014 International Society for Behavioral Ecology.

abstract={Sibling cannibalism occurs across diverse taxa and can affect population size and structure, as well as the fitness of parents and the cannibal, via density effects and variation in individual propensity to cannibalize. We examined these effects on sibling cannibalism in juveniles of a web-building spider (Latrodectus hasselti, Australian redbacks). Adult redbacks are solitary, but juveniles live in clusters of variable density for a week after hatching. We confined newly hatched siblings from a singly-mated female to a low or high density treatment in a split-clutch design, then left spiderlings unfed for a week. Our results showed no effect of density on overall cannibalism levels, but a strong correlation between cannibalism counts from the same maternal lines across densities. Unlike web-bound sit-and-wait predators, wandering spiders that are active hunters have been shown to experience density-dependent cannibalism. In contrast, we suggest sibling cannibalism in web-building spiders may be density independent because early cohabitation on the web selects for elevated tolerance of conspecifics. We conclude that, rather than being linked to density, cannibalism of siblings in these species may be controlled more strongly by variation in individual propensity to cannibalize. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Animal personalities are by definition stable over time, but to what extent they may change during development and in adulthood to adjust to environmental change is unclear. Animals of temperate environments have evolved physiological and behavioural adaptations to cope with the cyclic seasonal changes. This may also result in changes in personality: suites of behavioural and physiological traits that vary consistently among individuals. Winter, typically the adverse season challenging survival, may require individuals to have shy/cautious personality, whereas during summer, energetically favourable to reproduction, individuals may benefit from a bold/risk-taking personality. To test the effects of seasonal changes in early life and in adulthood on behaviours (activity, exploration and anxiety), body mass and stress response, we manipulated the photoperiod and quality of food in two experiments to simulate the conditions of winter and summer. We used the common voles (Microtus arvalis) as they have been shown to display personality based on behavioural consistency over time and contexts. Summer-born voles allocated to winter conditions at weaning had lower body mass, a higher corticosterone increase after stress and a less active, more cautious behavioural phenotype in adulthood compared to voles born in and allocated to summer conditions. In contrast, adult females only showed plasticity in stress-induced corticosterone levels, which were higher in the animals that were transferred to the winter conditions than to those staying in summer conditions. These results suggest a sensitive period for season-related behavioural plasticity in which juveniles shift over the bold-shy axis. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Nest-site selection involves trade-offs between the probability of nest discovery by egg predators, danger to the incubating parent from predators and provision of an appropriate microclimate for incubation, and all three components are potentially influenced by nest concealment and distance to habitat edge. Personality traits also affect habitat choice, and the trade-off hypothesis suggests that variable stress-coping strategies may evolve because individuals prioritize either productivity (proactive coping) or survival (reactive coping), both of which cannot be simultaneously maximized. Applying this hypothesis to understand nest-site selection by female eider ducks (Somateria mollissima), we predicted that bold individuals with attenuated stress responsiveness should select concealed nests further away from the shore, thereby promoting clutch survival at the potential expense of reduced escape opportunities for themselves. In testing this prediction, we controlled for individual quality (female body condition and breeding experience) and verified that individual stress responses and nest-site preferences were consistent by analysing their repeatability. Finally, we analysed how the viable proportion of the clutch was related to nest-site and female characteristics. Our prediction was supported: bold females [short flight initiation distance (FID)] and those with lower handling-induced body temperature were found in concealed nests, and bold females and those with lower handling-induced corticosterone concentrations occupied nests farther from the shore. The viable proportion of the clutch peaked at intermediate proportional nest-cover and increased linearly with increasing nest distance from the shore. Stress coping styles may thus be related to nest-site selection, but their fitness consequences may be manifested indirectly through the nest-site characteristics. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Understanding the foraging patterns of reef fishes is crucial for determining patterns of resource use and the sensitivity of species to environmental change. While changes in prey availability and interspecific competition have been linked to patterns of prey selection, body condition, and survival in coral reef fishes, rarely has the influence of abiotic environmental conditions on foraging been considered. We used underwater digital video to explore how prey availability and wave exposure influence the behavioural time budgets and prey selectivity of four species of obligate coral-feeding butterflyfishes. All four species displayed high selectivity towards live hard corals, both in terms of time invested and frequency of searching and feeding events. However, our novel analysis revealed that such selectivity was sensitive to wave exposure in some species, despite there being no significant differences in the availability of each prey category across exposures. In most cases, these obligate corallivores increased their selectivity towards their most favoured prey types at sites of high wave exposure. This suggests there are costs to foraging under different wave environments that can shape the foraging patterns of butterflyfishes in concert with other conditions such as prey availability, interspecific competition, and territoriality. Given that energy acquisition is crucial to the survival and fitness of fishes, we highlight how such environmental forcing of foraging behaviour may influence the ecological response of species to the ubiquitous and highly variable wave climates of shallow coral reefs. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Foraging activity in animals reflects a compromise between acquiring food and avoiding predation. The risk allocation hypothesis predicts that prey animals optimize this balance by concentrating their foraging activity at times of relatively low predation risk, as much as their energy status permits, but empirical evidence is scarce. We used a unique combination of automated telemetry, manual radiotelemetry and camera trapping to test whether activity at high risk times declined with food availability as predicted in a Neotropical forest rodent, the Central American agouti, Dasyprocta punctata. We found that the relative risk of predation by the main predator, the ocelot, Leopardus pardalis, estimated as the ratio of ocelot to agouti activity on camera trap photographs, was up to four orders of magnitude higher between sunset and sunrise than during the rest of the day. Kills of radiotracked agoutis by ocelots during this high-risk period far exceeded expectations given agouti activity. Both telemetric monitoring of radiotagged agoutis and camera monitoring of burrow entrances indicated that agoutis exited their burrows later at dawn, entered their burrows earlier at dusk and had lower overall activity levels when they lived in areas with higher food abundance. Thus, agoutis avoided activity during the high-risk period more strongly when access to food was higher. Our study provides quantitative empirical evidence of prey animals concentrating their activity at times of relatively low predation risk. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Qualitative behavioural assessment (QBA) has been used to quantify the expressive behaviour of animals, and operant tests have been used to quantify measures of behavioural need. In this study we compared measures of behavioural expression and behaviour in operant tests. We examined the behavioural expression of pregnant ewes of body condition score (BCS) 2 and 3. The ewes were exposed to a feed motivation test in which they received a food reward. Pregnant ewes (48-70 days gestation) were assessed during a food motivation test after they had been maintained at BCS 3 (n ≤ 7) or given a decreasing plane of nutrition that resulted in slow loss of 1 BCS unit (over 10-12 weeks; n ≤ 7) or a fast loss of 1 BCS unit (over 4-6 weeks; n ≤ 7). The feed motivation test involved ewes having the opportunity to approach a food reward and then being moved a given distance away from the reward by an automatic gate; they could then subsequently return to the feeder. Continuous video footage of each ewe during one cycle of the gate (approaching and returning from the food reward) was shown in random order to 11 observers who used their own descriptive terms (free-choice profiling methodology; FCP) to score the animals using QBA. Data of the assessment were analysed with generalised Procrustes analysis (GPA), a multivariate statistical technique associated with FCP. The research group also quantified the feeding behaviour of sheep in the same clips. These behaviours included how sheep approached the feeder, behaviours exhibited at the feeder, and how sheep returned from the feeder. There was consensus amongst observers in terms of their assessment of behavioural expression of the sheep (P < 0.001). The GPA found three main dimensions of assessed behavioural expression in the sheep, which together explained 44% of the variation observed. GPA dimension 1 differed between the three treatment groups (P < 0.05): ewes maintained at BCS 3 scored low on GPA dimension 1 (i.e. were described as more calm/bored/comfortable) compared with ewes that had a slow declining BCS (described as more interested/anxious/excited). GPA dimension 2 scores were not significantly different between treatment groups. However, quantitative behaviours exhibited by sheep during the clips were correlated with qualitative behavioural assessments made by the observers. Animals that spent more time 'sniffing and looking for more feed' were attributed lower GPA 2 scores (described as more hungry/searching/excited) (P < 0.05), and animals that 'did not walk directly to the food reward (but stopped along the way)' were attributed significantly higher GPA 2 scores (more curious/intimidated/uneasy) (P < 0.01). GPA dimension 3 scores also did not differ between the treatment groups; however, sheep that had a higher number of feeding events during the entire 23-h feed motivation test were attributed lower GPA dimension 3 scores (they were described as more hungry/bold/interested) (P < 0.05), and sheep that consumed a larger amount of the feed reward were attributed higher GPA dimension 3 scores (more curious/concerned/reserved) (P < 0.05). We conclude that QBA is a valuable method of assessing sheep behavioural expression under the conditions tested, in that it provided an integrative characterisation of sheep behavioural expression that was in agreement with quantitative behavioural measures of feeding. © CSIRO 2014.},

abstract={There is robust evidence for a protective role of interpersonal factors such as social support on alcohol relapse, but research on the mechanisms that social factors may be acting on to effectively protect individuals against relapse is lacking. Prairie voles are highly social, monogamous rodents that freely self-administer ethanol in high amounts, and are a useful model for understanding social influences on alcohol drinking. Here we investigated whether prairie voles can be used to model social influences on relapse using the alcohol deprivation effect, in which animals show a transient increase in ethanol drinking following deprivation. In Experiment I, subjects were housed alone during four weeks of 24-h access to 10% ethanol in a two-bottle choice test. Ethanol was then removed from the cage for 72. h. Animals remained in isolation or were then housed with a familiar same-sex social partner, and ethanol access was resumed. Animals that remained isolated showed an increase in ethanol intake relative to pre-deprivation baseline, indicative of relapse-like behavior. However, animals that were socially housed did not show an increase in ethanol intake, and this was independent of whether the social partner also had access to ethanol. Experiment II replicated the alcohol deprivation effect in a separate cohort of isolated animals. These findings demonstrate that prairie voles display an alcohol deprivation effect and suggest a 'social buffering' effect of relapse-like behavior in the prairie vole. This behavioral paradigm provides a novel approach for investigating the behavioral and neurobiological underpinnings of social influences on alcohol relapse. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Research into the impact of atmospheric change on predator–prey interactions has mainly focused on density dependent responses and trophic linkages. As yet, the chemical ecology underpinning predator–prey interactions has received little attention in environmental change research. Group living animals have evolved behavioral mechanisms to escape predation, including chemical alarm signalling. Chemical alarm signalling between conspecific prey could be susceptible to environmental change if the physiology and behavior of these organisms are affected by changes in dietary quality resulting from environmental change. Using Rubus idaeus plants, we show that elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2 (eCO2) severely impaired escape responses of the aphid Amphorophora idaei to predation by ladybird larvae (Harmonia axyridis). Escape responses to ladybirds was reduced by &gt;50 % after aphids had been reared on plants grown under eCO2. This behavioral response was rapidly induced, occurring within 24 h of being transferred to plants grown at eCO2 and, once induced, persisted even after aphids were transferred to plants grown at ambient CO2. Escape responses were impaired due to reduced sensitivity to aphid alarm pheromone, (E)-β-farnesene, via an undefined plant-mediated mechanism. Aphid abundance often increases under eCO2, however, reduced efficacy of conspecific signalling may increase aphid vulnerability to predation, highlighting the need to study the chemical ecology of predator–prey interactions under environmental change. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Here, we test the hypothesis that fathers are capable of programming their offspring for the type of environment they are likely to encounter. Male threespine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, were either exposed to predation risk while fathering or not. Fathers altered their paternal behaviour when exposed to predation risk, and consequently produced adult offspring with phenotypes associated with strong predation pressure (smaller size, reduced body condition, reduced behavioural activity). Moreover, more attentive fathers produced offspring that showed stronger antipredator responses. These results are consistent with behaviourally mediated paternal programming: fathers can alter offspring phenotypes to match their future environment and influence offspring traits well into adulthood. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Human and non-human animals exhibit a variety of response strategies (e.g., place responding) when searching for a familiar place or evading predators. We still know little about the conditions that support the use of each strategy. We trained rats to locate a hidden food reward in a small-scale spatial search task. The complexity of the search task was manipulated by reducing the number of search locations (25, 4, and 2) within an open-field apparatus and by comparison to a path-based apparatus (plus-maze). After rats were trained to reliably locate the hidden food, each apparatus was shifted to gauge whether rats were searching at the location of the goal relative to extramaze cues (i.e., place responding), or searching in the direction of the goal relative to a combination of intramaze and extramaze cues (i.e., directional responding). The results indicate that the open field supported place responding when more than two response locations were present, whereas, the four-arm plus-maze supported strong directional responding. These results extend prior research into the role of task demands on search strategy, as well as support the use of the four-choice open field as an analog to the Morris water task for future studies targeting the neural underpinnings of place responding. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The acquisition of information such as the location and quality of food, mates or shelter is a key survival requirement for animals. Individuals can acquire information through personal experience (private information) or through observing and interacting with others (social information). Environmental spatial and temporal heterogeneity can mean that sometimes social information conflicts with private knowledge. We tested how personality affected the importance placed on public versus private information in wild female guppies when these two information sources came into conflict. We found that boldness and sociality affected decisions to use conflicting social and private information. Bolder females used social information to avoid competition and/or potential patch depletion, whereas highly social individuals preferred the presence of conspecifics over rich foraging opportunities. There was no evidence of a speed-accuracy trade-off in a spatial associative learning task; rather, bold female guppies learned both more quickly and more accurately than shy females. We found no evidence of a behavioural syndrome between boldness and sociality which is consistent with previous studies on this population. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Diseases caused by impaired regulation of energy balance, in particular obesity, represent a major global health burden. Although polymorphisms, lifestyle and dietary choices have been associated with differential risk of obesity and related conditions, a substantial proportion of the variation in disease risk remains unexplained. Evidence from epidemiological studies, natural experiments and from studies in animal models has shown that a poor intra-uterine environment is associated causally with increased risk of obesity and metabolic disease in adulthood. Induction of phenotypes that increase disease risk involves the fetus receiving cues from the mother about the environment which, via developmental plasticity, modify the phenotype of the offspring to match her environment. However, inaccurate information may induce an offspring phenotype that is mismatched to the future environment. Such mismatch has been suggested to underlie increased risk of metabolic disease associated with a poor early life environment. Recent studies have shown that induction of modified phenotypes in the offspring involves altered epigenetic regulation of specific genes. Identification of a central role of epigenetics in the aetiology of obesity and metabolic disease may facilitate the development of novel therapeutic interventions and of biomarkers of disease risk. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Spatially variable selection pressure within heterogeneous environments can result in the evolution of specialist phenotypes that facilitate co-occurrence of closely related species and limit genetic exchange. If divergent selection pressures maintain reproductive isolation, hybridization is expected to correlate with the strength of underlying ecological gradients and the traits shaped by adaptive processes. We sampled ten replicate topminnow (Fundulus olivaceus and Fundulus notatus) hybrid zones in isolated drainages throughout central and southern North America. In all drainages, species were distributed in an upstream-downstream manner with contact zones localized at confluences featuring abrupt shifts from tributary to river habitat. In two drainages, the typical up and downstream positions of species were reversed. Phenotype differences between the species reflect predicted selection differences along stream gradients. Downstream populations (lower food availability and greater predator pressure) generally showed larger investment in reproduction (higher gonadal somatic index), smaller body size and lower somatic condition compared to upstream populations. Phenotypic differences between the species in the two reversed drainages were consistent with convergence of life history traits in the respective habitats. Phenotypes of individuals of hybrid origin (F1 hybrids or backcrosses) were not significantly different from the average of the two parental forms, though there were trends towards reduced fitness. The prevalence of hybridization among drainages ranged from no hybrids in two drainages to near random mating. The strongest correlates of hybridization rate among replicate hybrid zones were similarity in body shape and the homogeneity of habitat through tributary-river confluences. The two reversed orientation hybrid zones also exhibited high prevalence of hybrids suggesting that phenotypic convergence could lead to increased hybridization. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Urbanization poses serious extinction risks, yet some species thrive in urban environments. This may be due to a pronounced developmental plasticity in these taxa, since phenotypically, plastic organisms may better adjust to unpredictable urban food resources. We studied phenotypic plasticity in Nuctenea umbratica, a common European forest and urban vegetation spider. We subjected spiderlings to low (LF), medium (MF) and high (HF) food treatments and documented their growth and developmental trajectories into adulthood. Spiders from the three treatments had comparable numbers of instars and growth ratios, but differed in developmental periods. Longest developing LF spiders (♀=390, ♂=320 days) had the smallest adults, but MF (♀=300, ♂=240 days) and HF (♀=240, ♂=210 days) spiders reached comparable adult sizes through shorter development. While males and females had comparable instar numbers, females had longer development, higher growth ratios, adult sizes and mass; and while males adjusted their moulting to food availability, female moulting depended on specific mass, not food treatment. We discussed the patterns of Nuctenea sex-specific development and compared our results with published data on two other Holarctic urban colonizers (Larinioides sclopetarius, Zygiella x-notata) exhibiting high plasticity and fast generation turn-over. We conclude that despite relatively unconstrained developmental time in the laboratory enabling Nuctenea to achieve maximal mass and size - main female fitness proxies - their relatively fixed growth ratio and long generation turn-over may explain their lower success in urban environments. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Larvae of many trophically-transmitted parasites alter the behaviour of their intermediate host in ways that increase their probability of transmission to the next host in their life cycle. Before reaching a stage that is infective to the next host, parasite larvae may develop through several larval stages in the intermediate host that are not infective to the definitive host. Early predation at these stages results in parasite death, and it has recently been shown that non-infective larvae of some helminths decrease such risk by enhancing the anti-predator defences of the host, including decreased activity and increased sheltering. However, these behavioural changes may divert infected hosts from an optimal balance between survival and foraging (either seeking food or a mate). In this study, this hypothesis was tested using the intermediate host of the acanthocephalan parasite Pomphorhynchus laevis, the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex. We compared activity, refuge use, food foraging and food intake of hosts experimentally infected with the non-infective stage (acanthella), with that of uninfected gammarids. Behavioural assays were conducted in four situations varying in predation risk and in food accessibility. Acanthella-infected amphipods showed an increase in refuge use and a general reduction in activity and food intake. There was no effect of parasite intensity on these traits. Uninfected individuals showed plastic responses to water-borne cues from fish by adjusting refuge use, activity and food intake. They also foraged more when the food was placed outside the refuge. At the intra-individual level, refuge use and food intake were positively correlated in infected gammarids only. Overall, our findings suggest that uninfected gammarids exhibit risk-sensitive behaviour including increased food intake under predation risk, whereas gammarids infected with the non-infective larvae of P. laevis exhibit a lower motivation to feed, irrespective of predation risk and food accessibility. © 2013 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.},

abstract={Exotic species can provide abundant food resources for native consumers, but predicting which native species will respond positively remains a challenge. We studied the foraging behavior of black-capped (Poecile atricapillus) and mountain (P. gambeli) chickadees in western Montana to compare the degree to which these congeric and syntopic consumers exploited larvae of Urophora, an exotic biological control insect living within the seedheads of the invasive forb, spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe). Chickadees typically forage within tree or shrub cover, whereas knapweed and hence Urophora larvae thrive in open grassland away from cover. We found that black-capped chickadees were much more likely than mountain chickadees to forage for Urophora. Black-capped chickadees strategically minimized time spent in open habitats by flying out from cover to retrieve knapweed seedheads and immediately returning to cover to extract the larvae. Black-capped chickadees also employed an atypical hovering technique nearly twice as often as their congeners did, particularly when foraging away from cover. Via this hovering technique, birds were able to gather knapweed seedheads from erect plants rather than searching for seedheads on the ground. These shifts in foraging behavior allowed black-capped chickadees to exploit Urophora larvae to a much greater degree than their congeners while minimizing exposure to a high-risk habitat, an outcome with potentially important community-wide consequences. Behavioral flexibility has been used to predict the success of invading species. We suggest that behavioral flexibility may also be used to predict how native species will respond to invasions, particularly the availability of exotic food resources. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht(outside the USA).},

abstract={Original sperm competition theory assumed that males trade expenditure on searching for mates for expenditure on the ejaculate and predicted that males should increase their expenditure on the ejaculate in response to increased risk of competition. A recent extension of this theory has modelled pre-copulatory expenditure in terms of direct contest competition and predicts that when the gains from marginal investment in weaponry are large, males might be expected to allocate resources to armaments even at the expense of the ejaculate. Here, we examine socially cued plasticity in allocation to pre- (body condition) and post-copulatory (testes mass) traits in a male dimorphic beetle, Onthophagus taurus, where major males fight for access to females and minor males obtain reproductive success via sperm competition. Both male morphs were either reared in social isolation or exposed to rivals during the period of sexual maturation following adult emergence. Testes mass was found to be insensitive to social cues of future mating competition for both major and minor males. Major males allocated more to body condition when exposed to rivals, a response expected for a species in which the outcome of dyadic contests strongly affects male reproductive success. In contrast, minor male allocation to condition was insensitive to social cues. Our data illustrate how socially cued plasticity in pre- and post-copulatory traits can depend on the relative importance of these episodes of selection for individual male fitness. In O. taurus dung beetles, males strategically adjusted the amount of resources they allocated to winning pre-copulatory contests over access to females. Strategic allocation to pre-copulatory contest competition did not come at a cost to male investment in sperm competition, suggesting that males may trade investment into contest competition against some other life-history trait, such as longevity. The lack of plasticity in testes size suggests that selection from sperm competition may be a relatively constant feature of this species mating system. © 2013 The Authors.

abstract={Benthic suspension feeding is an important process in coastal ecosystems. Among all the World's oceans, coastal ecosystems are the most modified by human impact and changing at accelerating pace. It is complicated to understand, how various environmental factors affect feeding rates of suspension feeders in their natural habitats. Thus, shapes of such relationships are poorly described for several intersections of environmental gradients. In this study, relationships between grazing rates of an invasive bivalve Dreissena polymorpha and ambient environmental factors were investigated in a turbid eutrophic bay of the central Baltic Sea using a novel modelling method of Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), a statistical tool able to handle non-normal distributions, complex relationships, and interactive effects. Feeding rates of mussels were derived from field populations by measuring the content of algal pigments in specimens collected from their natural habitat. The content of pigments was converted to feeding rate separately each time using field experiments measuring simultaneously the content of pigments and biodeposition of mussels. The results suggest that feeding rates of D.polymorpha are related to several environmental factors which gradients outreach the optimal range for the local mussel population. All the observed effects were non-linear with complex shapes. Variability along the resource gradient was the most important predictor of mussel feeding, followed by salinity and disturbance caused by wind. The most important interaction occurred between disturbance and resource gradient, while feeding function showed more plasticity along the latter. Mapping of environmental tipping points with the aid of machine learning methods may enable to concentrate the most relevant information about ecological functions worldwide. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This study examined the population structure, reproductive cycle and feeding pattern of the lanternfish Lampanyctus crocodilus in the Balearic Basin (north-west Mediterranean Sea) from a depth of 450 to 1800m and at a seasonal scale. Juveniles were mainly located at shallower depths, but also at deepest stations in autumn, while adults mostly inhabited intermediate depths with their centre of population density (CPD) located at 800-1000m of depth. The migration of adults to deeper depths was detected in late summer to autumn, probably linked to the occurrence of nepheloid layers at c. 1200m, which in turn enhances the biomass of the zooplankton prey. The diet was mainly based on euphausiids and mysids, with marked seasonal variations both on the upper (450-800 m) and lower (1000-1800 m), where suprabenthic gammariids and pelagic decapods were also dominant. Stomach fullness increased from winter to autumn on the US, while it had a maximum in spring on the LS, in parallel with high consumption of gelatinous zooplankton, which is probably more available after the phytoplankton bloom in late winter. Reproduction occurred in winter, confirmed by the higher percentage of mature females and high gonadosomatic indices (IG) at both depth ranges. Hepatosomatic indices (IH) showed an inverse trend to IG on the US, except in autumn, and was almost parallel on the LS, probably attributable to the migration of adults, which determined different temporal schemes in energy use and storage for reproduction on the US v. LS. Consistent with the different patterns observed at the two depth ranges, environmental drivers of fullness (i.e. feeding intensity) and IG (as a proxy of reproductive cycle) differed on the US and LS. The biomass of mysids and euphausiids was the greatest explanatory variables of fullness on the US and LS, pointing to the increasing feeding intensity when a resource was more available. IH also explained fullness, suggesting that greater feeding intensity in pre-reproductive periods enabled energy storage in the liver. IG was linked directly (i.e. mysids) or indirectly (i.e. surface primary production recorded 2 months before sampling) to food availability, implying a rapid response to vertical food inputs by deep-sea predators. Also, IG in L. crocodilus was related to population density, which suggests aggregations for reproduction. Estimates of L. crocodilus trophic levels, and of other accompanying mesopelagic fishes, indicated that the species feed through a continuum spanning the third trophic level, confirming the key role of mesopelagic fishes in transferring organic carbon between trophic levels. Trophic niche segregation among mesopelagic species was pronounced and non-overlapping groups could be distinguished because of the different vertical distribution and migratory behaviour. The study highlights the important role of the benthic boundary layer in sustaining benthopelagic communities in the deep Mediterranean Sea and the need to study the biology of a species throughout its whole depth range and not just at exploited depths (i.e. fishing grounds). © 2014 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

abstract={The main impetus for 'modern' intensive animal production occurred after the Second World War, when Western governments developed policies to increase the availability of cheap, safe food for their populations. Livestock benefit under intensive husbandry by protection from environmental extremes and predators, and better nutritional and health management. Nevertheless, there are costs to the animal, such as impaired social behaviour, limited choice of living environment or pen mates, poor environmental stimulation and behavioural restrictions. The rapid progress in genetic selection of production traits has also, in some cases, adversely affected welfare by creating anatomical and metabolic problems. Above all, the intensively housed animal is heavily reliant on the stockperson and, therefore, inadequate care and husbandry practices by the stockperson may be the largest welfare risk. In a future in which the food supply may be limited as the world's population grows and land availability shrinks, intensive animal production is likely to expand. At the same time, ethical considerations surrounding intensive farming practices may also become more prominent. Novel technologies provide the opportunity to enhance both the productivity and welfare of intensively kept animals. Developing countries are also establishing more intensive commercial systems to meet their growing need for animal protein. Intensive livestock production in such countries has the potential for major expansion, particularly if such developments address the key constraints of poor welfare, inadequate nutrition, poor reproduction, poor housing, and high mortality often seen with traditional systems, and if farmer access to emerging market opportunities is improved. However, as shown by previous experience, inadequate regulation and staff who lack the appropriate training to care for the welfare of intensively housed livestock can be major challenges to overcome.},

abstract={Aged dogs spontaneously develop many features of human aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) including cognitive decline and neuropathology. In this review, we discuss age-dependent learning tasks, memory tasks, and functional measures that can be used in aged dogs for sensitive treatment outcome measures. Neuropathology that is linked to cognitive decline is described along with examples of treatment studies that show reduced neuropathology in aging dogs (dietary manipulations, behavioral enrichment, immunotherapy, and statins). Studies in canine show that multi-targeted approaches may be more beneficial than single pathway manipulations (e.g., antioxidants combined with behavioral enrichment). Aging canine studies show good predictive validity for human clinical trials outcomes (e.g., immunotherapy) and several interventions tested in dogs strongly support a prevention approach (e.g., immunotherapy and statins). Further, dogs are ideally suited for prevention studies as they the age because onset of cognitive decline and neuropathology strongly support longitudinal interventions that can be completed within a 3-5 year period. Disadvantages to using the canine model are that they lengthy, use labor-intensive comprehensive cognitive testing, and involve costly housing (almost as high as that of non-human primates). However, overall, using the dog as a preclinical model for testing preventive approaches for AD may complement work in rodents and non-human primates. © 2014 Davis and Head.},

abstract={The perfectionism model of binge eating (PMOBE) is an integrative model explaining the link between perfectionism and binge eating. This model proposes socially prescribed perfectionism confers risk for binge eating by generating exposure to 4 putative binge triggers: interpersonal discrepancies, low interpersonal esteem, depressive affect, and dietary restraint. The present study addresses important gaps in knowledge by testing if these 4 binge triggers uniquely predict changes in binge eating on a daily basis and if daily variations in each binge trigger mediate the link between socially prescribed perfectionism and daily binge eating. Analyses also tested if proposed mediational models generalized across Asian and European Canadians. The PMOBE was tested in 566 undergraduate women using a 7-day daily diary methodology. Depressive affect predicted binge eating, whereas anxious affect did not. Each binge trigger uniquely contributed to binge eating on a daily basis. All binge triggers except for dietary restraint mediated the relationship between socially prescribed perfectionism and change in daily binge eating. Results suggested cross-cultural similarities, with the PMOBE applying to both Asian and European Canadian women. The present study advances understanding of the personality traits and the contextual conditions accompanying binge eating and provides an important step toward improving treatments for people suffering from eating binges and associated negative consequences. © 2014 American Psychological Association.},

A bird's perfect eye is useless if it fails to avoid a stalking cat. If we fail in choosing a partner with complementary immunogenes, our ability to detect major histocompatibility complex-dependent body odors is worthless. Besides being able to detect all available prey items, the diet that maximizes net energy gain must be chosen. Individuals that are selected naturally will be those best able to avoid predators, choose mates, select food, and so on. Those with less perfect behavior produce fewer offspring, and their genotypes will disappear. Ecology is the stage on which the fittest have behaved most successfully. Thus, their strategies prevail today. Behavioral ecology is about the optimal design of behavior. © 2014 The Author.},

abstract={Predation influences the ecology and behaviour of prey species and it is well known that the risk of predation affects prey's decision making. We investigated whether predation risk through moon phase and exposure to the faecal odour of a natural predator, the red fox Vulpes vulpes, affect feeding behaviour and physiological response in wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus). Antipredatory response was studied by live trapping under new and full moon in odourless control areas and areas experimentally manipulated with red fox fresh faeces. Food intake by individuals was determined as the amount of bait remaining in each trap and the physiological response was measured non-invasively analysing faecal corticosterone metabolites (FCM). Traps treated with faeces of red fox were the most avoided, and this avoidance was more significant during full moon. Food intake by wood mice varied according to the moon phase being significantly lower under full moon nights. We found sex, breeding condition and weight of individuals explaining the variation found in FCM concentrations, but no changes in FCM levels due to moon phase or exposure to red fox faeces were detected. These results indicate that wood mice avoid red fox faecal odour and this antipredatory response as well as feeding behaviour are significantly influenced by moon phase. However, no physiological response was found due to predation risk suggesting that wood mice do not take these predation cues enough reliable to experience physiological changes. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Increasing urban development can have significant effects on wildlife species, including carnivores. Some carnivore species have been able to adapt to and even thrive in urban environments, including coyotes (Canis latrans). The presence of carnivores in urban areas can sometimes lead to conflicts with humans and their pets. Although coyotes may frequently use urban areas, they also inhabit natural areas surrounding urban development. Understanding the various factors affecting patch choice of urban coyotes may assist wildlife officials in managing human-coyote conflicts. Both sex and behavioral profile can influence patch choice; bold individuals are more likely to be exploratory than shy animals, which can result in increased conflicts in urban environments. Using a captive population of coyotes, we tested whether coyotes preferred urban (anthropogenic) habitat structure, natural structure, or a mixture of structures and whether sex, behavioral profile, biological season, or food manipulation affected coyote patch choice. Coyotes generally preferred the control, homogeneous structure representing their natal habitat (mean percentage of time 23.3%. ±. 19.3 SD; P= 0.037). The next most preferred habitat for coyotes, especially females (23.7. ±. 16.6% for 25% urban pen; P= 0.020) and bold coyotes (27.8. ±. 23.2% for 75% urban pen; P= 0.005), was a mixture of anthropogenic and natural structures rather than uniform structure (all natural or all anthropogenic), and this preference was more strongly expressed during the non-breeding season (25.6. ±. 23.2% for 75% urban pen; P= 0.017). Food had no effect on patch choice (P= 0.983); coyotes appeared to be primarily motivated by the structure of the habitat rather than by the amount of food within each habitat. Our results suggested that urban areas containing large amounts of both natural and anthropogenic structures are more likely to be used by coyotes and, thus, could have the potential for human-coyote conflicts. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background Understanding food choice behavior in adolescence is important because many core eating habits may be tracked into adulthood. The food choices of at least 2.3% of teenagers living in the United Kingdom are determined by food allergies. However, the effect of food allergies on eating habits in teenagers has not yet been studied. Objective To provide an understanding of how teenagers with food allergies make food choice decisions and how these differ from those of non-food-allergic teenagers. Methods One focus group discussion with non-food-allergic teenagers (n = 11) and 14 semistructured interviewers (7 with food-allergic and 7 with non-food-allergic teenagers) were performed (age range, 12-18 years). The focus group discussion and interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results Teenagers from both groups (food-allergic and non-food-allergic) named sensory characteristics of foods as the main reason for choosing them. Some food-allergic teenagers downplayed their allergy and frequently engaged in risk-taking behavior in terms of their food choices. However, they reported difficulties in trying new foods, especially when away from home. Parental control was experienced as protective by those with food allergies, whereas non-food-allergic teenagers felt the opposite. Most teenagers, including food-allergic ones, expressed the wish to eat similar foods to their friends. Other themes did not vary between the 2 groups. Conclusion Food-allergic teenagers strive to be able to make similar food choices to their friends, although differences to non-food-allergic teenagers exist. It is important to address these differences to improve their dietary management. © 2014 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={When choosing their sleeping sites, primates make adaptive trade-offs between various biotic and abiotic constraints. In human-modified environments, anthropic factors may play a role. We assessed the influence of ecological (predation), social (intergroup competition), and anthropic (proximity to human settlements) factors in sleeping site choice by long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) occupying a habitat at the interface of natural forests and human-modified zones in Bali Barat National Park, Indonesia. Over the course of 56 nights, we collected data relating to physical features of sleeping trees, patterns of the use of sleeping sites within the home range, pre-sleep behavior, diurnal ranging patterns and availability of natural and human food. Overall, the macaques used 17 sleeping sites with 37 sleeping trees. When the monkeys slept in forest zones, they selected sleeping trees that had larger trunks but were not significantly taller than surrounding trees. Though the macaques rarely re-used sleeping sites on consecutive nights, they frequently re-used four sites over the study period. The group favored sleeping within the core area of its home range, despite the occurrence of frequent agonistic intergroup encounters there. Macaques preferentially selected sleeping trees located within or near human-modified zones, especially when human food was abundant and natural food was scarce. These results partially support the hypothesis that long-tailed macaques choose their sleeping sites to avoid predation; proximity to human settlements appears to be the primary factor influencing sleeping site choice in this primate species. Our results reflect the strong influence that anthropic factors have on primates, which subsist in increasingly human-dominated landscapes. Am. J.

abstract={Prey consumption forms a large part of prey-handling time, and knowledge of where prey is ingested can inform management of predator-prey systems. Safeguarding habitats that promote prey consumption could enhance populations of facultative or obligate carnivores of conservation concern. We investigated habitat characteristics at 124 sites where radiocollared adult grizzly bears, Ursus arctos (N=9) consumed ungulates, and we contrasted these sites with paired random sites. We developed a priori models incorporating the potential effects of ungulate and plant food distribution as well as risks of detection by humans and other carnivores on consumption site choice, and evaluated which factors best explain grizzly bear food-caching behaviour. Ungulates were consumed in forested areas, close to edges, and where horizontal cover was high, whereby vegetation impeded visibility of the ungulate carcass. Distance to roads had no effect on the distribution of prey consumption sites, but carcasses were further from trails than expected. Models incorporating presence/absence of key non-ungulate bear foods had little weight of evidence (wi≤0.01). Food-caching behaviour did not appear to be related to variation in resource availability or risk of food spoilage but was significantly influenced by prey size. Although bears chose sites that minimized detection risk, spent more time at larger carcasses and cached 75.9% of ungulates, 50% of consumption sites had other carnivore sign, which was more likely to be present at large carcasses. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Dieting and the increased availability of highly palatable food are considered major contributing factors to the large incidence of eating disorders and obesity. This study was aimed at investigating the role of the cannabinoid (CB) system in a novel animal model of compulsive eating, based on a rapid palatable diet cycling protocol. Male Wistar rats were fed either continuously a regular chow diet (Chow/Chow, control group) or intermittently a regular chow diet for 2 days and a palatable, high-sucrose diet for 1 day (Chow/Palatable). Chow/Palatable rats showed spontaneous and progressively increasing hypophagia and body weight loss when fed the regular chow diet, and excessive food intake and body weight gain when fed the palatable diet. Diet-cycled rats dramatically escalated the intake of the palatable diet during the first hour of renewed access (7.5-fold compared to controls), and after withdrawal, they showed compulsive eating and heightened risk-taking behavior. The inverse agonist of the CB1 receptor, SR141716 reduced the excessive intake of palatable food with higher potency and the body weight with greater efficacy in Chow/Palatable rats, compared to controls. Moreover, SR141716 reduced compulsive eating and risk-taking behavior in Chow/Palatable rats. Finally, consistent with the behavioral and pharmacological observations, withdrawal from the palatable diet decreased the gene expression of the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase in the ventromedial hypothalamus while increasing that of CB 1 receptors in the dorsal striatum in Chow/Palatable rats, compared to controls. These findings will help understand the role of the CB system in compulsive eating. We evaluated the role of the cannabinoid (CB) system in a novel animal model of compulsive eating. Our results show that alternating access to a palatable diet led to spontaneous fluctuations of food intake and body weight, dramatic escalation of palatable food consumption, compulsive eating as well as CB system neuroadaptations. Administration of the CB1 receptor antagonist, SR141716, reduced both excessive intake and compulsive eating. These findings provide important insights into the role of the CB system in compulsive eating. © 2013 Society for the Study of Addiction.},

abstract={Purpose: The aim of this study was to define the associated factors and predictors of postlaparoscopic cholecystectomy diarrhea (PLCD) at different time intervals after the operation and to identify the possible associated factors and predictors of PLCD. We also aimed to determine the effectiveness of a low-fat diet in these patients and to educate the patients about their diet after the operation.
Methods: Data were obtained from clinical records and preoperative interviews with patients, who were also interviewed or contacted by telephone 1 week after the operation, and then surveyed by telephone 3 months later using standardized questionnaires. A total of 125 consecutive patients who were adequately informed and who had assented to accepting a prescription of a low-fat diet after undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy participated in this prospective study.
Results: Thirty-eight patients (25.2%) had diarrhea 1 week after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and seven patients (5.7%) had diarrhea 3 months after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The important predictors of PLCD at 1 week were a low-fat diet (B = -0.177, p = 0.000) and a high score on a preoperative diarrhea scale (B = 0.311, p = 0.031). There was no predictor for PLCD 3 months after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
Conclusion: We advise patients who have undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy to follow a low-fat diet for at least 1 week to reduce the possibility of diarrhea, especially when they are ≤45 years of age, of male sex, and had a high preoperative tendency for diarrhea.
Background: Diarrhea is part of the postlaparoscopic cholecystectomy syndrome, but is not well defined. Published reports have ignored possible associated factors such as the preoperative excretion pattern, gastrointestinal disorders, personality disorders, the effect of drugs, unsanitary food, and high-fat diets.

abstract={The invasive American mink has been a component of Iceland's fauna since the 1930s. Hunting statistics indicate that until 2003 the population size was increasing, but thereafter decreased rapidly. The Icelandic marine environment has experienced various changes in recent years, including rising sea temperature and sand-eel collapse followed by seabird recruitment failure and population declines. Furthermore the arctic fox population has increased at least six-fold in the last three decades. Mink stomach content analysis in the period 2001-2009 revealed diet changes, and signs of reduced prey availability for this generalist predator, that were most significant in males. The most marked shift in composition was a decrease in consumption of birds. Our findings suggest that climate events, together with competition with increasing numbers of arctic foxes over terrestrial food, contributed to the sharp reduction in the mink population from 2004 and onwards. Despite their generalist behaviour, mink have apparently failed to respond fully to these environmental changes, and this susceptibility may benefit attempts to control their numbers. The results are relevant to the ability of top predators in general to cope with diverse ecosystem alterations triggered by climate change. © 2013 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.},

abstract={Populations of invasive species tend to have fewer parasites in their introduced ranges than in their native ranges and are also thought to have fewer parasites than native prey. This 'release' from parasites has unstudied implications for native predators feeding on exotic prey. In particular, shifts from native to exotic prey should reduce levels of trophically transmitted parasites. We tested this hypothesis in native populations of pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) in Lake Opinicon, where fish stomach contents were studied intensively in the 1970s, prior to the appearance of exotic zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in the mid-1990s. Zebra mussels were common in stomachs of present-day pumpkinseeds, and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen confirmed their importance in long-term diets. Because historical parasite data were not available in Lake Opinicon, we also surveyed stomach contents and parasites in pumpkinseed in both Lake Opinicon and an ecologically similar, neighboring lake where zebra mussels were absent. Stomach contents of pumpkinseed in the companion lake did not differ from those of pre-invasion fish from Lake Opinicon. The companion lake, therefore, served as a surrogate "pre-invasion" reference to assess effects of zebra mussel consumption on parasites in pumpkinseed. Trophically transmitted parasites were less species-rich and abundant in Lake Opinicon, where fish fed on zebra mussels, although factors other than zebra mussel consumption may contribute to these differences. Predation on zebra mussels has clearly contributed to a novel trophic coupling between littoral and pelagic food webs in Lake Opinicon. © 2014 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.},

abstract={This study piloted a multiple aspect approach to assess differences or changes in equine behaviour, using physiological (heart rates - HR, salivary cortisol - SC) and behavioural measures in various routine (feed-time, riding, turning out) and test situations (novel situation tests NS: 2× reactivity and 2× handling, Cross-over design). In order to evaluate if this approach could identify different behavioural patterns, two distinct groups of riding school horses (selected by experienced equine professionals) were observed repeatedly over 6 weeks: 6 excitable/nervous horses (EX: Age: mean. =. 14. ±. 3.4, 8-18. yrs, BW 677. ±. 48. kg, Body Condition [BC]. =. 4.6. ±. 0.4) and 6 calm, quiet horses (CA: Age: mean. =. 16. ±. 2.5, 12-18. yrs, BW 645. ±. 35, BC 5.1. ±. 0.4).EX horses had consistently lower SC levels than CA horses (p&lt;0.01), when coming in from the paddock in the morning. Therefore, there was a significant increase of SC after feeding for EX horses (+43%, p&lt;0.05) but not for Group CA (only 16%). After feeding SC showed no difference between the two groups. Calm horses had significantly higher HRs (44±1.2bpm) while waiting for feed and post feeding (p&lt;0.01) than EX horses (38±0.7; p&lt;0.05). Behavioural measures showed significantly higher agitation scores for EX horses during feeding, walking to (p&lt;0.01) and release into paddock (p&lt;0.05). When ridden, EX horses showed a greater amount of threatening behaviour towards other horses (p&lt;0.05) and CA horses showed a significantly greater reluctance to move forward (p&lt;0.05). All mean agitation scores were significantly higher for Group EX (EX 2.3, CA 1.8, s.e.m. 0.3; p&lt;0.01) and apart from feed time these showed good correlations with behaviour observations. In the NS reactivity test CA horses had a significantly higher HR variability than EX horses (CA: 64±10.5, EX: 41±3.5, p&lt;0.05). There was no correlation between HRs and SC but in the NS handling test there was a correlation between SC and refusals to cross a bridge (p&lt;0.01; rs[12]=0.70) as well as SC and agitation score (p=0.07; rs[12]=0.54). Horses which displayed a greater level of investigation scored lower in agitation behaviours (p&lt;0.01, rs[12]=-0.68). The methodology applied, clearly and consistently highlighted differences between horse groups, although the physiological measures did not always follow assumptions. Within groups individual horses reacted differently in standardised test and routine situations, highlighting that multiple testing will increase the chances of observing subtle changes in behaviour or perceived stress. © 2014 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={Examination of angler-caught piscivore stomachs revealed that Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush, Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, and Walleyes Sander vitreus altered their diets in response to unprecedented declines in Lake Huron's main-basin prey fish community. Diets varied by predator species, season, and location but were nearly always dominated numerically by some combination of Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus, Rainbow Smelt Osmerus mordax, Emerald Shiner Notropis atherinoides, Round Goby Neogobius melanostomus, or terrestrial insects. Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (steelhead), Coho Salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch, and Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar had varied diets that reflected higher contributions of insects. Compared with an earlier (1983–1986) examination of angler-caught predator fishes from Lake Huron, the contemporary results showed an increase in consumption of nontraditional prey (including conspecifics), use of smaller prey, and an increase in insects in the diet, suggesting that piscivores were faced with chronic prey limitation during this study. The management of all piscivores in Lake Huron will likely require consideration of the pervasive effects of changes in food webs, especially if prey fish remain at low levels.

abstract={Background Understanding the nature of environmental factors that contribute to behavioral health is critical for successful prevention strategies in individuals at risk for psychiatric disorders. These factors are typically experiential in nature, such as stress and urbanicity, but nutrition - in particular dietary deficiency of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) - has increasingly been implicated in the symptomatic onset of schizophrenia and mood disorders, which typically occurs during adolescence to early adulthood. Thus, adolescence might be the critical age range for the negative impact of diet as an environmental insult. Methods A rat model involving consecutive generations of n-3 PUFA deficiency was developed on the basis of the assumption that dietary trends toward decreased consumption of these fats began 4-5 decades ago when the parents of current adolescents were born. Behavioral performance in a wide range of tasks as well as markers of dopamine-related neurotransmission was compared in adolescents and adults fed n-3 PUFA adequate and deficient diets. Results In adolescents, dietary n-3 PUFA deficiency across consecutive generations produced a modality-selective and task-dependent impairment in cognitive and motivated behavior distinct from the deficits observed in adults. Although this dietary deficiency affected expression of dopamine-related proteins in both age groups in adolescents but not adults, there was an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase expression that was selective to the dorsal striatum. Conclusions These data support a nutritional contribution to optimal cognitive and affective functioning in adolescents. Furthermore, they suggest that n-3 PUFA deficiency disrupts adolescent behaviors through enhanced dorsal striatal dopamine availability. © 2014 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract={Phylloporia ribis is an edible fungus in China. Its fermented mycelia have been approved by the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of PR China for use as a novel food material, but little information on its safety is available. The present research was the first to evaluate acute and subchronic toxicity in experimental animals of fermented Phylloporia ribis mycelia (FPM) following standard procedures. In acute toxicity study, FPM was orally administered to male and female mice twice a day at single dose of 10. g/kg bw. The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of FPM for mice of both sexes was over 10. g/kg bw. No death and abnormal behaviors occurred during 14. days study except for an increased locomotor activity in three animals. In 90-day feeding study, male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed diets containing 10.0%, 5.0%, 2.5%, 1.25% and 0% (control) FPM for 90. days. The treatment caused no effects on mortality, gross pathology, histology, hematology, and blood chemistry, no dose-dependent changes in food consumption, but caused effect on body weight gain compared with control group.

abstract={1. Modification of behaviours in the presence of predators or predation cues is widespread among animals. The costs of a behavioural change in the presence of predators or predation cues depend on fitness effects of lost feeding opportunities and, especially when organisms are sexually dimorphic in size or timing of maturation, these costs are expected to differ between the sexes. 2. Larval Aedes triseriatus (Say) (Diptera: Culicidae) were used to test the hypothesis that behavioural responses of the sexes to predation cues have been selected differently due to different energy demands. 3. Even in the absence of water-borne predation cues, hungry females (the larger sex) spent more time browsing than did males, indicating a difference in energy needs. 4. In the presence of predation cues, well-fed larvae of both sexes reduced their activity more than did hungry larvae, and males shifted away from high-risk behaviours to a greater degree than did females, providing the first evidence of sex-specific antipredator behaviour in foraging mosquito larvae. 5. Because sexual size dimorphism is common across taxa, and energetic demands are probably correlated with size dimorphism, this research demonstrates the importance of investigating sex-specific behaviour and behavioural responses to enemies, and cautions against generalising results between sexes. © 2014 The Royal Entomological Society.},

abstract={In captivity, personality types differ in behavioral flexibility: "fast" (neophilic, exploratory, and aggressive) types quickly form routines, whereas "slow" types continually adjust their behavior with environmental changes. If these differences extend to pertinent natural environmental changes, which indicate changing predation or starvation threat, then personality may reflect important variation in how animals manage risk. We examined whether personality traits classified in captivity would predict the behavioral flexibility of blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus as they foraged in the wild. Behavioral flexibility was defined as the tendency to adjust feeder use with changing winter air temperature, an indicator of starvation risk. At the population level, birds reduced their feeder use on warm days. Individuals, though, varied widely, with some instead using feeders at a relatively fixed, temperature-independent rate. Sex and size, correlates of dominance in blue tits, did not predict behavioral flexibility. Instead, behavioral flexibility was predicted by age and 2 personality traits: old, neophobic, and exploratory birds were more behaviorally flexible than young, neophilic, and nonexploratory birds. Our findings suggest that personality types differ in how they use information about their environments and hence cope with environmental change. © 2014 International Society for Behavioral Ecology.

abstract={Many animals show behavioural syndromes (i.e. suites of correlated behaviours across multiple situations). These behavioural correlations, however, imply limitations in the behavioural plasticity of individuals when facing the trade-off between predation risk and starvation risk. Some models suggest that proactive animals prioritize the reduction of starvation risk, while reactive animals do the opposite. Therefore, fast explorers that are also bold (i.e. proactive) are assumed to pay a predation cost associated with their behavioural trait. However, it has recently been suggested that proactive individuals may be able to compensate for their higher risk of predation by adopting some antipredator behaviours. In this study we tested these two alternative hypotheses with wild wintering Eurasian siskins, Carduelis spinus, foraging at artificial feeders. Male siskins have a melanin-based black bib that has been found to be correlated with exploratory behaviour, aggressiveness and dominance, and therefore is a signal of proactivity. We found that male siskins with large black bibs uttered more distress calls upon capture and displayed a vigilance strategy that improved predator detection. Moreover, this vigilance strategy did not reduce food intake rate. These results show that proactive individuals are not reckless, but instead compensate for their personality trait with stronger antipredator behaviours, and thus, do not necessarily have to pay a predation cost. Our results support the view of a positive relationship between eumelanism, proactive personality and the display of antipredator behaviours. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Background Current evidence suggests that many patients with self-reported non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) retain gastrointestinal symptoms on a gluten-free diet (GFD) but continue to restrict gluten as they report 'feeling better'. Aim To investigate the notion that a major effect of gluten in those with NCGS is on mental state and not necessarily on gastrointestinal symptoms. Methods Twenty-two subjects (24-62 years, five male) with irritable bowel syndrome who had coeliac disease excluded but were symptomatically controlled on a GFD, undertook a double-blind cross-over study. Participants randomly received one of three dietary challenges for 3 days, followed by a minimum 3-day washout before crossing over to the next diet. Challenge gluten-free food was supplemented with gluten (16 g/day), whey (16 g/day) or not supplemented (placebo). End-points included mental state as assessed by the Spielberger State Trait Personality Inventory (STPI), cortisol secretion and gastrointestinal symptoms. Results Gluten ingestion was associated with higher overall STPI state depression scores compared to placebo [M = 2.03, 95% CI (0.55-3.51), P = 0.010] but not whey [M = 1.48, 95% CI (-0.14 to 3.10), P = 0.07]. No differences were found for other STPI state indices or for any STPI trait measures. No difference in cortisol secretion was identified between challenges. Gastrointestinal symptoms were induced similarly across all dietary challenges. Conclusions Short-term exposure to gluten specifically induced current feelings of depression with no effect on other indices or on emotional disposition. Gluten-specific induction of gastrointestinal symptoms was not identified. Such findings might explain why patients with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity feel better on a gluten-free diet despite the continuation of gastrointestinal symptoms. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={This article is part of a Special Issue "Energy Balance".Ingestive behavior in free-ranging populations of nonhuman primates is influenced by resource availability and social group organization and provides valuable insight on the evolution of ecologically adaptive behaviors and physiological systems. As captive populations were established, questions regarding proximate mechanisms that regulate food intake in these animals could be more easily addressed. The availability of these captive populations has led to the use of selected species to understand appetite control or metabolic physiology in humans. Recognizing the difficulty of quantitating food intake in free-ranging groups, the use of captive, singly-housed animals provided a distinct advantage though, at the same time, produced a different social ecology from the animals' natural habitat. However, the recent application of novel technologies to quantitate caloric intake and energy expenditure in free-feeding, socially housed monkeys permits prospective studies that can accurately define how food intake changes in response to any number of interventions in the context of a social environment. This review provides an overview of studies examining food intake using captive nonhuman primates organized into three areas: a) neurochemical regulation of food intake in nonhuman primates; b) whether exposure to specific diets during key developmental periods programs differences in diet preferences or changes the expression of feeding related neuropeptides; and c) how psychosocial factors influence appetite regulation. Because feeding patterns are driven by more than just satiety and orexigenic signals, appreciating how the social context influences pattern of feeding in nonhuman primates may be quite informative for understanding the biological complexity of feeding in humans. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: Alcohol use and abuse patterns have created a need for novel treatment models. Current research has turned its focus on reward pathways associated with intrinsic necessities, such as feeding. Theories suggest that drugs of abuse seize control of natural reward pathways and dysregulate normal function, leading to chronic addiction. One such pathway involving the hunger stimulating peptide, ghrelin, is the focus of our study. Methods: Male C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to groups and treated with vehicle or a ghrelin antagonist, either [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 (DLys) or JMV2959. Three experiments tested ghrelin antagonism using different doses; experiment 1 tested 12 mg/kg JMV2959; experiment 2 tested 15 mg/kg DLys; experiment 3 tested 9 mg/kg JMV2959. Using a 2-bottle choice 24-hour access paradigm, data were collected for ethanol intake, preference, water intake, and food intake at 4 and 24 hours after injection. Results: Experiment 1 showed that 12 mg/kg of JMV2959 decreased ethanol, water, and food intake, without affecting preference. Experiment 2 showed that 15 mg/kg of DLys decreased ethanol intake, preference, and water intake only on the first day of treatment. Experiment 3 showed that 9 mg/kg of JMV2959 decreased only ethanol and food intake. No change was seen during deprivation, and JMV2959 was still effective at reducing ethanol intake upon reintroduction. Despite the change in food intake, there were no differences in body weight throughout the experiments. It should be noted that the majority of significant effects were only found 4 hours postinjection. Conclusions: The results show that compounds that block ghrelin receptor activity are effective at decreasing ethanol intake. However, DLys was only effective at reducing intake and preference on the first day, suggesting a quick tolerance and selectivity for ethanol. JMV2959 consistently reduced ethanol intake, but at the higher dose also reduced all other consummatory behaviors. Thus, ghrelin antagonists provide a viable potential for treatment of alcohol abuse disorders, but further research is needed to determine an appropriate dose and administration paradigm. © 2014 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.},

abstract={Summary: Omnivory enables animals to fill more than one trophic niche, providing access to a wider variety of food resources with potentially higher nutrient value, particularly when resources become scarce. Animals can achieve omnivory using different strategies, for example opportunistic foraging, or switching between multiple trophic niches. The Neotropical bat Glossophaga soricina (Pallas, 1766) is a common and widespread species known for nectar feeding, but it also eats fruit and insects. Approaching stationary objects (flowers and fruits) or moving objects (insects) poses different sensory tasks and should require different echolocation behaviours. Here we tested the contrasting hypothesis that G. soricina can approach both stationary and moving objects using the same echolocation behaviour, thus feeding at different trophic levels by a single sensory mechanism. Using DNA barcoding, we demonstrate that G. soricina eats beetles (Coleoptera), flies (Diptera) and noctuid moths with bat-detecting ears. Laboratory observations show that G. soricina actively hunts for prey so insect consumption does not appear to be opportunistic. After capture, individuals consumed prey while perched and manipulated them with jaw, thumb, wrist and wing movements, but food handling was longer and chewing rate slower than in obligate insectivores. In contrast to most insectivorous bats, the echolocation calls of G. soricina are of high frequency and low intensity, and G. soricina did not produce feeding buzzes when approaching insects. An acoustic model of detection distances shows that its low-intensity calls fail to trigger the auditory neurons of eared moths, allowing G. soricina to overcome auditory prey defences. Individuals achieved niche flexibility using a unique but generalist behavioural approach rather than employing two different specialist methods. Our findings provide a novel insight into the functional mechanisms of insect capture in G. soricina and highlight the importance of considering niche flexibility in classifying trophic links in ecological communities. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Owing to the trade-off between time for searching for and exploiting resources, choosing a profitable food resource is key for an animal's survival and reproductive success. Although the optimal diet model (ODM) from optimal foraging theory (OFT) has demonstrated this point successfully by modelling the global maximization of energy intake rate for foraging, the behavioural mechanisms by which animals achieve optimization, especially when facing a novel environment, have yet to be understood. Here we propose a recent experience-driven (RED) decision-making rule of foraging that relies only on short-term memory of recent feeding experience and hunger aversion. This contrasts with the ODM, which assumes both global information access to the forager and its apparent ability to reach optimal choices. Despite relying only on limited past experience and hunger aversion, this behavioural rule not only accounts for nearly the same energy intake rate as predicted by the ODM but also can flexibly respond to changing environments by rapidly reaching new optimization. The RED behaviour also predicts a more realistic partial preference for diet choice, contrasting with the zero-one rule of OFT which allows for no partial preference within the forager's diet. The partial preference simply emerges from the RED strategy, as opposed to decision-making errors imposed from behavioural and physiological constraints. The RED rule further elucidates three potential traits that natural selection can act upon for optimizing foraging: (1) short-term memory of recent feeding experience, (2) ability to recognize encountered resources, and (3) basic neural set-up for alternative responses to environmental cues. This simple and flexible RED rule thus provides a behavioural mechanism for optimal foraging, and can be further applied to decision-making theory in psychology and economics. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={To understand the molecular and neural mechanisms underlying alcohol addiction, many models ranging from vertebrates to invertebrates have been developed. In Drosophila melanogaster, behavioral paradigms from assaying acute responses to alcohol and to behaviors more closely modeling addiction have emerged in recent years. However, both the CAFÉ assay, similar to a two-bottle choice consumption assay, as well as conditioned odor preference, where ethanol is used as the reinforcer, are labor intensive and have low throughput. To address this limitation, we have established a novel ethanol consumption preference assay, called FRAPPÉ, which allows for fast, high throughput measurement of consumption in individual flies, using a fluorescence plate reader. We show that naïve flies do not prefer to consume ethanol, but various pre-exposures, such as ethanol vapor or voluntary ethanol consumption, induce ethanol preference. This ethanol-primed preference is long lasting and is not driven by calories contained in ethanol during the consumption choice. Our novel experience-dependent model of ethanol preference in Drosophila - a highly genetically tractable organism - therefore recapitulates salient features of human alcohol abuse and will facilitate the molecular understanding of the development of alcohol preference. © 2013 Society for the Study of Addiction.},

abstract={The ability to generate behavioral plasticity according to ever-changing physiological demands and environmental conditions is a universal feature of decision-making circuits in all animals.

Information about the reproductive and nutritional status of the male is also incorporated in his choice of exploratory behavior. The study of mate searching in the C. elegans male, a genetic model organism with a nervous system of only 383 neurons, provides the opportunity to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms of state-dependent control of behavior and sensory integration.

abstract={Shelter-building behavior by caterpillars provides a mechanism of defense against predators, microenvironment enhancement, and in some cases nutritional benefits. This study provides a detailed description of the life cycle and shelter-building process of caterpillars, and identifies constraints and factors influencing this adaptive behavior in Lepidomys n. sp. near proclea Druce (Pyralidae: Chrysauginae), a tropical dry forest pyralid. Five macroscopic larval instars were detected during the life cycle, and activities performed during shelter-building were categorized and timed. Caterpillar predators were identified, and 20% of all collected larvae died due to attack by parasitoid wasps. Shelter-building behavior was found to be constrained by the ontogenetic stage of caterpillars and influenced by leaf size of the host plant, Piper stipulaceum Opiz (Piperales: Piperaceae). A similar pattern of shelter-building behavior exhibited by Tosale n. sp. near cuprealis larvae that coexisted in the same host plant is also described. Larvae of the second species were significantly less abundant than those of Lepidomys and hatched one month later in the rainy season, which could indicate some competitive interactions between these two pyralid species. © This is an open access paper.},

Progression of diabetes, including increases in blood glucose and declines in blood insulin, was observed earlier in male rats than in females, and diabetic grade was more critical in male rats. Blood lipids tended to increase in female rats. Gonadal dysfunction was observed in both male and female rats with aging. Microangiopathies, such as nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, and osteoporosis, were seen in both genders, and pathological grade and progression were more significant in males.

abstract={Prey species have to balance their foraging and vigilance behaviour in order to maximize nutritional and energetic intake while avoiding predation. Anthropogenic noise, a ubiquitous form of human disturbance, has the potential to influence antipredator behaviour through its effects on predator detection and perceived risk. Noise might increase perceived risk as predicted by the risk disturbance hypothesis, reduce risk by providing protection from disturbance-sensitive predators, or have no effect on antipredator behaviour if animals are tolerant of nonlethal forms of human disturbance. Road traffic is a pervasive source of anthropogenic noise, but few studies have experimentally isolated the effects of road noise on behaviour. Using systematic playback experiments, we investigated the influence of traffic noise on foraging and vigilance in a keystone species in North American prairie systems, the prairie dog, Cynomys ludovicianus. Exposure to road traffic noise significantly lowered aboveground activity, reduced foraging and increased vigilance, as predicted by the risk disturbance hypothesis. These effects were prevalent irrespective of temperature, a strong influence on such behaviours, and they were consistent across the 3-month study period, providing no evidence of habituation. Our results provide the first experimental investigation of the potential costs of this ubiquitous disturbance in a free-ranging mammal, demonstrating that road noise can alter key survival behaviours of this ecologically pivotal species. These findings highlight that the presence of animals in a location is no guarantee of population and ecological integrity, while also underlining the potential synergistic impacts of noise on a species that has already experienced severe declines across its historic range due to human disturbance. Globally, roadways have profound impacts on biodiversity, and quantifying the behavioural and fitness costs associated with different forms of disturbance such as noise is crucial for mitigation. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Survival depends on escape responses and when to flee a predator. As a result, factors affecting the escape performance of prey species, including parasite infection, may profoundly influence the outcome of predator-prey encounters. Several hypotheses predict the responses of prey to simulated predator attacks based on intrinsic characteristics such as individual reproductive value and flight costs: as predation risk and reproductive value increase, so should the distance at which an organism begins to flee an escaping predator (flight initiation distance; FID). Conversely, FID should decrease if the costs of fleeing are high. Despite providing testable hypotheses, rarely have these theories been used to predict the escape behaviour of parasitized individuals. The bridled monocle bream, Scolopsis bilineata, is parasitized by a large cymothoid isopod, Anilocra nemipteri, which attaches above the eye. In this species, ectoparasite infection is associated with increased energy costs and decreased endurance. We investigated the effects of infection on escape performance and FID. Maximum velocity, maximum acceleration, cumulative distance travelled and response latency did not differ between parasitized fish, unparasitized fish and fish that had their parasite experimentally removed. Parasitized fish were smaller, on average, than unparasitized individuals. Smaller, parasitized individuals allowed a threat to approach closer before fleeing (shorter FID) than larger parasitized or uninfected individuals. Since parasite infection has known effects on host growth and metabolism, we suggest that parasitism alters fish escape behaviour as predicted by two nonexclusive hypotheses: (1) by decreasing reproductive value (the asset protection hypothesis) and (2) by increasing the relative costs of fleeing (the economic hypothesis) compared with uninfected and large parasitized fish. The relative importance of each hypothesis in driving the trends observed remains to be tested. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Animal welfare enhancement requires that problems are reliably identified and ranked in order to prioritise corrective actions. Welfare problems vary with the conditions in which animals are maintained. The objectives were to highlight major welfare problems for dairy cows on farms in France, and find out how farm characteristics (housing and milking systems, breed) could impact specific welfare aspects on these farms. We conducted a cross-sectional survey on 131 French dairy farms. We used the Welfare Quality® protocol, which addresses all aspects of welfare, and yields scores for principles and criteria that represent how well farms meet welfare requirements (from 0 for a very adverse situation to 100 for an excellent one). We used descriptive statistics to highlight low welfare scores, and variance analyses to compare farms. Most farms were found 'Acceptable' according to the Welfare Quality® classification. Principles scores for Health, Feeding and Behaviour ranged from 33 to 39. The median score for eight of the welfare criteria was below 50 ('Pain', 'Integument alterations', 'Diseases', 'Comfort around resting', 'Social behaviours', 'Human-animal relationship', 'Positive emotional state', 'Hunger'), while the median score was above 50 for the four other criteria ('Thirst', 'Lameness', 'Expression of other behaviours', 'Ease of movement'). The scores varied widely between farms, within and between systems. Farms with cubicles obtained lower scores for 'Comfort around resting', 'Injuries'; farms with Holstein cows obtained lower scores for 'Hunger'; farms using an automatic milking system obtained lower scores for 'Expression of other behaviours' and 'Diseases' in Holstein herds. This survey yields information on bottlenecks in dairy cow welfare with all dimensions of welfare considered together. The results can be used by stakeholders to prioritise corrective actions in welfare plans, focusing either on the whole population of farms or on farms with characteristics that are at high risk for specific welfare problems. © 2014 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare},

abstract={Seventy-nine continental crossbred beef heifers (524.4 ± 41.68 kg BW), 16 of which were ruminally cannulated, were used in a 53-d experiment with a generalized randomized block design to assess the effects of barley grain (BG), corn silage (CS), and corn distillers' grain (DG) offered in a free-choice diet on feeding behavior and ruminal fermentation. Treatments were total mixed ration (TMR) consisting of 85% BG, 10% CS, and 5% supplement or free-choice (i.e., selfselection) diets of BG and CS (BGCS), BG and corn dry DG (BGDG), or CS and corn DG (CSDG). Heifers were housed in groups of 9 or 10 in 8 pens and weighed 2 h before feed delivery at d 0, 21, 42, and 52 of the study. Pens were equipped with an electronic feed bunk monitoring system enabling feed intake and feeding behavior to be continuously monitored. Each of these pens was randomly allocated 2 cannulated heifers equipped with indwelling pH probes for continuous measurement of ruminal pH during wk 1, 2, 4, and 7. Blood and rumen contents were taken from cannulated heifers 2 h after feed delivery on d -3, 0, 7, 8, 42, and 49. Cattle fed either TMR or freechoice diets had similar (P > 0.10) ruminal fermentation, blood profile, and growth performance, with the exception of the CSDG diet, for which ruminal pH levels were consistently greater (P < 0.01) and performance was lower (P < 0.01). When DG was a component in freechoice diets, heifers reduced its inclusion in the diet (P < 0.05) over the experiment without affecting growth rate or ruminal fluid pH. Finishing feedlot cattle fed BG and CS separately selected a diet with a greater proportion of BG (85% DMI) compared to the TMR with no signs of acidosis. When cattle were given free-choice access to corn dry DG as an alternative to CS, they consumed levels up to 30% of their total daily DMI. Under the conditions of our experiment cattle can effectively self-select diets without increasing the risk of subclinical acidosis and still maintain similar levels of growth and feed efficiency compared with a TMR. © 2014 American Society of Animal Science.

abstract={Many lines of evidence suggest that schizophrenia has a major developmental component and that environmental factors that disrupt key stages of development, such as maternal stress during pregnancy as a result of infection or malnutrition, can increase the risk of developing schizophrenia in later life. This review examines how non-clinical neurodevelopmental models pertinent to schizophrenia have been evaluated for their ability to reproduce behavioural deficits related to the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The more frequently used are the prenatal application of the mitotoxic agent methylazoxymethanol, prenatal immune challenge and the neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion model. In general they have been extensively evaluated in models considered relevant to positive symptoms of schizophrenia. In contrast, very few studies have examined tests related to negative symptoms and, when they have, it has almost exclusively been a social interaction model. Other aspects related to negative symptoms such as anhedonia, affective flattening and avolition have almost never been studied. Further studies examining other components of negative symptomatology are needed to more clearly associate these deficits with a schizophrenia-like profile as social withdrawal is a hallmark of many disorders. Although there are no truly effective treatments for negative symptoms, better characterisation with a broader range of drugs used in schizophrenia will be necessary to better evaluate the utility of these models. In summary, developmental models of schizophrenia have been extensively studied as models of positive symptoms but, given the unmet need in the clinic, the same effort now needs to be made with regard to negative symptoms. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.},

abstract={The ability to adjust behavioral responses to environmental cues probably contributes to an individual's ability to persist in unfamiliar habitats. One behavior, how an individual responds to novelty, influences the acquisition of resources (e.g., novel foods) and identification of stressors, but it may also increase exposure to risks. Here, using house sparrows (Passer domesticus) recently introduced to Kenya, we tested how range expansion influenced individuals' responses to novel foods and objects. We predicted that range edge birds would be less averse to novelty than birds at the site of introduction and that this effect would be more pronounced for novel foods than novel non-nutritional items. We also expected range edge individuals to be more sensitive to changes in the environment and therefore more apt to adjust their behavior in response to different cues; in other words, individuals at the range edge would have a more flexible behavioral repertoire than individuals at the site of introduction. As predicted, individuals at the range edge ate novel foods faster than those from established areas; however, latency to touch novel objects did not vary across the range. Individuals throughout the range were variable in their response to novelty, but there was no indication that individual flexibility was greater at the range edge. Although many novel items might be useful to introduced organisms, novel foods are likely more valuable, and therefore individuals should be most apt to risk the potential costs associated with novelty for a high nutritional payoff. © 2014 © The Author 2014.},

abstract={Sexual and parental conflicts can arise because males benefit by inducing elevated reproductive effort in their mates. For females, the costs of such manipulation are often manifested later in life, and may therefore covary with female life expectancy. Here, I outline a simple female life-history model where female life expectancy reflects extrinsic mortality rate, and elevated reproductive effort causes accelerated senescence. Using this model, I show that variation in extrinsic mortality rate can modulate the magnitude and sign of fitness effects that male manipulation has on females. This result has several interesting implications. First, it suggests that the fitness effects of sexual interactions can depend on ecological factors, such as predation, that influence life expectancy. Second, if mortality risk is condition-dependent but reproductive effort is not fully optimized in relation to individual condition, then sexual conflict intensity may increase with individual condition, selecting for condition-dependent reproductive strategies. Third, if males vary in manipulativeness, then the fitness effects of mating with a given male phenotype may depend on both female condition and extrinsic mortality rate. Fourth, life span extension in the laboratory can lead to overestimation of sexual and parental conflicts. Life expectancy may therefore be a key factor in sexual coevolution. © 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract={An organism's behavioral decisions often depend upon the relative strength of appetitive and aversive sensory stimuli, the relative sensitivity to which can be modified by internal states like hunger. However, whether sensitivity to such opposing influences is modulated in a unidirectional or bidirectional manner is not clear. Starved flies exhibit increased sugar and decreased bitter sensitivity. It is widely believed that only sugar sensitivity changes, and that this masks bitter sensitivity. Here we use gene- and circuit-level manipulations to show that sweet and bitter sensitivity are independently and reciprocally regulated by starvation in Drosophila. We identify orthogonal neuromodulatory cascades that oppositely control peripheral taste sensitivity for each modality. Moreover, these pathways are recruited at increasing hunger levels, such that low-risk changes (higher sugar sensitivity) precede high-risk changes (lower sensitivity to potentially toxic resources). In this way, state-intensity-dependent, reciprocal regulation of appetitive and aversive peripheral gustatory sensitivity permits flexible, adaptive feeding decisions. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Memory is a high-level brain function that enables organisms to adapt their behavioral responses to the environment, hence increasing their probability of survival. The Ras-ERK pathway is a key molecular intracellular signalling cascade for memory consolidation. In this chapter we will describe two main one-trial behavioral tests commonly used in the field of memory research in order to assess the role of Ras-ERK signalling in long-term memory: passive avoidance and object recognition. Passive avoidance (PA) is a fear-motivated instrumental learning task, designed by Jarvik and Essman in 1960, in which animals learn to refrain from emitting a behavioral response that has previously been associated with a punishment. We will describe here the detailed protocol and show some examples of how PA can reveal impairments or enhancements in memory consolidation following loss or gain of function genetic manipulations of the Ras-ERK pathway. The phenotypes of global mutants as Ras-GRF1 KO, GENA53, and ERK1 KO mice, as well as of conditional region-specific mutants (striatal K-CREB mice), will be illustrated as examples. Novel object recognition (NOR), developed by Ennaceur and Delacour in 1988, is instead a more recent and highly ecological test, which relies on the natural tendency of rodents to spontaneously approach and explore novel objects, representing hence a useful non-stressful tool for the study of memory in animals without the employment of punishments or starvation/water restriction regimens. Careful indications will be given on how to select the positions for the novel object, in order to counterbalance for individual side preferences among mice during the training. Finally, the methods for calculating two learning indexes will be described. In addition to the classical discrimination index (DI) that measures the ability of an animal to discriminate between two different objects which are presented at the same time, we will describe the formula of a new index that we present here for the first time, the recognition index (RI), which quantifies the ability of an animal to recognize a same object at different time points and that, by taking into account the basal individual preferences displayed during the training, can give a more accurate measure of an animal's actual recognition memory. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly but effective therapeutic strategies to treat AD are not yet available. This is also due to the fact that the pathological mechanisms that drive the pathogenesis of sporadic AD are still not sufficiently understood and may differ on the individual level. Several risk factors such as altered insulin-like peptide (ILP) signaling have been linked to AD and modulating the ILP system has been discussed as a potential therapeutic avenue. Here we show that insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7), a protein that attenuates the function of ILPs, is up-regulated in the brains of AD patients and in a mouse model for AD via a process that involves altered DNA-methylation and coincides with decreased ILP signaling. Mimicking the AD-situation in wild type mice, by increasing hippocampal IGFBP7 levels leads to impaired memory consolidation. Consistently, inhibiting IGFBP7 function in mice that develop AD-like memory impairment reinstates associative learning behavior. These data suggest that IGFBP7 is a critical regulator of memory consolidation and might be used as a biomarker for AD. Targeting IGFBP7 could be a novel therapeutic avenue for the treatment of AD patients. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The effect of sexual selection on nonsexual fitness is a major unanswered question in evolutionary biology that may have important implications for adaptation, diversification and the evolution of mate preferences. If reproductive success is condition dependent, the resulting sexual selection will tend to align with natural selection, promoting adaptation. One prediction under such a scenario is that adaptation to a novel environment should increase male mating success and hence sexual fitness. Environmentally induced plasticity in mate preferences could also contribute to an alignment of natural and sexual selection if the changes cause females to prefer locally adapted males as mates. We tested for both forms of alignment using a set of 10 independent populations of Drosophila melanogaster that were adapted to one of two environments. Competitive mating trials were performed between pairs of populations adapted to these two environments, with the trials designed to separate the effects of local adaptation on male mating success from plasticity of female mate preferences in response to these environments. Contrary to expectations under an alignment of natural and sexual selection, males did not have higher mating success when competing in the environment to which they were adapted. Furthermore, there was no evidence that females altered their mate choice based on their rearing environment, indicating the absence of any adaptive plasticity in mate preferences. Overall, despite previous evidence of reciprocal adaptation to these different environments, increased nonsexual fitness did not translate into higher mating success, indicating a lack of any alignment with natural selection of this component of male sexual fitness. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Objective: This study evaluated the contribution of total parenteral nutrition (PN) to compromised neurodevelopment after preterm birth.

Neurodevelopment was assessed by observations of motor activity and evaluation of sensory/motor reflexes, brain weight, MRI, and cerebellar histology. Results: Despite similar gains in body weight, PN pigs had smaller brains (32 ± 0.4 vs. 35 ± 0.6 g; P 5 0.0002) including the cerebellum, as well as reduced motor activity (P = 0.005), which corresponded to underdeveloped myelination (P = 0.004) measured by diffusion tensor imaging. PN resulted in lower serum triglycerides (17 ± 5.9 vs. 27 ± 3.1 mg/dL; P = 0.05), total cholesterol (3169.6 vs. 8568.1mg/dL; P = 0.04), VLDL cholesterol (3.761.2 vs. 5.760.7mg/dL; P = 0.04), andHDL cholesterol (16 ± 4.6 vs. 57 ± 7.3 mg/dL; P = 0.03) and nonsignificantly lower LDL cholesterol (10.7 ± 4.4 vs. 22.7 ± 2.9 mg/dL; P = 0.09). Conclusions: The compromised neurodevelopment caused by total PN is a novel finding, was independent of confounding variables (disease, inconsistent gestational ages, diverse genetics, extrauterine growth retardation, and inconsistent neonatal intensive care unit protocols), and highlights a need to improve current PN solutions. The preterm pig is a translational animal model for improving nutrition support to enhance neurodevelopment of preterminfants requiring PN. © 2014 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={One of the most remarkable traits of highly encephalized animals is their ability to manipulate knowledge flexibly to infer logical relationships. Operationally, the corresponding cognitive process can be defined as reasoning. One hypothesis is that this process relies on the reverberating activity of glutamate neural circuits, sustained by NMDA receptor (NMDAr) mediated synaptic transmission, in both parietal and prefrontal areas. We trained two macaque monkeys to perform a form of deductive reasoning - the transitive inference task - in which they were required to learn the relationship between six adjacent items in a single session and then deduct the relationship between nonadjacent items that had not been paired in the learning phase. When the animals had learned the sequence, we administered systemically a subanaesthetic dose of ketamine (a NMDAr antagonist) and measured their performance on learned and novel problems. We observed impairments in determining the relationship between novel pairs of items. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that transitive inference premises are integrated during learning in a unified representation and that reducing NMDAr activity interferes with the use of this mental model, when decisions are required in comparing pairs of items that have not been learned. © The Author(s) 2014.},

abstract={Transgenic plants expressing Bacillus thuringiensis proteins can indirectly affect natural enemies of target insects, and the assessment of these effects is essential in risk analysis of genetically modified plants. The biology of Podisus nigrispinus (Dallas) (Hemiptera Pentatomidae) and changes in the predation behaviour of this insect when fed with Bt (Cry1Ab) maize-fed Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) larvae (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) was evaluated. The predator showed 43.7% delay in the nymphal development time and 15% biomass reduction in the fifth instar, probably due to low nutritional quality of prey exposed to Bt maize. Survival curves were similar in predators fed with S. frugiperda larvae exposed and not exposed to Bt maize. The predator search time was slightly influenced by the developmental delay of S. frugiperda fed with Bt maize. In a greenhouse assay P. nigrispinus was important in controlling S. frugiperda density in Bt maize expressing the Cry1Ab protein. Our laboratory results indicate that Bt maize may cause indirect effects on P. nigrispinus, and suggest that nutritional prey-quality factors other than the Bt protein determine the observed negative effects. However, the semi-field greenhouse assays demonstrate that indirect negative effects of Bt maize on the predator’s performance and search behaviour is not substantiated, and that plant damage is lowest if Bt maize is used concurrently with biological control by P. nigrispinus for managing S. frugiperda. © 2014(Publisher Name).

abstract={We evaluated puma (Puma concolor) feeding patterns in southeastern Brazilian agricultural landscapes using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses of hair collected from fecal samples (N = 64). We classified the samples into three groups: feeding patterns based on forest remnants, on the agricultural matrix or both. We observed a predominance of consumption of C3 prey (~47% of individuals) in the area with the highest proportion of forest coverage. Conversely, C4 prey were highly consumed (~40% of individuals) where the agricultural matrix was predominant. The δ13C values for pumas in both areas indicated that their food resources come from both forest remnants and the agricultural matrix and that some individuals preferentially consumed C4 prey, indicating that food resources from the agricultural matrix make up most of their diet (~46% of prey individuals). The wide range of puma's δ15N values in both areas indicated a diet based on different types of prey. However, the C4 group had higher values, indicating that both pumas and their prey feed on enriched resources from the agricultural matrix. The results confirm the high behavioral plasticity of pumas in using highly anthropogenic habitats. The stable isotope analyses conducted in this study yielded new information on large carnivore trophic ecology that might be useful in the development of new conservation strategies in disturbed areas. © 2014 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

abstract={Repeated pairings of a particular visual context with a specific location of a target stimulus facilitate target search in humans. We explored an animal model of this contextual cueing effect using a novel Cueing-Miscueing design. Pigeons had to peck a target which could appear in one of four possible locations on four possible color backgrounds or four possible color photographs of real-world scenes. On 80% of the trials, each of the contexts was uniquely paired with one of the target locations; on the other 20% of the trials, each of the contexts was randomly paired with the remaining target locations. Pigeons came to exhibit robust contextual cueing when the context preceded the target by 2. s, with reaction times to the target being shorter on correctly-cued trials than on incorrectly-cued trials. Contextual cueing proved to be more robust with photographic backgrounds than with uniformly colored backgrounds. In addition, during the context-target delay, pigeons predominately pecked toward the location of the upcoming target, suggesting that attentional guidance contributes to contextual cueing. These findings confirm the effectiveness of animal models of contextual cueing and underscore the important part played by associative learning in producing the effect.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: SQAB 2013: Contextual Con. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objectives Short sleep confers a higher risk of obesity in humans. Restricted sleep increases appetite, promotes higher calorie intake from fat and carbohydrate sources, and induces insulin resistance. However, the effects of fragmented sleep (SF), such as occurs in sleep apnea, on body weight, metabolic rates, and adipose tissue distribution are unknown. Methods C57BL/6 mice were exposed to SF for 8 weeks. Their body weight, food consumption, and metabolic expenditure were monitored over time, and their plasma leptin levels measured after exposure to SF for 1 day as well as for 2 weeks. In addition, adipose tissue distribution was assessed at the end of the SF exposure using MRI techniques. Results Chronic SF-induced obesogenic behaviors and increased weight gain in mice by promoting increased caloric intake without changing caloric expenditure. Plasma leptin levels initially decreased and subsequently increased. Furthermore, increases in both visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue volumes occurred. Conclusions These results suggest that SF, a frequent occurrence in many disorders and more specifically in sleep apnea, is a potent inducer of obesity via activation of obesogenic behaviors and possibly leptin resistance, in the absence of global changes in energy expenditure. © 2013 The Obesity Society.},

abstract={Introduction: The rosy wolfsnail (Euglandina rosea), a predatory land snail, finds prey snails and potential mates by following their mucus trails. Euglandina have evolved unique, mobile lip extensions that detect mucus and aid in following trails. Currently, little is known of the neural substrates of the trail-following behavior. Methods: To investigate the neural correlates of trail following we used tract-tracing experiments in which nerves were backfilled with either nickel-lysine or Lucifer yellow, extracellular recording of spiking neurons in snail procerebra using a multielectrode array, and behavioral assays of trail following and movement toward the source of a conditioned odor. Results: The tract-tracing experiments demonstrate that in Euglandina, the nerves carrying mucus signals innervate the same region of the central ganglia as the olfactory nerves, while the electrophysiology studies show that mucus stimulation of the sensory epithelium on the lip extensions alters the frequency and pattern of neural activity in the procerebrum in a manner similar to odor stimulation of the olfactory epithelium on the optic tentacles of another land snail species, Cantareus aspersa (previously known as Helix aspersa). While Euglandina learn to follow trails of novel chemicals that they contact with their lip extensions in one to three trials, these snails proved remarkably resistant to associative learning in the olfactory modality. Even after seven to nine pairings of odorant molecules with food, they showed no orientation toward the conditioned odor. This is in marked contrast to Cantareus snails, which reliably oriented toward conditioned odors after two to three trials. Conclusions: The apparent inability of Euglandina to learn to associate food with odors and use odor cues to drive behavior suggests that the capability for sophisticated neural processing of nonvolatile mucus cues detected by the lip extensions has evolved at the expense of processing of odorant molecules detected by the olfactory system. Euglandina rosea, the rosy wolfsnail, is a carnivorous land snail native to the Southeastern U.S. Wolfsnails feed on other snails and slugs, which they track down by following slime trails using a sophisticated chemosensory system that is separate from olfactory sensing. In this article we present neuroanatomical and physiological data suggesting that slime chemosensation in the wolfsnail is carried out by the same central neuronal structures as olfactory processing. We also present behavioral data suggesting that in a simple nervous system like the one in snails, evolving highly sophisticated processing for a new sensory modality (in wolfsnails, mucus chemosensation) required giving up processing capability in the olfactory modality. © 2013 The Authors.},

abstract={Plant-manipulating herbivores can modify their host nutrients and defensive compounds to their own advantage. This generally results in enhanced performance of herbivores on modified tissues, but the anatomical and biochemical modifications undergone by host tissues could also modify the herbivores' behaviour. Phloeomyzus passerinii induces a reaction tissue in the bark of its susceptible poplar hosts, suggesting a host-plant manipulation by the aphid. We investigated whether the formation of this reaction tissue, confirmed by histological sections, affected the performance and feeding behaviour of the aphid. In addition we studied how host resistance affected these parameters by comparing two host genotypes of different susceptibility. Aphids developed faster on the preinfested susceptible host genotype, whereas no effect was detected on the resistant one, confirming an improvement in the host's nutritional value due to the preinfestation, in agreement with the nutrition hypothesis. The DC-EPG technique indicated that in both host genotypes, preinfestation shortened the delay until the first probe and increased both the rate and duration of sustained ingestion, and consequently host acceptance. This suggests that host manipulation can adjust not only the nutritional value of plant tissues at an optimal level for development but also host acceptance by the herbivores. In the resistant host genotype though, the number of probes and the duration of parenchyma exploration increased in the galled tissue, which was congruent with extensive cell wall modifications indicated by more extended induced lignification. The adaptive consequences of this modified feeding behaviour are discussed. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Summary: State-dependent models (SDMs) of behaviour, based on dynamic fitness-maximizing optimality routines, offer a powerful approach to understanding the plasticity and complexity in the timing of behaviour of foraging animals; yet, they are rarely developed for individual species. Such models permit evaluation of the sensitivity of predicted behavioural patterns to parameters that describe the main elements of environmental risk and the dynamics of internal states, such as energy stores, that determine motivational state. Here, we develop a state-dependent dynamic model for the temporal organization of foraging in a cyclic environment, using the intertidal grazing limpet Cellana grata as a test species. Estimates of relevant parameter values were obtained wherever possible and a sensitivity analysis performed to estimate the relative importance of these parameters. The results demonstrated the value of constructing an optimality model of the combined effects of gut processing and food supply, alongside the costs and risks of foraging. The dynamic model was able to satisfactorily reproduce the foraging behaviour of the limpet and highlighted several emergent details of behaviour that were not immediately apparent or predicted using a more simple, static model. Ranking the importance of the different parameters in the foraging behaviour of the limpet helped to identify research priorities for further studies on these grazers. Among the investigated parameters, standing crop and gut volume appeared to be of greatest importance, while energy costs and ingestion rates were of relatively lower importance. Risks of mortality during the different phases also played a fundamental role, dictating the main temporal limits within which activity occurred. Even with the great number of parameters required with respect to simpler static models, the benefits of following such a dynamic approach were evident and outweighed the additional effort needed for their estimation, supporting the use of dynamic modelling approaches in future research into the behaviour of mobile consumers. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

In the present study we investigated the somatic and sensory-motor development of the offspring from rat dams fed a HFD, compared with dams fed a control diet, during pregnancy or lactation. Indicators of the body growth, physical maturation, and reflex ontogeny were evaluated. Offspring of dams fed a HFD showed reduced weight and body growth, delayed physical maturation, and delayed maturation of the physiological reflexes, such as vibrissa placing, auditory startle response, and free-fall righting. Our findings suggest that maternal HFD during pregnancy or lactation modifies somatic and neurological development of the offspring, possibly increasing the risk of neuroendocrine and neuropsychiatric disorders later in life.},

abstract={Wormlion larvae (Diptera: Vermileonidae) construct conical pits in fine loose soils and ambush arthropod prey. Their hunting strategy resembles that of pit-building antlions (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae), offering a classical example of convergent evolution, as they belong to different orders of insects. However, compared with other trap-building predators, spiders and antlions, the foraging behaviour of wormlions is almost unknown. In this study we used a combination of field observations and laboratory experiments to close this gap and investigate how hunger and ecological factors such as density and spatial pattern affect pit size, that is, how they shape investment in foraging and indicate competition between neighbouring larvae. We found slight, mainly decreasing, changes in pit size with hunger, with no change in response to prey. Surprisingly, body mass and length were not tightly correlated with pit size, unlike in antlions and spiders. Other factors, in addition to body mass and size, affect pit size, as the correlation between pits constructed in the field and in the laboratory was strong. The evidence for competition was mixed. On the one hand, we detected, in the laboratory, a change towards a regular spatial pattern with increasing pit densities, as expected, suggesting interference competition. On the other hand, we detected, in the field, a positive correlation between the sizes of neighbouring pits, and a negative correlation in the laboratory between pit size and distance to the nearest neighbour, both indicating clustering in favourable microhabitats, and not supporting strong competition. We discuss our findings in comparison with other trap-building predators and locate them within the general framework of foraging theory. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) gene mutations are involved in the leptin-melanocortin pathways that control food intake. The effect of these mutations on eating behavior phenotypes is still debated. To determine the association between functional MC4R mutations and eating behaviors, dietary intake and physical activity, we sequenced the MC4R gene in 4653 obese adults. Among them, 19 adults carriers of functional MC4R mutation were matched on age, sex and body mass index with two randomly-paired controls without MC4R mutation (n=57). We found that eating behaviors and physical activity did not differ between groups. In particular, cases were not at increased risk of binge eating disorders. Subjects carriers of MC4R mutation reported a higher proportion of dietary carbohydrates intakes (43.2±7.1 and 39.2±8.1% of total energy intake, respectively, P=0.048) and a lower proportion of dietary lipids (34.3±6.7 and 38.5±6.7% of total energy intake, respectively, P=0.018). In conclusion, mutation carriers differ from controls by a higher consumption of carbohydrates counterbalanced by a lower consumption of lipids expressed as percentage of total energy intake. However, functional MC4R mutations do not have a higher risk of compulsive eating contrary to what was previously suggested. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract={Strain comparison studies have been critical to the identification of novel genetic and molecular mechanisms in learning and memory. However, even within a single learning paradigm, the behavioral data for the same strain can vary greatly, making it difficult to form meaningful conclusions at both the behavioral and cellular level. In fear conditioning, there is a high level of variability across reports, especially regarding responses to the conditioned stimulus (CS). Here, we compare C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice using delay fear conditioning, trace fear conditioning, and a nonassociative condition. Our data highlight both the significant strain differences apparent in these fear conditioning paradigms and the significant differences in conditioning type within each strain. We then compare our data to an extensive literature review of delay and trace fear conditioning in these two strains. Finally, we apply a number of commonly used baseline normalization approaches to compare how they alter the reported differences. Our findings highlight three major sources of variability in the fear conditioning literature: CS duration, number of CS presentations, and data normalization to baseline measures. © 2014 Tipps et al.},

abstract={Understanding the causes of animal personality (i.e. consistent behavioural differences) is a major aim of evolutionary studies. Recent theoretical work suggests that major personality traits may contribute to evolutionary trade-offs. However, such associations have only been investigated in a few study systems, and even less so in free ranging animal populations. Eastern chipmunks exhibit consistent individual differences in exploration, ranging from slow to fast. Birth cohorts also experience dramatic differences in age at first breeding opportunity due to annual differences in beech mast. Individuals may breed for the first time at 24, 33 or 50% of their average life span, depending on year of birth. Here, we used data from a long-term survey on a wild population to investigate the relationship between reproductive life history and consistent individual differences in exploration. We determined whether predictable differences in age at first breeding opportunity among birth cohorts were associated with exploration differences and favoured individuals with different exploration. Birth cohorts with a predictably earlier age at first breeding opportunity were faster explorers on average. Slower explorers displayed their highest fecundity (females) or highest fertilization success (males) later in their life compared with faster explorers. Overall, slow explorers attained a higher lifetime reproductive success than fast explorers when given an opportunity to reproduce later in their life. Our results suggest that the timing of mating seasons, associated with fluctuating food abundance, may favour individual variation in exploration and maintain population variation through its effects on reproductive life history. Together, our result shed light on how fluctuation in ecological conditions may maintain personality differences and on the nature of the relationships between animal personality and life history. © 2014 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Tail biting is a serious animal welfare and economic problem in pig production. Tail docking, which reduces but does not eliminate tail biting, remains widespread. However, in the EU tail docking may not be used routinely, and some 'alternative' forms of pig production and certain countries do not allow tail docking at all. Against this background, using a novel approach focusing on research where tail injuries were quantified, we review the measures that can be used to control tail biting in pigs without tail docking. Using this strict criterion, there was good evidence that manipulable substrates and feeder space affect damaging tail biting. Only epidemiological evidence was available for effects of temperature and season, and the effect of stocking density was unclear. Studies suggest that group size has little effect, and the effects of nutrition, disease and breed require further investigation. The review identifies a number of knowledge gaps and promising avenues for future research into prevention and mitigation. We illustrate the diversity of hypotheses concerning how different proposed risk factors might increase tail biting through their effect on each other or on the proposed underlying processes of tail biting. A quantitative comparison of the efficacy of different methods of provision of manipulable materials, and a review of current practices in countries and assurance schemes where tail docking is banned, both suggest that daily provision of small quantities of destructible, manipulable natural materials can be of considerable benefit. Further comparative research is needed into materials, such as ropes, which are compatible with slatted floors. Also, materials which double as fuel for anaerobic digesters could be utilised. As well as optimising housing and management to reduce risk, it is important to detect and treat tail biting as soon as it occurs. Early warning signs before the first bloody tails appear, such as pigs holding their tails tucked under, could in future be automatically detected using precision livestock farming methods enabling earlier reaction and prevention of tail damage. However, there is a lack of scientific studies on how best to respond to outbreaks: the effectiveness of, for example, removing biters and/or bitten pigs, increasing enrichment, or applying substances to tails should be investigated. Finally, some breeding companies are exploring options for reducing the genetic propensity to tail bite. If these various approaches to reduce tail biting are implemented we propose that the need for tail docking will be reduced. © 2014 The Animal Consortium.},

abstract={Background Swallowing problems following stroke may result in increased risk of aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, and dehydration. Objective/hypothesis Our hypothesis was that three neurostimulation techniques would produce beneficial effects on chronic dysphagia following stroke through a common brain mechanism that would predict behavioral response. Methods In 18 dysphagic stroke patients (mean age: 66 ± 3 years, 3 female, time-post-stroke: 63 ± 15 weeks [±SD]), pharyngeal electromyographic responses were recorded after single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the pharyngeal motor cortex, to measure corticobulbar excitability before, immediately, and 30 min, after real and sham applications of neurostimulation. Patients were randomized to a single session of either: pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES), paired associative stimulation (PAS) or repetitive TMS (rTMS). Penetration-aspiration scores and bolus transfer timings were assessed before and after both real and sham interventions using videofluoroscopy. Results Corticobulbar excitability of pharyngeal motor cortex was beneficially modulated by PES, PAS and to a lesser extent by rTMS, with functionally relevant changes in the unaffected hemisphere. Following combining the results of real neurostimulation, an overall increase in corticobulbar excitability in the unaffected hemisphere (P =.005, F 1,17 = 10.6, ANOVA) with an associated 15% reduction in aspiration (P =.005, z = -2.79) was observed compared to sham. Conclusions In this mechanistic study, an increase in corticobulbar excitability the unaffected projection was correlated with the improvement in swallowing safety (P =.001, rho = -.732), but modality-specific differences were observed. Paradigms providing peripheral input favored change in neurophysiological and behavioral outcome measures in chronic dysphagia patients. Further larger cohort studies of neurostimulation in chronic dysphagic stroke are imperative. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Objective: People who decide to lose weight by dieting often do so without participating in any associated physical activity. Although some people who participate in sports are unconcerned about their diet, it is generally believed that people who exercise tend to eat a healthy diet and those who do not exercise eat a less healthy diet. There is no clear relationship between the decisions regarding participation in physical activity and eating a healthy diet when choices are taken freely and not influenced by policy factors promoting healthy behaviour. However, these decisions may reveal some common explanatory factors and an implicit link. As such the aim of this study was to identify the common explanatory factors and investigate the existence of an implicit relationship. Study design: Econometric estimate - bivariate probit estimation. Method: Using data from the Portuguese National Health Survey, a bivariate probit was undertaken for decisions regarding participation in physical activity and eating a healthy diet. The correlation between the residuals gives information on the implicit relationship between the healthy choices. Results: Common explanatory factors were found between the decisions to eat healthy snacks and participate in physical activity, such as being married. However, holding voluntary private health insurance, smoking, getting older, living alone and unemployment were found to dissuade people from making healthy choices. Positive correlation was found between the residuals of the probit estimations, indicating that other unmeasurable variables have a similar influence on both decisions, such as peer pressure, cultural values, fashion, advertising and risk aversion. Conclusions: Further research is needed to improve understanding of decision making related to participation in physical activity and eating a healthy diet. This will facilitate the design of policies that will make a greater contribution to healthy lifestyles. © 2014 The Royal Society for Public Health.},

abstract={Animals must overcome the physical properties protecting foods to obtain nutrition. While animals can experience selection for traits that facilitate resource exploitation, specific feeding behaviors may entail multiple, different mechanical challenges with each potentially eliciting distinct selection pressures. Tree gouging by common marmosets (Primates: Callithrix jacchus) provides an illustrative case for studying these distinct mechanical challenges and their correlated behaviors and morphologies. We test the hypothesis that marmosets respond differently to three sequential mechanical stages of bark removal: (1) indentation; (2) crack initiation; (3) crack propagation. By surveying trees gouged by free-ranging marmosets in Pernambuco, Brazil, we found that mechanical variables related to crack initiation (fracture toughness, critical strain energy release rate and elastic modulus) were inversely correlated with measures of gouging intensity, with less mechanically challenging trees being gouged more intensely. Because crack initiation is likely the most mechanically challenging aspect of tree gouging, behavioral preference for less challenging resources likely allows marmosets to reduce costs and potential risks associated with accessing exudates. Variables related to bark indentation (hardness and friction) showed no relationship to the intensity of gouging behavior. Contrary to our prediction, trees with greater mechanical challenges for crack propagation (work to peel) were gouged more intensely. We attribute this pattern of gouging trees requiring greater effort in crack propagation to an inverse correlation between work to peel and fracture toughness in our tree sample. Importantly, marmosets exhibit morphological specializations of the feeding apparatus that facilitate indentation and crack propagation, potentially mitigating the need for behavioral choice. Here we show that extracting a single food resource can exert a series of distinct, potentially competing, selective forces during resource acquisition. This study illustrates how animals combine behaviors and morphological specializations to competently overcome distinct mechanical challenges, emphasizing the need for holistic approaches in understanding feeding adaptations. © 2014 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract={Accumulating evidence points to cortical oscillations as a mechanism for mediating interactions among functionally specialized neurons in distributed brain circuits. A brain function that may use such interactions is declarative memory-that is, memory that can be consciously recalled, such as episodes and facts. Declarative memory is enabled by circuits in the entorhinal cortex that interface the hippocampus with the neocortex. During encoding and retrieval of declarative memories, entorhinal and hippocampal circuits are thought to interact via theta and gamma oscillations, which in awake rodents predominate frequency spectra in both regions. In favour of this idea, theta-gamma coupling has been observed between entorhinal cortex and hippocampus under steady-state conditions in well-trained rats; however, the relationship between interregional coupling and memory formation remains poorly understood. Here we show, by multisite recording at successive stages of associative learning, that the coherence of firing patterns in directly connected entorhinal-hippocampus circuits evolves as rats learn to use an odour cue to guide navigational behaviour, and that such coherence is invariably linked to the development of ensemble representations for unique trial outcomes in each area. Entorhinal-hippocampal coupling was observed specifically in the 20-40-hertz frequency band and specifically between the distal part of hippocampal area CA1 and the lateral part of entorhinal cortex, the subfields that receive the predominant olfactory input to the hippocampal region. Collectively, the results identify 20-40-hertz oscillations as a mechanism for synchronizing evolving representations in dispersed neural circuits during encoding and retrieval of olfactory-spatial associative memory. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract={The eastern lubber grasshopper, Romalea microptera (Palisot de Beauvois) (Orthoptera: Romaleidae)[also known as R. guttata (Houttuyn)], is known to be polyphagous, but little else is known about its diet. Choice and no-choice tests were conducted to determine plant preference. In choice tests, 104 different plants were presented and relative preference was determined using 'Romaine' lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. longifolia; Asteraceae) as a standard. These included representative plants from several categories, including ornamental plants, weeds, shrubs, trees, vines, aquatic or semiaquatic plants, and vegetable crops. The grasshoppers did not display a statistically significant difference in selection, relative to 'Romaine' lettuce, for 20% of the plants evaluated; these should be considered very susceptible to injury because lettuce is a readily accepted plant. A few plants (3%) were more preferred than lettuce, and of course would also be at high risk for consumption. The majority of plants tested (77%) were significantly less preferred, but even some of these are at risk because, like other polyphagous insects, lubbers sometimes will feed on less acceptable plants when preferred plants are not available. A subset of these (n = 25) was also presented in no-choice tests, and the choice and no-choice responses compared. Plant preference in choice and no-choice tests was significantly correlated. A selection of ornamental plants (n = 10) that scored least-preferred in choice tests was assessed in no-choice 'starvation' tests, and 9 of the 10 proved to be quite resistant to grasshopper feeding. Several plants (n = 5) that produce foliage asynchronously were assessed in choice tests, with the grasshoppers preferring young foliage relative to old foliage. In field cage studies, the acceptability of plants significantly affected the efficacy of insecticide-containing baits, with significantly higher mortality found in cages containing non-preferred plants. Thus, host plant selection affects damage directly by regulating the amount of feeding, and indirectly by influencing acceptance of bait.},

abstract={To study the acute and sub-chronic toxicity associated with potential Zincovit tablets with grape seed extract among rats and mice. For acute toxicity in adult female Sprague-Dawley rats and Balb-c mice, the Acute Toxicity Class method (OECD 423 guideline) was employed.

Sub chronic toxicity was investigated in normal control (2% gum acacia, 1 ml/kg) and Zincovit tablets with grape seed extract at 50, 500 and 1250 mg/kg/day individually for 3 months in adult Sprague-Dawley female rats (4 groups, n= 6). Clinical signs, hematological and biochemical parameters were assessed. During the acute toxicity study, there were no behavioral changes or mortality observed even at 2000 mg/kg of Zincovit tablet with grape seed extract among rats and mice. There was no significant change in their body weight. LD50 cut-offfor mice and rat was found to be above 5000 mg/kg and the drug came under the category 5 according to Globally Harmonized Classification System (OECD 423 guidelines).

abstract={Background and objective: High calcium concentrations are an established risk factor for pancreatitis. We have investigated whether increasing magnesium concentrations affect pathological calcium signals and premature protease activation in pancreatic acini, and whether dietary or intraperitoneal magnesium administration affects the onset and course of experimental pancreatitis. Methods: Pancreatic acini were incubated with up to 10 mM magnesium; [Ca 2+]i (fura-2AM) and intracellular protease activation (fluorogenic substrates) were determined over 60 min. Wistar rats received chow either supplemented or depleted for magnesium (&lt;300 ppm to 30 000 ppm) over two weeks before pancreatitis induction (intravenous caerulein 10 mg/kg/h/4 h); controls received 1 mg/kg/h caerulein or saline. C57BL6/J mice received four intraperitoneal doses of magnesium (NaCl, Mg2+ 55 192 or 384 mg/kg bodyweight) over 72 h, then pancreatitis was induced by up to eight hourly supramaximal caerulein applications. Pancreatic enzyme activities, protease activation, morphological changes and the immune response were investigated. Results: Increasing extracellular Mg2+ concentration significantly reduced [Ca2+]i peaks and frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations as well as intracellular trypsin and elastase activity. Magnesium administration reduced pancreatic enzyme activities, oedema, tissue necrosis and inflammation and somewhat increased Foxp3-positiv T-cells during experimental pancreatitis. Protease activation was found in animals fed magnesium-deficient chow-even with low caerulein concentrations that normally cause no damage. Conclusions: Magnesium supplementation significantly reduces premature protease activation and the severity of pancreatitis, and antagonises pathological [Ca2+]i signals. Nutritional magnesium deficiency increases the susceptibility of the pancreas towards pathological stimuli. These data have prompted two clinical trials on the use of magnesium in patients at risk for pancreatitis.},

abstract={The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of diphenyl diselenide (PhSe)2 supplemented diet (10ppm) associated to the administration of caffeine (15mg/kg; i.g.) for 30days on the novel object recognition memory in middle-aged rats. The present findings showed that (PhSe)2-supplemented diet enhanced short-term memory, but not long-term memory, of middle-aged rats in the novel object recognition task. The (PhSe)2 supplemented diet associated with caffeine administration improved long-term memory, but did not alter short-term memory, impaired in middle-aged rats. Daily caffeine administration to middle-aged rats had no effect on the memory tasks. Diet supplemented with (PhSe)2 plus caffeine administration increased the number of crossings and rearings reduced in middle-aged rats. Caffeine administration plus (PhSe)2 diets were effective in increasing the number of rearings and crossings, respectively, in middle-aged rats, [3H] glutamate uptake was reduced in hippocampal slices of rats from (PhSe)2 and caffeine plus (PhSe)2 groups. In addition, animals supplemented with (PhSe)2 showed an increase in the pCREB/CREB ratio whereas pAkt/Akt ratio was not modified. These results suggest that the effects of (PhSe)2 on the short-term memory may be related to its ability to decrease the uptake of glutamate, influencing the increase of CREB phosphorylation. (PhSe)2-supplemented diet associated to the administration of caffeine improved long-term memory impaired in middle-aged rats, an effect independent of CREB and Akt phosphorylation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={As the largest container and resource of metals, sediment has a special role in the fate of metals. Factors influencing bioavailability of heavy metals in sediment have never been comprehensively considered and the sediment properties still fail to understand and even controversial. In this review, the mechanisms of sediment properties such as acid-volatile sulfides (AVS), organic matter, texture (clay, silt or sand) and geology, organism behaviors as well as those influencing the bioavailability of metals were analyzed. Under anoxic condition, AVS mainly reduce the solubility and toxicity of metals, while organic matters, Fe. -Mn oxides, clay or silt can stabilize heavy metals in elevated oxidative-reductive potential (ORP). Other factors including the variation of pH, redox potential, aging as well as nutrition and the behavior of benthic organism in sediment also largely alter metals mobility and distribution. These factors are often inter-related, and various toxicity assessment methods used to evaluate the bioavailability of trace metals have been also discussed. Additionally, we expect that some novel synthetic materials like polysulfides, nano-materials, provide the substantial amendments for metals pollution in sediment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={AC bolometer theory is built on the established matrix formalism for quantum calorimeters and bolometers. The bolometer is represented by a 3 × 3 matrix with complex valued parameters. The bolometer matrix is used to model the behavior of the devices including the response to signal and noise, feedback, pulse response times, stability, and bolometer impedance. The effects of a current dependent bolometer impedance are included. The matrix simplifies theoretical computations of AC devices, including demodulation and the interactions between signals at different frequencies. This theory is applied to measurements of bolometers, each consisting of a kinetic inductance device suspended on a silicon nitride membrane.

abstract={Purpose: We aimed to examine if past and more recent body mass index (BMI) changes are associated with eating behavior (EB) traits and whether these associations are due to non-genetic factors. Materials and Methods: In 1321 Korean twins and family members, recent and past BMI change groups were defined using quartiles of BMI change between first and second visits over 2.4±0.9 years and BMI change between 20 years old and second visit, respectively. We applied linear mixed analysis for relationships of past or recent BMI change groups and each EB (restrained, external, and emotional EB using the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire) assessed at second visit after adjusting for household effect and covariates (age, gender, education, medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, alcohol use, physical activity, smoking habit, and calorie intake). In monozygotic twin pairs, paired t-test for within-pair comparison and conditional logistic regression analysis were conducted regarding EB. Results: Greater past BMI change was associated with higher restrained eating scores (P for trend=0.031), whereas greater recent BMI change was associated with higher external eating scores (P for trend=0.046). In co-twin-control analysis, twins with greater past BMI change were more likely to have higher restrained eating scores as compared with their co-twins with lower past BMI change (odds ratio 1.80; 95% confidence interval 1.13-2.87), whereas there were no associations between recent BMI change and external eating scores. Conclusion: Greater BMI change since 20 years old is associated with higher dietary restraint, and non-genetic factors explain this relationship. © Yonsei University College of Medicine 2014.},

abstract={Within the CALICE collaboration† several concepts for the hadronic calorimeter of a future linear collider detector are studied. After having demonstrated the capabilities of the measurement methods in "physics prototypes" the focus now lies on improving their implementation in "engineering prototypes", that are scalable to the full linear collider detector. The Analog Hadron Calorimeter (AHCAL) concept is a sampling calorimeter of tungsten or steel absorber plates and plastic scintillator tiles read out by silicon photo multipliers (SiPMs) as active material. The front-end ASICs are integrated into the active layers of the calorimeter and are allowing the prototype to be equipped with different types of scintillator tiles as well as SiPMs. Four layers have been equipped with a novel design of scintillator tile wrapped in reflecting foil and directly coupled to a SiPM manufactured by Ketek. The blue sensitive SiPM has 2304 pixels, an average gain of 6 × 106 electrons and an average dark count rate of 2 × 106 s-1 when operated at 2.5 V above breakdown and 22°C. Furthermore the temperature dependence of the breakdown voltage for these SiPMs is only 17 C V which ensures a stable operation. The operation at fixed over voltage ensures a homogeneous response and behavior of the calorimeter. Results from recent beam test measurements of minimal ionizing particles will be compared to calibrations obtained in the laboratory and the analysis on electromagnetic showers will be presented. Plans for future hadron beam tests with a larger prototype will be discussed. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike Licence.},

abstract={Many horses display unwanted behaviour prior to receiving concentrate feed or forage. These behaviours have received relatively little scientific attention as a distinct group of equine behaviour problems and risk factors for their performance have not been quantified. The objective of this study was to generate data on the diet of UK leisure horses, the feeding practices employed by their carers, and the prevalence of behaviour problems seen prior to feeding. A convenience sample of leisure horse carers were surveyed via a self-administered internet survey. Each carer provided data for only one horse, and to minimise recall bias was asked to report details of their horse's feeding routine over the week prior to completing the survey. Recruitment was spread over twelve calendar months. The survey was completed by 1,324 respondents, each reporting data for an individual horse in their care. Pre-feeding behaviour problems were common within the sample and were reduced by Principal Components Analysis into three components labelled: aggression; frustration; and stereotypies. While the specific risk factors associated with these problems differed, they fell into four distinct themes: how the horse is fed; the use of nutritional supplements; exercise and stabling; and the performance of oral investigative behaviour. The risk factors for pre-feeding behaviour problems identified in this study raise concerns about the way domestic horses are currently fed and managed. In conjunction with published empirical evidence they indicate that the welfare of domestic horses may be improved by adopting a feeding regime and management system more suited to their physiological and behavioural needs. © 2014 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.},

abstract={Cognitive dysfunction is more common in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Currently, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and metformin are important therapeutic options for patients with T2DM. However, their potential effects on cognitive function, including underlying mechanisms, are yet to be fully determined. We have compared the individual and combined effects of treatment for 20 days with (Val8)GLP-1(GluPAL), an enzymatically stable GLP-1-receptor agonist, and metformin on metabolic control and aspects of learning and memory in high fat fed mice. (Val8)GLP-1(GluPAL) treatment for 20 days alone, or in combination with metformin, improved (p &lt; 0.05) the recognition index in high fat mice, indicating enhanced learning and memory. In addition, these mice exhibited a complete reversal of the deleterious effects of prolonged high-fat feeding on long-term potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region. This was linked to reduced hippocampal levels of 8-oxoguanine (p &lt; 0.01) and glial fibriallary acidic protein (p &lt; 0.001), indicating decreased oxidative stress and inflammation; respectively. Expression of fundamental hippocampal genes including mTOR, VEGF, NTRK2 and SIRT1 was also increased significantly (p &lt; 0.001) by all treatments. (Val 8)GLP-1(GluPAL) monotherapy, or in combination with metformin, reduced circulating glucose (p &lt; 0.05) and increased insulin (p &lt; 0.05 to p &lt; 0.01) concentrations, as well as improving glucose tolerance (p &lt; 0.001) and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (p &lt; 0.05 to p &lt; 0.01). Insulin sensitivity and measurements of energy regulation and metabolic rate were not altered.

abstract={Although many studies have been carried out on plant-animal mutualistic assemblages, the roles of functional traits and taxonomy in determining both whether interactions involve mutualisms or predation and the structure of such assemblages are unclear. We used semi-natural enclosures to quantitatively assess the interaction strengths between seeds of 8 sympatric tree species and 4 rodent species in a tropical forest in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, Southwest China. We found 2 clusters of species in the seed-rodent network represented by 2 genera in the Fagaceae (Castanopsis, Lithocarpus). Compared to seeds of 3 Castanopsis species, seeds with heavy weight, hard coat or caloric content (including 3 Lithocarpus species) were eaten less and more frequently hoarded by rodents. In turn, hoarded seeds showed less predation and more mutualism with rodents. Our results suggest that seed traits significantly affected the hoarding behavior of rodents, and, consequently, the occurrence of mutualisms and predation as well as assemblage structure in the plant-animal seed dispersal system. Taxonomically-related species with similar seed traits as functional groups belong to the same substructures in the assemblage. Our results indicate that both seed traits and taxonomic relationships may simplify thinking about seed dispersal systems by helping to elucidate whether interactions are likely to be dominated by predation or mutualism. © 2013 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.},

abstract={The Look AHEAD trial, evaluating the effects of weight loss on cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in overweight/obese people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), was interrupted after a median 9.5-year follow-up because the incidence of CV events was not different between the Intensive Lifestyle Intervention (ILI) and the control groups, and unlikely to statistically change thereafter. This made health providers and patients wondering about clinical value of diet and physical exercise in diabetic patients. Many factors may have made difficult to ascertain benefits of lifestyle intervention, besides the lower than predicted CV event rates. Among others, LDL-cholesterol was lowered more, with a higher use of statins, in the control group. Anyhow, ILI significantly improved numerous health conditions, including quality of life, CV risk factors and blood glucose control, with more diabetes remissions and less use of insulin.The intervention aimed at weight loss by reducing fat calories, and using meal replacements and, eventually, orlistat, likely underemphasizing dietary composition. There is suggestive evidence, in fact, that qualitative changes in dietary composition aiming at higher consumption of foods rich in fiber and with a high vegetable/animal fat ratio favorably influence CV risk in T2D patients.In conclusion, the Look AHEAD showed substantial health benefits of lifestyle modifications. Prevention of CV events may need higher attention to dietary composition, contributing to stricter control of CV risk factors. As a better health-related quality of life in people with diabetes is an important driver of our clinical decisions, efforts on early implementation of behavioral changes through a multifactorial approach are strongly justified. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objective: To develop and validate an instrument to assess environmentally conscious eating (Green Eating [GE]) behavior (BEH) and GE Transtheoretical Model constructs including Stage of Change (SOC), Decisional Balance (DB), and Self-efficacy (SE). Design: Cross-sectional instrument development survey. Setting/Participants: Convenience sample (n = 954) of 18- to 24-year-old college students from a northeastern university. Analysis: The sample was randomly split: (N1) and (N2). N1 was used for exploratory factor analyses using principal components analyses; N2 was used for confirmatory analyses (structural modeling) and reliability analyses (coefficient α). The full sample was used for measurement invariance (multi-group confirmatory analyses) and convergent validity (BEH) and known group validation (DB and SE) by SOC using analysis of variance. Results: Reliable (α &gt; 7), psychometrically sound, and stable measures included 2 correlated 5-item DB subscales (Pros and Cons), 2 correlated SE subscales (school [5 items] and home [3 items]), and a single 6-item BEH scale. Most students (66%) were in Precontemplation and Contemplation SOC. Behavior, DB, and SE scales differed significantly by SOC (P &lt;.001) with moderate to large effect sizes, as predicted by the Transtheoretical Model, which supported the validity of these measures. Conclusions and Implications: Successful development and preliminary validation of this 25-item GE instrument provides a basis for assessment as well as development of tailored interventions for college students. © 2014 Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior.},

abstract={Animals with parental care defend their offspring with an intensity reflecting parental investment. Parental investment theory predicts that parents should take risks relative to their residual reproductive value. Therefore, parental defense should change consistently with age reaching a peak at middle age, and it should vary consistently with age at start and end of reproduction. We recorded the intensity of parental defense of offspring in 410 female goshawks Accipiter gentilis throughout their lives, ranging from timid females that barely approached a human intruder at the nest to aggressive females that physically attacked the human. Females were consistent in their level of defense throughout life, and aggressive females were mated to aggressive males. Investment in reproduction as reflected by laying date, clutch size, and brood size showed a bell-shaped relationship with age. Females that started to breed at a young age were less aggressive than females that started late. Likewise, females that finished reproduction at a young age behaved less aggressively than females that finished at an old age. The intensity of defense of offspring peaked at an intermediate age followed by a decrease into old age and senescence. Females that started to breed early during the season were more aggressive than late breeders. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the intensity of parental defense of their offspring reflects parental investment and patterns of aging. © 2014 International Society for Behavioral Ecology.

abstract={Fetal growth restriction (FGR) can emerge as a complication of placental dysfunction and increases the risk for neurodevelopmental delay. Marked elevations of umbilical artery (UA) Doppler resistance that set the stage for cardiovascular and biophysical deterioration with subsequent preterm birth characterize early-onset FGR. Minimal, or absent UA Doppler abnormalities and isolated cerebral Doppler changes with subtle deterioration and a high risk for unanticipated term stillbirth are characteristic for late-onset FGR. Nutritional deficiency manifested in lagging head growth is the most powerful predictor of developmental delay in all forms of FGR. Extremes of blood flow resistance and cardiovascular deterioration, prematurity and intracranial hemorrhage increase the risks for psychomotor delay and cerebral palsy. In late-onset FGR, regional cerebral vascular redistribution correlates with abnormal behavioral domains. Irrespective of the phenotype of FGR, prenatal tests that provide precise and independent stratification of risks for adverse neurodevelopment have yet to be determined. © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract={Dementia is often associated with challenging behaviors that can significantly impact the quality of life of individuals with dementia and pose great difficulty for long-term care staff. Antipsychotic medications, historically the mainstay approach for managing such behaviors, have increasingly been associated with limited efficacy and increased death risk with older dementia patients. In an effort to promote and realize the promise of nonpharmacological management of challenging dementia-related behaviors, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system has developed and implemented STARVA, an interdisciplinary behavioral intervention for managing challenging dementia-related behaviors of veterans, in 17 VA nursing homes, as part of a pilot implementation initiative. Sixty-four veterans with challenging behaviors associated with dementia participated in the STAR-VA intervention coordinated by Mental Health Providers completing specialized training. Challenging behaviors clustered into 6 behavior types: Resistance to care, agitation, violence/aggression, vocalization, wandering, and other. Results indicate that STAR-VA led to significant reductions in the frequency and severity of challenging dementia-related behaviors, with overall effect sizes of approximately 1. In addition, the intervention led to significant reductions in depression and anxiety. Overall, the results support the feasibility and effectiveness of STAR-VA for managing challenging dementia-related behaviors in veterans in realworld, nursing home settings.},

abstract={TThe nutritional management of cattle herds in the country had resulted in a low production behavior of the animal. Under these circumstances, the diagnosis and functional approach to the feeding subsystem in a group of 20 bovine farms located in the Aroa Valley, at Yaracuy state, during the years 2010 and 2011 was raised. Diagnostic information was collected by survey application and observations exploratory on-farm; based on diagnosed needs, a work plan designed and executed, which included training and technical support to producers for a period of 18 months. A significant increase (P ≤ 0,0065) in the adoption of strategic supplementation in herds, reaching 85% at the end of the period approach was achieved. Established practices more relevant (P ≤ 0,05) were: establishment and use of protein banks (30%), development and provision of multinutritional blocks (45%) and mixed silage (30%) from local raw materials, acquisition and use of external inputs such as concentrated feed (80%) and minerals (85%), and the use of citrus pulp (35%) and molasses (40%) like agroindustrial byproducts usable and availability for animal supplementation. Determined that the process of technological approach of feeding subsystem under this methodology was used to start and consolidate food improvement in these cattle production systems. © 2014, Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agricolas (INIA).

abstract={In order to evaluate the influence of rearing system (free-ranging (FR) v. confinement (C)) on buffalo heifer efficiency to reach age of puberty and on behavioural and immune functions, two experiments were conducted from September 2010 to October 2011. In Experiment I, 32 subjects aged 8 to 9 months at the start of experiment were used. A total of 16 animals (group C) were group housed in an indoor slatted floor pen (4 m2/animal) with an outdoor paddock (4 m2/animal); 16 others grazed on a Mediterranean natural pasture of 40 ha (group FR). Behavioural data were collected and organic matter digestibility, blood metabolites and progesterone were determined. At the end of the experiment, a novel object test and a skin test were conducted, and the avoidance distance (AD) at the manger was measured. Free-ranging animals were able to express natural behaviours such as wallowing and grazing. C animals devoted more time to the novel object than FR animals, whereas AD at manger was lower in group FR than in group C (P &lt; 0.01). Cellular immune response was higher in FR heifers than in C animals (P &lt; 0.01). FR animals also showed a higher digestibility of organic matter (P &lt; 0.01). Heifers from group FR had higher plasma concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (P &lt; 0.001) and lower concentrations of glucose than heifers from group C (P &lt; 0.001). C animals showed higher daily weight gains (P &lt; 0.01) and weight at the puberty (P &lt; 0.05), but there were no differences in terms of age of puberty between the two groups. The intakes of dry matter (DM), CP and energy to reach the age of puberty were similar in both groups. In order to verify whether the results obtained in Experiment I could be replicated in different rearing conditions (reduced pasture availability, different location and altitude), a second experiment was conducted on 26 animals, where only onset of age of puberty and metabolic profile were monitored. In Experiment II, 13 heifers grazed on a natural pasture of 5 ha, other 13 received the same space as indicated for Experiment I. Results from Experiment II generally confirmed those of Experiment I. Only the intakes of DM and energy to reach the age of puberty were higher in group C than in FR (P &lt; 0.001). A lower competition with human nutrition, reproductive performances similar to those shown by confined animals and the indications given by immune and behavioural variables, suggest that a free-range-based system may be conveniently used for buffalo heifer farming purposes. © The Animal Consortium 2014.},

abstract={Binge eating disorder (BED), the most common eating disorder, affects approximately 3.5% of women and 2.0% of men in the United States at some point in their lifetime. Because binge eating can lead to excess caloric intake, many individuals with BED are overweight or obese. The prevalence of BED among obese treatmentseeking individuals may be as high as 70%, and approximately 5% to 8% of obese individuals meet criteria for BED. In addition, BED has been prospectively linked to other negative obesity-related health outcomes including metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and diabetes. Independent of obesity, BED is associated with increased rates of depression and other psychological problems. Thus, some practitioners and researchers see BED as a modifiable risk factor that could assist our wider efforts to reduce the public health problems associated with obesity and diabetes in our society. This chapter reviews current evidence-based pharmacological and behavioral treatments for BED and obesity. Also mentioned are novel therapies that have shown promise in limited clinical studies. Several antidepressant medications have demonstrated short-term efficacy in reducing binge frequency; whereas, orlistat and buproprion have demonstrated short-term efficacy in the management of obesity. Effective behavioral therapies include cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, and dialectical behavior therapy for reducing binge frequency, and behavioral weight management for reducing weight. Selfmonitoring is an important component of most behavioral strategies. Surgical techniques are generally reserved for treating severe obesity, and include gastric banding and bypass. The chapter includes discussions of treatment moderating factors; current controversies/competing theories about weight reduction as a goal of BED treatment; binge/loss of control eating in children; and future directions for research including internet-based, telemedicine, and virtual-world delivery systems. Key challenges for research and clinical application in the treatment of obesity and BED are presented. Findings and guidance for treatment evaluation are contextualized using the clinically relevant concept of "number needed to treat/harm" (NNT/NNH). © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={Background: Societies tend to accept much higher risks for voluntary behaviours, those based on individual decisions (for example, to smoke, to consume alcohol, or to ski), than for involuntary exposure such as exposure to risks in soil, drinking water or air. In high-income societies, an acceptable risk to those voluntarily engaging in a risky behaviour seems to be about one death in 1,000 on a lifetime basis. However, drinking more than 20 g pure alcohol per day over an adult lifetime exceeds a threshold of one in 100 deaths, based on a calculation from World Health Organization data of the odds in six European countries of dying from alcohol-attributable causes at different levels of drinking. Discussion: The voluntary mortality risk of alcohol consumption exceeds the risks of other lifestyle risk factors. In addition, evidence shows that the involuntary risks resulting from customary alcohol consumption far exceed the acceptable threshold for other involuntary risks (such as those established by the World Health Organization or national environmental agencies), and would be judged as not acceptable. Alcohol's exceptional status reflects vagaries of history, which have so far resulted in alcohol being exempted from key food legislation (no labelling of ingredients and nutritional information) and from international conventions governing all other psychoactive substances (both legal and illegal). This is along with special treatment of alcohol in the public health field, in part reflecting overestimation of its beneficial effect on ischaemic disease when consumed in moderation. Summary: A much higher mortality risk from alcohol than from other risk factors is currently accepted by high income countries. © 2014 Rehm et al.},

abstract={This review aimed to determine longitudinal changes in objectively measured overall sedentary behaviour, and to examine their associations with adiposity in children and adolescents. A search for longitudinal studies was performed using several electronic databases. Of 161 potentially eligible papers, 10 for change in sedentary behaviour and 3 for longitudinal associations with change in adiposity were included. Weighted mean increase in daily sedentary behaviour per year was 5.7% for boys and 5.8% for girls. Only one paper included preschool children, and it showed a decrease in sedentary behaviour. Nine studies were from Western countries. Null associations were reported between sedentary behaviour and adiposity in two studies, the other found that increases in sedentary behaviour were associated with increases in adiposity, but only in those with body mass index above the 50th percentile. There was consistent evidence that sedentary behaviour increases with age in school-age children and adolescents, by approximately 30min extra daily sedentary behaviour per year. There was little evidence on the influence of changes in sedentary behaviour on changes in adiposity. There is a need for more longitudinal research, for more evidence from outside the Western world, and for more studies that examine 'dose-response' associations between changes in sedentary behaviour and changes in adiposity. © 2014 The Author(s).},

abstract={Foraging decisions and movement strategies by animals often involve a trade-off between meeting nutritional demands and minimizing risk of predation. We evaluated the influence of space use and movement patterns of maternal female grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) on cub (defined as first year of life) survival in eastern Interior Alaska, USA, during 2008-2012. We monitored 9 GPS radiocollared females that produced 28 cubs in 12 litters (x¯ litter size = 2.3, range = 2-3). The estimated annual cub survival rate was 0.39 (95% CI = 0.20-0.57). In all cases the entire litter survived or died prior to den entrance. All cubs in a litter died either concurrently or within 14 days in 5 of 7 litters lost. Sixty-nine percent of cub mortality occurred between 31 May and 16 June. We did not document cub mortality before 31 May. Females with surviving cubs remained within 1 km of the den for a longer period following emergence than those that lost cubs. Between den emergence and the onset of vegetation green-up, females with surviving cubs used fewer habitat patches and remained in individual habitat patches longer than females that lost their cubs later in the summer. Females with surviving cubs exhibited different activity patterns compared with females that lost their cubs, particularly by moving less between midnight and mid-morning during 15 May-16 June. Once vegetation green-up occurred, movement rates of all maternal females were similar except that females with surviving cubs continued to move less during the morning hours (0000-1200 hr). We did not find evidence that the body size of the mother was a factor explaining cub survival nor was there evidence that cub survival was directly influenced by human causes. The most successful behavioral strategies used by maternal females to maximize cub survival appeared to be a combination of limiting movements to a few habitat patches between den emergence and vegetation green-up and limiting activity between midnight and mid-morning. We suggest that the ability to find and exploit suitable habitat patches during this period of limited resources may have allowed females to alter movements temporally and spatially and provision themselves and their cubs more effectively. This strategy was likely effective for both minimizing exposure to infanticidal adult bears and allowing cubs to maximize energy efficiency. © 2014 International Association for Bear Research and Management.},

Lifestyle can be treated as an indicator of social attitudes and of the ideologies that are functioning in the social space. In aboriginal tribes, eating behaviors had a strong religious imprint referring directly to obtain favors from the gods as health, wealth, healing and long life. Even if blatant promotion of a lifestyle can produce civilization, modelling behaviours, yet strongly promoting a lifestyle can become a subtle tool of manipulation and control. Following a healthy lifestyle, regardless of age, will have numerous health benefits, being proven that it reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, decreases incidence of obesity and diabetes, the risk of malignancy, psychiatric disorders and cognitive dysfunction.

abstract={The costs and benefits of alternative migratory strategies are often framed in the context of top-down and bottom-up effects on individual fitness. This occurs because migration is considered a costly behavioral strategy that presumably confers explicit benefits to migrants in the form of either decreased predation risk (predation risk avoidance hypothesis) or increased nutrition (forage maturation hypothesis). To test these hypotheses, we studied a partially migratory moose (Alces alces) population and contrasted explicit measures of predation risk (i.e., offspring survival) and nutrition (i.e., accumulation of endogenous energy reserves) between resident and migratory subpopulations. We relied on data collected from migratory and nonmigratory radio-marked moose (n = 67) that inhabited a novel study system located in coastal Alaska between 2004 and 2010. In this area, 30% of the population resides year-round on a coastal foreland area, while 48% migrate to either a small island archipelago or a subalpine ridge system (the remainder exhibited one of six different low-occurrence strategies). Overall, we determined that accumulation of body fat during the growing season did not differ between migratory or resident modalities. However, calf survival was 2.6-2.9 times higher for individuals that migrated (survival, islands=0.49 ± 0.16 [mean ± SE], n = 35; ridge = 0.52 ± 0.16, n = 33) than those that did not (survival, resident = 0.19 ± 0.08, n = 57). Our results support the predation risk avoidance hypotheses, and suggest that migration is a behavioral strategy that principally operates to reduce the risk of calf predation and does not confer explicit nutritional benefits. We did not directly detect trade-offs between predation risk and nutrition for migratory individuals. Yet we identify an indirect life history mechanism that may mildly dampen the apparent fitness benefits of migration. The proximate factors accounting for differences in migration-specific neonate survival are likely linked to accessibility of refugial habitats for moose at local and landscape scales, landscape factors that affect hunting efficacy of large carnivores, and interactions with rural human communities. Conservation of ungulate populations can be aided by integrating knowledge about migratory behavior, life history strategies, and factors that alter ungulate vulnerability, particularly those induced by human activity. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={A combinatory approach using metabolomics and gut microbiome analysis techniques was performed to unravel the nature and specificity of metabolic profiles related to gut ecology in obesity. This study focused on gut and liver metabolomics of two different mouse strains, the C57BL/6J (C57J) and the C57BL/6N (C57N) fed with high-fat diet (HFD) for 3 weeks, causing diet-induced obesity in C57N, but not in C57J mice. Furthermore, a 16S-ribosomal RNA comparative sequence analysis using 454 pyrosequencing detected significant differences between the microbiome of the two strains on phylum level for Firmicutes, Deferribacteres and Proteobacteria that propose an essential role of the microbiome in obesity susceptibility. Gut microbial and liver metabolomics were followed by a combinatory approach using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) and ultra performance liquid chromatography time of tlight MS/MS with subsequent multivariate statistical analysis, revealing distinctive host and microbial metabolome patterns between the C57J and the C57N strain. Many taurine-conjugated bile acids (TBAs) were significantly elevated in the cecum and decreased in liver samples from the C57J phenotype likely displaying different energy utilization behavior by the bacterial community and the host. Furthermore, several metabolite groups could specifically be associated with the C57N phenotype involving fatty acids, eicosanoids and urobilinoids. The mass differences based metabolite network approach enabled to extend the range of known metabolites to important bile acids (BAs) and novel taurine conjugates specific for both strains. In summary, our study showed clear alterations of the metabolome in the gastrointestinal tract and liver within a HFD-induced obesity mouse model in relation to the host-microbial nutritional adaptation. © 2014 International Society for Microbial Ecology.

abstract={Eating slowly contributes to a lower risk of obesity, probably because it could aid appetite control. Chewing thoroughly is an effective strategy to reduce eating rate; however, insufficient data are available to demonstrate the relationship between such an eating behavior and energy intake. To investigate the effect of increasing the number of chews before swallowing on meal size, a randomized cross-over trial was conducted in 18- to 45-year-old normal-weight, overweight, and obese participants (n=45) who were recruited from the local community (Ames, IA). After assessment of baseline number of chews, participants were asked to attend three test sessions to eat pizza for lunch until comfortably full by chewing each portion of food either 100%, 150%, or 200% of their baseline number of chews before swallowing. Two-way analysis of variance was used to test the effect of treatment and body-weight status, as well as their interactions on food intake, meal duration, eating rate, and appetite at meal termination. Appetite data during 60 minutes were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance. Food intake in the sessions with 150% and 200% of their baseline number of chews was reduced significantly, by 9.5% and 14.8%, respectively, compared with the 100% session. Increasing the number of chews also prolonged meal duration and reduced eating rate. However, subjective appetite at meal termination or during the immediate postprandial period did not differ. These data indicate that increasing the number of chews before swallowing might be a behavioral strategy to reduce food intake and potentially aid body-weight management. © 2014 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.},

abstract={Purpose: Usability testing can be used to evaluate human-computer interaction (HCI) and communication in shared decision making (SDM) for patient-provider behavioral change and behavioral contracting. Traditional evaluations of usability using scripted or mock patient scenarios with think-aloud protocol analysis provide a way to identify HCI issues. In this paper we describe the application of these methods in the evaluation of the Avoiding Diabetes Thru Action Plan Targeting (ADAPT) tool, and test the usability of the tool to support the ADAPT framework for integrated care counseling of pre-diabetes. The think-aloud protocol analysis typically does not provide an assessment of how patient-provider interactions are effected in "live" clinical workflow or whether a tool is successful. Therefore, "Near-live" clinical simulations involving applied simulation methods were used to compliment the think-aloud results. This complementary usability technique was used to test the end-user HCI and tool performance by more closely mimicking the clinical workflow and capturing interaction sequences along with assessing the functionality of computer module prototypes on clinician workflow. We expected this method to further complement and provide different usability findings as compared to think-aloud analysis. Together, this mixed method evaluation provided comprehensive and realistic feedback for iterative refinement of the ADAPT system prior to implementation. Methods: The study employed two phases of testing of a new interactive ADAPT tool that embedded an evidence-based shared goal setting component into primary care workflow for dealing with pre-diabetes counseling within a commercial physician office electronic health record (EHR). Phase I applied usability testing that involved "think-aloud" protocol analysis of eight primary care providers interacting with several scripted clinical scenarios. Phase II used "near-live" clinical simulations of five providers interacting with standardized trained patient actors enacting the clinical scenario of counseling for pre-diabetes, each of whom had a pedometer that recorded the number of steps taken over a week. In both phases, all sessions were audio-taped and motion screen-capture software was activated for onscreen recordings. Transcripts were coded using iterative qualitative content analysis methods. Results: In Phase I, the impact of the components and layout of ADAPT on user's Navigation, Understandability, and Workflow were associated with the largest volume of negative comments (i.e. approximately 80% of end-user commentary), while Usability and Content of ADAPT were representative of more positive than negative user commentary. The heuristic category of Usability had a positive-to-negative comment ratio of 2.1, reflecting positive perception of the usability of the tool, its functionality, and overall co-productive utilization of ADAPT. However, there were mixed perceptions about content (i.e., how the information was displayed, organized and described in the tool).In Phase II, the duration of patient encounters was approximately 10. min with all of the Patient Instructions (prescriptions) and behavioral contracting being activated at the end of each visit. Upon activation, providers accepted the pathway prescribed by the tool 100% of the time and completed all the fields in the tool in the simulation cases. Only 14% of encounter time was spent using the functionality of the ADAPT tool in terms of keystrokes and entering relevant data. The rest of the time was spent on communication and dialog to populate the patient instructions. In all cases, the interaction sequence of reviewing and discussing exercise and diet of the patient was linked to the functionality of the ADAPT tool in terms of monitoring, response-efficacy, self-efficacy, and negotiation in the patient-provider dialog. There was a change from one-way dialog to two-way dialog and negotiation that ended in a behavioral contract. This change demonstrated the tool's sequence, which supported recording current exercise and diet followed by a diet and exercise goal setting procedure to reduce the risk of diabetes onset. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that "think-aloud" protocol analysis with "near-live" clinical simulations provided a successful usability evaluation of a new primary care pre-diabetes shared goal setting tool. Each phase of the study provided complementary observations on problems with the new onscreen tool and was used to show the influence of the ADAPT framework on the usability, workflow integration, and communication between the patient and provider. The think-aloud tests with the provider showed the tool can be used according to the ADAPT framework (exercise-to-diet behavior change and tool utilization), while the clinical simulations revealed the ADAPT framework to realistically support patient-provider communication to obtain behavioral change contract. SDM interactions and mechanisms affecting protocol-based care can be more completely captured by combining "near-live" clinical simulations with traditional "think-aloud analysis" which augments clinician utilization. More analysis is required to verify if the rich communication actions found in Phase II compliment clinical workflows. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract={Background: The aims of the present study were to explore whether symptoms in different anxiety disorders are associated with Cloninger's model temperament dimensions novelty seeking (NS), harm avoidance (HA), reward dependence and persistence compared with control subjects in clinical samples of adults or late adolescents. Method: Literature search in the following databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed (Medline), Web of Science, Psycinfo and PsycArticles. Systematic review, grading the level of evidence and meta-analysis for each disorder by comparing the temperament dimension scores between patient and control samples in single studies. Results: A total of 40 papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses were conducted on a total of 24 studies focusing on panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder (SAD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The primary finding was a constant and clinically marked positive association between the HA temperament dimension and symptoms of PD, SAD and OCD, with a most marked effect in SAD, and a moderate effect in OCD and PD. Second, less marked and clinically marginal associations between NS score and SAD and OCD (negative associations), but no associations with PD were observed. The meta-analyses revealed heterogeneity between the results of individual studies, especially in the analyses including SAD and OCD. Conclusions: PD, SAD and OCD share a marked and state-dependent avoidant behavioral pattern, which is common for all anxiety disorders. However, PD showed a different pattern of arousal to novel stimuli from that of SAD and OCD. The findings are state dependent and based on cross-sectional studies. © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract={Mutualistic symbioses are ubiquitous in nature and facilitate high biodiversity and productivity of ecosystems by enhancing the efficiency of energy and nutrient use within ecological communities. For example, small groups of fish that inhabit coral colonies in reef ecosystems potentially enhance coral growth through defense from coral predators, aeration of coral tissue and nutrient provisioning. This study examines whether the prevalence and consequences of fish-coral interactions vary among sites with different environmental conditions in a coral reef lagoon, using the humbug damselfish Dascyllus aruanus and its preferred coral host Pocillopora damicornis as a study system. Using a field experiment, we tested the site-specific effects of D. aruanus on coral growth, and show that the cost-benefit ratio for corals hosting fish varies with local environmental variation. Results of this study also demonstrate that fish prefer to inhabit coral colonies with particular branch-spacing characteristics, and that the local abundance of D. aruanus influences the proportion of coral colonies within a site that are occupied by fish rather than increasing the number of fish per colony. We also show that corals consistently benefit from hosting D. aruanus via defense from predation by corallivorous butterflyfish, regardless of local environmental conditions. These findings highlight the need to consider the potential for multiple scale- and state-dependent interaction effects when examining the ecology of fish-coral associations. We suggest that fluctuating cost-benefit ratios for species interactions may contribute to the maintenance of different colony phenotypes within coral populations. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Introduction: Uniform coordinate systems in neuroimaging research have enabled comprehensive systematic and quantitative meta-analyses. Such approaches are particularly relevant for neuropsychiatric diseases, the understanding of their symptoms, prediction and treatment. Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), a common neurodegenerative syndrome, is characterized by deep alterations in behavior and personality. Investigating this 'nexopathy' elucidates the healthy social and emotional brain. Methods: Here, we combine three multimodal meta-analyses approaches - anatomical and activation likelihood estimates and behavioral domain profiles - to identify neural correlates of bvFTD in 417 patients and 406 control subjects and to extract mental functions associated with this disease by meta-analyzing functional activation studies in the comprehensive probabilistic functional brain atlas of the BrainMap database. Results: The analyses identify the frontomedian cortex, basal ganglia, anterior insulae and thalamus as most relevant hubs, with a regional dissociation between atrophy and hypometabolism. Neural networks affected by bvFTD were associated with emotion and reward processing, empathy and executive functions (mainly inhibition), suggesting these functions as core domains affected by the disease and finally leading to its clinical symptoms. In contrast, changes in theory of mind or mentalizing abilities seem to be secondary phenomena of executive dysfunctions. Conclusions: The study creates a novel conceptual framework to understand neuropsychiatric diseases by powerful data-driven meta-analytic approaches that shall be extended to the whole neuropsychiatric spectrum in the future. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={For long-lived organisms, the fitness value of survival is greater than that of current reproduction. Asymmetric fitness rewards suggest that organisms inhabiting unpredictable environments should adopt a risk-sensitive life history, predicting that it is adaptive to allocate resources to increase their own body reserves at the expense of reproduction. We tested this using data from reindeer populations inhabiting contrasting environments and using winter body mass development as a proxy for the combined effect of winter severity and density dependence. Individuals in good and harsh environments responded similarly: Females who lost large amounts of winter body mass gained more body mass the coming summer compared with females losing less mass during winter. Additionally, females experienced a cost of reproduction: On average, barren females gained more body mass than lactating females. Winter body mass development positively affected both the females' reproductive success and offspring body mass. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our findings with respect to scenarios for future climate change. © 2014 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Consistent with reports of cerebellar structural, functional, and neurochemical anomalies in schizophrenia, robust cerebellar-dependent delay eyeblink conditioning (dEBC) deficits have been observed in the disorder. Impaired dEBC is also present in schizotypal personality disorder, an intermediate phenotype of schizophrenia. The present work sought to determine whether dEBC deficits exist in nonpsychotic first-degree relatives of individuals with schizophrenia. A single-cue tone dEBC paradigm consisting of 10 blocks with 10 trials each (9 paired and 1 unpaired trials) was used to examine the functional integrity of cerebellar circuitry in schizophrenia participants, individuals with a first-degree relative diagnosed with schizophrenia, and healthy controls with no firstdegree relatives diagnosed with schizophrenia. The conditioned stimulus (a 400 ms tone) coterminated with the unconditioned stimulus (a 50 ms air puff to the left eye) on paired trials. One relative and 2 healthy controls were removed from further analysis due to declining conditioned response rates, leaving 18 schizophrenia participants, 17 first-degree relatives, and 16 healthy controls. Electromyographic data were subsequently analyzed using growth curve models in hierarchical linear regression. Acquisition of dEBC conditioned responses was significantly impaired in schizophrenia and first-degree relative groups compared with controls. This finding that cerebellar-mediated associative learning deficits are present in first-degree relatives of individuals with schizophrenia provides evidence that dEBC abnormalities in schizophrenia may not be due to medication or course of illness effects. Instead, the present results are consistent with models of schizophrenia positing cerebellar-cortical circuit abnormalities and suggest that cerebellar abnormalities represent a risk marker for the disorder. © The Author 2013.},

abstract={Background: Suicide is a major cause of mortality for patients with eating disorders (ED), especially for patients with anorexia nervosa. Attempted suicide is also relatively common in patients with anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Aims: This study aimed at examining associations between attempted suicide and trait- and state-dependent characteristics in a large clinical population of ED patients. Method: The sample consisted of 1,436 in- and outpatients of the Centre for Eating Disorders of the Ghent University Hospital. Measures of ED symptoms, psychopathology, and personality traits were compared between ED patients with and ED patients without a history of attempted suicide. Results: A history of attempted suicide was found in 11.8% of the ED patients and lifetime suicidal ideation was reported by 43.3%. Multivariate analyses showed that a history of attempted suicide was associated with higher scores on depression, purging symptomatology, early-developed cognitive schemes (impaired autonomy and increased inhibition), and social insecurity. Conclusion: These findings support the increased risk of suicidal behavior in ED. The presence of particular personality traits, of cognitive schemes, and of purging and depressive symptoms should increase vigilance for suicidal behavior. © 2014 Hogrefe Publishing.},

abstract={Background: Due to the excessive and pathologic effects of depression and anxiety, it is important to identify the role of protective factors, such as effective coping and social support. This study examined the associations between perceived social support and coping styles with depression and anxiety levels.
Materials and Methods: This cross sectional study was part of the Study on the Epidemiology of Psychological, Alimentary Health and Nutrition project. A total 4658 individuals aged ≥20 years was selected by cluster random sampling. Subjects completed questionnaires, which were used to describe perceived social support, coping styles, depression and anxiety. t-test, Chi-square test, pearson’s correlation and Logistic regression analysis were used in data analyses.
Results: The results of Logistic regression analysis showed after adjusting demographic characteristics for odd ratio of anxiety, active copings such as positive re-interpretation and growth with odds ratios; 95% confidence interval: 0.82 (0.76, 0.89), problem engagement (0.92 [0.87, 0.97]), acceptance (0.82 [0.74, 0.92]) and also among perceived social supports, family (0.77 [0.71, 0.84]) and others (0.84 [0.76, 0.91]) were protective. In addition to, for odd ratio of depression, active copings such as positive re-interpretation and growth (0.74 [0.69, 0.79]), problem engagement (0.89 [0.86, 0.93]), and support seeking (0.96 [0.93, 0.99]) and all of social support types (family [0.75 (0.70, 0.80)], friends [0.90 (0.85, 0.95)] and others [0.80 (0.75, 0.86)]) were protective. Avoidance was risk factor for both of anxiety (1.19 [1.12, 1.27]) and depression (1.22 [1.16, 1.29]).
Conclusion: This study shows active coping styles and perceived social supports particularly positive re-interpretation and family social support are protective factors for depression and anxiety. © 2014, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences(IUMS). All rights reserved.},

abstract={Phenotypic plasticity pervades organismal development and physiology where it facilitates an enormous range of adaptive responses to novel or stressful environments. Plasticity also impacts evolutionary processes, reducing the probability of population extinction in the face of environmental changes and sometimes increasing speciation rates in developmentally plastic lineages. Despite the adaptive significance of plasticity, organisms are not infinitely plastic; rather they are constrained in the kinds and ranges of environmental changes to which their body parts, organs, and tissues can respond. Understanding the nature, costs, and limits of developmental plasticity requires insight into (i) the developmental-genetic and genomic mechanisms underlying plastic responses as well as (ii) their interplay with ecological and social conditions. In this chapter we review and summarize recent progress in the development of horned beetles as a study system with which to explore the interactions between changing ecological conditions and plastic, genome-wide responses in gene expression and developmental function. In particular, we focus on plastic responses to nutritional variation, which in horned beetles differ widely as a function of body region, sex, and species. We begin by introducing the study system and summarize the developmental-genetic and genomic tool set currently available for horned beetles. We then present recently developed statistical approaches that can be used to guide the design of multi-factorial genome-wide transcriptional comparisons when circumstances prohibit a fully balanced design. We present an example of such an approach in the horned beetle Onthophagus taurus and end by highlighting the growing opportunities for future ecological-genomic studies in horned beetles. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Developmental plasticity underlies widespread associations between early-life exposures and many components of adult phenotype, including the risk of chronic diseases. Humans take almost two decades to reach reproductive maturity, and yet the 'critical windows' of physiological sensitivity that confer developmental plasticity tend to close during fetal life or infancy. While several explanations for lengthy human maturation have been offered, the brevity of physiological plasticity has received less attention. I argue that offspring plasticity is only viable within the niche of maternal care, and that as this protection is withdrawn, the offspring is obliged to canalize many developmental traits in order to minimize environmental disruptions. The schedule of maternal care may therefore shape the duration of critical windows, and since the duration of this care is subject to parent-offspring conflict, the resolution of this conflict may shape the duration of critical windows. This perspective may help understand (i) why windows close at different times for different traits, and (ii) why the duration of critical windows may vary across human populations. The issue is explored in relation to population differences in the association between infant weight gain and later body composition. The occupation of more stable environments by western populations may have favoured earlier closure of the critical window during which growth in lean mass is sensitive to nutritional intake. This may paradoxically have elevated the risk of obesity following rapid infant weight gain in such populations. © 2014 The Author(s).},

abstract={This study explores foraging choices made by seed predators (white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis (Fischer, 1829), and woodland deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus gracilis (LeConte, 1855)) presented with seeds of two dominant tree species (sugar maple, Acer saccharum Marsh., and red maple, Acer rubrum L.). I hypothesized that both species would prefer A. saccharum seeds, as they are larger and ostensibly contain more energy. Although P. l. noveboracensis consumed more seed than P. m. gracilis, there was also a species-specific difference in preference. Peromyscus maniculatus gracilis clearly preferred A. rubrum over A. saccharum, whereas preferences of P. l. noveboracensis were less specific. Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis, being a habitat generalist, may demonstrate higher plasticity in response to different food types. Peromyscus maniculatus gracilis may prefer A. rubrum because of differences in nutrition, handling costs, or germination schedules, although this was not explicitly tested. This species-specific difference in preference indicates the common assumption that Peromyscus species are ecologically similar should be made with caution. © 2014, National Research Council of Canada.

abstract={An effective regulation emotion has been viewed as an important developmental task that serves as a prerequisite for several other developmental tasks. Specifically, because unregulated emotions have the potential to disorganize and disrupt multiple psychological processes. Children with deficits in emotion regulation have an increased risk for the development of emotional and behavioral problems. Emotion regulation starts to develop prenatally and is closely connected to early interactions with the infants' caregivers. A few studies show associations between prenatal risk factors (e.g. prenatal stress, maternal mental disorders, toxins, and malnutrition) and the emotional reactivity of the offspring. An increased excitability or irritability of the baby increases the demands on the interpersonal emotion regulation by the parents. However, deficits in the interpersonal emotion regulation in highly irritable infants can have a negative impact on the emotion regulation. Accordingly, a model of prenatal programming and postnatal plasticity of the emotion regulation in infants and toddlers is derived in this review paper, which is based on a mutual influence of pre- and postnatal risks for the development of the child's emotion regulation.},

abstract={The phenomenon whereby an individual's early life experiences modulate subsequent susceptibility to disease risk is known as the "developmental origins of health and disease" (DOHaD). This chapter focuses on obesity and associated metabolic disease, reviewing this research domain through the lens of an evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) conceptual framework. At the molecular level, we use early life nutrition as an illustrative example to review the rapidly accumulating experimental, clinical and epidemiological evidence that epigenetic mechanisms are a key component underlying developmental pathways affecting the risk of obesity and related diseases. Early overnutrition involving evolutionarily novel circumstances such as maternal obesity and gestational diabetes, while potentially representing a non-adaptive pathway to DOHaD, may also be underpinned by epigenetic mechanisms. The evidence that epigenetic dysregulation underlies the pathology of obesity and type 2 diabetes in adults is reviewed, as is the therapeutic potential of developmental epigenomics in improving human health. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Aims/hypothesis: The association between low birthweight (LBW) and risk of developing type 2 diabetes may involve epigenetic mechanisms, with skeletal muscle being a prime target tissue. Differential DNA methylation patterns have been observed in single genes in muscle tissue from type 2 diabetic and LBW individuals, and we recently showed multiple DNA methylation changes during short-term high-fat overfeeding in muscle of healthy people. In a randomised crossover study, we analysed genome-wide DNA promoter methylation in skeletal muscle of 17 young LBW men and 23 matched normal birthweight (NBW) men after a control and a 5 day high-fat overfeeding diet. Methods: DNA methylation was measured using Illumina's Infinium BeadArray covering 27,578 CpG sites representing 14,475 different genes. Results: After correction for multiple comparisons, DNA methylation levels were found to be similar in the LBW and NBW groups during the control diet. Whereas widespread DNA methylation changes were observed in the NBW group in response to high-fat overfeeding, only a few methylation changes were seen in the LBW group (χ2, p∈&lt;∈0.001). Conclusions/interpretation: Our results indicate lower DNA methylation plasticity in skeletal muscle from LBW vs NBW men, potentially contributing to understanding the link between LBW and increased risk of type 2 diabetes. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Members of a number of animal phyla are able to exhibit more than one phenotype as a consequence of developmental plasticity. In mammals, such plasticity appears to operate over a continuum and to involve altered epigenetic regulation. There is compelling evidence that environmental challenges during development in mammals induce altered phenotypes and that in humans such phenotypic changes may contribute to risk of non-communicable diseases. Whether induced phenotypic and epigenetic traits can be passed between generations is a matter for debate. Here, we discuss the evidence for non-genomic inheritance across multiple generations through the maternal line in mammals. We consider evidence from transient and persistent environmental challenges in the form of "natural experiments" in humans, including famine and exposure to synthetic hormones, and of experiments in rodent models. We also describe evidence for the involvement of heat shock protein-90 in regulating phenotypic change. Current evidence points to progressive phenotypic changes across generations driven by changing interactions between maternal phenotype and the environment that may either maintain a canalized phenotype or induce progressive increase in phenotypic variation. Overall, we conclude that there is no evidence to support the suggestion that phenotypic or epigenetic traits are passed unchanged between generations. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The widespread appreciation that the in utero environment may have long-term effects on the risk of adult diseases is now over 30 years old.1, 2 The idea has been called the Barker hypothesis or the fetal (or developmental) origins of adult diseases.2-4 It is hypothesized that the fetus has developmental plasticity, and that the final phenotype depends on environmental exposure during critical periods.5 For example, exposure to nutritional restriction in utero may shift the phenotype toward one that is better adapted to tolerate lower nutrition intake. These adaptations may be beneficial and increase the survival of the fetus, albeit at reduced body weight. Subsequently, however, this plasticity is lost and those phenotypic changes become fixed or programmed.5 If the individual is now exposed to conditions of nutritional excess, those same adaptations that were advantageous in utero may become maladaptive and increase the risk of adult diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD), type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. © 2014 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={By any of several measures, the health of the American population has been worsening over the last two decades. Obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart failure have risen dramatically. All the while, the average birthweight at all gestational ages has declined. The relationship between robust growth in the womb and lifelong health is now well established. Likewise, babies born at the low end of the birthweight scale are known to have highly elevated risks for ischemic heart disease, hypertension, stroke and metabolic disease. The biological mechanisms by which developmental plasticity becomes a risk for cardiovascular disease are only now being understood. Translating from animal and human studies, low birthweight babies are likely to have endothelial dysfunction, fewer nephrons, fewer pancreatic beta cells, less vascular elastin, fewer cardiomyocytes, increased sympathetic tone and liver-derived dyslipidemias. Only in the past few years, however, has it become known that maternal and placenta phenotypes are associated with adult onset cardiovascular disease. Helsinki Birth Cohort studies have been especially important in the discovery of these relationships. Sudden cardiac death is associated with a thin placenta and heart failure is associated with a small placenta in short mothers. Coronary heart disease is associated with three combinations of maternal-placental phenotypes. Because the diet is important in providing nutrients for the development of the female body before pregnancy and for providing nutrients during pregnancy, there is increasing evidence that the western diet is an underlying cause for the increase in metabolic disease in the American population. A large segment of the American population suffers from high calorie malnutrition. Scientists in this field now have a responsibility to educate the public on the topic of nutrition and health.

abstract={Epigenetics can play a role in interactions between chemicals and exposed species, between species and abiotic ecosystem components or between species of the same or another population in a community. Technological progress and advanced insights into epigenetic processes have led to the description of epigenetic features (mainly DNA methylation) in many ecologically relevant species: algae, plants, several invertebrates and fish. Epigenetic changes in plants, insects and cladocerans have been reported to be induced by various environmental stress factors including nutrition or water deficiency, grazing, light or temperature alterations, social environment, and dissolved organic matter concentrations. As regards chemicals, studies in rats and mice exposed to specific pesticides, hydrocarbons, dioxins, and endocrine disrupting chemicals demonstrated the induction of epigenetic changes, suggesting the need for further research with these substances in an ecotoxicological context. In fish and plants, exposure to polyaromatic hydrocarbons, metals, and soluble fractions of solid waste affected the epigenetic status. A novel concept in ecotoxicological epigenetics is the induction of transgenerational stress resistance upon chemical exposure, as demonstrated in rice exposed to metals. Evaluating epigenetics in ecotoxicological field studies is a second relatively new approach. A cryptic lineage of earthworms had developed arsenic tolerance in the field, concurrent with specific DNA methylation patterns. Flatfish caught in the framework of environmental monitoring had developed tumours, exhibiting specific DNA methylation patterns. Two main potential implications of epigenetics in an ecotoxicological context are (1) the possibility of transgenerationally inherited, chemical stress-induced epigenetic changes with associated phenotypes and (2) epigenetically induced adaptation to stress upon long-term chemical exposure. Key knowledge gaps are concerned with the causality of the relation between epigenetic and phenotypic changes, the persistence of transgenerational effects, the implications at population level and the costs of tolerance. Epigenetic changes following exposure to multiple stressors constitute another promising area of further research. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objective Social relations have become the focus of much research attention when studying depressive symptoms in older adults. Research indicates that social support and being embedded in a network may reduce the risk for depression. The aim of the review was to analyze the association of social relations and depression in older adults. Methods Electronic databases were searched systematically for potentially relevant articles published from January 2000 to December 2012. Thirty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. Results Factors of social relations were categorized into 12 domains. Factors regarding the qualitative aspects of social relations seem to be more consistent among studies and therefore provide more explicit results. Thus, social support, quality of relations, and presence of confidants were identified as factors of social relations significantly associated with depression. The quantitative aspects of social relations seem to be more inconsistent. Cultural differences become most obvious in terms of the quantitative aspects of social relations. Conclusion Despite the inconsistent results and the methodological limitations of the studies, this review identified a number of factors of social relations that are significantly associated with depression. The review indicates that it is needful to investigate social relations in all their complexity and not reduce them to one dimension. Simultaneously, it is important to conduct longitudinal studies because studies with cross-sectional design do not allow us to draw conclusions on causality. Beyond that, cultural differences need to be considered. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose of review: This article will summarize recent progress in research in the area of complementary feeding as it relates to childhood obesity. Newly emerged findings demonstrate how research on contributing factors has shifted. Examining nutrient and caloric intakes alone has failed to answer the critical question, 'Why are some children obese, whereas others are not?' Recent research explores parental attitudes, beliefs and parental feeding styles as contributing factors. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies examining the impact of specific macronutrients on obesity risk may have partially uncovered a link between consistently high protein intakes during infancy and an elevated obesity risk, at least until the second year of life. However, this relationship was not evident in all studies evaluated in a systematic review this year. Childhood obesity is not linked to any specific types of foods or food groups during the complementary feeding period. Adherence to dietary guidelines is associated with increased lean body mass, but not BMI or fat mass. Complementary feeding practices, socioeconomic and other family dynamics at least partially explain obesity risk. SUMMARY: As young infants are dependent on adults for nourishment, parental attitudes and beliefs about infant nutrition and actual feeding practices directly influence infant nutritional status. Early nutrition interventions to prevent obesity should take nutrition belief systems, parental feeding styles, socioeconomic and educational status, among other characteristics into consideration. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={ABSTRACT Background: This exploratory study investigated the associations of individual characteristics of both persons with dementia and family caregivers with the nutritional status of caregivers. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at home by psychogerontologist within the frame of a community gerontological center in rural areas of south west France. The study participants comprised 56 community-dwelling persons with dementia (mean 80.7 years, SD 6.5) and 56 family caregivers (mean 70.9 years, SD 11.0). Persons with dementia were assessed with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Basic Activities Of Daily Living (ADL), Instrumental ADL (IADL), and NeuroPsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and family caregivers with the Burden Interview (Zarit scale), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI Y-B), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the emotional impact measure of NPI and the Autonomy, Gerontology and Group Resources scale (AGGIR scale). For both, nutritional status was evaluated using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA®). Results: Among family caregivers, 32.1% were at risk of malnutrition and 5.4% were malnourished, and among people with dementia, 58.9% and 23.2%, respectively. NPI severity score of apathy of persons with dementia (Beta = -0.342, p = 0.001), dependency on AGGIR scale (Beta = -0.336, p = 0.002), and CES-D score of caregivers (Beta = -0.365, p = 0.001) were associated with caregivers' MNA score (Adjusted R 2 = 0.480, p &lt; 0.001).

abstract={Objectives: The objective of this follow-up study is to assess the association between different potentially modifiable nutritional risk factors; weight loss after six and 12 months and mortality.Design and setting: A one year follow-up project among Danish nursing home residents.Participants: A total of 441 nursing home resident living in 11 nursing homes.Measurements: Odds ratio was calculated and used to assess the strength of association between different potentially modifiable nutritional risk factors and nutritional status of the participants. The difference in mortality between those who died versus survivors was assessed by means of Fishers Exact Test.Results: Almost half experienced a loss of weight during the follow-up period. The nutritional risk factors significantly or borderline significantly associated with weight loss were; eating dependency, leaves 25% or more of food uneaten at most meals, chewing and swallowing problems. The prevalence of eating dependency; leaves 25% or more of food uneaten at most meals; swallowing problems and enteral nutrition were higher among those who died than among survivors.Conclusion: A high percentage of old nursing home residents suffer from weight loss and this is associated with several potentially modifiable nutritional risk factors. Increased combined efforts from all levels of care and wider ranged multidisciplinary nutritional support need to be implemented. Regular routines for assessing weight loss and the potentially modifiable nutritional risk factors cannot be stressed enough. © 2015, Serdi and Springer-Verlag France.},

abstract={Summary: It is a research priority to identify modifiable risk factors to improve the effectiveness of childhood obesity prevention strategies. Research, however, has largely overlooked the role of child temperament and personality implicated in obesogenic risk factors such as maternal feeding and body mass index (BMI) of preschoolers. A systematic review of relevant literature was conducted to investigate the associations between child temperament, child personality, maternal feeding and BMI and/or weight gain in infants and preschoolers; 18 papers were included in the review. The findings revealed an association between the temperament traits of poor self-regulation, distress to limitations, low and high soothability, low negative affectivity and higher BMI in infants and preschool-aged children. Temperament traits difficult, distress to limitations, surgency/extraversion and emotionality were significantly associated with weight gain rates in infants. The results also suggested that child temperament was associated with maternal feeding behaviours that have been shown to influence childhood overweight and obesity, such as using restrictive feeding practices with children perceived as having poor self-regulation and feeding potentially obesogenic food and drinks to infants who are more externalizing. Interestingly, no studies to date have evaluated the association between child personality and BMI/weight gain in infants and preschoolers. There is a clear need for further research into the association of child temperament and obesogenic risk factors in preschool-aged children. © 2013 International Association for the Study of Obesity.},

abstract={The stomach has distinct functions in relation to the ingestion and handling of solids and liquids. These functions include storage of the food before it is gradually emptied into the duodenum, mechanical crushing of larger food particles to increase the surface area, secretion of an acidic enzyme rich gastric juice and mixing the ingested food with the gastric juice. In addition, the stomach 'senses' the composition of the gastric content and this information is passed via the vagal nerve to the lateral hypothalamus and the limbic system, most likely as palatability signals that influence eating behaviour. Other sensory qualities related to the stimulation of gastric tension receptors are satiety and fullness. Receptors that respond to macronutrient content or gastric wall tension influence appetite and meal related hormone responses. The ingestion of food - in contrast to an infusion of nutrients into the stomach - has distinct effects on the activation of specific brain regions. Brain areas such as thalamus, amygdala, putamen and praecuneus are activated by the ingestion of food. Gastric nutrient infusion evokes greater activation in the hippocampus and anterior cingulate. The brain integrates these interrelated neural and hormonal signals arising from the stomach as well as visual, olfactory and anticipatory stimuli that ultimately influence eating and other behavioural patterns. Furthermore, there is now good evidence from experimental studies that gastric afferents influence mood, and animal studies point towards the possibility that gastric dysfunction may be a risk factor for mood disorders such as anxiety and depression. The stomach is also not only colonised by Helicobacter pylori but a large array of bacteria. While there is sufficient evidence to suggest that H. pylori may alter caloric intake and mood, the role of other gastric microbiome for the brain function is unknown. To address this appropriate targeted gastric microbiome studies would be required instead of widely utilised opportunistic stool microbiome studies. In summary, it is now well established that there are important links between the brain and the stomach that have significant effects on gastric function. However, the stomach also influences the brain. Disturbances in the crosstalk between the stomach and the brain may manifest as functional GI disorders while disturbances in the stomachebrain communication may also result in an altered regulation of satiety and as a consequence may affect eating behaviour and mood. These observations may enable the identification of novel therapies targeted at the gastroduodenum that positively alter brain function and treat or prevent conditions such as obesity or functional gastrointestinal disorders. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Parental care promotes offspring survival and, for livestock species, this care is provided solely by the mother. Maternal behaviour in the sheep has been exceptionally well-studied compared with other species and many of the underpinning biological processes leading to the expression of maternal care are known. In this review the current state of play with regard to the biology of maternal care will be reviewed, and its application to provide practical solutions to reduce lamb mortality considered. For maternal care to be elicited at birth the ewe requires elevated circulating oestradiol in late gestation, which stimulates the expression of oxytocin receptors in both peripheral and central areas (particularly the hypothalamic and limbic areas of the brain). At birth stretching of the vaginocervical canal elicits a spinal reflex which triggers the release of oxytocin primarily from neurones within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Oxytocin release causes an increase in the neurotransmitters noradrenaline, acetylcholine, glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the olfactory bulb, and other brain regions important for maternal behaviour. Finally, sensory cues provided by the lamb, in particular the amniotic fluids surrounding it, lead to the expression of maternal behaviours (licking, low-pitched bleats, acceptance of the lamb at the udder and suckling). This allows the expression of the two facets of maternal behaviour in the ewe: nurturance of the young and maternal selectivity, whereby a specific olfactory memory for the ewes own lamb is formed and the expression of maternal care is restricted to this lamb. Variation in the expression of maternal care has been demonstrated in primiparous ewes compared with multiparous, in different sheep genotypes, with undernutrition, stress in pregnancy, following a difficult delivery, and may occur with variation in ewe temperament. An understanding of the importance of the timing of various events in late pregnancy and during parturition, as well as the factors that can disrupt these events, can help to design management activities to minimise risks to the successful onset of maternal behaviour. Management practices that work with the biology of the ewe will be the most successful in ensuring that maternal care is expressed, so improving the welfare of the ewe and lamb, and the profitability of the farm.

abstract={Objective: To test whether personality traits were prospectively associated with type 2 diabetes incidence. Methods: The sample (. n=. 6798) was derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiological Follow-up Study cohort. We fit four logistic regression models to test whether neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, or the Type A behavior pattern predicted type 2 diabetes incidence. Model 1 included sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Model 2 added personality traits, Model 3 added depressive symptoms, and Model 4 added body mass index (BMI), hypertension, and cigarette smoking status as predictors. Results: In Model 1 age was associated with increased risk of diabetes (2% per year); being black as opposed to white was associated with a three-fold increase in risk. In Model 2 age and being black were still significant and extraversion was associated with decreased risk (17% per standard deviation [SD]). In Model 3 age, being black, and extraversion were still significant. In addition, neuroticism was associated with decreased risk (26% per SD) and depressive symptoms were associated with increased risk (28% per SD). In Model 4 age, being black, neuroticism, and depressive symptoms were still significant. BMI was associated with increased risk (14% per SD) and extraversion was no longer significant. Conclusions: Higher neuroticism was associated with reduced type 2 diabetes risk even after controlling for race/ethnicity, age, depressive symptoms, and BMI. Extraversion and Type A behavior were not significant after including covariates. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This review summarizes studies on eating disorders in pregnancy and the postpartum period that have been conducted as part of the broader Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Prior to the 2000s, empirical literature on eating disorders in pregnancy was sparse and consisted mostly of studies in small clinical samples. MoBa has contributed to a new era of research by making population-based and largesample research possible. To date, MoBa has led to 19 eating disorder studies on diverse questions including the prevalence, course, and risk correlates of eating disorders during pregnancy and the postpartum. The associations between eating disorder exposure and pregnancy, birth and obstetric outcomes, and maternal and offspring health and well-being, have also been areas of focus. The findings indicate that eating disorders in pregnancy are relatively common and appear to confer health risks to mother and her child related to sleep, birth outcomes, maternal nutrition, and child feeding and eating. © 2014, Norwegian Epidemiological Society.

abstract={Objectives: To validate the modified version of the Short Emergency Geriatric Assessment (SEGAm) frailty instrument in elderly people living at home.
Design: Longitudinal, prospective, multicentre study.
Setting: Four departments (Ardennes, Marne, Meurthe-et-Moselle, Meuse) in two French Regions (Champagne-Ardenne and Lorraine).
Participants: Subjects aged 65 years or more, living at home, who could read and understand French, with a degree of autonomy corresponding to groups 5, or 6 in the AGGIR autonomy evaluation scale.
Measurements: Assessment included demographic characteristics, comprehensive geriatric assessment, and the SEGAm instrument. Psychometric validation was used to study feasibility and acceptability, internal structure validity, reliability, and discriminant validity of the SEGAm instrument.
Results: Between July 1st 2012 and March 31st 2013, 167 patients were included in the study. Averaged age was 77±7 years, the majority were women (70.7%). Feasibility and acceptability of the SEGAm instrument were excellent: we observed no refusal to participate, no drop-out during administration, no missing items, no ceiling or floor effects, and the administration time was short (5.0±3.5 min). By factor analysis, the instrument proved to be unidimensional. It showed good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha coefficient: 0.68) and good test-retest (intra-class correlation: 0.88) at 7 days interval. Discriminant validity showed a significant difference, mainly for nutritional status, fall risk, dependency, mood and depression risk, and comorbidities.
Conclusion: Based on these psychometric properties, the SEGAm appears to be an easy-to-use instrument that is particularly suitable for use in the community to identify frail elderly people who could benefit from early targeted interventions. © 2014, Serdi and Springer-Verlag France.},

abstract={A healthy and active life is a key issue for elderly citizens, above all when psychological complications such as depression and anxiety disorders, late delusion or loneliness can be observed. Moreover, medical pathologies in elderly patients often have a multi-factorial etiology and many psychopathological dimensions and psychosocial risk factors are underestimated. From the perspective of clinical health psychology, psychogeriatrics could play an important role in promoting active ageing and a healthy lifestyle in elderly persons through tailored clinical approaches based on specific research and advanced professional training in this area. More research is needed in order to study which determinants affect the process of an active and functional ageing. Possible research ageing areas are: 1) evaluation of psychosocial risk-protective factors related to the individual's biography and personality. 2) Evaluation of enrichment programs and clinical protocols focused on the management of different topics such as health system areas, behavioral areas, social and physical environment areas, psychological factors and economic determinants. The goal of Psychogeriatrics endeavors to develop and evaluate interventions designed to stimulate improvement in friendship, self-esteem and subjective well-being, as well as to reduce loneliness among older citizens. 3) Evaluation of self-management programs in chronic disease conditions (such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, poor nutrition, physical inactivity, alcohol abuse and tobacco smoking), that could enhance risk factors for health in elderly citizens. Typical key elements of self-management, such as decision making, problem solving, motivation, self-efficacy, resource utilization, and citizen's empowerment have to be studied. © 2014 The authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={Objective: To investigate whether internalizing disorders are associated with quality of life (QoL) in adolescents, even after accounting for shared risk factors.
Methods: The sample comprised 102 adolescents from a community cross-sectional study with an oversampling of anxious subjects. Risk factors previously associated with QoL were assessed and divided into five blocks organized hierarchically from proximal to distal sets of risk factors.
Results: Multiple regression analysis yielded a hierarchical model accounting for 72% of QoL variance. All blocks were consistently associated with QoL (p, 0.05), accounting for the following percentages of variance: 12% for demographics; 5.2% for family environment; 37.8% for stressful events; 10% for nutritional and health habits; and 64.2% for dimensional psychopathological symptoms or 22.8% for psychiatric diagnoses (dichotomous). Although most of the QoL variance attributed to internalizing symptoms was explained by the four proximal blocks in the hierarchical model (43.2%), about 21% of the variance was independently associated with internalizing symptoms/diagnoses.
Conclusions: QoL is associated with several aspects of adolescent life that were largely predicted by our hierarchical model. Our findings reinforce the hypothesis that internalizing disorders and internalizing symptoms in adolescents have a high impact on QoL and deserve proper clinical attention. © 2014 Associação Brasileira de Psiquiatria.},

abstract={Beyond the biological risk factors of early childhood caries (ECC) is child temperament. This study aimed to investigate the relationship of ECC to different traits of child temperament, directly and indirectly through the nutritional and oral hygiene habits. Through a multi-stage sampling, 373 kindergarten children aged 18-36 months participated in this study. The primary caregivers filled in the Early Childhood Behaviour Questionnaire (ECBQ) and a checklist containing demographic data and the dietary and oral hygiene habits of the children. Children were examined for dental caries. The frequency of ECC was 41.14%. With 18 aspects of a child's temperament under consideration, attentional shifting, fear, frustration, low-intensity pleasure, sadness and shyness were significantly higher in the ECC group. Cuddliness, perceptual sensitivity, positive anticipation and soothability were significantly higher in caries-free children. Attentional shifting (p = 0.02), frustration (p = 0.02) and shyness (p = 0.03) were risk factors and cuddliness (p < 0.001) was a protecting factor for ECC. In the multiple regression model regarding nutritional and oral hygiene habits, easily soothable children were 0.69 times less likely to use sweetened liquids frequently [odds ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49-0.97, p = 0.03], while sad children were 0.58 times less likely to brush (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36-0.94, p = 0.02). Considering temperament traits along with socioeconomic status, positive anticipation was the most significant determinant of ECC (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.13-2.19, p = 0.007). However, considering temperament, socioeconomic measures and child habits among ECC risk factors, the most significant was the initiation of brushing habits (OR 5.41, 95% CI 2.81-12.98, p = 0.002). © 2013 S.

abstract={The purpose of this review is to evaluate the evidence for an association between the Big Five dimensions of personality, dietary intake, and compliance to dietary recommendations. Poor diet is a known risk factor for overweight and obesity and associated chronic lifestyle diseases and it has been proposed that personality may be linked to dietary choices. Findings from cross-sectional surveys from different countries and cultures show a positive association between Openness and consumption of fruits and vegetables and between Conscientiousness and healthy eating. Although no evidence has been found that personality dimensions are associated with adherence to dietary recommendations over time, Conscientiousness is associated with a number of prosocial and health-promoting behaviors that include avoiding alcohol-related harm, binge-drinking, and smoking, and adherence to medication regimens. With emerging evidence of an association between higher Conscientiousness and lower obesity risk, the hypothesis that higher Conscientiousness may predict adoption of healthy dietary and other lifestyle recommendations appears to be supported. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Measurements: Data regarding various aspects of undernutrition including socio-demographic aspect, disease characterisitics, nutritional status, appetite and overall-physical and psychological functioning were collected. Results: Undernutrition was diagnosed in 2.0% and 20.5% of the patients were categorized as being at risk of undernutrition. Care dependency and appetite were the two risk factors with the highest predictive value for an unfavorable nutritional status. Conclusion: Of Dutch elderly patients with Parkinson's Disease 22.5% had an unfavourable nutritional status. Dependency and appetite were the two risk factors with the highest predictive value fort his outcome. Because undernutrition can be regarded as a geriatric syndrome a comprehensive nutritional assessment should be done followed by nutritional interventions next to interventions focused on the risk factors.

abstract={The article aims to study mother-child and father-child interactions with 24-month-old children during feeding, considering the possible influence of time spent by the parent with the child, the infantile temperament, and the parental psychological profile. The families were recruited from 12 preschools in Italy (N = 77 families). Through an observation of the feeding [Scala di Valutazione dell'Interazione Alimentare (SVIA - Feeding Scale; I. Chatoor et al., 1997; L. Lucarelli et al., 2002)], self-reporting [Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R; L.R. Derogatis, 1994), and report-form questionnaires [Italian Questionnaires on Temperament (QUIT; G. Axia, 2002)], and information provided by the parents about the amount of time spent with their children, results showed that the overall quality of father-child interactions during feeding is lower than that of mother-child interactions. Fathers showed higher psychological symptoms than did mothers. No associations were found between the fathers' psychopathological risk and the quality of interactions with their children during feeding. Mothers' psychopathological risks predicted less contingent exchanges interactions with their children during feeding. Children's temperaments significantly influence mother-child interactions, but no association exists between maternal involvement and the quality of interactions with their children. Paternal involvement predicts a better quality of father-infant interactions when associated with a child's higher scores on Social Orientation. The quality of parents' interactions with their children during feeding are impacted by different issues originating from the parent's psychological profile, the degree of involvement, and from the child's temperament. © 2014 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.},

abstract={Background: Many US women fall short of meeting the recommendations on breastfeeding. Whereas prenatal demographic factors have been well researched in relation to breastfeeding, psychosocial maternal characteristics are less understood but could be important predictors of breastfeeding initiation and duration.
Objective: This study examined primiparous maternal psychosocial characteristics and temperamentally based negative infant affect as predictors of breastfeeding initiation and duration while accounting for depression and sociodemographic covariates.
Methods: Prenatally, 237 primiparous women were administered the Adult Attachment Interview and completed a measure of beliefs related to infant crying. At 6 months postpartum, negative infant affect was assessed via mother report. Breastfeeding was assessed at 6 months and 1 year postpartum via mother report.
Results: Results indicated that younger, low income, less educated, single, ethnic minority mothers and mothers with elevated depressive symptoms were less likely to initiate breastfeeding and breastfed for a shorter period than other women. Women who initiated breastfeeding tended to have higher adult attachment coherence scores (more secure attachment) than those who did not initiate breastfeeding (median score of 6.00 vs 4.00). An interaction was observed etween negative infant affect and beliefs about crying related to spoiling, such that earlier cessation of breastfeeding was observed among mothers who reported high levels of negative infant affect and strongly endorsed the belief that responding to cries spoils infants (hazard ratio = 1.71, P <.01) .
Conclusion: Although these psychosocial variables predicted relatively little variation in breastfeeding over and above covariates, the results suggest some novel approaches to promote breastfeeding. © The Author(s) 2014.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: A higher frequency of family meals is associated with good dietary habits in young people. This study focused on the relationships of family meal frequency with food neophobia and personality traits in adolescents. SUBJECTS/METHOD: For this purpose, we administered a survey to 495 middle school students in Seoul metropolitan city, after which the data were analyzed using the SPSS (18.0) program. Pearson correlation was used to determine the relationships among dietary habits, personality traits, and food neophobia according to frequency of family meals. RESULTS: Dietary habits, personality traits, and food neophobia all showed significant differences according to the frequency of family meals. Further, eating regular family meals was associated with good dietary habits (P < 0.001) and was linked with improved extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness/intellect (P < 0.001). On the other hand, it showed a negative relationship with food neophobia (P < 0.001). The relationship between dietary habits and food neophobia showed a negative correlation (P < 0.01). The relationship between dietary habits and personality traits showed a positive correlation (P < 0.01). Lastly, the relationship between personality traits and food neophobia showed a negative correlation (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Based on the results of the study, the frequency of family meals affects dietary habits, personality traits, and food neophobia in adolescents. © 2014 The Korean Nutrition Society and the Korean Society of Community Nutrition.},

abstract={Case description: "The Most Dangerous Woman in American" is Paula Deen who was described in these terms by one of her fellow chefs on the Food Network. Ms. Deen was originally criticized for the unhealthy ingredients which she featured in her recipes, but the criticism increased when she announced that she had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. In fact, Ms. Deen had amassed considerable wealth with her unhealthy recipes and was viewed by some as promoting an unhealthy lifestyle. Since obesity is a risk factor for diabetes, she was accused of hypocrisy in that she continued in her usual mode three years after her diagnosis. She added insult to injury by timing her announcement of her diagnosis to coincide with her affiliation with a new diabetes drug. She became the target of criticism for allegedly promoting the kind of food that is a risk factor for diabetes and then capitalizing on a drug endorsement for the treatment. The case provides a forum for discussion of the ethics of a decision that was personal but had business consequences. The issues of how to move past this crisis has an ethical dimension as well. This case has a level four difficulty. Seniors in Strategic Management courses are encouraged to consider the ethical aspects of decisions. This case allows both analysis in hindsight of what might or should have been done and requires decisions about how to maintain brand loyalty going forward.This case is designed to be taught in a 50- minute class and is expected to require about an hour of outside preparation by students. Case synopsis: However, that food is not the only cause and that people may not eat something just because they see it prepared on television. Deen Enterprises' On January 17, 2012, Paula Deen, famous for high calorie Southern cooking, went public with what amounted to an open secret: She had been diagnosed three years earlier with Type 2 Diabetes. During that three year period, she had continued to promote the type of foods that most people view as causing or at least contributing to diabetes. It appeared that people were lining up to sneer at her, to question her judgment, and her ethics. There is an often quoted test for judging the ethics of a decision: Imagine yourself explaining your decision on TV. The popular Food Network chef found herself in this situation as she explained her decision to keep her diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes a secret for three years. She timed her announcement to coincide with the announcement of her endorsement and contractwith a diabetes drug.While diet is a risk factor for diabetes, it is far from the only risk factor. Otherfactors include age, activity level, and family history. Diabetes is a serious disease and can lead to other conditions which are life-threating. Approximately 23 million Americans have the condition and because early symptoms are mild or nonexistent may not be aware of it. Students should realize, holdings and interests go well beyond food and are estimated to be worth approximately $10 million annually. The case requires students to review the ethical and financial implications of her decision. What is the responsibility of a personality such as Paula Deen to her fans? How should this responsibility affect her business decisions in the future? What steps should be taken to control damage to the Paula Deen brand?.},

abstract={Animals need to manage the combined risks of predation and starvation in order to survive. Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that individuals can reduce predation risk by delaying feeding (and hence fat storage) until late afternoon. However, little is known about how individuals manage the opposing pressures of resource uncertainty and predation risks. We suggest that individuals should follow a two-part strategy: prioritizing the discovery of food early in the day and exploiting the best patch late in the day. Using automated data loggers, we tested whether a temporal component exists in the discovery of novel foraging locations by individuals in a mixed-species foraging guild. We found that food deployed in the morning was discovered significantly more often than food deployed in the afternoon. Based on the diurnal activity patterns in this population, overall rates of new arrivals were also significantly higher than expected in the morning and significantly lower than expected in the afternoon. These results align with our predictions of a shift from patch discovery to exploitation over the course of the day. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

abstract={Some laboratory mice gnaw food pellets without ingesting much of the gnawed material, resulting in the production of waste material called 'orts'. The fact that this food grinding behavior is not seen in all individuals of a particular strain suggests that it might be abnormal, and thus indicate a welfare concern. Furthermore, the increased rate of feed consumption and cage soiling is undesirable from a husbandry perspective. To try to determine possible motivations for the behavior, and identify potential treatments, outbred Crl:CD1(Icr) mice exhibiting food grinding were selected for one of three treatments placed in the feeder: no enrichment, a chewing device, or sunflower seeds. Both enrichment groups showed a significant decrease (P<0.05) in ort production when compared with baseline measurements, but only mice provided with sunflower seeds maintained the decreased rate of food wastage after the treatment was withdrawn. A relationship between body weight and ort production was also found, in that cages with greater average body weights had lower levels of ort production. This suggests that a simple need to gnaw cannot alone explain food grinding, and that a nutritional motivation may also be involved. © The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract={Prey can invest in a variety of defensive traits when balancing risk of predation against that of starvation. What remains unknown is the relative costs of different defensive traits and how prey reconcile investment into these traits when energetically limited. We tested the simple allocation model of prey defense, which predicts an additive effect of increasing predation risk and resource availability, resulting in the full deployment of defensive traits under conditions of high risk and resource saturation. We collected morphometric, developmental, and behavioural data in an experiment using dragonfly larvae (predator) and Northern leopard frog tadpoles (prey) subject to variable levels of food availability and predation risk. Larvae exposed to food restriction showed limited response to predation risk; larvae at food saturation altered behaviour, development, and growth in response to predation risk. Responses to risk varied through time, suggesting ontogeny may affect the deployment of particular defensive traits. The observed negative correlation between body size and activity level for food-restricted prey - and the absence of a similar response among adequately-fed prey - suggests that a trade-off exists between behavioural and growth responses when energy budgets are limited. Our research is the first to demonstrate how investment into these defensive traits is mediated along gradients of both predation risk and resource availability over time. The interactions we demonstrate between resource availability and risk level on deployment of inducible defenses provide evidence that both internal condition and extrinsic risk factors play a critical role in the production of inducible defenses over time.

abstract={Food availability in nature is often irregular, and famine is commonplace. Increased motivation to engage in ingestive behaviors increases the chance of survival, providing additional potential opportunities for reproduction. Because of the advantages conferred by entraining ingestive behavior to environmental conditions, neuroendocrine mechanisms regulating the motivation to acquire and ingest food have evolved to be responsive to exogenous (i.e., food stored for future consumption) and endogenous (i.e., body fat stores) fuel availability. Motivated behaviors like eating occur in two phases. The appetitive phase brings animals into contact with food (e.g., foraging, food hoarding), and the more reflexive consummatory phase results in ingestion (e.g., chewing, swallowing). Quantifiable appetitive behaviors are part of the natural ingestive behavioral repertoire of species such as hamsters and humans. This review summarizes current knowledge about neuroendocrine regulators of ingestive behavior, with an emphasis appetitive behavior. We will discuss hormonal regulators of appetitive ingestive behaviors, including the orexigenic hormone ghrelin, which potently stimulates foraging and food hoarding in Siberian hamsters. This section includes a discussion of the hormone leptin, its relation to endogenous fat stores, and its role in food deprivation-induced increases in appetitive ingestive behaviors. Next, we discuss how hormonal regulators interact with neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of ingestive behaviors, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related protein (AgRP) and α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), to regulate ingestive behavior. Finally, we discuss the potential impact that perinatal nutrient availability can have on the neuroendocrine regulation of ingestive behavior. Understanding the hormonal mechanisms that connect metabolic fuel availability to central appetite regulatory circuits should provide a better understanding of the neuroendocrine regulation of the motivation to engage in ingestive behavior. © 2013 Keen-Rhinehart, Ondek and Schneider.},

abstract={Background: Escalating weight gain among the Malaysian paediatric population necessitates identifying modifiable behaviours in the obesity pathway. Objectives: This study describes the adaptation and validation of the Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ) as a self-report for adolescents, investigates gender and ethnic differences in eating behaviour and examines associations between eating behaviour and body mass index (BMI) z-scores among multi-ethnic Malaysian adolescents. Methodology: This two-phase study involved validation of the Malay self-reported CEBQ in Phase 1 (n = 362). Principal Axis Factoring with Promax rotation, confirmatory factor analysis and reliability tests were performed. In Phase 2, adolescents completed the questionnaire (n = 646). Weight and height were measured. Gender and ethnic differences in eating behaviour were investigated. Associations between eating behaviour and BMI z-scores were examined with complex samples general linear model (GLM) analyses, adjusted for gender, ethnicity and maternal educational level. Results: Exploratory factor analysis revealed a 35-item, 9-factor structure with 'food fussiness' scale split into two. In confirmatory factor analysis, a 30-item, 8-factor structure yielded an improved model fit. Reliability estimates of the eight factors were acceptable. Eating behaviours did not differ between genders. Malay adolescents reported higher Food Responsiveness, Enjoyment of Food, Emotional Overeating, Slowness in Eating, Emotional Undereating and Food Fussiness 1 scores (p<0.05) compared to Chinese and Indians. A significant negative association was observed between BMI z-scores and Food Fussiness 1 ('dislike towards food') when adjusted for confounders. Conclusion: Although CEBQ is a valuable psychometric instrument, adjustments were required due to age and cultural differences in our sample. With the self-report, our findings present that gender, ethnic and weight status influenced eating behaviours. Obese adolescents were found to display a lack of dislike towards food. Future longitudinal and qualitative studies are warranted to further understand behavioural phenotypes of obesity to guide prevention and intervention strategies. © 2013 Loh et al.},

abstract={We investigated the effects of rikkunshito (RKT), a ghrelin signal enhancer, on the decrease in food intake after exposure to novelty stress in mice. RKT administration (500 mg/kg, per os) improved the decrease in 6 h cumulative food intake. In control mice, the plasma acylated ghrelin levels significantly increased by 24 h fasting. In contrast, the acylated ghrelin levels did not increase by fasting in mice exposed to the novelty stress. RKT administration to the novelty stress mice showed a significant increase in the acylated ghrelin levels compared with that in the distilled-water-treated control mice. Food intake after administering serotonin 2B (5-HT receptor antagonists was evaluated to clarify the role of 5-HTreceptor activation in the decrease in feeding behavior after novelty stress. SB215505 and SB204741, 5-HTreceptor antagonists, significantly improved the decrease in food intake after exposure to novelty stress. A component of RKT, isoliquiritigenin, prevented the decrease in 6 h cumulative food intake. Isoliquiritigenin showed 5-HTreceptor antagonistic activity in vitro. In conclusion, the results suggested that RKT improves the decrease in food intake after novelty stress probably via 5-HTreceptor antagonism of isoliquiritigenin contained in RKT. © 2013 Chihiro Yamada et al.},

abstract={In theory, habitat preferences should be adaptive. Accordingly, fitness is often assumed to be greater in preferred habitats; however, this assumption is rarely tested and, when it is, the results are often equivocal. Habitat preferences may not directly convey fitness advantages if animals are constrained by tradeoffs with other selective pressures like predation or food availability. We address unresolved questions about the survival consequences of habitat choices made during brood-rearing in a precocial species with exclusive maternal care (mallard Anas platyrhynchos, n = 582 radio-marked females on 27 sites over 8 years). We directly linked duckling survival with habitat selection patterns at two spatial scales using logistic regression and model selection techniques. At the landscape scale (55-80 km2), females that demonstrated stronger selection of areas with more cover type 4 wetlands and greater total cover type 3 wetland area (wetlands with large expanses of open water surrounded by either a narrow or wide peripheral band of vegetation, respectively) had lower duckling survival rates than did females that demonstrated weaker selection of these habitats. At finer scales (0.32-7.16 km2), females selected brood-rearing areas with a greater proportion of wetland habitat with no consequences for duckling survival. However, females that avoided woody perennial habitats composed of trees and shrubs fledged more ducklings. The relationship between habitat selection and survival depended on both spatial scale and habitats considered. Females did not consistently select brood-rearing habitats that conferred the greatest benefits, an unexpected finding, although one that has also been reported in other recent studies of breeding birds. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Molecular imaging studies with positron emission tomography have revealed that the availability of serotonin transporter (5-HTT) in the human brain fluctuates over the course of the year. This effect is most pronounced in carriers of the short allele of the 5-HTT promoter region (5-HTTLPR), which has in several previous studies been linked to an increased risk to develop mood disorders. We argue that long-lasting fluctuations in the cerebral serotonin transmission, which is regulated via the 5-HTT, are responsible for mediating responses to environmental changes based on an assessment of the expected "safety" of the environment; this response is obtained in part through serotonergic modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. We posit that the intermediate phenotype of the s-allele may properly be understood as mediating a trade-off, wherein increased responsiveness of cerebral serotonin transmission to seasonal and other forms of environmental change imparts greater behavioral flexibility, at the expense of increased vulnerability to stress. This model may explain the somewhat higher prevalence of the s-allele in some human populations dwelling at geographic latitudes with pronounced seasonal climatic changes, while this hypothesis does not rule out that genetic drift plays an additional or even exclusive role. We argue that s-allele manifests as an intermediate phenotype in terms of an increased responsiveness of the 5-HTT expression to number of daylight hours, which may serve as a stable surrogate marker of other environmental factors, such as availability of food and safety of the environment in populations that live closer to the geographic poles. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In social mammals, within-group competition for food can drive variation in female fitness. Frugivores may face particularly strong competition because they use patchily distributed usurpable resources. Dominance rank and group size influence how a female experiences within-group competition. Both are predicted to affect access to food and, thus, reproductive success. We used 15 years of behavioral, demographic, and reproductive data from wild frugivorous blue monkeys to examine effects of rank and group size on the probability that a female conceived. We used generalized linear mixed models, controlling for potentially confounding maternal and environmental factors. Blue monkey females compete aggressively and disproportionately for fruits and exhibit linear dominance hierarchies, but neither rank index we tested significantly predicted the probability of conception. Although earlier studies found that group size effects on activity budgets were minimal, we found that group size had a quadratic relationship with the probability of conception, which peaked at around 31 members. The lack of a rank effect may reflect behavioral strategies (e.g., switching resources, spreading out during feeding, using cheek pouches) that minimize the strength of within-group competition, thus facilitating group-level cooperation in between-group contests. The significant quadratic effect of group size on reproduction may occur if individuals in small groups do not obtain the full benefits of group living (e.g., predator avoidance, increased foraging success, communal care for offspring) and those in large groups experience a lower quality diet or constrained feeding time. Ultimately, measures of reproduction are preferable to behavioral proxies for accurately assessing within-group competition. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Carbon dioxide (CO2) thermal lasers have previously been validated for the assessment of nociception in cats. This experiment sought to assess the potential impact of factors associated with age, sex, body weight and sterilisation upon nociceptive threshold as measured by latency to display a behavioural response. Cats (N=113) were exposed to a CO2 thermal laser three times during a 45-60min test period depending upon the interval between tests. A minimum of 15min elapsed between consecutive tests on any one individual. Time to display either a skin twitch or withdrawal was measured. Intra-class correlations showed the three measurements to be repeatable across tests for any given cat (ICC=0.482; P&lt;0.001). Males had a significantly longer mean latency to respond than females (14.83s and 12.59s respectively; P=0.028). Analyses of co-variance established that the body weight of females significantly affected response threshold (P=0.013) but for males this effect was marginal (P=0.058). All other factors included in the analyses were non-significant. A post hoc t-test for males and females with overlapping body weights found no significant differences between the sexes (P=0.721). The precise reason for the effect of body weight on latency to respond is unknown and further exploration is needed particularly as it relates to sub-cutaneous fat deposition and skin temperature. It is concluded that, for cats, the body weight of the subject should be standardised or included in any analyses for assessment of nociception. Inclusion of body weight data in analyses may also prove useful when using a CO2 laser protocol in other species. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Methyl donor deficiencies and chronic stress cause depression independently, but their interaction has never been thoroughly evaluated. In our study, methyl donor deficient diet and chronic stress condition consisted respectively of a B2, B9, B12, and choline-free diet and a chronic mild stress procedure. Rats were randomly assigned to six groups with three "diet" conditions (free-feeding, pair-fed and methyl donor deficient diet) and two "stress" conditions (no-stress and stress) and were evaluated in the open-field, the elevated plus-maze and the forced swimming test. After the behavioral evaluation, corticosterone and homocysteine plasma levels were measured and dopamine, DOPAC, serotonin, 5HIAA concentrations were evaluated in several brain areas. Rats given a methyl donor deficient diet for 11 weeks causing elevated plasma homocysteine levels were compared to pair-fed and free-feeding rats with or without unpredictable chronic mild stress. Regardless of stress environmental conditions, the methyl donor deficient diet decreased plasma corticosterone levels and caused disinhibition in the elevated plus-maze condition relative to both control groups. However, stress potentiated the effects of the deficient regimen on rearing in the open-field and climbing in the forced swim test. The dietary changes involved in behavior and plasma corticosterone could be caused by homocysteine-induced decreases in dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine metabolites in selective brain regions and it can be noted that regardless of stress-conditions, methyl donor deficient diet decreases DOPAC/dopamine and 5HIAA/serotonin ratios in striatum and hypothalamus and selectively 5HIAA/serotonin ratio in the sensorimotor cortex. Our experimental data is particularly relevant in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders frequently associated with folate deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={High mortality in rearing of domestic rabbits is not only an economic problem but also an animal welfare issue. Among the reasons for this high mortality are some common rearing practices. In this review, we point out several commonly used management practices, which neither represent adequate housing conditions according to the animals' behavioural requirements nor correspond to their nutritional needs. Sometimes, the doe has to build the nursery nest on the cage floor or in a box with a permanently open entrance, often not protected from the light. This can lead to perinatal mortality due to disturbed behaviour of the mother such as failure to build a proper nest, depositing the kits outside the nest, or infanticide. Furthermore, continuous housing of the doe with the kits does not conform to this species' pattern of unusually limited maternal care. Possibly stimulated by olfactory and acoustic signals emanating from the nest, the doe can disturb the inactivity of the kits by her frequent entries to the nest or attempts to close the entrance. Cooling of the kits caused by maladaptive maternal behaviour under such conditions can also contribute to increased mortality and morbidity during the nursing period. In addition, when the doe is left to nurse the kits longer than four weeks, which does not conform to the reproductive biology of the rabbit, kit morbidity can be increased by the following factors. Although the doe's milk has a high protective role against main digestive disorders, prolonged mother-offspring contact might increase the risk of the kits becoming infected with pathogens such as coccidiosis, EPEC and pasteurellosis persisting in the doe. Pre-disposition of the kits to bacterial enteropathies can be encouraged by the delayed development of the enzymatic system, the delayed establishment of a stable gut flora, as well as by consumption of the doe's feed. The increased energy demands of lactation as well as mastitis incidence due to prolonged suckling by the kits could decrease the fertility and the lifespan of the doe. Feed with a high content of non-fibre carbohydrates (compared to green forage) can promote bacterial enteropathies when given before the development of the kits' digestive functions is completed. The risk of the outbreak of such diseases is enhanced by intestinal coccidiosis and unstable gut flora. Enteropathies are also exacerbated by the use of deep litter as opposed to housing rabbits on perforated floors. © WRSA, UPV, 2003.},

abstract={This article proposes that a recent shift in our understanding of dopamine function may support translational research to target deficits in positive emotions and reward processing in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). We review how dopamine functions to modulate approach behaviors in response to positive incentives, and we describe the incentive salience hypothesis, which posits that dopamine primarily modulates wanting, or anticipatory reward, rather than liking, or subjective pleasure. Although the incentive salience hypothesis was first proposed to help explain how drugs of abuse may reinforce harmful behaviors in the absence of continued pleasure or liking, it may also provide a basis for understanding and developing new treatment approaches for MDD. Specifically, it provides a rationale for combining behaviorally activating psychotherapies and pro-dopaminergic agents to target impaired reward processing in MDD.

abstract={The complex mixture of phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables provides protective health benefits, mainly through additive and/or synergistic effects. The presence of several bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols and caffeine, implicates coffee as a potential nutritional therapeutic in aging. Moderate (three to five cups a day) coffee consumption in humans is associated with a significant decrease in the risk of developing certain chronic diseases. However, the ability of coffee supplementation to improve cognitive function in aged individuals and the effect of the individual components in coffee, such as caffeine, have not been fully evaluated. We fed aged rats (19 months) one of five coffeesupplementeddiets (0, 0.165, 0.275, 0.55, and 0.825 % of the diet) for 8 weeks prior to motor and cognitive behavior assessment. Aged rats supplemented with a 0.55 % coffee diet, equivalent to ten cups of coffee, performed better in psychomotor testing (rotarod) and in a working memory task (Morris water maze) compared to aged rats fed a control diet. A diet with 0.55 % coffee appeared to be optimal. The 0.165 % coffeesupplemented group (three cups) showed some improvement in reference memory performance in the Morris water maze. In a subsequent study, the effects of caffeine alone did not account for the performance improvements, showing that the neuroprotective benefits of coffee are not due to caffeine alone, but rather to other bioactive compounds in coffee. Therefore, coffee, in achievable amounts, may reduce both motor and cognitive deficits in aging. © American Aging Association (outside the USA) 2013.},

abstract={The maternal nutritional status during pregnancy and lactation influences the risk of obesity in offspring, but the details of this phenomenon are unclear. In particular, there is little information on the influence on the offspring of the maternal nutritional status during lactation only. Therefore, in this study, we examined the influence of high dietary fat intake in dams during lactation on the risk of obesity in offspring, using C57BL/6J mice. The mice were fed a control diet (CD) during pregnancy. After birth, dams were fed a CD or a high-fat diet (HD) during lactation (3 wk). Fat and energy were significantly increased in milk from dams fed a HD during lactation. Male offspring were weaned at 3 wk old and fed a CD for 4 wk, which resulted in no significant difference in their physique. Four weeks after weaning, the offspring (7 wk old) were fed a CD or HD for 4 wk to induce obesity. High dietary fat intake in dams and offspring promoted lipid accumulation in white adipose tissue and adipocyte hypertrophy in male offspring. The underlying mechanism may involve an increase in expression of Lpl and a decrease in expression of Hsl in white adipose tissue of offspring. In conclusion, our results show that high dietary fat intake during lactation promotes development of diet-induced obesity in male offspring.},

abstract={The choice of small immediate rewards as opposed to larger delayed rewards, or delay discounting, is an important dimension of impulsive decision making. The inability to delay gratification is related to obesity, as well as other maladaptive behaviors such as substance abuse, problem drinking, smoking, pathological gambling, and risky HIV behaviors. One way to reduce delay discounting (DD) may be to use prospective imagery in the form of episodic future thinking (EFT) during inter-temporal decision making. We have recently shown that EFT reduces DD and ad libitum energy intake in obese individuals. However, no studies have examined whether the magnitude of the EFT effect differs between lean and overweight/obese individuals. We conducted a within-subject design experiment to compare the efficacy of EFT versus a control task in reducing DD between lean ( N= 24) and overweight/obese ( N= 24) women. Participants attended two sessions in which they engaged in either EFT or control episodic thinking during a DD task. We also examined whether individual differences such as trait time perspective, behavioral inhibition or behavioral activation moderated the EFT effect on DD. Results showed EFT reduced DD similarly for lean and overweight/obese individuals. The EFT effect was moderated by behavioral activation. This suggests EFT is just as effective in reducing impulsive decision making in obese individuals as it is in lean individuals and may be useful in reducing other impulsive obesity related behaviors. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Common obesity is widely regarded as a complex, multifactorial trait influenced by the 'obesogenic' environment, sedentary behavior, and genetic susceptibility contributed by common and rare genetic variants. This review describes the recent advances in understanding the role of genetics in obesity. RECENT FINDINGS: New susceptibility loci and genetic variants are being uncovered, but the collective effect is relatively small and could not explain most of the BMI heritability. Yet-to-be identified common and rare variants, epistasis, and heritable epigenetic changes may account for part of the 'missing heritability'. Evidence is emerging about the role of epigenetics in determining obesity susceptibility, mediating developmental plasticity, which confers obesity risk from early life experiences. Genetic prediction scores derived from selected genetic variants, and also differential DNA methylation levels and methylation scores, have been shown to correlate with measures of obesity and response to weight loss intervention. Genetic variants, which confer susceptibility to obesity-related morbidities like nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, were also discovered recently. SUMMARY: We can expect discovery of more rare genetic variants with the advent of whole exome and genome sequencing, and also greater understanding of epigenetic mechanisms by which environment influences genetic expression and which mediate the gene-environment interaction.

Despite the fact that a huge body of research has carefully examined the possible risk factors associated with the eating disorders, they have failed not only to uncover the exact etiology of eating disorders, but also to understand the interaction between different causes of eating disorders. This failure may be due complexities of eating disorders, limitations of the studies or combination of two factors.

abstract={Objective. To assess the interaction of parent and child characteristics with feeding practices and mealtime functioning. Design. Longitudinal, predictive study comparing baseline characteristics with follow-up assessments. Participants. The caregivers of 52 persistently obese youth and 32 nonoverweight comparison youth completed measurements of child temperament, parental feeding practices, parenting styles, and interactions during mealtimes. Results. Adolescents with persistent obesity were significantly more likely to be parented using problematic feeding practices when parents also reported difficult child temperaments. Additionally, adolescents with persistent obesity and difficult temperaments were significantly more likely to have lower levels of positive mealtime interactions. Conclusion. Persistently obese youth are at increased risk for problematic parental feeding practices and mealtime functioning, particularly when youth are described as having difficult temperaments. These results indicate that further investigations are needed to better understand the mechanisms linking parent and child characteristics with health-related behaviors for adolescents with obesity. © The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract={Background: Short lived, iteroparous animals in seasonal environments experience variable social and environmental conditions over their lifetime. Animals can be divided into those with a " young-of-the-year" life history (YY, reproducing and dying in the summer of birth) and an " overwinter" life history (OW, overwintering in a subadult state before reproducing next spring).We investigated how behavioural patterns across the population were affected by season and sex, and whether variation in behaviour reflects the variation in life history patterns of each season. Applications of pace-of-life (POL) theory would suggest that long-lived OW animals are shyer in order to increase survival, and YY are bolder in order to increase reproduction. Therefore, we expected that in winter and spring samples, when only OW can be sampled, the animals should be shyer than in summer and autumn, when both OW and YY animals can be sampled.We studied common vole (Microtus arvalis) populations, which express typical, intra-annual density fluctuation. We captured a total of 492 voles at different months over 3 years and examined boldness and activity level with two standardised behavioural experiments. Results: Behavioural variables of the two tests were correlated with each other. Boldness, measured as short latencies in both tests, was extremely high in spring compared to other seasons. Activity level was highest in spring and summer, and higher in males than in females.Conclusion: Being bold in laboratory tests may translate into higher risk-taking in nature by being more mobile while seeking out partners or valuable territories. Possible explanations include asset-protection, with OW animals being rather old with low residual reproductive value in spring. Therefore, OW may take higher risks during this season. Offspring born in spring encounter a lower population density and may have higher reproductive value than offspring of later cohorts. A constant connection between life history and animal personality, as suggested by the POL theory, however, was not found. Nevertheless, correlations of traits suggest the existence of animal personalities. In conclusion, complex patterns of population dynamics, seasonal variation in life histories, and variability of behaviour due to asset-protection may cause complex seasonal behavioural dynamics in a population. © 2013 Eccard and Herde; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Food limitation early in life may be compensated for by developmental plasticity resulting in accelerated development enhancing survival at the expense of small adult body size. However and especially for females in nonmatching maternal and offspring environments, being smaller than the standard may incur considerable intra- and transgenerational costs. Methodology/ Principal Findings: Here, we evaluated the costs of small female body size induced by food limitation early in life in the sexually size-dimorphic predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis. Females are larger than males. These predators are adapted to exploit ephemeral spider mite prey patches. The intra- and trans-generational effects of small maternal body size manifested in lower maternal survival probabilities, decreased attractiveness for males, and a reduced number and size of eggs compared to standard-sized females. The trans-generational effects of small maternal body size were sex-specific with small mothers producing small daughters but standard-sized sons. Conclusions/Significance: Small female body size apparently intensified the well-known costs of sexual activity because mortality of small but not standard-sized females mainly occurred shortly after mating. The disadvantages of small females in mating and egg production may be generally explained by size-associated morphological and physiological constraints. Additionally, size-assortative mate preferences of standard-sized mates may have rendered small females disproportionally unattractive mating partners. We argue that the sex-specific trans-generational effects were due to sexual size dimorphism - females are the larger sex and thus more strongly affected by maternal stress than the smaller males - and to sexually selected lower plasticity of male body size. © 2013 Walzer, Schausberger.},

abstract={Relations between the human and hi-tech worlds, even until recently considered the subject of science fiction, are taking a more real shape and becoming the focus of expert discussions. Some specialists suggest that in the future machines can become the principal creator of new technologies and race far ahead of humanity. However, emerging technologies for human enhancement offer new possibilities for humans to remain competitive against machines and to acquire more advanced physical and mental capacities. These techniques are interdisciplinary, drawing primarily on advances in medicine, pharmacology, nutrition, mobile communications, neuroscience and cognitive sciences. This paper provides examples of such developments, analyzes their contribution to the expansion of human capabilities and, consequently, implications for the future working environment. It addresses ethical issues and risks associated with human enhancement technologies, in particular, the emergence of the new social divide - between the users of such technologies and people lacking access to them. Finally, it discusses some wild cards that may cause future surprises and shocks, i.e. machines that can control a human-excluded world, a virtual level of human life that dominates real life. The author notes that such conditions will require rethinking established views of personality, human responsibility and mutual obligations that will help the establishment of new behavioral patterns.},

abstract={Background: Treatment resistance is an omnipresent frustration in eating disorders. Attempts to identify the features of this resistance and subsequently develop novel treatments have had modest effects. This selective review examines treatment resistant features expressed in core eating disorder psychopathology, comorbidities and biological features. Novel treatments addressing resistance are discussed.Description: The core eating disorder psychopathology of anorexia nervosa becomes a coping mechanism likely via vulnerable neurobiological features and conditioned learning to deal with life events. Thus it is reinforcing and ego syntonic resulting in resistance to treatment. The severity of core features such as preoccupations with body image, weight, eating and exercising predicts greater resistance to treatment. Bulimia nervosa patients are less resistant to treatment with treatment failure related to greater body image concerns, impulsivity, depression, severe diet restriction and poor social adjustment. For those with binge eating disorder overweight in childhood and high emotional eating predicts treatment resistance. There is suggestive data that a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder and severe perfectionism may confer treatment resistance in anorexia nervosa and substance use disorders or personality disorders with impulse control problems may produce resistance to treatment in bulimia nervosa. Traits such as perfectionism, cognitive inflexibility and negative affect with likely genetic influences may also affect treatment resistance. Pharmacotherapy and novel therapies have been developed to address treatment resistance. Atypical antipsychotic drugs have shown some effect in treatment resistant anorexia nervosa and topiramate and high doses of SSRIs are helpful for treatment of resistant binge eating disorder patients. There are insufficient randomized controlled trials to evaluate the novel psychotherapies which are primarily based on the core psychopathological features of the eating disorders.Conclusion: Treatment resistance in eating disorders is usually predicted by the severity of the core eating disorder psychopathology which develops from an interaction between environmental risk factors with genetic traits and a vulnerable neurobiology. Future investigations of the biological features and neurocircuitry of the core eating disorders psychopathology and behaviors may provide information for more successful treatment interventions. © 2013 Halmi; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Introduction: Research has shown that eating disorder (ED) patients who abuse substances demonstrate worse ED symptomatology and poorer outcomes than those with EDs alone, including increased general medical complications and psychopathology, longer recovery times, poorer functional outcomes and higher relapse rates. This article provides a broad overview of the prevalence, aetiology, assessment and management of co-morbid EDs and substance use disorders (SUDs).Review: The co-occurrence of EDs and SUDs is high. The functional relationship between EDs and SUDs vary within and across ED subtypes, depends on the class of substance, and needs to be carefully assessed for each patient. Substances such as caffeine, tobacco, insulin, thyroid medications, stimulants or over the counter medications (laxatives, diuretics) may be used to aid weight loss and/or provide energy, and alcohol or psychoactive substances could be used for emotional regulation or as part of a pattern of impulsive behaviour. A key message conveyed in the current literature is the importance of screening and assessment for co-morbid SUDs and EDs in patients presenting with either disorder. There is a paucity of treatment studies on the management of co-occurring EDs and SUDs. Overall, the literature indicates that the ED and SUD should be addressed simultaneously using a multi-disciplinary approach. The need for medical stabilization, hospitalization or inpatient treatment needs to be assessed based on general medical and psychiatric considerations. Common features across therapeutic interventions include psycho-education about the aetiological commonalities, risks and sequelae of concurrent ED behaviours and substance abuse, dietary education and planning, cognitive challenging of eating disordered attitudes and beliefs, building of skills and coping mechanisms, addressing obstacles to improvement and the prevention of relapse. Emphasis should be placed on building a collaborative therapeutic relationship and avoiding power struggles. Cognitive behavioural therapy has been frequently used in the treatment of co-morbid EDs and SUDs, however there are no randomized controlled trials. More recently evidence has been found for the efficacy of dialectical behavioural therapy in reducing both ED and substance use behaviours.Conclusion: Future research would benefit from a meta-analysis of the current research in order to better understand the relationships between these two commonly co-occurring disorders. © 2013 Gregorowski et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Parasitic helminths present one of the most pervasive challenges to grazing herbivores. Many macro-parasite transmission models focus on host physiological defence strategies, omitting more complex interactions between hosts and their environments. This work represents the first model that integrates both the behavioural and physiological elements of gastro-intestinal nematode transmission dynamics in a managed grazing system. A spatially explicit, individual-based, stochastic model is developed, that incorporates both the hosts' immunological responses to parasitism, and key grazing behaviours including faecal avoidance. The results demonstrate that grazing behaviour affects both the timing and intensity of parasite outbreaks, through generating spatial heterogeneity in parasite risk and nutritional resources, and changing the timing of exposure to the parasites' free-living stages. The influence of grazing behaviour varies with the host-parasite combination, dependent on the development times of different parasite species and variations in host immune response. Our outputs include the counterintuitive finding that under certain conditions perceived parasite avoidance behaviours (faecal avoidance) can increase parasite risk, for certain host-parasite combinations. Through incorporating the two-way interaction between infection dynamics and grazing behaviour, the potential benefits of parasite-induced anorexia are also demonstrated. Hosts with phenotypic plasticity in grazing behaviour, that make grazing decisions dependent on current parasite burden, can reduce infection with minimal loss of intake over the grazing season. This paper explores how both host behaviours and immunity influence macro-parasite transmission in a spatially and temporally heterogeneous environment. The magnitude and timing of parasite outbreaks is influenced by host immunity and behaviour, and the interactions between them; the incorporation of both regulatory processes is required to fully understand transmission dynamics. Understanding of both physiological and behavioural defence strategies will aid the development of novel approaches for control. © 2013 Fox et al.},

abstract={Maternal obesity caused by overnutrition during pregnancy increases susceptibility to metabolic risks in adulthood, such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes; however, whether and how it affects the cognitive system associated with the brain remains elusive. Here, we report that pregnant obesity induced by exposure to excessive high fatty or highly palatable food specifically impaired reversal learning, a kind of adaptive behavior, while leaving serum metabolic metrics intact in the offspring of rats, suggesting a much earlier functional and structural defects possibly occurred in the central nervous system than in the metabolic system in the offspring born in unfavorable intrauterine nutritional environment. Mechanically, we found that above mentioned cognitive inflexibility might be associated with significant striatal disturbance including impaired dopamine homeostasis and disrupted leptin signaling in the adult offspring. These collective data add a novel perspective of understanding the adverse postnatal sequelae in central nervous system induced by developmental programming and the related molecular mechanism through which priming of risk for developmental disorders may occur during early life. © 2013 Wu et al.},

abstract={Injuries are common in animals of diverse taxa and are usually attributed to encounters with predators. Although often non-lethal, injuries nevertheless represent effects of predators that can have negative consequences for demography and fitness (e.g. reproductive costs). However, encounters with predators also represent experience through which animals can learn and positively adapt their future behaviour, potentially mitigating, at least partly, the negative effects of prior exposure to predators. I predicted that injured grass snakes (Natrix natrix), which presumably had been handled previously by a predator, would be more likely to move before capture than uninjured snakes. This prediction was borne out. Snakes with injuries also had lower body condition than uninjured snakes, although the effect was non-significant. Snakes that had been previously captured also were significantly more likely to move before capture than snakes that had never been caught before. These results provide strong evidence for the role of experience and learning in modifying the antipredator behaviour of snakes. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Objective: Activity-based anorexia is a translational rodent model that results in severe weight loss, hyperactivity, and voluntary self-starvation. The goal of our investigation was to identify vulnerable and resistant phenotypes of activity-based anorexia in adolescent female rats. Method: Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained under conditions of restricted access to food (N = 64; or unlimited access, N = 16) until experimental exit, predefined as a target weight loss of 30-35% or meeting predefined criteria for animal health. Nonlinear mixed effects statistical modeling was used to describe wheel running behavior, time to event analysis was used to assess experimental exit, and a regressive partitioning algorithm was used to classify phenotypes. Results: Objective criteria were identified for distinguishing novel phenotypes of activity-based anorexia, including a vulnerable phenotype that conferred maximal hyperactivity, minimal food intake, and the shortest time to experimental exit, and a resistant phenotype that conferred minimal activity and the longest time to experimental exit. Discussion: The identification of objective criteria for defining vulnerable and resistant phenotypes of activity-based anorexia in adolescent female rats provides an important framework for studying the neural mechanisms that promote vulnerability to or protection against the development of self-starvation and hyperactivity during adolescence. Ultimately, future studies using these novel phenotypes may provide important translational insights into the mechanisms that promote these maladaptive behaviors characteristic of anorexia nervosa. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={The proximal reasons and ultimal consequences of decisions made during foraging by breeding individuals are widely studied in numerous avian systems. However, the effects of these decisions are more pronounced in migratory birds because they spend more time and energy foraging than on the actual journey itself. The peak flowering and pollination period of crops in southern Israel, when large numbers of hives are transported to the region, coincide with the peak migration of Bee-eaters. We hypothesized that Bee-eaters cue on conspecifics while foraging at a stopover site, react to perceived danger at a given foraging patch, and that the degree of risk taken by an individual was a function of body condition and sex. Bee-eaters were caught on 44 different mornings in spring 2004, 2005, and 2009. A sex-dependent trapping was noted and significantly more females were caught in the first bout. The sex ratio remained significantly male biased in bouts 3-8. Birds caught in the first bout were heavier in comparison to those caught in the second bout, and there was a significant interaction between sex and bouts. From the second bout onwards both sexes showed a significant increase in body mass, by 1.05. g/bout on average (±0.6 SD), however wing lengths remained similar for both sexes. We conclude that migrant Bee-eaters cue on conspecifics to evaluate predation risks when socially foraging at a localized food patch and males, who we assume to be time-minimizers, are more likely to forage at a novel site and once danger of foraging is perceived only high energy demand individuals will attempt to hunt. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Most subsequent "thrifty" research has focused on the early developmental origins of the metabolic syndrome and cardio-metabolic disease. The goal of this manuscript is to review an emerging line of research that uses a similar thrifty framework to understand the early developmental origins of eating-related phenotypes that have primary relevance to many psychiatric disorders. Given the important role of environmental adversity in various psychiatric disorders that involve overeating, and their early age of onset, it is likely that several thrifty mechanisms are relevant in this regard. Understanding the early origins of increased eating behaviour based on a thriftymodelmight point the way to highly targeted preventative interventions during critical periods of development, and provide a new way of addressing these common and difficult to treat disorders. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Ecoimmunologists strive to understand how ecology and evolution shape immunity in natural populations. To date, ecoimmunologists have sometimes struggled to find measures of immunity that can be easily performed in nonmodel systems. One exception is variation in rates of cutaneous wound healing, which is a functionally important, integrative measure of immunity that combines cell-mediated, inflammatory and even some Th2-mediated processes. Here I review what is known about sources of variation in wound healing in wild populations, focusing on two key ecoimmunological questions: How and when does the stress response influence immune function? And how do energetic trade-offs alter immunity? The results indicate that stress and energetic costs can suppress wound healing, but the effects depend on individuals' social and abiotic environments. I also discuss methods to measure wound healing in natural populations and useful directions for future research. Because wound healing has functional significance to organisms, can be measured in diverse species and integrates several immune processes, this measure of immunity is an especially valuable member of the ecoimmunological toolkit. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={In accordance with the differential allocation hypothesis, females are expected to increase their reproductive investment when mated to high-quality males. In waterfowl, reproductive, investment increased when captive female mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were mated to more attractive males, but information for wild ducks is lacking. Studies of waterfowl mating systems have focused primarily on the importance of plumage coloration of males and female mate choice, whereas investigations of reproductive ecology examine female attributes and virtually ignore the role of males in investment decisions. Here, we used unique data for 253 pairs of wild mallards to test whether females mated to high-quality males would increase reproductive effort and reproduce more successfully. We derived measurements of female and male body size and condition, and indices of male plumage quality, and related these traits to patterns of reproductive effort and performance of females. Consistent with predictions, yearling females nested earlier and had higher nest survival when mated to males with better plumage scores. Furthermore, when paired with larger bodied males, yearling females renested more often, and nest and brood survival increased among older females. Although the strength of male effects varied with breeding stage and female age or experience, this is one of a few studies to demonstrate an additive effect of male quality on investment and success of females, in free-ranging birds. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We examined differences in the fear response between Bengalese finches and their wild ancestor, the white-backed munia, to explore the evolutionary mechanisms of behavioural changes due to domestication. The Bengalese finch (Lonchura striata var. domestica) was domesticated from the wild-living white-backed munia (L. striata) approximately 250 years ago. A previous study indicated that Bengalese finches sing much more complex songs than white-backed munias. We hypothesised that Bengalese finches are likely able to allocate more resources to reproduction in exchange for reduced survival effort. We measured tonic immobility (TI) reactions as a response to physical restraint to evaluate fearfulness related to coping with predation. The results showed that Bengalese finches exhibited decreased TI responses compared with white-backed munias. TI responses were unaffected by sex, body weight or growth conditions. These differences suggest that the fearfulness in Bengalese finches has been reduced by selective pressure during domestication. Bengalese finches may have been able to increase the investment of energy in reproduction in exchange for reduced costs of predation and coping necessary to survive in the wild; these behavioural changes may have been a major target of domestication effects in this species. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In arid Australia, flooding rains associated with the La Nińa phase of El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) prompt dramatic pulses of primary productivity, which in turn result in irruptions of rodents and their predators. When it is dry, the dense vegetation produced by extreme rainfall events can fuel extensive wildfires. In this study we investigated the effects of a wildfire that followed exceptional rainfalls associated with the La Niña event of 2010-2011 on small mammal assemblages in a stony (gibber) desert ecosystem in central Australia. When the study commenced in July 2011, there was dense grass cover and rodents, particularly, Rattus villosissimus occurred at high abundance. Mammalian predator activity was high throughout the study period and predators primarily consumed rodents. A wildfire in October 2011, reduced grass cover but there was no effect of fire on the abundance or species richness of small mammals, immediately after the wildfire or 11 months after the wildfire. Following the fire event, grass cover increased on both burnt and unburnt grids, but did not reach the levels recorded prior to the wildfire. Small mammal abundance and species richness declined steadily during the study irrespective of the occurrence of wildfire. At 6 and 11 months after the wildfire there was no difference in grass cover on burnt and unburnt grids and Rattus villosissimus were absent. Our results show that the removal of vegetation by wildfire was not a major driver of small mammal assemblage structure in this stony desert ecosystem. Our results are consistent with the predictions of ecosystem organization models that describe switching trophic control along gradients of resource productivity and support the notion that the decline of small mammals was driven by the onset of top-down control by abundant predators coupled with diminished availability of food resources. © 2013 Ecological Society of Australia.},

abstract={Food and water resources are limiting factors for animals in desert ecosystems. Fleshy fruits are a rare water source in deserts and when available they tend to attract a wide variety of organisms. Here we show that two congeneric rodent species, Acomys cahirinus and A. russatus, employ different fruit eating strategies that result in either dispersal or predation of the small seeds of the desert plant Ochradenus baccatus. The nocturnal A. cahirinus leaves intact seeds when consuming O. baccatus fruits and thus, acts mainly as a seed disperser; whereas the diurnal A. russatus consumes the whole fruit and digests the seeds and thus, acts mainly as a seed predator. Acomys russatus is subjected to the toxic products of the glucosinolates-myrosinase system found in O. baccatus fruits. Acomys cahirinus avoids the toxic compounds by consuming the pulp only, which contains glucosinolates but not the seeds that contain the enzyme that activates them. We suggest that the behavioral responses exhibited by A. russatus are the result of physiological adaptations to whole fruit consumption that are absent in A. cahirinus. Our results shed new light on the ecological divergence of the two congeneric species. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Variation in how individuals invest in acquiring information (sampling) and in insuring themselves against potential negative consequences of uncertainty (e.g., by storing energy reserves) has been suggested to underlie consistent individual differences in suites of behavioral traits. However, the key drivers of individual differences in information use remain poorly understood. We use dynamic programming to explore how existing variation in metabolic rates (MRs) affects the use of sampling and insurance under starvation risk. Our analysis reveals nonlinear effects of MRs on diurnal patterns of sampling and insurance. Individuals with low MRs accrue reserves quickly, because they invest in sampling and are able to exploit profitable options when they arise. Individuals with intermediate MRs initially lose reserves, because sampling, while optimal, is relatively expensive; however, they later build reserves due to efficient exploitation of alternative foraging options. Sampling rarely pays for individuals with the highest MRs, which show relatively constant levels of energy reserves throughout the foraging period. Thus, individual variation in MRs on the scale observed in natural populations can lead to important differences in investment in sampling and insurance and may underpin consistent individual differences in suites of other behavioral traits, including individual differences in behavioral responsiveness. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.},

We used an arena with a white light at the top and two openings on the floor, one giving access to a dark shelter and the other one closed with a mesh. Filter paper with different chemicals (mate or green tea) surrounded both openings. A harvestman (. n=. 37) was released in the arena and its behavior recorded. The procedure was repeated for 14 consecutive days with each individual. We found that harvestmen got faster at finding the refuge, became less exploratory and tended to move toward the open shelter as the days passed.

The effect of PEA+luteolin compound treatment (1mg/kg, i.p.), on depression-like behaviour was assessed using different paradigms such as open field, novelty suppressed feeding, forced swim test and elevated plus maze. In particular in the open field, novelty suppressed feeding and elevated plus maze the time spent in the open arm was employed as an indicator of anxiety; forced swim test was used to evaluate the antidepressant capacity of PEA+luteolin on immobility time as an indicator of depression. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroplasticity were evaluated by immunohistochemical techniques; brain-derived neurotrophic factor and apoptotic protein (Bax and Bcl2) expression were studied by immunostaining and Western blot analysis.

abstract={Molecular interactions between male and female factors during mating profoundly affect the reproductive behavior and physiology of female insects. In natural populations of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, blood-fed females direct nutritional resources towards oogenesis only when inseminated. Here we show that the mating-dependent pathway of egg development in these mosquitoes is regulated by the interaction between the steroid hormone 20-hydroxy-ecdysone (20E) transferred by males during copulation and a female Mating-Induced Stimulator of Oogenesis (MISO) protein. RNAi silencing of MISO abolishes the increase in oogenesis caused by mating in blood-fed females, causes a delay in oocyte development, and impairs the function of male-transferred 20E. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that MISO and 20E interact in the female reproductive tract. Moreover MISO expression after mating is induced by 20E via the Ecdysone Receptor, demonstrating a close cooperation between the two factors. Male-transferred 20E therefore acts as a mating signal that females translate into an increased investment in egg development via a MISO-dependent pathway. The identification of this male-female reproductive interaction offers novel opportunities for the control of mosquito populations that transmit malaria. © 2013 Baldini et al.},

Methods Data were collected as part of Youth'07, a nationally representative survey of the health and well-being of secondary school students in New Zealand (n = 9107). Results Frequent family meals were positively associated with better indicators of family relationships (P < 0.001). Likewise, frequent family meals were significantly associated with higher well-being scores (P < 0.001), lower depression scores (P < 0.001) and fewer risk-taking behaviours (P < 0.001), even after controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, family connectedness, parental monitoring and parental communication. Conclusions Our findings suggest that family meals may provide a unique opportunity for building stronger families and young people. Creating environments where frequent family meals are normative, valued and feasible for families may result in benefits for young people that extend beyond good nutrition. © 2013 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (Royal Australasian College of Physicians).},

abstract={Vigilance is an essential component of antipredator behaviour and is also used to monitor conspecifics, but is traded off against feeding in herbivores. This trade-off can be influenced by variation in many environmental, social and individual traits. Our aim was to test the relationship between individual-level traits, including boldness, body condition and reproductive state, and vigilance, while controlling for environmental and social variables. Using multiple 5-min video samples of 30 foraging, individually recognisable, female eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) at Sundown National Park in Queensland, we investigated individual-level variation in the duration, intensity and target of vigilance behaviour during foraging. On separate occasions, we used flight-initiation distance tests to measure boldness in our kangaroos. Females with longer flight-initiation distances (shyer females) spent more time vigilant, providing preliminary support for studies of animal personality that have suggested that boldness may covary with vigilance. Body condition did not affect the total time spent vigilant, but females in poorer body condition spent more of their vigilance time in low-intensity vigilance. Vigilance patterns were not related to reproductive state, but varied among months and differed between mornings and afternoons, and females spent more time in high-intensity vigilance when further from cover. Even after accounting for all our variables we found that 7% of the variation in total time vigilant and 14% of the variation in vigilance intensity was explained by individual identity. This highlights the importance of individual-level variation in vigilance behaviour. © 2013 CSIRO.},

abstract={Background: Obesity is mainly attributed to environmental factors. In developed countries, the time spent on physical activity tasks is decreasing, whereas sedentary behaviour patterns are increasing.The purpose of the intervention is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intensive family-based behavioural multi-component intervention (Nereu programme) and compared it to counselling intervention such as a health centre intervention programme for the management of children's obesity. Methods/Design. The study design is a randomized controlled multicenter clinical trial using two types of interventions: Nereu and Counselling. The Nereu programme is an 8-month intensive family-based multi-component behavioural intervention. This programme is based on a multidisciplinary intervention consisting of 4 components: physical activity sessions for children, family theoretical and practical sessions for parents, behaviour strategy sessions involving both, parents and children, and lastly, weekend extra activities for all. Counselling is offered to the family in the form of a monthly physical health and eating habits session. Participants will be recruited according the following criteria: 6 to 12 year-old-children, referred from their paediatricians due to overweight or obesity according the International Obesity Task Force criteria and with a sedentary profile (less than 2 hours per week of physical activity), they must live in or near the municipality of Lleida (Spain) and their healthcare paediatric unit must have previously accepted to cooperate with this study. The following variables will be evaluated: a) cardiovascular risk factors (anthropometric parameters, blood test and blood pressure), b) sedentary and physical activity behaviour and dietary intake, c) psychological aspects d) health related quality of life (HRQOL), e) cost-effectiveness of the intervention in relation to HRQOL. These variables will be then be evaluated 4 times longitudinally: at baseline, at the end of the intervention (8 months later), 6 and 12 months after the intervention. We have considered necessary to recruit 100 children and divide them in 2 groups of 50 to detect the differences between the groups. Discussion. This trial will provide new evidence for the long-term effects of childhood obesity management, as well as help to know the impact of the present intervention as a health intervention tool for healthcare centres.

abstract={The easy accessibility of energy-rich palatable food makes it difficult to resist food temptation. Drosophila larvae are surrounded by sugar-rich food most of their lives, raising the question of how these animals modulate food-seeking behaviors in tune with physiological needs. Here we describe a circuit mechanism defined by neurons expressing tdc2-Gal4 (a tyrosine decarboxylase 2 promoter-directed driver) that selectively drives a distinct foraging strategy in food-deprived larvae. Stimulation of this otherwise functionally latent circuit in tdc2-Gal4 neurons was sufficient to induce exuberant feeding of liquid food in fed animals, whereas targeted lesions in a small subset of tdc2-Gal4 neurons in the subesophageal ganglion blocked hunger-driven increases in the feeding response. Furthermore, regulation of feeding rate enhancement by tdc2-Gal4 neurons requires a novel signaling mechanism involving the VEGF2-like receptor, octopamine, and its receptor. Our findings provide fresh insight for the neurobiology and evolution of appetitive motivation.},

abstract={Size variance among similarly aged individuals within populations is a pattern common to many organisms that is a result of interactions between intrinsic and extrinsic traits of individuals. While genetic and maternal effects, as well as physiological and behavioral traits have been shown to contribute to size variation in animal populations, teasing apart the influence of such factors on individual growth rates remain a challenge. Furthermore, tracing the effects of these interactions across life stages and in shaping adult phenotypes also requires further exploration. In this study we investigated the relationship between genetics, hatching patterns, behaviors, neuroendocrine stress axis activity and variance in growth and metamorphosis among same-aged larval amphibians. Through parallel experiments we found that in the absence of conspecific interactions, hatch time and to a lesser extent egg clutch identity (i.e. genetics and maternal effects) influenced the propensity for growth and development in individual tadpoles and determined metamorphic traits. Within experimental groups we found that variance in growth rates was associated with size-dependent foraging behaviors and responses to food restriction. We also found an inverse relationship between glucocorticoid (GC) hormone levels and body mass and developmental stage among group-reared tadpoles, which suggests that GC expression plays a role in regulating differing within-population growth trajectories in response to density-dependent conditions. Taken together these findings suggest that factors that influence hatching conditions can have long-term effects on growth and development. These results also raise compelling questions regarding the extent to which maternal and genetic factors influence physiological and behavioral profiles in amphibians. © 2013 Warne et al.},

abstract={The neuroendocrinology of ingestive behavior is a topic central to human health, particularly in light of the prevalence of obesity, eating disorders, and diabetes. The study of food intake in laboratory rats and mice has yielded some useful hypotheses, but there are still many gaps in our knowledge. Ingestive behavior is more complex than the consummatory act of eating, and decisions about when and how much to eat usually take place in the context of potential mating partners, competitors, predators, and environmental fluctuations that are not present in the laboratory. We emphasize appetitive behaviors, actions that bring animals in contact with a goal object, precede consummatory behaviors, and provide a window into motivation. Appetitive ingestive behaviors are under the control of neural circuits and neuropeptide systems that control appetitive sex behaviors and differ from those that control consummatory ingestive behaviors. Decreases in the availability of oxidizable metabolic fuels enhance the stimulatory effects of peripheral hormones on appetitive ingestive behavior and the inhibitory effects on appetitive sex behavior, putting a new twist on the notion of leptin, insulin, and ghrelin "resistance." The ratio of hormone concentrations to the availability of oxidizable metabolic fuels may generate a critical signal that schedules conflicting behaviors, e.g., mate searching vs. foraging, food hoarding vs. courtship, and fat accumulation vs. parental care. In species representing every vertebrate taxa and even in some invertebrates, many putative "satiety" or "hunger" hormones function to schedule ingestive behavior in order to optimize reproductive success in environments where energy availability fluctuates. © 2013 The Authors.},

abstract={Habitat utilization, behavior and food habits of the jumbo or Humboldt squid, Dosidicus gigas, were compared between an area recently inhabited in the northern California Current System (CCS) and a historically established area of residence in the Gulf of California (GOC). Low dissolved oxygen concentrations at midwater depths define the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), an important environmental feature in both areas. We analyzed vertical diving behavior and diet of D. gigas and hydrographic properties of the water column to ascertain the extent to which squid utilized the OMZ in the two areas. The upper boundary of the OMZ has been shoaling in recent decades in the CCS, and this phenomenon has been proposed to vertically compress the pelagic environment inhabited by aerobic predators. A shoaling OMZ will also bring mesopelagic communities into a depth range with more illumination during daytime, making these organisms more vulnerable to predation by visual predators (i.e. jumbo squid). Because the OMZ in the GOC is considerably shallower than in the CCS, our study provides insight into the behavioral plasticity of jumbo squid and how they may respond to a shoaling OMZ in the CCS. We propose that shoaling OMZs are likely to be favorable to jumbo squid and could be a key indirect factor behind the recent range expansion of this highly migratory predator. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Leaf-tying caterpillars act as ecosystem engineers by building shelters between overlapping leaves, which are inhabited by other arthropods. Leaf-tiers have been observed to leave their ties and create new shelters (and thus additional microhabitats), but the ecological factors affecting shelter fidelity are poorly known. For this study, we explored the effects of resource limitation and occupant density on shelter fidelity and assessed the consequences of shelter abandonment. We first quantified the area of leaf material required for a caterpillar to fully develop for two of the most common leaf-tiers that feed on white oak, Quercus alba. On average, Psilocorsis spp. caterpillars consumed 21.65 ± 0.67 cm2 leaf material to complete development. We also measured the area of natural leaf ties found in aMaryland forest, to determine the distribution of resources available to caterpillars in situ. Of 158 natural leaf ties examined, 47% were too small to sustain an average Psilocorsis spp. caterpillar for the entirety of its development. We also manipulated caterpillar densities within experimental ties on potted trees to determine the effects of cohabitants on the likelihood of a caterpillar to leave its tie. We placed 1, 2, or 4 caterpillars in ties of a standard size and monitored the caterpillars twice daily to track their movement. In ties with more than one occupant, caterpillars showed a significantly greater propensity to leave their tie, and left sooner and at a faster rate than those in ties as single occupants. To understand the consequences of leaf tie abandonment, we observed caterpillars searching a tree for a site to build a shelter in the field. This is a risky behavior, as 17% of the caterpillars observed died while searching for a shelter site. Caterpillars that successfully built a shelter traveled 110±20 cm and took 28±7 min to find a suitable site to build a shelter. In conclusion, leaf-tying caterpillarsmust frequently abandon their leaf tie due to food limitation and interactions with other caterpillars, but this is a costly behavior. © 2013 Sliwinski and Sigmon.},

abstract={Animals rely on environmental cues to identify potential rewards and select the best reward available. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is proposed to encode sensory-specific representations of expected outcome. However, its contribution to the selection of a preferred outcome among different reward options is still unclear.Weinvestigated the effect of transient OFC inactivation (achieved by presession injection of muscimol and baclofen) in a novel two-reward choice task. In discrete trials, rats could choose between a solution of polycose and an equally caloric, but highly preferred, solution of sucrose by visiting one of two liquid dispensers after the presentation of a specific cue signaling the availability of one or both of the solutions. We found that OFC inactivation did not affect outcome preference: rats maintained high preference for sucrose and adapted their behavioral responding when the cue-outcome contingencies were reversed. However, when rats were tested drug-free 24 h after OFC inactivation and reversal learning, memory for the newly learned contingencies was poor. These results suggest a potential conflict betweenOFC(encoding pre-reversal contingencies) and other brain circuits (encoding the new contingencies). Remarkably, repeating the OFC inactivation before the reversal memory test restored normal behavior, confirming the hypothesis of a dominant impact of OFC on other decision-making circuits. These results indicate that the representations encoded in the OFC, while not essential to the expression of outcome preference, exert hierarchical control on downstream decisionmaking circuits. ©2013 the authors.},

abstract={Sanjiangyuan Region is the headstream area of three main rivers in Asia, i.e. Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Lancangjiang River (Mekong). It is an important ecological barrier of the local and regional environmental security and sustainable development, not only for China but also for the southeastern Asian, In recent decades, however, grasslands in Sanjiangyuan Region were seriously disturbed or destroyed by both global climate change and human activities, which led to sharp decrease of nourishing capacity of source water and serious environmental problems of the lower reaches. Since 2005, Chinese government began to implement a series of activities, e.g. 'Returning Grazing Land to Grassland Project' and 'Ecological Migration Project', in Sanjiangyuan Region to alleviate the situation of grassland degradation, and gradually restore and protect the ecological environment. The success of such projects in Sanjiangyuan Region depends largely on local herdsman's active response, support and participation because herdsmen's ecological protective cognition and behavior response to grassland degradation is the key to the effective implementation of ecological protection and herdsmen' s participation willingness directly influences the accomplishment efficiency and sustainability of ecological protection.In this paper we surveyed 283 Tibetan herder household and tried to explore the key influential factors of their participation willness with the binary logistic model analysis. Several conclusions can be drawn from this investigation: (1) About 87 percent of herdsmen have realized the externality of ecological protection, but only 70 percent of herdsmen passively participated in ecological protection based on bounded rationality with government domination.(2) Factors like government's protection efforts, herdsmen's cognitive level of ecological protection externalities, livelihood level, the degree of contact with the outside world and career opportunities have positive affects on herdsmen's participation willingness in ecological protection, while factors like age, the distance to the towns and regional extreme climate have negative impacts on the ecological protection willness, These factors'influence coefficient are 2.22,3.98,1.93,2.26,1.48,-1.63,-2.43 and -0.92. (3) The livelihood level, grassland degradation perception and externalities cognitive are the most important factors of herdsmen's participation willingness in ecological protection, The probability of Herdsmen's participation willness is not only the passive response to the consideration of their own profit and the unknown risk but also the individual choices under the influence of ecological protection education and input of local governments. (4) In order to realize regional ecological protection, the wellbeings of local herdsmen and ecological and economical sustainable development, we should basically solve the present livelihood of the herdsmen who living on the local grasslands in the Sanjiangyuan Region and emphasize on the environmental education in their religious and local livings, formulate the conservation strategies and management planning of grasslands with an emphasis on improving both human livelihood and the environmental protection. We should also build a better ecological compensation strategy which lets herdsmen enjoy the externalities effectiveness of ecological protection and then take an active part in ecological protections of Sanjiangyuan Region.},

abstract={The postprandial event known as the specific dynamic action is an evolutionarily conserved physiological set of metabolic responses to feeding. Its behavioral counterpart, a sequence of drinking, maintenance (e.g., grooming) and sleep-like behaviors known as the behavioral satiety sequence (BSS), has been thoroughly described in rodents and has enabled the refined evaluation of potential appetite modifiers. However, the presence and attributes of a BSS have not been systematically studied in non-mammalian species. Here, we describe the BSS induced in pigeons (Columba livia) by 1) the presentation of a palatable seed mixture (SM) food to free-feeding animals (SM. +. FF condition) and 2) re-feeding after a 24-h fasting period (FD24h. +. SM), which was examined by continuous behavioral recording for 2. h. We then compare these patterns to those observed in free-feeding (FF) animals. A set of graphic representations and indexes, drawn from these behaviors (latency, time-to-peak, inter-peak intervals and the first intersection between feeding curves and those of other BSS-typical behaviors) were used to describe the temporal structure and sequential relationships between the pigeon's BSS components. Cramér-von Mises-based statistical procedures and bootstrapping-based methods to compare pairs of complex behavioral curves were described and used for comparisons among the behavioral profiles during the free-feeding recordings and after fasting- and SM-induced BSS. FD24h. +. SM- and SM. +. FF-induced feeding were consistently followed by a similar sequence of increased bouts of drinking, followed by preening and then sleep, which were significantly different from that of FF birds. The sequential and temporal patterns of the pigeon's BSS were not affected by differences in food intake or by dissimilarity in motivational content of feeding stimuli. The present data indicated that a BSS pattern can be reliably evoked in the pigeon, in a chronological succession and sequence that strongly resembled that observed in rodents and primates. This pattern can be quantitatively described and compared using different suitable and coordinated behavioral measures, enabling further studies on the comparative and evolutionary aspects of the mechanisms that shape the post-consummatory behavioral flux in amniotes. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Habitat selection by ungulates is determined by the quantity, quality and distribution of trophic resources as well as by predation risk. It may also vary in relation to species-specific reproductive strategies and social organization. The guanaco (Lama guanicoe), a highly social and sexually size-monomorphic wild camelid typical of arid lands, is ideal for evaluating behavioural responses of this type, since most studies have done on dimorphic ungulates in temperate environments, where trophic resources are abundant. We recorded the group size and social structure of guanaco during both dry and wet seasons of 2005-2007 in an Argentinean desert, where pumas (Puma concolor) are the sole predators. Remote sensing data were used to calculate five variables that reflected trophic availability and terrain morphology for each guanaco group and for an equivalent number of random controls. Habitat use did not differ between types of social groups but differed between seasons. Guanacos used less productive and less steep areas during the breeding season, irrespective of juvenile:adult ratios in the family groups, and larger groups occupied flatter areas. Overall, guanaco habitat selection prioritizes reducing predation risk to the extent that animals occupy areas offering the minimum productivity capable of meeting their energy requirements. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The giving-up density (GUD) framework provides a powerful experimental approach with a strong theoretical underpinning to quantify foraging outcomes in heterogeneous landscapes. Since its inception, the GUD approach has been applied successfully to a vast range of foraging species and foraging scenarios. However, its application is not simple, as anyone who has tried to use it for the first time might attest. Limitations of the technique were noted at its conception, yet only the artificiality of the patches, the appropriateness of the food resource, and the possibility of multiple visiting foragers were identified. Here we show the current uses of GUD and outline the practical benefits as well as the often overlooked limitations of the technique. We define seven major points that need to be addressed when applying this methodology: (1) the curvilinearity between harvest rate and energy, (2) the energetic state of the forager, (3) the effect of group foraging, (4) food quality and substrate properties, (5) the predictability of the patch, (6) behavioral traits of the forager, and (7) nontarget species. We also suggest how GUD experiments can be enhanced by incorporating complementary methods (such as cameras) to better understand the foraging processes involved in the GUD itself. We conclude that the benefits of using GUD outweigh the costs, but that its limitations should not be ignored. Incorporating new methods when using GUD can potentially offer novel and important insights into the study of foraging behavior. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Parasites influence colorful ornaments and their behavioral display in many animal hosts. Because coloration and display behavior are often critical components of communication, variation in these traits may have important implications for individual fitness, yet it remains unclear whether such traits are signals of quality in many taxa. We investigated the association between ectoparasitic mite load and the color and behavioral use of the throat fan (dewlap) by male Anolis brevirostris lizards. We found that heavily parasitized lizards exhibited lower body condition, duller dewlaps, and less frequent dewlap displays than less parasitized individuals. Our results thus suggest that highly parasitized individuals invest less in both ornamental color and behavioral display of that color. Because the two components of the signal simultaneously provide information on male quality, this study provides novel support for the long-standing hypothesis that colorful traits may function as social or sexual signals in reptiles. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Many parents of children with autism want to try a gluten-free and casein-free diet (gfcf-d) for their child to see if it will help. Some studies have found positive results, but questions remain unanswered. Parents should consider potential benefits and potential harms of trying the diet. Potential benefits to the affected child include improved communication, social interaction, and behavioral flexibility and decreased inattention and hyperactivity. Potential harms of the diet include nutritional deficiencies and the effort and costs associated with maintaining it. Caution should be used when trying to decide whether to try a gfcf-d for a child who already has nutritional deficiency, growth problems, or restricted diet due to difficulty accepting new foods. Before starting a gluten-free diet, the child should be screened for celiac disease, especially if the child has had gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, or weight loss. If parents want to try a gfcf-d, they should consider seeking guidance from a therapist to help introduce the diet in a gradual way and a dietitian to monitor their child's nutritional intake while on the diet and to recommend supplementation if necessary. Weight also needs to be monitored. Parents and health care professionals or teachers should document behavioral improvement, ideally using validated measures. © 2013 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.},

abstract={This study evaluated whether the specific heavy pig rearing context allowed the fattening of undocked pigs without an outbreak of tail biting. At the same time, gender and straw availability (small amounts) were considered to understand their possible interactions with tail presence in the display of tail biting. A 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design was adopted to test the effects of these factors on blood parameters, behaviour and tail/ear lesions. Few interactions among factors were detected. Undocked pigs showed lower cortisol (P< 0.02), lying behaviour (P< 0.001), and higher risk of tail/ear biting (weeks 3 and 9), but lower risk of tail lesions (week 14). Straw increased the motivation for exploring (P< 0.001), reduced serum haptoglobin (P< 0.001) and the risk for tail biting (weeks 3, 9, 18) and ear biting (weeks 3, 9). Results highlight the importance of straw as an environmental enrichment and seem to indicate that fattening undocked heavy pigs is possible. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
