Title = {{Titrating the cost of plant toxins against predators: determining the

Abstract = {{P>1. Foraging herbivores must deal with plant characteristics that
   inhibit feeding and they must avoid being eaten. Principally, toxins
   limit food intake, while predation risk alters how long animals are
   prepared to harvest resources. Each of these factors strongly affects
   how herbivores use food patches, and both constraints can pose immediate
   proximate costs and long-term consequences to fitness.
   2. Using a generalist mammalian herbivore, the common brushtail possum
   (Trichosurus vulpecula), our aim was to quantitatively compare the
   influence of plant toxin and predation risk on foraging decisions.
   3. We performed a titration experiment by offering animals a choice
   between non-toxic food at a risky patch paired with food with one of
   five toxin concentrations at a safe patch. This allowed us to identify
   the tipping point, where the cost of toxin in the safe food patch was
   equivalent to the perceived predation risk in the alternative patch.
   4. At low toxin concentration, animals ate more from the safe than the
   risky patch. As toxin concentration increased at the safe patch, intake
   shifted until animals ate mainly from the risky patch. This shift was
   associated with behavioural changes: animals spent more time and fed
   longer at the risky patch, while vigilance increased at both risky and
   safe patches.
   5. Our results demonstrate that the variation in toxin concentration,
   which occurs intraspecifically among plants, can critically influence
   the relative cost of predation risk on foraging. We show that herbivores
   quantify, compare and balance these two different but proximate costs,
   altering their foraging patterns in the process. This has potential
   ecological and evolutionary implications for the production of plant
   defence compounds in relation to spatial variation in predation risk to
   herbivores.}},

Title = {{Raiders of the Lost Bark: Orangutan Foraging Strategies in a Degraded
   Landscape}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{JUN 22}},
Abstract = {{Deforestation is rapidly transforming primary forests across the tropics
   into human-dominated landscapes. Consequently, conservationists need to
   understand how different taxa respond and adapt to these changes in
   order to develop appropriate management strategies. Our two year study
   seeks to determine how wild Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii) adapt to
   living in an isolated agroforest landscape by investigating the sex of
   crop-raiders related to population demographics, and their temporal
   variations in feeding behaviour and dietary composition. From focal
   animal sampling we found that nine identified females raided cultivated
   fruits more than the four males. Seasonal adaptations were shown through
   orangutan feeding habits that shifted from being predominantly
   fruit-based (56\% of the total feeding time, then 22\% on bark) to the
   fallback food of bark (44\%, then 35\% on fruits), when key cultivated
   resources such as jackfruit (Artocarpus integer), were unavailable.
   Cultivated fruits were mostly consumed in the afternoon and evening,
   when farmers had returned home. The finding that females take greater
   crop-raiding risks than males differs from previous human-primate
   conflict studies, probably because of the low risks associated (as
   farmers rarely retaliated) and low intraspecific competition between
   males. Thus, the behavioral ecology of orangutans living in this
   human-dominated landscape differs markedly from that in primary forest,
   where orangutans have a strictly wild food diet, even where primary
   rainforests directly borders farmland. The importance of wild food
   availability was clearly illustrated in this study with 21\% of the
   total orangutan feeding time being allocated to feeding on cultivated
   fruits. As forests are increasingly converted to cultivation, humans and
   orangutans are predicted to come into conflict more frequently. This
   study reveals orangutan adaptations for coexisting with humans, e. g.
   changes in temporal foraging patterns, which should be used for guiding
   the development of specific human-wildlife conflict mitigation
   strategies to lessen future crop-raiding and conflicts.}},

Title = {{Caloric restriction}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ASPECTS OF MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{159-221}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Restricting the intake of calories has been practiced as a method for
   increasing both the length and quality of life for over 500 years.
   Experimental work confirming the success of this approach in animals has
   accumulated over the last 100 years. Lifelong caloric restriction (CR)
   may extend life by up to 50\% in rodents, with progressively less impact
   the later in life it is started. This effect is matched by profound
   impacts on age related diseases including reduced risk of cancer,
   neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease
   and type II diabetes mellitus. The disposable soma theory of ageing
   suggests that CR evolved as a somatic protection response to enable
   animals to survive periods of food shortage. The shutdown of
   reproductive function during CR is consistent with this suggestion, but
   other features of the phenomenon are less consistent with this theory,
   and some have suggested that in rodents it may be mostly an artifact of
   domestication. CR induces profound effects on animals at all levels from
   the transcriptome to whole animal physiology and behavior. Animals under
   CR lose weight which is disproportionately contributed to by white
   adipose tissue. Generally animals on CR change their activity patterns
   so that they are more active prior to food delivery each day but total
   activity may be unchanged or reduced. Considerable debate has occurred
   over the effects of CR on resting metabolic rate (RMR). Total RMR
   declines, but as body mass and body composition also change it is
   unclear whether metabolism at the tissue level also declines, is
   unchanged or even increases. Body temperature universally decreases.
   Hunger is increased and does not seem to abate even with very long term
   restriction. Circulating adipokines are reduced reflecting the reduction
   in white adipose tissue (WAT) mass under restriction and there is a
   large reduction in circulating insulin and glucose levels. There are
   profound tissue level changes in metabolism with a generalized shift
   from carbohydrate to fat metabolism. Four pathways have been implicated
   in mediating the CR effect. These are the insulin like growth factor
   (IGF-1)/insulin signaling pathway, the sirtuin pathway, the adenosine
   monophosphate (AMP) activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and the
   target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway. These different pathways may interact
   and may all play important roles mediating different aspects of the
   response. Exactly how they generate the health benefits remains open for
   debate, however CR results in reduced oxidative stress and enhanced
   autophagy, both of which could be essential components of the beneficial
   effects. Most data about the effects of CR in mammals comes from work on
   rodents. There is limited work on non-human primates that shows
   promising effects and one randomized controlled trial in humans where
   physiological markers of the CR response are consistent with the
   responses in mice and rats. There are also populations of humans
   voluntarily restricting themselves. Humans on long term restriction
   report similar negative side effects to those observed in animals -
   perpetual hunger, reduced body temperature leading to a feeling of being
   cold, and diminished libido. Considerable effort has been directed in
   recent years to find drugs that mimic the CR response. Promising
   candidates are those that intersect with the critical signaling pathways
   identified above and include biguanides such as metformin that target
   the insulin signaling pathway, stilbenes (e.g.
   resveratrol) that affect sirtuin activity and drugs such as rapamycin
   that interat with mTOR signaling. Whether it will ever be possible to
   find drugs that capture the health benefits of CR without the negative
   side-effects remains unclear. Moreover, even if such drugs are developed
   how the current licensing system for drug use in western societies would
   cope with them may be a further obstacle to their use. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{The imprinted brain theory proposes that autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
   represents a paternal bias in the expression of imprinted genes. This is
   reflected in a preference for mechanistic cognition and in the
   corresponding mentalistic deficits symptomatic of ASD. Psychotic
   spectrum disorder (PSD) would correspondingly result from an imbalance
   in favor of maternal and/or X-chromosome gene expression. If differences
   in gene expression were reflected locally in the human brain as mouse
   models and other evidence suggests they are, ASD would represent not so
   much an `extreme male brain' as an extreme paternal one, with PSD
   correspondingly representing an extreme maternal brain. To the extent
   that copy number variation resembles imprinting and aneuploidy in
   nullifying or multiplying the expression of particular genes, it has
   been found to conform to the diametric model of mental illness peculiar
   to the imprinted brain theory. The fact that nongenetic factors such as
   nutrition in pregnancy can mimic and/or interact with imprinted gene
   expression suggests that the theory might even be able to explain the
   notable effect of maternal starvation on the risk of PSD - not to
   mention the `autism epidemic' of modern affluent societies. Finally, the
   theory suggests that normality represents balanced cognition, and that
   genius is an extraordinary extension of cognitive configuration in both
   mentalistic and mechanistic directions. Were it to be proven correct,
   the imprinted brain theory would represent one of the biggest single
   advances in our understanding of the mind and of mental illness that has

Abstract = {{Objective. This study investigated whether infants' temperament at 18

   study of mothers and infants (N = 40 266) participating in the Norwegian
   Mother and Child Cohort Study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of
   Public Health. Data were collected by questionnaire. Predictor variables
   were: infants' temperament at 18 months (internalizing, externalizing,
   and surgency/extraversion), and mothers' negative affectivity. Outcome
   variables were feeding of sweet foods, sweet drinks, and night-time
   caloric drinks at 18 months (all dichotomized). Confounders were child's
   gender, weight-for-height at 1 year, breastfeeding, and mother's level
   of education. Results. After controlling for confounders, infant
   temperament dimensions at 18 months were significantly associated with
   mothers' feeding of potentially obesogenic foods and drinks independent
   of mothers' negative affectivity. Infants who were more internalizing
   were more likely to be given sweet foods (OR 1.47, CI 1.32-1.65), sweet
   drinks (OR 1.76, CI 1.56-1.98), and drinks at night (OR 2.91, CI

Abstract = {{This paper presents a behavioral ecologist's view on adaptive responses
   to early stress. I first summarize two approaches to this topic drawn
   from other papers in this Special Issue: the `inoculation model' and the
   `adaptive calibration model'. I then describe three relevant modeling
   approaches from behavioral and evolutionary ecology: models of adaptive
   plasticity, models of adaptive prey behavior under uncertainty about
   risk, and models of state-dependent adaptive behavioral syndromes. These
   models generate some novel predictions on factors that explain variation
   in how organisms might respond adaptively to early stress. In
   particular, the state-dependent models of adaptive behavioral syndromes
   emphasize the importance of feedback loops between behavior and state
   variables in explaining the long-term persistence of effects of early
   experiences. State variables can include aspects of physiology,
   morphology or life history, differences among individuals in information
   state or skill, or even in social state (e.g., social rank). The
   feedbacks between behavior and individual state suggest a framework for
   an integrative approach to understanding responses to stress. The
   behavioral syndrome approach also emphasizes the importance of
   understanding stress carryovers - e.g., situations where effects of one
   kind of stressor (e.g., early social stress) carry over to influence
   other stress responses (e.g., response to danger) later in life.
   Finally, I discuss how responses to early stress might relate to
   variation in the ability of animals to cope well with novel conditions
   associated with human-induced rapid environmental change, a ubiquitous
   problem that animals face in the modern world. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that dysfunctions in the serotonin system
   and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) are associated strongly
   with suicidal behavior and suicide, especially among individuals with
   major depressive disorder. Suicidal behavior has been explained using
   both the stress-diathesis model and the state-trait interaction model.
   Specifically, diatheses, or trait-dependent risk factors, are associated
   with dysfunctions in the serotonin system; however, stress responses, or
   state-dependent factors, are associated with HPA hyperactivity.
   Decreases in cholesterol and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
   levels have been associated with impaired brain plasticity among
   individuals with suicidal behavior. Decreased serotonin functioning has
   been measured using cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) 5-HIAA, fenfluramine
   challenge studies, and platelet 5-HT2A receptors. HPA axis dysfunction
   has been evaluated with the dexamethasone suppression test Cholesterol
   and BDNF levels have been measured in blood serum or plasma.
   Nevertheless, challenges to finding promising and accessible
   neurobiological predictors of suicide and suicidal behavior remain. As
   suicide behavior is a complex phenomenon, a combined or multidimensional
   approach, including each of the aforementioned methods, may be required
   to predict suicide risk among individuals with major depressive

Abstract = {{Sick animals may change their feeding behaviour to compensate for

   infection affects (1) feeding behaviour of predators, (2) feeding
   behaviour using an experimental approach in the wild, (3) other costly

   experimentally infected males of the predatory damselfly Hetaerina
   americana in a field experiment. We hypothesized that infection would
   reduce feeding behaviour. We further predicted a reduction in
   territorial activity, an increase in immune response (measured by the
   activity of phenoloxidase, PO) and a reduction of fat reserves and
   flight-associated muscle mass (two traits usually traded off with immune
   ability and territorial behaviour). We also infected males in a
   laboratory experiment that controlled for food supply and territorial
   activity, and measured the same physiological characters. Immune
   challenges in the field experiment unexpectedly increased feeding rate
   but did not change territorial activities. Muscle mass was reduced in
   the field but not in the laboratory, probably because of differences in
   the presence of energetically expensive territorial activities. In the
   laboratory, starvation and infection reduced PO activity and fat stores
   but did not affect muscle mass. Thus, our field and laboratory results
   support the idea that increased feeding compensates for infections in

Abstract = {{Individuals with reduced body mass resulting from early nutritional
   stress often compensate for this later in growth. This compensatory
   growth can be beneficial as individuals adjust their body mass to the
   level of individuals that grew up under better conditions. Yet,
   compensatory growth can also result in costs that are paid later in
   life. In zebra finches raised under different nutritional conditions, we
   tested whether compensatory growth affects subsequent adult exploratory
   behaviour, a proxy for an avian personality trait. We tested their
   exploratory behaviour in a spatial test to find hidden food on 2
   consecutive days. The behavioural measures of exploration correlated
   with each other across time showing a high individual behavioural
   consistency. Early nutritional treatment itself did not affect
   exploration and feeding. Yet, birds with higher previous compensatory
   growth were less active and approached the food with different latencies
   from birds with lower compensatory growth. Life history decisions on
   whether to compensate for a bad start or stay small thus result in

Abstract = {{Causes of interspecific variation in growth rates within and among
   geographic regions remain poorly understood. Passerine birds represent
   an intriguing case because differing theories yield the possibility of
   an antagonistic interaction between nest predation risk and food
   delivery rates on evolution of growth rates. We test this possibility
   among 64 Passerine species studied on three continents, including
   tropical and north and south temperate latitudes. Growth rates increased
   strongly with nestling predation rates within, but not between, sites.
   The importance of nest predation was further emphasized by revealing
   hidden allometric scaling effects. Nestling predation risk also was
   associated with reduced total feeding rates and per-nestling feeding
   rates within each site. Consequently, faster growth rates were
   associated with decreased per-nestling food delivery rates across
   species, both within and among regions. These relationships suggest that
   Passerines can evolve growth strategies in response to predation risk
   whereby food resources are not the primary limit on growth rate
   differences among species. In contrast, reaction norms of growth rate
   relative to brood size suggest that food may limit growth rates within

Abstract = {{Individual variation in the way animals cope with stressors has been
   documented in a number of animal groups. In general, two distinct sets
   of behavioural and physiological responses to stress have been
   described: the proactive and the reactive coping styles. Some
   characteristics of stress coping style seem to be coupled to the time to
   emerge of fry from spawning redds in natural populations of salmonid
   fishes. In the present study, behavioural and physiological traits of
   stress coping styles were compared two and five months after emergence
   in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), using individuals with an early
   or late time to emerge. Initially, compared to late emerging
   individuals, early emerging individuals showed a shorter time to resume
   feeding after transfer to rearing in isolation. Resumption of feeding
   after isolation was suggested to be related to boldness behaviour,
   rather than hunger, in the present study. This observation was repeated
   five months after emergence, demonstrating behavioural consistency over
   time in this trait. However, in other traits of proactive and reactive
   stress coping styles, such as social status, resting metabolism or post
   stress cortisol concentrations, early and late emerging individuals did
   not differ. Therefore, this study demonstrates that boldness in a novel
   environment is uncoupled from other traits of the proactive and reactive
   stress coping styles in farmed salmonids. It is possible that this
   decoupling is caused by the low competitive environment in which fish
   were reared. In natural populations of salmonids, however, the higher
   selection pressure at emergence could select for early emerging
   individuals with a proactive coping style. (C) 2011 Published by

Abstract = {{The thrifty genotype hypothesis initiated speculation that feast and
   famine cycling throughout history may have led to group-specific
   alterations of the human genome, thereby augmenting the capacity for
   excessive fat mass accrual when immersed in the modern-day obesogenic
   environment. Contemporary work, however, suggests alternative mechanisms
   influencing fuel utilization and subsequent tissue partitioning to be
   more relevant in the etiology of population-based variation in adipose
   storage. The objective of this study was to evaluate the independent and
   interactive contribution of ancestral admixture as a proxy for
   population-based genetic variation and diet on adipose tissue deposition
   and distribution in peripubertal children and to identify differences in
   racial/ethnic and sex groups. Two-hundred seventy-eight children (53\%
   male) aged 7-12 years, categorized by parental self-report as African-
   (n = 91), European- (n = 110), or Hispanic American (n = 77),
   participated. Ancestral genetic admixture was estimated using 140
   ancestry informative markers. Body composition was evaluated by
   dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; energy expenditure by indirect
   calorimetry and accelerometry; and diet by 24-h-recall. Admixture
   independently contributed to all adiposity parameters; i.e., estimates
   of European and Amerindian ancestries were positively associated with
   all adiposity parameters, whereas African genetic admixture was
   inversely associated with adiposity. In boys, energy intake was
   associated with adiposity, irrespective of macronutrient profile,
   whereas in girls, the relationship was mediated by carbohydrate. We also
   observed moderating effects of energy balance/fuel utilization of the
   interaction between ancestral genetic admixture and diet. Interactive
   effects of genetic and non-genetic factors alter metabolic pathways and
   underlie some of the present population-based differences in fat
   storage. Am J Phys Anthropol 145:181-191, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss,

Title = {{Risk factors associated with hair loss, ulceration, and swelling at the
   hock in freestall-housed UK dairy herds}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to identify the risk factors associated
   with 3 presentations of hock lesions (hair loss, ulceration, and
   swelling) in freestall-housed lactating cattle. By independent
   identification and scoring of, and analysis of the factors associated
   with, hair loss, ulceration, and swelling, the aim was to identify
   whether risk factors were common to all 3, or differed among the
   presentations. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 76 herds in the
   UK during the winter housing period of 2007 to 2008, with a total of
   3,691 cows examined for hock lesions. A randomly selected sample of
   approximately 50 cows in each herd were scored for body condition,
   lameness, cleanliness, rising behavior, and lesions at the hocks. For
   all cows, hair loss, ulceration, and swelling were scored separately on
   4-point scales, with both left and right hocks scored. Based on a review
   of the literature, potential risk factors were identified and measured,
   collected from milk-recording data, or obtained through interviews with
   the farmers. Risk factors associated with hocks lesions in cattle were
   examined using data from the 2,982 cows housed in the 63
   freestall-housed herds visited. Risk factors for each of the 3 lesion
   presentations were considered separately in multilevel logistic
   regression models, with moderate or severe hair loss, any degree of
   ulceration, and moderate or severe swelling as the outcome variables.
   Thirty risk factors were identified, none of which were common to all 3
   lesion presentations. Five risk factors (locomotion score, number of
   days of winter housing, mean milk yield, freestall base material, and
   herd size) were common to both hair loss and ulceration. The stall
   bedding material was a common risk factor for both hair loss and
   swelling. A further 8, 5, and 11 risk factors were unique to hair loss,
   ulceration, and swelling, respectively. The existence of several
   differential risk factors between the 2 lesion presentations suggests
   that ulceration may not always be a direct extension of hair loss, as
   has been implied in previous scoring systems. Of the 12 risk factors
   associated with swelling, only 1 was common to another lesion
   presentation, which suggests that swelling may have a different etiology
   than hair loss and ulceration. The variables associated with the lesions
   indicate the importance of factors that affect the lying and rising
   behavior of the animal, including freestall structure and design, and
   the lying surface.}},

Abstract = {{The distributions of many freshwater organisms correlate with a gradient
   in canopy cover, ranging from sunny wetlands to closed woodland ponds.
   Little is known about mechanisms that exclude species from some sections
   of the gradient while allowing persistence in others. I addressed this
   question by manipulating shading in 740-l outdoor mesocosms and
   measuring several ecologically-relevant traits in three species of
   amphibian larva (Rana temporaria and Triturus alpestris, generalists
   occupying the entire gradient; and Hyla arborea, a specialist in open
   habitats). Shading caused delayed development, but had no effect on
   survival and increased the growth rate of R. temporaria. Body and tail
   color were darker in the shade. Plasticity in morphological shape,
   consisting of reduced gut width and increased tail size under shaded
   conditions, may reflect poor food availability and low dissolved oxygen.
   The canopy generalist R. temporaria increased activity in the shade,
   spent more time basking in shallow water, and maintained high larval
   performance. Unexpectedly, the specialist H. arborea was also highly
   plastic. These results describe extensive phenotypic plasticity induced
   by shade, and highlight traits that may influence performance along the
   canopy gradient.}},

Abstract = {{Early-onset drug taking is associated with increased likelihood of
   addiction, but it is unclear whether early onset is causal in
   development of addiction. Many other factors are associated with
   increased risk of addiction and also promote early intake. Here, a
   rodent model is used to explore the causality of early onset in
   development of self-administration and addiction-like behavior and to
   examine factors that promote self-administration.
   We used cocaine self-administration to examine drug taking and
   addiction-like behavior in adolescent and adult rats a priori
   characterized for their locomotor responses to novelty and cocaine and
   behavior in the light-dark task.
   Adolescent animals initially sought more cocaine than adults. However,
   as the adolescents matured, their intake fell and they did not differ
   from adults in terms of unreinforced lever-pressing, extinction or
   reinstatement behavior. For both age groups, self-administration was
   positively correlated with the locomotor response to novelty, the
   locomotor response to cocaine, and with time in light in the light-dark
   task. The rats that were insensitive to cocaine's locomotor effects and
   that spent the least time in light in the light-dark task sought the
   least cocaine, appearing to be ``protected{''} from the reinforcing
   effects of cocaine. There was no difference between the two age groups
   in appearance of this ``protected{''} phenotype.
   These results suggest that early onset of drug taking may promote
   increased use, but does not promote progression to addiction-like
   behavior. Furthermore, protective factors, such as innate anxiety and
   insensitivity to cocaine's pharmacological effects, function across
   developmental stages.}},

   determinants and modifying influences of biotic interactions}},
Journal = {{HYDROBIOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{668}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{61-108}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In view of its fundamental and pervasive influences and impacts on
   organism physiology and ecology, body size is recognized as a key
   component of evolutionary fitness and serves as the cornerstone of a
   seminal contribution in freshwater zooplankton ecology-the Size
   Efficiency Hypothesis (SEH) of Brooks \& Dodson (Science 150:28-35,
   1965). While the roles and implications of body size in predation and
   competition-central tenets of the SEH-have been widely considered and
   reviewed, no broader integrated synthesis exists of the collective array
   of body size determinants and their implications in the ecology in
   crustacean zooplankton-a numerically and functionally dominant group of
   aquatic organisms. Focusing on planktonic Cladocera and Copepoda in
   inland waters, in particular, we provide a wide-ranging overview of the
   direct and/or indirect effects of environmental conditions, consumable
   resources and biotic interactions that independently and/or collectively
   influence the phenotypic expression of body size (particularly as
   length), both within and between species. Some indirect ultimate
   evolutionary consequences of body size are considered, and we identify
   some controversies and unresolved issues related to this biologically
   crucial trait. While by no means exhaustive, our overview reveals a
   complex nexus of extrinsic proximate abiotic and biotic factors and
   interactions that influence body size, the phenotypic expression of
   which in natural systems commonly reflects contrasting outcomes related
   to conflicting direct and/or indirect selective pressures. In general,
   however, body size (both inter- and intra specifically) declines with
   rising temperature and increases with rising food supply (depending on
   its quality), although both temperature and food supply exert contrary
   influences on particular taxa (or life history stages) under certain
   environmental circumstances. Predation undoubtedly has an overriding
   influence on body size selection. Depending on its mechanistic basis
   (visual, tactile or both in tandem), it selectively favours either small
   or large body size, both within (adults vs. juveniles) and between prey
   species, which are accordingly often `size-trapped' between contrasting
   selective pressures, with consequent indirect effects. The bioenergetics
   of fundamental physiological processes undoubtedly set constraints on
   body size and serve as the primary determinant. However, within such
   constraints, the phenotypic expression of body size reflects its
   adaptive modification in response to the prevailing abiotic and biotic
   environment. As such, body size represents an emergent ecological
   property, reflecting the outcome of specific circumstances and
   conditions, which vary both temporally within and spatially between
   different ecosystems, and are accordingly context dependent.
   Nevertheless, underlying physiological advantages of larger size (within
   and between species) among crustacean zooplankters-lower mass-specific
   metabolic rates (although recently challenged), higher individual
   feeding rates (at least among cladocerans), potentially wider food
   size-ranges, better starvation tolerances, higher potential fecundity,
   etc.-collectively favour the selection of increased body size, as
   predicted by the SEH. Although competitive superiority of large size
   (measured in terms of minimal food requirements) has been confirmed
   experimentally, this cannot be generalized to natural conditions, where
   conflicting and temporally variable pressures apply, and contribute to
   generally mixed, and temporally variable body size compositions.
   Complex undrlying ecological interactions and influences ultimately
   determine the phenotypic expression of body size in directions
   consistent with fitness optimization under prevailing circumstances.
   Certain specific and general deficiencies in information are identified.
   In particular, the overwhelming emphasis on daphniid cladocerans as
   model study taxa in freshwater ecosystems has marginalized the
   acquisition of a comparably broad and penetrating understanding of
   specific features both of non-daphniid cladoceran and copepod life
   histories and body size selection. Among daphniid cladocerans,
   contemporary definitive understanding devolves largely from reductionist
   laboratory approaches. Holistic re-integration of these mechanistic
   findings into natural system circumstances presents a difficult
   challenge that is attracting increasingly attention. With regard to
   copepods, synthetic integration of the expansive marine knowledge base
   appears crucial to inform and direct future investigations on freshwater
   taxa. The question of intrinsic body size regulation in copepods and
   cladocerans, especially in regard to final phenotypic plasticity in body
   size expression, awaits resolution. Overall, body size remains a
   multi-facetted and complex topic, offering promising challenges for
   further investigation.}},

Title = {{Space Use of Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) Revealed by Radio-Tracking}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Accurate estimates of movement behavior and distances
   travelled by animals are difficult to obtain, especially for
   small-bodied insects where transmitter weights have prevented the use of
   radio-tracking.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we report the first successful use
   of micro radio telemetry to track flight distances and space use of
   bumblebees. Using ground surveys and Cessna overflights in a Central
   European rural landscape mosaic we obtained maximum flight distances of
   2.5 km, 1.9 km and 1.3 km for Bombus terrestris (workers), Bombus
   ruderatus (worker), and Bombus hortorum (young queens), respectively.
   Bumblebee individuals used large areas (0.25-43.53 ha) within one or a
   few days. Habitat analyses of one B. hortorum queen at the landscape
   scale indicated that gardens within villages were used more often than
   expected from habitat availability. Detailed movement trajectories of
   this individual revealed that prominent landscape structures (e. g.
   trees) and flower patches were repeatedly visited. However, we also
   observed long (i.e. >45 min) resting periods between flights (B.
   hortorum) and differences in flower-handling between bumblebees with and
   without transmitters (B. terrestris) suggesting that the current weight
   of transmitters (200 mg) may still impose significant energetic costs on
   the insects.
   Conclusions/Significance: Spatio-temporal movements of bumblebees can
   now be tracked with telemetry methods. Our measured flight distances
   exceed many previous estimates of bumblebee foraging ranges and suggest
   that travelling long distances to food resources may be common. However,
   even the smallest currently available transmitters still appear to
   compromise flower handling performance and cause an increase in resting
   behavior of bees. Future reductions of transmitter mass and size could
   open up new avenues for quantifying landscape-scale space use of insect
   pollinators and could provide novel insights into the behavior and
   requirements of bumblebees during critical life stages, e. g. when
   searching for mates, nest locations or hibernation sites.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary trends in obesity mean that research into whether
   unbalanced diets could impact on behavioural traits became increasingly
   important. The timing of exposure to obesity is particularly important,
   as sensitive periods during development have been identified where
   dietary extremes play a critical role in determining adult risk of
   physiological dysfunction. To this end, female Wistar rats were fed on
   chow or cafeteria diet (CD) for 8 weeks from weaning until mating. Half
   of the mated animals within each group were crossed-over to the
   alternative diet. This generated four treatment groups, differing in
   their pre-gestational and gestational diets. After birth, offspring of
   dams from each of the 4 pregnancy groups were further divided into
   groups, either being fed chow or CD throughout lactation.
   Anxiety-related behaviour and exploration in the offspring were tested
   in the Elevated Plus Maze (EMP) and the Open Field (OF) at 10 weeks of
   age. Maternal obesity significantly reduced the EPM locomotor activity
   in male and female offspring and grooming in males. Lactational CD had
   an anxiolytic effect in male offspring as shown in the EPM (increased
   entries into and more time on open arms) and the OF (shorter latency to
   enter the centre). In both sexes, lactational CD reduced grooming upon
   exposure to the EPM and the OF. Post mortem analysis revealed a
   stimulant effect of lactational CD on adipose tissue growth. The present
   study demonstrates that pre-gestational, gestational and lactational

Title = {{Resilience: is it possible to measure and influence it?}},
Journal = {{SALUD MENTAL}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{237-246}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to present a review about the concept of
   resilience, its biological aspects, the way we can try to measure it and
   some possible interventions.
   In Spanish, the term resiliencia is taken from the English word
   resilience or resiliency, term originally used in thermodynamics. In
   biological sciences, resilience is defined as ``the capability of an
   ecosystem or organism to recover its steadiness after it has suffered an
   alteration{''}. In psychosocial research, Rutter defines resilience as
   ``the relative resistance to the psychosocial experiences of risk{''}.
   For the resilience process to take place, it is necessary that
   individuals become exposed to an important stress and adversity load,
   and their efforts to contend them result in a positive adaptation in
   spite of suffering aggressions throughout the developmental process.
   When facing significant stress, three potential responses can be
   anticipated: 1. That individuals at risk show a better evolution than
   expected; 2. That a positive adaptation remains in spite of stressing
   experiences; or 3. That individuals reach an acceptable recovery after a
   trauma.
   The physiological response to the acute stress involves several
   neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and hormones, which have functional
   interactions that may produce a psychobiological response in the face of
   the acute stress and long term psychiatric consequences because they
   mediate mechanisms and neuronal paths that regulate reward, fear
   conditioning and social behavior. Cortisol, corticotropin-releasing
   hormone, norepinephrine, galanin, neuropeptide Y, dopamine and serotonin
   are some of the substances (physiological {[}or stress] mediators)
   implicated.
   After important stress exposure, we can say that a person has a
   resilient profile if his/her dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), neuropeptide
   Y, galanin, testosterone, 1A serotonin receptor (5HT1A) and
   benzodiazepine receptor levels are increased at the time that the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) and the locus coeruleus
   system functions are diminished.
   The biological factors associated with the acute and chronic stress can
   be considered a measure of resilience. For this purpose, the term
   allostasis, defined as the adaptive physiological response against the
   acute stress, has been proposed. Ideally, once the acute stress is
   suppressed, the individual is capable of recovering the state of
   homeostasis. However, if this does not occur and adaptive response
   against the acute stress persists or decreases only partially, it
   results in a harmful cumulative effect on the physiological and
   psychological functions of the individual. This phenomenon is
   denominated ``allostatic load{''}.
   To evaluate the allostatic load it is necessary to incorporate
   information on the usual levels of each individual's allostasis, and to
   evaluate the dynamics of the systems and the parameters of the main
   regulation systems.
   The parameters to evaluate the allostatic load are: a) Arterial systolic
   pressure >148 mmHg and arterial diastolic pressure >83 mmHg, which are
   the cardiovascular activity index; le) Waist-hip index > 0.94, that
   reflects the chronic metabolism function and the disposition of body
   fat; c) The total cholesterol/high density lipids (HDL)relation in serum
   >5.9, related with the development of atherosclerosis; d) Glycosylated
   hemoglobin levels >7.1\%, to identify the average of plasma glucose
   concentration over prolonged periods of time; e) Dehydroepiandrosterone
   sulfate (DHEA-S) <350 ng/ml, a functional antagonist of the HPAA; f)
   Nocturnal urinary cortisol excretion ratio >25.7 ug/g creatinine, which
   measures the 12 hours HPAA activity; g) Nocturnal urinary adrenaline >48
   ug/g creatinine, and noradrenaline excretion >5 ug/g creatinine; this
   test integrates the 12-hours indexes of the sympathetic nervous system
   activity.
   The appropriate study of resilience requires consideration to other
   aspects influencing its nature besides the biological ones. Some of them
   are: a) The risk factors, defined as events or conditions of adversity
   associated with the presence of psychopathology or dysfunctional
   development; b) The vulnerability factors, that is, the features,
   genetic biases and environmental or biological deficiencies which
   increase the stress and risk factors response; and c) The protective
   factors, described as features, contextual characteristics and
   interventions that promote the resistance, or moderate the effects, to
   the risk factors. The protective factors are associated with health and
   functional development; therefore, they promote resilience and offer new
   options to cope with the event.
   These factors are studied in three areas: those characteristic of
   children, in the family atmosphere and in the community.
   The characteristic factors of children are: intelligence, temperament,
   flexibility, sense of humor and self-esteem. Related to these a number
   of annotations have been made. For instance, in certain individual
   intelligence is modified due to a sequence of stress exposure, like
   family violence. Individuals with a resistant personality experience
   more trust and are better prepared to apply their abilities and take
   advantage of their social support; likewise, cooperativeness, kindliness
   and tolerance are characteristics that could help the child to deal with
   the presence of harsh conditions; and finally, people with a high
   opinion of themselves seem to be more resistant to stressing events.
   The factors of the family atmosphere are: maltreatment, parental loss,
   attachment and support, discipline and surveillance, carefulness and
   parents' mental illness. Regarding these factors it is possible to say
   that abuse can result in a disturbance of the normal development.
   Whereas a good care quality educational opportunities, appropriate
   nutrition and support from the community to the families, during the
   early childhood, propitiate a positive development at a cognitive,
   social and self-regulation level in both children and adolescents. It is
   known that resilient boys come from homes with structure and rules. For
   these children, the role of a healthy and reliable paternal figure
   serves as a model for identity and for the appropriate emotional
   expression. Instead, the resilient girls develop in homes that combine
   the emphasis in the taking of risks as well as the independence, besides
   they are supported by a caregiver.
   Finally, the factors in the community are: violence, social networks and
   neighborhood. It has been recognized that children who live in violent
   neighborhoods have a high risk of developing internalized and
   externalized disorders. Nevertheless, the acceptance of their peers and
   their friendships can attenuate their family adversity, what surely
   helps them to acquire social abilities; in that same direction, an
   appropriate social organization can reduce the impact of poverty and
   violence in the community.
   It is important to mention that these factors continually interact with
   each other (and should not be seen in an isolated way) in what we call
   adaptive systems, those which directly contribute to the satisfactory
   adjustment or recovery of balance after the exposure to one or more
   adverse events. When these adaptive systems are available and work
   properly, the individuals are said to be resilient. We know that in
   these adaptive systems, mainly in the first stages of life, a
   disturbance can exist as a consequence of chronic or acute exposure of
   the individual to adversity. The adaptive systems are as follows:
   learning, attachment, motivation, response to stress, self-modulation,
   family, school, pairs, cultural and social systems.
   In the study of resilience, it is impossible to solely have a biological
   or environmental vision. A gene-environment interplay perspective allows
   a more integrative model of this and other phenomena. There exist at
   least two types of gene-environment interplay: 1. The gene-environment
   correlation (r(GE)) and 2. The gene X environment interaction.
   Studies in maltreated children have been carried out, where genes
   implicated in the protection or decrease of risk to psychopathology have
   been identified. Certain genotypes confer protection for depression,
   schizophrenia, abuse of substances or maltreatment.
   To know some of the factors that may contribute to resilience leads us
   to the following question: will it be possible to intervene in
   populations at risk?
   From this perspective, the fact that children suffer damage as a
   consequence of the insult to their adaptive systems which are not
   completely developed, makes it possible to prevent the damage, and to
   repair or to improve these adaptive systems.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Aim of this study is to examine the epidemiology of
   paediatric headache and periodic syndromes in a school population and to
   evaluate the co-existence of environmental predisposing conditions.
   Design and methods: A 60-item questionnaire was completed by a
   school-based sample (n = 1536, ages 6-18 years). Diagnostic assessment
   of primary headache and periodic syndromes was established in first
   section; predisposing conditions in the second section; while the third
   section quantified the frequency of self medication and identified drugs
   most frequently used.
   Results: Headache was reported by 62.1\% of subjects. Socioeconomic
   status, composition of family unit and nutrition habits in the first
   year of life did not appear significantly different in subjects with
   headache compared to healthy controls. A good sleep quality was found in
   95.2\% of healthy controls, in 89.4\% of children with occasional
   headache. Recurrent abdominal pain, motor weakness and car sickness was
   significantly higher in primary headache group compared to occasional
   headache. Depressive/anxious traits were significantly higher in primary
   headache and occasional headache groups than in healthy controls. The
   frequency of aggressive traits was also higher in children with primary
   headache compared to occasional headache and healthy control subjects.
   72.5\% of subjects with primary headache and 58.4\% of children with
   occasional headache assumed medicines to relieve pain. Paracetamol was
   the most frequently assumed drug.
   Conclusions: Our data show a more frequent occurrence of
   anxious/depressive profile in children suffering from primary headache.
   In agreement with literature data, this research points out that
   self-treatment is a relevant problem in paediatric headache. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE-Fixed genomic variation explains only a small proportion of
   the risk of adiposity. In animal models, maternal diet alters offspring
   body composition, accompanied by epigenetic changes in metabolic control
   genes. Little is known about whether such processes operate in humans.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Using Sequenom MassARRAY we measured the
   methylation status of 68 CpGs 5' from five candidate genes in umbilical
   cord tissue DNA from healthy neonates. Methylation varied greatly at
   particular CpGs: for 31 CpGs with median methylation and a >= 5\% and a
   5-95\% range >= 10\%, we related methylation status to maternal
   pregnancy diet and to child's adiposity at age 9 years. Replication was
   sought in a second independent cohort.
   RESULTS-In cohort 1, retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRA) chr9: 136355885+
   and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) chr7: 150315553+
   methylation had independent associations with sex-adjusted childhood fat
   mass (exponentiated regression coefficient {[}beta] 17\% per SD change
   in methylation {[}95\% CI 4-311, P = 0.009, n = 64, and beta = 20\%
   {[}9-32], P < 0.001, n = 66, respectively) and \%fat mass (beta = 10\%
   {[}1-19], P = 0.023, n = 64 and beta =12\% {[}4-20], P = 0.002, n = 66,
   respectively). Regression analyses including sex and neonatal epigenetic
   marks explained > 25\% of the variance in childhood adiposity. Higher
   methylation of RXRA chr9: 136355885+, but not of eNOS chr7:150315553+,
   was associated with lower maternal carbohydrate intake in early
   pregnancy, previously linked with higher neonatal adiposity in this
   population. In cohort 2, cord eNOS chr7:150315553+ methylation showed no
   association with adiposity, but RXRA chr9:136355885+ methylation showed
   similar associations with fat mass and \%fat mass (beta = 6\% {[}2-10]
   and beta = 4\% {[}1-7], respectively, both P = 0.002, n = 239).
   CONCLUSIONS-Our findings suggest a substantial component of metabolic
   disease risk has a prenatal developmental basis. Perinatal epigenetic
   analysis may have utility in identifying individual vulnerability to
   later obesity and metabolic disease. Diabetes 60:1528-1534, 2011}},

Abstract = {{To increase their chances of survival and reproduction, animals must
   detect changes in food quality and then decide if, and how quickly, to
   adjust their behavior. How quickly an animal responds to change will
   depend on the information available (cognitive, sensory, or
   physiological) and how it weights those types of information. Surrogate
   measures of meal size suggest that sensory information is used to make
   initial choices about how much to eat following changes in resource
   quality, choices are subsequently altered and refined as further
   information becomes available. Using direct measures, we investigated
   the amount of food consumed, the time taken to feed, and the interbout
   intervals between visits to a feeder of rufous hummingbirds, before and
   after changes in sucrose concentration. The hummingbirds did not change
   how much they drank at first experience of a new concentration but then
   rapidly adjusted meal sizes toward optimal for that concentration over a
   few feeding visits. Thus, it seems the hummingbirds used both cognitive
   and physiological information to decide how much to drink but appeared
   to ignore sensory information, such as taste. The early responses
   animals make to changed resources enable us to determine the types of
   information on which they rely most in their decision making.}},

Abstract = {{P>There is increasing evidence that the early life environment, of which
   nutrition is a key component, acts through developmental adaptations to
   set the capacity of cardiovascular and metabolic pathways, and
   ultimately the limits to physiological challenges in later life.
   Suboptimal maternal nutrition and fetal growth result in reduced
   microvascular perfusion and functional dilator capacity, which are
   strongly associated with later development of obesity, type 2 diabetes,
   and hypertension. These conditions are also linked to microvascular
   rarefaction and remodeling that together limit capillary recruitment,
   reduce exchange capacity and increase diffusion distances of metabolic
   substrates, and increase local and overall peripheral resistance.
   Changes in small vessel structure and function may be seen very early,
   long before the onset of overt cardiovascular and metabolic disease, and
   may thus be a target for early therapeutic and lifestyle intervention
   strategies. This article explores how a disadvantageous microvascular
   phenotype may result from perinatal priming and how developmental
   plasticity may become an important and additional risk determinant in

Abstract = {{Nutrient balancing is well known in herbivores and omnivores, but has
   only recently been demonstrated in predators. To test how a predator
   might regulate nutrients when the prey varies in nutrient composition,
   we restricted juvenile Pardosa prativaga wolf spiders to diets of one of
   six fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, prey types varying in lipid:
   protein composition during their second instar. We collected all fly
   remnants to estimate food and nutrient intake over each meal. The
   spiders adjusted their capture rate and nutrient extraction in response
   to prey mass and nutrient composition irrespective of energy intake.
   Intake was initially regulated to a constant lipid plus protein mass,
   but later spiders fed on prey with high proportions of protein increased
   consumption relative to spiders fed on other prey types. This pattern
   indicates that the spiders were prepared to overconsume vast amounts of
   protein to gain more lipids and energy. The spiders also regulated
   protein after ingestion, and ingested protein was incorporated less
   efficiently into body tissue when the prey was protein rich. Despite
   both pre- and postingestive nutrient regulation, the body lipid: protein
   compositions of the spiders were highly affected by the nutrient
   compositions of their prey, and growth in carapace length and lean body
   mass increased with increasing prey protein: lipid ratio. Our results
   demonstrate that prey nutrient composition affects these predators, but
   also that the spiders possess behavioural and physiological adaptations
   that lead to partial compensation for these effects. (C) 2011 The

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{166}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{69-78}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Changes in dietary preferences in animal species play a pivotal role in
   niche specialization. Here, we investigate how divergence of foraging
   behaviour affects the trophic position of animals and thereby their role
   for ecosystem processes. As a model, we used two closely related bat
   species, Myotis myotis and M. blythii oxygnathus, that are
   morphologically very similar and share the same roosts, but show clear
   behavioural divergence in habitat selection and foraging. Based on
   previous dietary studies on synanthropic populations in Central Europe,
   we hypothesised that M. myotis would mainly prey on predatory arthropods
   (i.e., secondary consumers) while M. blythii oxygnathus would eat
   herbivorous insects (i.e., primary consumers). We thus expected that the
   sibling bats would be at different trophic levels. We first conducted a
   validation experiment with captive bats in the laboratory and measured
   isotopic discrimination, i.e., the stepwise enrichment of heavy in
   relation to light isotopes between consumer and diet, in insectivorous
   bats for the first time. We then tested our trophic level hypothesis in
   the field at an ancient site of natural coexistence for the two species
   (Bulgaria, south-eastern Europe) using stable isotope analyses. As
   predicted, secondary consumer arthropods (carabid beetles; Coleoptera)
   were more enriched in N-15 than primary consumer arthropods
   (tettigoniids; Orthoptera), and accordingly wing tissue of M. myotis was
   more enriched in N-15 than tissue of M. blythii oxygnathus. According to
   a Bayesian mixing model, M. blythii oxygnathus indeed fed almost
   exclusively on primary consumers (98\%), while M. myotis ate a mix of
   secondary (50\%), but also, and to a considerable extent, primary
   consumers (50\%). Our study highlights that morphologically almost
   identical, sympatric sibling species may forage at divergent trophic
   levels, and, thus may have different effects on ecosystem processes.}},

   A total of 1,147 adults with type 2 diabetes completed a self-report

   The model explained 27.1 and 18.2\% of the variance for HRQL and LS,

Abstract = {{Environmental conditions experienced early in life have been shown to
   significantly affect growth trajectories at later stages in many
   vertebrate species. Amphibians typically have a biphasic life history,
   with an aquatic larval phase during early development and a subsequent
   terrestrial adult phase after completed metamorphosis. Thus, the early
   conditions have an especially strong impact on the future survival and
   fitness of amphibians. We studied whether early nutritional conditions
   affect the behavioural reaction of fire salamander larvae (Salamandra
   salamandra) before completion of metamorphosis. Fire salamander larvae
   reared under rich nutritional conditions were heavier and larger,
   displayed better body condition overall throughout the first three month
   of life and metamorphosed earlier compared with larvae raised under poor
   nutritional conditions. Specifically, we tested whether larvae reared
   under these different conditions differed with respect to their
   risk-taking behaviour and activity. We found no differences in the
   activity of larvae with respect to their experienced early food
   conditions. However, larvae reared under poor nutritional conditions hid
   significantly more often in a risk-taking test than larvae reared under
   rich food conditions. This increase in shelter-seeking behaviour might
   be an adaptation to reduce the risk of larval drift or an adaptation to
   compensate for physiological deficits in part by appropriate behavioural
   reactions. Our results indicate that environmental conditions, such as
   food availability, may lead to different behavioural strategies.}},

   in Three Duck Species}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 20}},
Abstract = {{Predation directly triggers behavioural decisions designed to increase
   immediate survival. However, these behavioural modifications can have
   long term costs. There is therefore a trade-off between antipredator
   behaviours and other activities. This trade-off is generally considered
   between vigilance and only one other behaviour, thus neglecting
   potential compensations. In this study, we considered the effect of an
   increase in predation risk on the diurnal time-budget of three captive
   duck species during the wintering period. We artificially increased
   predation risk by disturbing two groups of 14 mallard and teals at
   different frequencies, and one group of 14 tufted ducks with a
   radio-controlled stressor. We recorded foraging, vigilance, preening and
   sleeping durations the week before, during and after disturbance
   sessions. Disturbed groups were compared to an undisturbed control
   group. We showed that in all three species, the increase in predation
   risk resulted in a decrease in foraging and preening and led to an
   increase in sleeping. It is worth noting that contrary to common
   observations, vigilance did not increase. However, ducks are known to be
   vigilant while sleeping. This complex behavioural adjustment therefore
   seems to be optimal as it may allow ducks to reduce their predation
   risk. Our results highlight the fact that it is necessary to encompass
   the whole individual time-budget when studying behavioural modifications
   under predation risk. Finally, we propose that studies of behavioural
   time-budget changes under predation risk should be included in the more
   general framework of the starvation-predation risk trade-off.}},

Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{952-966}},

Abstract = {{Immunosenescence, the aging of the immune system, is well documented in
   humans and laboratory models and is known to increase infection risk,
   morbidity, and mortality among the old. Immunosenescence patterns have
   recently been unveiled in various free-living populations, but their
   consequences in the wild have not been explored. We investigated the
   consequences of immunosenescence in free-living Tree Swallows
   Tachycineta bicolor through a field experiment simulating a bacterial
   infection (challenge with lipopolysaccharide, LPS) in females of
   different ages during the nestling rearing period. We assessed
   behavioral and physiological responses of females, as well as growth and
   quality of their offspring, to determine the costs associated with the
   simulated infection. Results of the experiment differed between the two
   years of study. In the first year, old females challenged with LPS lost
   more body mass and reduced their nest visitation rates more, and their
   offspring tended to grow slower compared to similarly challenged younger
   females. In contrast, in the second year, old females did not appear to
   suffer larger costs than younger ones. Interestingly, immunosenescence
   was only detected during the first year of the study, suggesting that it
   is the dysregulated immune function characteristic of immunosenescent
   individuals rather than age per se that can lead to higher costs of
   immune defense in old individuals. These results provide the first
   evidence of costs of immunosenescence in free-living animals and support
   the hypothesis that old, immunosenescent individuals pay higher costs
   than younger ones when faced with a challenge to their immune system.
   Our results also suggest that these costs are mediated by an exaggerated
   sickness behavior, as seen in laboratory models, and can be modulated by
   ecological factors such as weather conditions and food availability.}},

   sleeping sites on the ranging behavior of 2 groups of white-headed
   langurs (Trachypithecus leucocephalus) in a limestone habitat at Fusui
   Nature Reserve, China, between August 2007 and July 2008. During the
   study period, the total home range sizes for the 2 focal groups were
   23.8 ha and 33.8 ha, the mean daily path lengths were 491 m and 512 m,
   and leaves accounted for 83.4\% and 91.0\% of the diet, which are well
   within the range of variation reported for other Trachypithecus. One
   focal group traveled significantly longer distances in the rainy season
   months than in the dry season months. This variation may be related to
   the seasonal difference in food availability and diet. The langurs did
   not use their home ranges uniformly, and 50\% of their activities
   occurred within 11\% (group 1) and 20\% (group 2) of their home ranges.
   The most heavily used quadrats in the home ranges were located near the
   most frequently used sleeping sites. Moreover, the core areas (> 70\% of
   location records) of both groups' home ranges included >= 1 permanent
   water pool. The langurs ventured to these pools for drinking when
   surface water became scarce in the dry season. These results suggest
   that sleeping sites and water scarcity may be significant influences on
   the ranging behavior of white-headed langurs in limestone habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Plasticity in developmental programming has evolved in order to provide
   the best chances of survival and reproductive success to the organism
   under changing environments. Environmental conditions that are
   experienced in early life can profoundly influence human biology and
   long-term health. Developmental origins of health and disease and
   life-history transitions are purported to use placental, nutritional,
   and endocrine cues for setting long-term biological, mental, and
   behavioral strategies in response to local ecological and/or social
   conditions. The window of developmental plasticity extends from
   preconception to early childhood and involves epigenetic responses to
   environmental changes, which exert their effects during life-history
   phase transitions. These epigenetic responses influence development,
   cell-and tissue-specific gene expression, and sexual dimorphism, and, in
   exceptional cases, could be transmitted transgenerationally.
   Translational epigenetic research in child health is areiterative
   process that ranges from research in the basic sciences, preclinical
   research, and pediatric clinical research. Identifying the epigenetic
   consequences of fetal programming creates potential applications in
   clinical practice: the development of epigenetic biomarkers for early
   diagnosis of disease, the ability to identify susceptible individuals at
   risk for adult diseases, and the development of novel preventive and
   curative measures that are based on diet and/or novel epigenetic drugs.

Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{Background: It is no surprise that it has taken over four decades to
   confirm and extend the crucial role of dopamine and related genes and
   gene deficits in the etiology of risk for drug dependence. Hundreds of
   studies, enabled by neuroscience neuroimaging and genetic advances, have
   been reported. While dopamine theories have been reported, confirmed,
   replicated and replicated again, changes have been slow to move from the
   bench to the bedside. Unlike penicillin used to target certain
   infections, addiction requires the consent, motivation and enthusiastic
   participation of the patient. Clearly, current treatment has not caught
   up with advances in the science. In-patient and out-patient treatment
   still relies on detoxification, abstinence and 12 step programs.
   Addiction is a chronic and relapsing disease. Addiction treatment can be
   reported as cures at 3 or 6 weeks, only to be clearly failures at 1 or 5
   years. The logical standard of care should focus on detoxifying,
   stabilizing and returning the patient to the pre-loss of control or
   pre-addiction neurochemical state.
   Method: Pre-clinical and clinical data on neurochemistry and
   neurogenetics of Substance Use Disorder (SUD) as it relates to both
   relapse and drug hunger has been reviewed.
   Results: We are proposing herein that efforts to physiologically
   integrate known neural mechanisms with other psychotherapeutic treatment
   options to combat relapse should be encouraged. It is well known that
   after prolonged abstinence, recovered addicts are particularly
   vulnerable to relapse. Individuals who use their drug of choice after
   abstinence experience a powerful euphoria that can quickly precipitate a
   full-blown relapse. While a biological explanation for this conundrum
   has remained elusive, we hypothesize that this clinically observed
   ``supersensitivity{''} might be the result of pre-morbid or state
   genetic hypodopaminergic polymorphisms.
   Hypothesis: We are proposing that recent studies have indicated that
   genetic, personality and environmental factors are predictors of drug
   use in adolescents. Exploration of various treatment approaches for the
   most part reveal poor outcomes in terms of relapse prevention and
   continued drug hunger. The authors are proposing a new paradigm shift in
   residential, non-residential and aftercare involving the incorporation
   of genetic testing to identify risk alleles coupled with D2 receptor
   stimulation using neuroadatogen amino acid precursor enkephlinase -
   catecholamine-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibition therapy. A natural but
   therapeutic nutraceutical formulation potentially induces DA release
   could cause the induction of D2-directed mRNA and proliferation of D2
   receptors in the human. We further hypothesize that this proliferation
   of D2 receptors in turn will induce the attenuation of drug-like craving
   behavior. Finally, pharmacological therapies have had limited success
   because these powerful agents have focused on maintenance or
   interference with drug euphoria rather than correcting or compensating
   for pre-morbid dopamine system deficits These concepts await further
   confirmation via required neuroimaging studies. (C) 2011 Published by

Abstract = {{In the present paper, we explore a novel preparation for the study of
   animal choice behaviour designed to capture some aspects of naturally
   occurring patch exploitation. Although one can cast the problem of patch
   exploitation as a binary choice, naturally occurring patch-leaving
   decisions are inevitably asymmetric. We asked whether captive blue jays,
   Cyanocitta cristata, treat leaving and staying in the same way. To do
   this we factorially varied the delays associated with leaving and
   staying in a food patch. In addition, we manipulated our subject's level
   of motivation (e. g. hunger) using prefeeding treatments. We found that
   hungry subjects came closest to our prediction of treating leaving and
   staying in the same way, but that less motivated subjects showed a
   pronounced and surprising bias in favour of leaving. We discuss the
   implications of results for experimental and theoretical studies and
   choice behaviour. We suggest that students of choice behaviour need to
   understand the sources of such biases because naturally occurring choice
   situations are seldom perfectly symmetrical. (C) 2010 The Association

Abstract = {{We examined how availability of brine shrimps, Artemia parthenogenetica,
   influenced temporal aspects of foraging behaviour and population
   dynamics of moulting black-necked grebes, Podiceps nigricollis, from
   late August to early December in four salt ponds in the Odiel marshes,
   southern Spain, in 2008 and 2009. The moulting grebe population was
   higher in 2009, coinciding with an increase in shrimp biomass, with a
   peak of 2,500 birds in October. Grebes increased their time spent
   foraging as the season progressed, coinciding with decreases in shrimp
   biomass and water temperature. Foraging activity was lower in 2009, when
   shrimp biomass was greater. Diving was the most frequent feeding method,
   especially as the season progressed. Brine shrimps at the bottom of the
   water column were larger than those near the surface. Differences
   between years in grebe body mass suggest that changing shrimp
   availability and water temperature had an influence on body condition.
   The grebe population consumed an estimated 0.2-2.0\% of the standing
   crop of Artemia per day, with this fraction increasing as the season
   progresses, thus contributing to the decline in the Artemia population.
   Our results suggest that moulting grebes are probably only able to
   adjust foraging effort within certain limits, especially at the end of
   moulting period when thermal stress is greatest and food supply is
   lowest. They may leave the study area when they can no longer meet their
   energy requirements.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{2}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Phenological events of plants and animals are sensitive to climatic
   processes. Migration is a life-history event exhibited by most large
   herbivores living in seasonal environments, and is thought to occur in
   response to dynamics of forage and weather. Decisions regarding when to
   migrate, however, may be affected by differences in life-history
   characteristics of individuals. Long-term and intensive study of a
   population of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in the Sierra Nevada,
   California, USA, allowed us to document patterns of migration during 11
   years that encompassed a wide array of environmental conditions. We used
   two new techniques to properly account for interval-censored data and
   disentangle effects of broad-scale climate, local weather patterns, and
   plant phenology on seasonal patterns of migration, while incorporating
   effects of individual life-history characteristics. Timing of autumn
   migration varied substantially among individual deer, but was associated
   with the severity of winter weather, and in particular, snow depth and
   cold temperatures. Migratory responses to winter weather, however, were
   affected by age, nutritional condition, and summer residency of
   individual females. Old females and those in good nutritional condition
   risked encountering severe weather by delaying autumn migration, and
   were thus risk-prone with respect to the potential loss of foraging
   opportunities in deep snow compared with young females and those in poor
   nutritional condition. Females that summered on the west side of the
   crest of the Sierra Nevada delayed autumn migration relative to
   east-side females, which supports the influence of the local environment
   on timing of migration. In contrast, timing of spring migration was
   unrelated to individual life-history characteristics, was nearly twice
   as synchronous as autumn migration, differed among years, was related to
   the southern oscillation index, and was influenced by absolute snow
   depth and advancing phenology of plants. Plasticity in timing of
   migration in response to climatic conditions and plant phenology may be
   an adaptive behavioral strategy, which should reduce the detrimental
   effects of trophic mismatches between resources and other life-history
   events of large herbivores. Failure to consider effects of nutrition and
   other life-history traits may cloud interpretation of phenological
   patterns of mammals and conceal relationships associated with climate
   change.}},

Abstract = {{Hippocampal function has been implicated in mood and anxiety disorders,
   as well as in the response to antidepressant (AD) treatment. However,
   the significance of new neurons in the therapeutic mechanism of ADs
   remains unclear. In this study, the proliferation of new neurons was
   inhibited through conditional deletion of ataxia telangeictasia-mutated
   and rad-3 related (ATR), a cell cycle checkpoint kinase, and cellular
   and behavioral outcomes following AD exposure were evaluated. ATR was
   conditionally deleted by microinjecting a Cre recombinase-expressing
   virus into the hippocampus of floxed-ATR mice. Behavioral assessment in
   multiple rodent models of affective state revealed anxiolytic-like
   behavior in the elevated zero maze, marble burying test, and
   novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) test. The efficacy of chronic
   desipramine (DMI) treatment was evaluated in the NIH test, as this
   paradigm is thought to be sensitive to increases in neurogenesis by
   chronic AD exposure. Chronic exposure to DMI reduced hyponeophagia in
   the NIH test in control mice, whereas DMI had no behavioral effect in
   ATR-deleted mice. Although DMI did not alter cell proliferation in
   either group, it did produce a robust increase in dendritic spine
   density in control mice, indicative of enhanced neuronal plasticity.
   This effect of DMI on spine density was severely attenuated following
   ATR deletion. These findings demonstrate that reductions in basal
   neurogenesis produce an anxiolytic phenotype and reduce AD efficacy in
   behaviors requiring chronic exposure. Furthermore, attenuated capacity
   for synaptic remodeling may underlie these behaviors. ATR deletion may
   serve as a valuable model to study the various proposed roles of newborn

Abstract = {{Mineral licks-also known as ``salados,{''} ``saladeros,{''} or
   ``collpas{''}-are specific sites in tropical and temperate ecosystems
   where a large diversity of mammals and birds come regularly to feed on
   soil. Although the reasons for vertebrate geophagy are not completely
   understood, animals are argued to obtain a variety of nutritional and
   health benefits from the ingestion of soil at mineral licks. We studied
   the temporal patterns of mineral lick use by white-bellied spider monkey
   (Ateles belzebuth) and red howler monkey (Alouatta seniculus) in a
   lowland rain forest in Amazonian Ecuador. Using camera and video traps
   at four different mineral licks, combined with behavioral follows of one
   group of spider monkeys, we documented rates of mineral lick visitation
   by both primate species and the relative frequency and intensity of
   mineral lick use by spider monkeys. On the basis of 1,612 days and 888
   nights of mineral lick monitoring, we found that A. belzebuth and A.
   seniculus both visit mineral licks frequently throughout the year (on
   average similar to 14\% of days for both species), and mineral lick
   visitation was influenced by short-term environmental conditions (e.g.
   sunny and dry weather). For spider monkeys, the area surrounding the
   lick was also the most frequently and most intensively used region
   within the group's home range. The fact that spider monkeys spent long
   periods at the lick area before coming to the ground to obtain soil, and
   the fact that both species visited the lick preferentially during dry
   sunny conditions (when predator detectability is presumed to be
   relatively high) and visited simultaneously more often than expected by
   chance, together suggest that licks are indeed perceived as risky areas
   by these primates. We suggest that howler and spider monkeys employ
   behavioral strategies aimed at minimizing the probability of predation
   while visiting the forest floor at risky mineral lick sites. Am. J.

Title = {{Does Environmental Enrichment Reduce Stress? An Integrated Measure of
   Corticosterone from Feathers Provides a Novel Perspective}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 11}},
Abstract = {{Enrichment is widely used as tool for managing fearfulness, undesirable
   behaviors, and stress in captive animals, and for studying exploration
   and personality. Inconsistencies in previous studies of physiological
   and behavioral responses to enrichment led us to hypothesize that
   enrichment and its removal are stressful environmental changes to which
   the hormone corticosterone and fearfulness, activity, and exploration
   behaviors ought to be sensitive. We conducted two experiments with a
   captive population of wild-caught Clark's nutcrackers (Nucifraga
   columbiana) to assess responses to short- (10-d) and long-term (3-mo)
   enrichment, their removal, and the influence of novelty, within the same
   animal. Variation in an integrated measure of corticosterone from
   feathers, combined with video recordings of behaviors, suggests that how
   individuals perceive enrichment and its removal depends on the duration
   of exposure. Short- and long-term enrichment elicited different
   physiological responses, with the former acting as a stressor and birds
   exhibiting acclimation to the latter. Non-novel enrichment evoked the
   strongest corticosterone responses of all the treatments, suggesting
   that the second exposure to the same objects acted as a physiological
   cue, and that acclimation was overridden by negative past experience.
   Birds showed weak behavioral responses that were not related to
   corticosterone. By demonstrating that an integrated measure of
   glucocorticoid physiology varies significantly with changes to
   enrichment in the absence of agonistic interactions, our study sheds
   light on potential mechanisms driving physiological and behavioral
   responses to environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat alteration by humans may change the supply of food and cover for
   wild ungulates, but few studies have examined how these resources are
   utilised over time by individuals of different sex and reproductive
   status. We examined circadian and seasonal variation in habitat
   utilisation within a moose Alces alces population in central Norway. Our
   study area covers forests and open habitats, both influenced by human
   alterations (e.g. forestry and agriculture). We expected moose to select
   habitats with good forage and cover in all seasons, but to select open
   foraging habitats mainly during night-time. Moose selected good foraging
   habitats, such as young forest stands and cultivated land during night,
   whereas the utilisation of older forest stands providing cover increased
   during daytime. This circadian pattern changed throughout the year,
   seemingly related to variation in hours of daylight and provision of
   forage. Young forest stands provided higher density of preferred food
   plants compared to older stands and were highly selected from spring
   until autumn. Relative to young forest, the selection for older forest
   stands increased towards winter, likely due to provision of higher plant
   quality late in the growing season, and to reduced accumulation of
   movement-impeding snow during winter. Selection of cultivated land
   varied among seasons, being highest when crop biomass was high. We also
   found some indications of state-dependent habitat selection as
   reproducing females avoided open, food rich areas in the first months
   after their calves were born, whereas males and females without young
   selected these areas in spring and summer. Our results clearly show that
   moose exploit the variations in cover and food caused by forestry and
   agriculture. This is particularly relevant for moose in Norway as
   current changes in forestry practice lead to a reduction in young,
   food-rich forest stands, possibly aggravating the already declining body
   conditions and recruitment rates of moose.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptations that minimize the effects of stress are important components
   of avian development and have a role in structuring the relationship
   between development and fitness. I examined the effect of experimental
   manipulations of developmental stress during the nestling and fledgling
   stages on weight gain, growth in structural size, and take-off flight
   speed of juvenile mourning doves Zenaida macroura. Brood size was
   manipulated during the nestling stage (< 11 days) and feeding rates
   during the fledgling stage (13-25 days) using a full factorial design.
   Effects of nutritional stress differed between the two treatments and
   depended on the response that was measured and the age at which it was
   measured. Treatment effects on flight ability were delayed and were
   greater for the treatment during the nestling stage than during the
   fledgling stage. Immediate treatment effects were greater than delayed
   effects on weight and size. Young were able to minimize effects of
   stress on flight ability at early ages when they would be most
   vulnerable to predation. However, by 90 days birds from enlarged broods
   were slower and flight time at 90 days was negatively correlated with
   weight and size at 25 days. There was no evidence for a cost of
   compensatory growth after experimental treatments ended on flight
   ability at 90 days. Results suggest that the effects of stress occur in
   a hierarchical manner across phenotypic components and that at early
   ages flight ability is prioritized through phenotypic plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary sexual traits are expected to reflect a balance between sexual
   selection and natural selection. We test the hypothesis that plasticity
   in sexual advertisement behaviors can influence this trade-off, allowing
   showier traits than expected for a given level of predation risk.
   Specifically, we tested whether the degree of behavioral plasticity
   exhibited in response to chemical cues of a co-occurring predatory wolf
   spider corresponds to courtship rate and the degree of ornamentation in
   male wolf spiders. Both ornamented (brush-legged) males and
   non-ornamented males decreased locomotion, decreased their likelihood to
   court, and increased their time to initiate courtship in response to
   predator cues. However, brush-legged males increased their time to
   initiate courtship more than did non-ornamented males, demonstrating a
   greater response to the risk of predation for the more ornamented males.
   Similarly, within brush-legged males, individuals with the highest
   courtship rates also showed the greatest degree of plasticity in time to
   initiate courtship across predation contexts, whereas behavioral
   plasticity was independent of courtship rate for non-ornamented males.
   We found no correlation between ornament size and plasticity in response
   to predator cues within brush-legged males. Ultimately, we suggest that
   our data provide support for the hypothesis that behavioral plasticity
   in response to predator cues may alter the trade-off between predation
   risk and sexual advertisement and may be more important for males with
   higher degrees of conspicuousness in ornamentation and courtship.}},

Abstract = {{Genetically engineered fish are nearing commercialization for
   aquaculture. If transgenic fish escape from farms, they could encounter
   and interbreed with natural populations. Relative advantages of
   transgenic fish for fitness-related traits could drive population
   processes like gene flow, but fitness trait estimates will best inform
   risk assessments if measured under environmental conditions that are
   relevant to natural environments. Wild-type and growth-enhanced
   transgenic Japanese medakas Oryzias latipes of different genetic
   backgrounds were compared for the following fitness traits: fecundity,
   fertility, survival to sexual maturity, age at sexual maturity, and
   mating advantage. Because food availability and predation have been
   shown to alter the life histories of growth-enhanced transgenic fish, we
   measured traits under four different environments: (1) high food
   availability and no predation, (2) high food availability with simulated
   predation, (3) low food availability and no predation, and (4) low food
   availability with simulated predation. We found that regardless of
   environment, there was no clear fitness trend by genotype: transgenic
   females were more fecund than wild-type females, wild-type males
   obtained more matings than transgenic males, and offspring of transgenic
   x wild-type crosses had higher survival to sexual maturity than
   offspring of two wild-type parents, possibly due to heterosis.
   Regardless of genotype, females produced more eggs in environments with
   high food availability and matured fastest under conditions of high food
   availability and no predation. Our results imply that population-level
   processes like gene flow will be difficult to predict from measurements
   of one or two fitness traits taken on fish in a single environment.
   Therefore, gene flow risk assessments should be based on estimates of
   fitness traits that span the entire life cycle, incorporate relevant
   environmental variation, and compare the transgenic fish strain with a
   wild-type strain of relevant genetic background.}},

Abstract = {{Current work in behavioral ecology contrasts traditional hypotheses of
   context-specific adaptation with the suggestion that behaviors are often
   coupled such that animals exhibit context-general behavioral syndromes.
   Wasteful killing, the partial consumption and/or abandonment of prey, is
   a perplexing phenomenon because the costs of this behavior seem high
   (e.g. energetic loss, risk of injury). Wasteful killing may be the
   product of a context-specific, adaptive foraging strategy restricted
   spatially and/or temporally to conditions of prey abundance.
   Alternatively, wasteful killing may represent a context-general syndrome
   of high aggression that results in the capture of prey that are not
   consumed. We investigated the conditions in which a web-building spider
   the North American black widow (Latrodectus hesperus) participates in
   wasteful killing. We employed a powerful repeated-measures design that
   reduces error variance by controlling for individual differences. Across
   the adult life cycle of female spiders collected from urban habitats
   throughout Phoenix, AZ, we repeatedly measured each spider's foraging
   voracity and wastefulness after varied periods of food restriction (2,
   7, and 14 d). While food restriction decreased body condition, condition
   alone was a poor predictor of voracity and wasteful killing. Our results
   indicate that previous food restriction i) shortens latency to attack,
   ii) heightens the number of prey killed per trial, and iii) reduces
   wastefulness. Latency to attack and wasteful killing were neither
   repeatable within individuals nor correlated with each other and
   therefore appear unlikely to be components of a behavioral syndrome. We
   discuss other possible benefits for wasteful killing in the contexts of
   predation risk and mate attraction.}},

Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{317-322}},

Abstract = {{An extensive literature has documented differences in the way individual
   animals cope with environmental challenges and stressors. Two broad
   patterns of individual variability in behavioural and physiological
   stress responses are described as the proactive and reactive stress
   coping styles. In addition to variability in the stress response,
   contrasting coping styles may encompass a general difference in
   behavioural flexibility as opposed to routine formation in response to
   more subtle environmental changes and non-threatening novelties. In the
   present study two different manipulations, relocating food from a
   previously learned location, and introducing a novel object yielded
   contrasting responses in rainbow trout selected for high (HR) and low
   (LR) post stress plasma cortisol levels. No difference was seen in the
   rate of learning the original food location: however, proactive LR fish
   were markedly slower than reactive HR fish in altering their food
   seeking behaviour in response to relocated food. In contrast, LR fish
   largely ignored a novel object which disrupted feeding in HR fish.
   Hence, it appears that the two lines appraise environmental cues
   differently. This observation suggests that differences in
   responsiveness to environmental change are an integral component of
   heritable stress coping styles, which in this particular case, had
   opposite effects on foraging efficiency in different situations. Context
   dependent fitness effects may thus explain the persistence of stable
   divergence of this evolutionary widespread trait complex. (C) 2010

   spider mites, and A. andersoni is a broad generalist. Immature predators

Abstract = {{Growth rate is an ecologically important trait, affecting the energy
   acquisition from, and provisioning to, the surrounding community. One of
   many costs suggested to counteract the evolution of increased intrinsic
   growth rate is an associated reduction in tolerance to conditions of
   nutrient stress. Here we test this concept with individuals possessing
   experimentally increased intrinsic growth rates (growth hormone
   transgenic coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch) relative to wild
   genotypes. Using a series of three experiments, survival and growth of
   both genotypes were assessed on a physiological and behavioral level
   while varying food abundance, social interactions, and predation risk.
   Only in complete absence of exogenous food in newly emerged fry did the
   high intrinsic growth rate appear costly with a shorter average survival
   time compared to wild-type (Exp. 1). In experiment 2, genotypes with
   elevated intrinsic growth showed equal or higher survival and growth
   than wild-type genotypes In a third experiment, adding very limited
   amounts of food and allowing for social interactions in a simulated
   natural environment benefited transgenic individuals relative to
   wild-types, but at similar magnitudes in both the absence and presence
   of predators. Populations with transgenic individuals present did not
   crash under these competitive conditions as previously reported when
   studied in simple environments where hiding and attack escape were not
   possible. Our data suggest that transgenic fish have a greater scope for
   growth under most conditions, but are not obligated to use this
   capability. Physiological (e.g. appetite and conversion efficiency) and
   behavioral traits (e.g. competitive ability and risk-taking) found
   previously to correlate positively with intrinsic growth rate in the
   transgenic strain likely aided in their survival and growth, even under
   food limited conditions. Hence, at least in coho salmon, intrinsic
   growth rate does not appear to strongly affect survival under nutrient
   stress.}},

Abstract = {{P> Cross-ecosystem movements of resources, including detritus, nutrients
   and living prey, can strongly influence food web dynamics in recipient
   habitats. Variation in resource inputs is thought to be driven by
   factors external to the recipient habitat (e.g. donor habitat
   productivity and boundary conditions). However, inputs of or by `active'
   living resources may be strongly influenced by recipient habitat quality
   when organisms exhibit behavioural habitat selection when crossing
   ecosystem boundaries.
   To examine whether behavioural responses to recipient habitat quality
   alter the relative inputs of `active' living and `passive' detrital
   resources to recipient food webs, we manipulated the presence of caged
   predatory fish and measured biomass, energy and organic content of
   inputs to outdoor experimental pools of adult aquatic insects, frog
   eggs, terrestrial plant matter and terrestrial arthropods.
   Caged fish reduced the biomass, energy and organic matter donated to
   pools by tree frog eggs by similar to 70\%, but did not alter insect
   colonisation or passive allochthonous inputs of terrestrial arthropods
   and plant material. Terrestrial plant matter and adult aquatic insects
   provided the most energy and organic matter inputs to the pools
   (40-50\%), while terrestrial arthropods provided the least (7\%). Inputs
   of frog egg were relatively small but varied considerably among pools
   and over time (3\%, range = 0-20\%). Absolute and proportional amounts
   varied by input type.
   Aquatic predators can strongly affect the magnitude of active, but not
   passive, inputs and that the effect of recipient habitat quality on
   active inputs is variable. Furthermore, some active inputs (i.e. aquatic
   insect colonists) can provide similar amounts of energy and organic
   matter as passive inputs of terrestrial plant matter, which are well
   known to be important. Because inputs differ in quality and the trophic
   level they subsidise, proportional changes in input type could have
   strong effects on recipient food webs.
   Cross-ecosystem resource inputs have previously been characterised as
   donor-controlled. However, control by the recipient food web could lead
   to greater feedback between resource flow and consumer dynamics than has
   been appreciated so far.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity is the single greatest risk factor for the development of Type 2
   diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with the prevalence of both dramatically
   increasing in recent years. These conditions are associated with medical
   complications such as hypertension, neuropathy and cardiovascular
   disease. Recent evidence also suggests a greater risk of developing

   governing these changes remain obscure, although epidemiological
   evidence suggests that reduced insulin sensitivity (a characteristic of
   T2DM) is an independent risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Here we
   examine the effects of diet-induced insulin resistance on cognitive
   ability in an animal model not predisposed to develop Alzheimer's
   pathology. Following 12 weeks on a high fat diet (45\% of calories as
   crude fat) male Wistar rats were overweight and insulin resistant but
   not frankly diabetic. High fat fed animals were consistently poorer in
   all aspects of an operant based delayed matching to position task, yet
   were not impaired in spatial working memory as judged by the open field
   watermaze test. The cognitive deficit of the HF fed animals was most
   apparent when the task was switched from matching to non-matching to
   position, suggestive of an inability to change contingency. Performance
   in this task was negatively correlated with whole body insulin

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in the tendency to accept risk have

   however, has investigated the effect of developmental environment on
   individual differences in risk-acceptance. Competing hypotheses offer
   different explanations of how variation in the quality of the
   developmental environment affects risk-acceptance in adults. The first
   hypothesis states that individuals developing in poor quality
   environments take risks because such behavior is their only means of
   obtaining adequate fitness returns. The second hypothesis states that
   individuals developing in poor environments avoid risk because their
   poor physical condition makes them especially vulnerable to injury or
   death. We measured several forms of risk-accepting behavior
   (exploration, foraging, and recovery after disturbance) in male hissing
   cockroaches (Gromphadorhina portentosa) that had developed in
   nutritional and social environments of varying quality. Individuals
   raised on poor nutrition diets exhibited lower levels of risk-acceptance
   than those raised on high nutrition diets. Risk-acceptance among
   individuals that developed on poor nutrition diets was negatively

Abstract = {{Supplementary feeding of wild birds during winter is one of the most
   popular wildlife management activities, and is likely to have profound
   influence on the behavioural ecology of a species. At garden bird
   feeders, birds are now often fed well into the breeding season.
   Providing food within an established songbird territory, however, is
   likely to influence the territorial behaviour of the resident male. We
   used song performance during the dawn chorus in early spring to study
   behavioural changes in food-supplemented great tits, Parus major. After
   2 weeks of continuous food supply within their territory, supplemented
   males started dawn singing later than control males, and thus postponed
   their regular dawn chorus before sunrise. This effect was maintained 2
   weeks after food supplementation had ended. However, we did not find an
   effect of long-term feeding on song output. Our results were largely
   unexpected because formal models and field studies on short-term food
   supplementation suggested an earlier start of dawn singing or a higher
   dawn song output. Because we did not observe great tits visiting the
   feeders before sunrise or food supplementation increasing the numbers of
   conspecific intruders, the reasons for the delay in the start of dawn
   singing remain unclear; possible explanations include the presence of
   predators at feeding stations and the quality of the supplementary food
   itself. Delaying dawn singing could potentially affect the reproductive
   success of supplemented males, for example if females base extrapair
   mating decisions on dawn song performance of their mates. (C) 2010 The

Abstract = {{Poor self-control, lack of inhibition, and impulsivity contribute to the
   propensity of adolescents to engage in risky or dangerous behaviors.
   Brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex) involved in impulse-control,
   reward-processing, and decision-making continue to develop during
   adolescence, raising the possibility that an immature brain contributes
   to dangerous behavior during adolescence. However, very few validated
   animal behavioral models are available for behavioral neuroscientists to
   explore the relationship between brain development and behavior. To that
   end, a valid model must be conducted in the relatively brief window of
   adolescence and not use manipulations that potentially compromise
   development. The present experiments used three operant arrangements to
   assess whether adolescent rats differ from adults in measures of
   learning, behavioral inhibition, and impulsivity, within the
   aforementioned time frame without substantial food restriction. In
   Experiment 1, separate squads of rats were trained to lever-press and
   then transitioned to two types of extinction. Relative to their
   baselines, adolescent rats responded more during extinction than adults,
   suggesting that they were less sensitive to the abolishment of the
   reinforcement contingency. Experiment 2 demonstrated similar age-related
   differences during exposure to a differential reinforcement of low rates
   schedule, a test of behavioral inhibition. Lastly, in Experiment 3,
   adolescent's responding decreased more slowly than adults during
   exposure to a resetting delay of reinforcement schedule, suggesting
   impaired self-control. Results from these experiments suggest that
   adolescents exhibit impaired learning, behavioral inhibition and
   self-control, and in concert with recent reports, provide researchers
   with three behavioral models to more fully explore neurobiology of
   risk-taking behavior in adolescence.}},

Volume = {{165}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{311-320}},

Abstract = {{Life-history plasticity is widespread among organisms. However, an
   important question is whether it is adaptive. Most models for plasticity
   in life-history timing predict that animals, once they have reached the
   minimal nutritional threshold under poor conditions, will accelerate
   development or time to reproduction. Adaptive delays in reproduction are
   not common, especially in short-lived species. Examples of adaptive
   reproductive delays exist in mammalian populations experiencing strong
   interspecific (e.g., predation) and intraspecific (e.g., infanticide)
   competition. But are there other environmental factors that may trigger
   an adaptive delay in reproductive timing? We show that the short-lived
   flesh fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis will delay reproduction under
   nutrient-poor conditions, even though it has already met the minimal
   nutritional threshold for reproduction. We test whether this delay
   strategy is an adaptive response allowing the scavenger time to locate
   more resources by experimentally providing supplemental protein pulses
   (early, mid and late) throughout the reproductive delay period. Flies
   receiving additional protein produced more and larger eggs,
   demonstrating a benefit of the delay. In addition, by tracking the
   allocation of carbon from the pulses using stable isotopes, we show that
   flies receiving earlier pulses incorporated more carbon into eggs and
   somatic tissue than those given a later pulse. These results indicate
   that the reproductive delay in S. crassipalpis is consistent with
   adaptive post-threshold plasticity, a nutritionally linked reproductive
   strategy that has not been reported previously in an invertebrate
   species.}},

Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{491-498}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural traits generally and cognitive traits in particular are
   relatively understudied in an evolutionary ecological context. One
   reason for this is that such traits are often difficult to characterize
   among large numbers of individuals, without the influence of diverse
   environmental effects swamping intrinsic individual differences. We
   conducted standardized assays on a natural population of great tits,
   Parus major, to quantify and characterize individual variation in
   problem-solving performance, a simple cognitive trait often linked to
   innovative foraging ability. Forty-four per cent of 570 birds solved a
   food-motivated, lever-pulling problem and this proportion was consistent
   across three seasons. Individual performance was consistent within and
   across captivity sessions, across seasons, and between two different
   problem-solving tasks (lever and string pulling). Problem-solving
   performance was not explained by differences in latency to approach the
   empty task, nor latency to feed after human disturbance. Variation was
   unrelated to body condition, while age and natal origin explained
   significant but minimal amounts of variation, the importance of which
   varied between seasons. Problem-solving performance did not covary with
   exploration behaviour of a novel environment, suggesting that individual
   differences in problem solving represent an independent source of
   behavioural variation in our population. Rather than simply reflecting
   covariance with state or with other behavioural traits, our results
   suggest that variation in problem-solving performance represents
   inherent individual differences in the propensity to forage
   innovatively. We suggest that standardized problem-solving assays may
   prove ideal for studying the evolutionary ecology of simple cognitive
   traits. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Predator-induced defences have been demonstrated in numerous marine
   molluscs, but never in giant clams (Bivalvia: Tridacnidae). Water-borne
   cues from the predatory crab Myomenippe hardwickii were tested for their
   ability to induce changes in the shell morphology, strength and growth
   of juvenile fluted giant clams, Tridacna squamosa. Specimens were
   maintained in effluent from tanks holding `fed crabs', `starved crabs'
   and `no crabs'. To ensure changes were due to predator cues only, food
   for the crabs was provided ex situ and measures were taken to minimise
   the prey signal. After 182 days, MANOVA identified differences in
   various shell parameters relating to shape and strength. CDA showed a
   clear change in overall morphology, with strong separation among the
   three treatments. Effluent from `fed crabs' had a greater influence than
   effluent from `starved crabs', possibly because the starved crabs were
   perceived as weaker, and thus less risk. Significantly more clams died
   in `fed crabs' treatments (25\%) and `starved crabs' treatments (30\%)
   compared to the `no crabs' control (0\%). This degree of mortality has
   not been observed in similar experiments elsewhere and represents a new

Abstract = {{The obesity epidemic is a major health concern. More than two thirds of
   Americans and more than one third of children and adolescents are
   overweight or obese. Physical inactivity and sedentary lifestyle are
   contributing factors of overweight and obesity. Increasing physical
   activity in overweight and obese individuals can potentially improve
   health status and lower the risk of major health problems. Based on the
   theoretical frameworks of behavioral change models, health information
   technologies, and pervasive interactive technologies, a conceptual model
   has been developed. The proposed model is an intervention method
   combining a behavior change model and a personalized Health IT system
   using an interactive accelerometer-based pervasive technology component,
   to increase physical activity potentially in an overweight and obese
   population. The accelerometer automatically synchronizes with the
   personal health record database over wireless networks; the decision
   engine utilizes the theory of planned behavior model to form a feedback;
   and; proper interactive feedback is provided directly to the users in
   the personal health record interface. A prototype was developed based on
   the conceptual model. The prototype measures and stores the number of
   steps, type of steps and caloric consumption on a daily basis with an
   interval of 20 minutes by an advanced accelerometer that can simply be
   attached to any footwear. The accelerometer synchronizes automatically
   the stored data with a central database as soon as the participant
   enters a designated wireless area. Virtual characters that are embedded
   inside a personal health record system convey the feedback to the users.
   The feedback is generated based on the theory of planned behavior
   decision model utilizing the stored daily physical activity data. The
   interface prompts knowledge-based information, presents self-monitoring
   trend lines, and shows virtual character changes over time such as
   becoming obese, to reflect the tailored feedback message. In addition,
   the interface is integrated in a popular social-networking website where
   users can review other virtual characters and generate peer pressure.
   The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of implementing
   a behavioral change intervention using pervasive health information
   technology among overweight and obese population. This research explains
   the development of the conceptual model, integration of wireless
   physical activity self-monitoring devices into personal health records,
   and the application of rich interactive media to convey messages to the
   users. The final prototype will be presented and preliminary findings
   will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Epigenetic processes which include DNA methylation, histone modification

   early-life nutrition may reflect an adaptive response of the foetus to
   environmental cues acting through the process of developmental
   plasticity. This may allow an organism to adjust its developmental
   programme resulting in long-term changes in its metabolism and
   physiology in order to be better matched to the future environment.
   However, when the future environment lies outside the anticipated range,
   metabolic and homoeostatic capacity will be mismatched with the

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{436}},
Pages = {{119-130}},
Abstract = {{Small-scale turbulence can alter the rate of plankton predator-prey
   encounters. Encounter models predict that prey ingestion by
   slow-swimming zooplankton is enhanced at low levels of turbulence. We
   investigated whether small-scale turbulence increases ingestion for the
   slow-swimming, suspension-feeding pluteus larvae of the white urchin
   Lytechinus pictus and the purple urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus.
   Model predictions of the critical level of turbulence, epsilon(cr),
   above which encounters due to turbulence are greater than those due to
   behavior (swimming or suspension feeding) alone, were experimentally
   tested using short-and long-term grazing treatments. Because urchin
   larvae are smaller than the smallest eddy scales of turbulence and thus
   experience turbulence as laminar shear, larvae were exposed to flow
   conditions using a simple laminar shear flow with dissipation rates,
   epsilon, of 0, 0.1, 0.4, and 1 cm(2) s(-3). Short-term ingestion of
   beads by L. pictus larvae was unaffected by epsilon < 1 cm(2) s(-3) but
   was 30\% greater at this level, which was greater than ecr based on flow
   speeds produced in suspension feeding. Long-term flow treatments with
   algal prey had no significant effect on grazing or growth. Short-term
   ingestion of beads by S. purpuratus larvae was unaffected by epsilon <
   epsilon(cr) based on suspension feeding; the effect of long-term flow
   exposure on ingestion and growth could not be investigated because of
   high mortality, suggesting greater sensitivity to flow exposure compared
   to L. pictus. Experimental results are consistent with model predictions
   that ecr is high, and thus levels of turbulence in the ocean are not
   expected to significantly increase ingestion and reduce food limitation
   in suspension-feeding urchin larvae.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence of altered antioxidant systems and signs of elevated oxidative
   stress are reported in peripheral tissue and brain of schizophrenic
   patients, including low levels of glutathione (GSH), a major thiol
   antioxidant and redox buffer. Functional and genetic data indicate that
   an impaired regulation of GSH synthesis is a vulnerability factor for
   the disease. Impaired GSH synthesis from a genetic origin combined with
   environmental risk factors generating oxidative stress (e.g.,
   malnutrition, exposure to toxins, maternal infection and diabetes,
   obstetrical complications, and psychological stress) could lead to redox
   dysregulation. This could subsequently perturb normal brain development
   and maturation with delayed functional consequences emerging in early
   adulthood. Depending on the nature and the time of occurrence of the
   environmental insults, the structural and functional delayed
   consequences could vary, giving rise to various endophenotypes. The use
   of animal models of GSH deficit represents a valuable approach to
   investigate how interactions between genetic and environmental factors
   lead to the emergence of pathologies found in the disease. Moreover,
   these models of GSH can be useful to investigate links between
   schizophrenia and comorbid somatic disorders, as dysregulation of the
   GSH system and elevated oxidative stress are also found in
   cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. This chapter reviews
   pharmacological and genetic rodent models of GSH synthesis dysregulation
   used to address some of the aforementioned issues. Up to date, these
   models revealed that GSH deficits lead to morphological, physiological,
   and behavioral alterations that are quite analogous to pathologies
   observed in patients. This includes hypofunction of NMDA receptors,
   alteration of dopamine neurotransmission, anomalies in
   parvalbumin-immunoreactive fast-spiking interneurons, and reduced
   myelination. In addition, a GSH deficit affects the brain in a
   region-specific manner, the anterior cingulate cortex and the ventral
   hippocampus being the most vulnerable regions investigated.
   Interestingly, a GSH deficit during a limited period of postnatal
   development is sufficient to have long-lasting consequences on the
   integrity of PV-IR interneurons in the anterior cingulate cortex and
   impairs cognitive functions in adulthood. Finally, these animal models
   of GSH deficit display behavioral impairments that could be related to
   schizophrenia. Altogether, current data strongly support a contributing
   role of a redox dysregulation on the development of pathologies
   associated with the illness and demonstrate the usefulness of these
   models to better understand the biological mechanisms leading to
   schizophrenia.}},

Title = {{Altricial Development in Wood-Feeding Cockroaches: The Key Antecedent of
   Termite Eusociality}},
Booktitle = {{BIOLOGY OF TERMITES: A MODERN SYNTHESIS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Pages = {{69-95}},
Abstract = {{Altricial development, the production of vulnerable, dependent neonates,
   is regularly associated with high levels of parental care in both
   vertebrates and invertebrates and has evolved in at least two
   phylogenetically distant, biparental wood-feeding cockroach genera:
   Cryptocercus and Salganea. Here I make the case that altricial
   development was the first deviation from standard hemimetabolous
   development in the biparental termite ancestor, played a fundamental
   role in the origin of the termite lineage, and can account for many of
   the novel traits and functions that constitute eusociality in extant
   Isoptera. Altricial neonates of subsocial wood feeding cockroaches are
   small, fragile, incapable of feeding themselves, and costly to rear.
   However, the type of care these juveniles require does not necessarily
   have to originate from a parent; consequently other members of the
   social group have the opportunity to undertake brood care obligations.
   Altricial development therefore allows for the transition to
   alloparental care, and has a great deal of explanatory power when the
   evolution of termite eusociality is framed as a hierarchical two-stage
   process. Stage 1 alloparental care both increased reproductive output of
   adults and prolonged the development of young helpers. Combined, this
   changed the nature of the family: it was composed of a greater number of
   small, vulnerable juveniles. At the same time however, parents were
   increasingly specializing in reproduction at the expense of their
   defensive parental duties. Stage I alloparental care, then, necessitated
   Stage 2, the development of a soldier caste, but it also allowed it.
   Soldiers are a nutritionally dependent caste, so alloparental feeding
   would have to be part of the behavioral repertoire before soldiers with
   specialized defensive mandibles could appear. As eusociality progressed,
   altricial development formed the operational basis for the prolongation
   of juvenile morphology, physiology and behavior into later ontogeny,
   accounting for many aspects of termite life history neglected by current
   hypotheses. Altricial development reinforces the importance of
   biparental care and hemimetabolous development in the termite ancestor
   and is a clear indication that the social environment can significantly
   influence developmental ontogeny the lineage. The evolution of termite
   eusociality is a prime example of how evolution uses existing components
   in the origin of new systems.}},

Pages = {{23-28}},

Abstract = {{Many vertebrate species alter their reproductive behavior under
   stressful conditions. Available evidence in wild birds suggests that
   under food limitation, parents reduce overall provisioning rate while
   increasing selectivity of food distribution within brood in favor of
   senior siblings. However, how acute stressors such as predation risk
   influence the magnitude and direction of changes in parental
   provisioning is poorly understood. In this study, a small passerine
   bird, the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca), was used as a model
   species to investigate parental provisioning strategies when exposed to
   different types of predators. Parents reduced provisioning rates
   remarkably when exposed to a predator of adults, whereas no behavioral
   change was observed when nest predation was imitated. Under normal
   conditions, parents preferred senior chicks to juniors. In contrast to
   experiments with food limitation, parents allocated food equally to
   senior and junior siblings under predation risk, irrespective of the
   type of a predator. No sex-related differences in parental provisioning
   strategies were found. We conclude that parents alter several aspects of
   their behavior in response to fear stress. If danger to parents occurs
   repeatedly, temporal reductions in provisioning rates may have
   cumulative and potentially harmful consequences on offspring
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Two 3-month longitudinal studies examined weight loss following a
   1-month behavioral intervention (FIT-DSD) focusing on increasing

   required participants to do something different each day and to engage
   in novel weekly activities to expand their behavioral repertoire. These
   activities were not food-or exercise-related. In Study 1, the FIT-DSD
   program was compared with a control condition where participants engaged
   in daily tasks not expected to influence behavioral flexibility. Study 2
   used an active or quasicontrol group in which half the participants were
   also on food diets. Measures in both studies were taken pre-, post-, and
   post-postintervention. In Study 1, FIT-DSD participants showed greater
   weight loss that continued post-postintervention. In Study 2, all

Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{148}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{31-54}},
Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation and urbanization not only cause extirpation of
   species, but also alter the behaviour of species in human modified
   areas. We evaluated behavioural characteristics of the black-tailed
   prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus), a keystone species, in the urban
   landscape of Denver, CO, USA. Specifically, we investigated the
   proportion of vigilance, foraging, and social behaviour within a system
   of urban colonies that varied in area, degree of connectivity, and time
   since isolation. Overall, rates of vigilance were lower than are
   typically reported for black-tailed prairie dogs in grassland habitats.
   Colonies that were more isolated exhibited higher levels of vigilance,
   but colonies isolated for a longer period of time exhibited reduced
   vigilance. Thus, while urban stimuli may increase alertness in the most
   isolated colonies, we suggest that black-tailed prairie dogs might
   eventually adjust to these stimuli and relax their vigilance responses.
   Because behaviour varies based on age of fragments, we provide evidence
   that black-tailed prairie dog populations are responding to urbanization
   through behavioural changes that may be adaptive. The ability to
   understand how landscape-level factors influence black-tailed prairie
   dog behaviour provides important information about the response of
   keystone species to urban settings and can aid conservation and
   management efforts in fragmented systems.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{65-75}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{The thrifty phenotype hypothesis is widely used to interpret
   associations between early nutritional experience and degenerative
   disease risks. However, it remains unclear what is adaptive about early
   life thrift, and biomedical approaches struggle to explain why
   associations between early growth and later disease hold across the
   entire range of birth size. This issue can be addressed using a simple
   model, attributing disease to a high metabolic load (large tissue
   masses, rich diet, and sedentary lifestyle) relative to metabolic
   capacity (physiological traits contingent on fetal/infant development).
   In this context, different hypotheses regarding the long-term functions
   of thrift can be examined. The ``predictive adaptive response''
   hypothesis considers thrift to involve metabolic adaptations (insulin
   resistance and central adiposity) that emerge in anticipation of a poor
   quality adult breeding environment. The competing ``maternal capital''
   hypothesis considers thrift to involve reductions in lean mass and organ
   phenotype arising through constraints on maternal phenotype, reflecting
   both maternal developmental experience and current ecological
   conditions. This hypothesis assumes offspring developmental responses to
   stresses such as temperature, altitude, and nutritional ecology occur
   under the influence of maternal capital indices, including size,
   physiology, reproductive history and social status. I argue that insulin
   resistance only emerges after infancy, and far from being anticipatory
   of a low nutritional plane, indicates perturbations of metabolism.

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel combination of feeding motivation and
   spatial preference testing. We used the feeding motivation test to
   determine a `low' barrier height that broiler chickens, Gallus gallus
   domesticus, that were not food deprived would cross to get to food, and
   a `high' barrier height that food-deprived chickens would cross to get
   to food. These barriers were then used to assess the chickens' spatial
   preferences. Birds could show their spatial preference by moving between
   two compartments with different stocking densities (14.7 birds/m(2) in a
   compartment of fixed size versus 9.3, 12.1 or 14.7 birds/m(2) in a
   compartment of adjustable size). The compartments were separated by
   either the low or the high barrier. In the density preference test, the
   number of birds in the adjustable compartment increased with increasing
   size of this compartment, indicating that birds preferred lower
   densities, an effect that became more pronounced with age. This effect
   occurred even when a barrier was used that had previously deterred
   20-25\% of birds from crossing to get to food after 6 h of food
   deprivation, suggesting that achieving a lower density was important to
   the broiler chickens. Since this methodology does not involve training,
   it could be used to evaluate the importance of spatial or other
   preferences in a wide range of domestic and nondomestic species. (c)

Abstract = {{In animals, behavioural properties such as aggressive propensity are
   often consistent over a life span, and they may form part of a
   behavioural syndrome. We studied how aggressive propensity influences
   dominance, contest behaviour and growth in the cooperatively breeding
   cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher. We tested whether intrinsic
   aggressive propensity (1) influences dominance in paired contests, (2)
   causes different aggression levels in contests with partners matched for
   aggressive propensity compared to unmatched partners, and how it (3)
   affects growth rate in groups that were either matched or unmatched for
   aggressive propensity. Intrinsic aggressive propensity was first scored
   with a mirror test and classified as high, medium or low. Thereafter we
   tested fish with either high or low aggressive propensity with partners
   matched for size and either matched or unmatched for aggressive type in
   a paired contest for a shelter. We scored dominance, aggression and
   submission. As predicted, (1) dominance was more clearly established in
   unmatched than in matched contests and (2) individuals with high
   aggressive propensity launched more attacks overall than fish with low
   intrinsic aggressiveness, suggesting a higher propensity to escalate
   independently of winning or losing the paired contest. However, contrary
   to expectation, (3) individuals with low aggressiveness grew faster than
   aggressive ones in unmatched groups, whereas the opposite occurred in
   matched groups. This suggests that individuals with low aggressive
   propensity may benefit from conflict evasion, which might allow them to
   gain dominance in the future owing to larger body size. (C) 2010 The

Abstract = {{Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular disease and
   type 2 diabetes, constitute the main cause of death worldwide. Eighty
   percent of these deaths occur in low-and middle-income countries,
   especially as these countries undergo socio-economic improvement
   following reductions in the burden of infectious disease. The World
   Health Organization predicts a substantial increase in the incidence of
   NCDs over the next decade globally. NCDs are generally preventable, but
   current approaches are clearly inadequate. New initiatives are needed to
   implement such prevention, and there needs to be greater recognition
   that early-life interventions are likely to be the most efficacious.
   Devising appropriate prevention strategies necessitates an understanding
   of how the developmental environment influences risk. Progress in this
   field has been slow due to an excessive emphasis on fixed genomic
   variations (hard inheritance) as the major determinants of disease
   susceptibility. However, new evidence demonstrates the much greater
   importance of early-life developmental factors, involving epigenetic
   processes and `soft' inheritance in modulating an individual's
   vulnerability to NCD. This also offers opportunities for novel
   epigenetic biomarkers of risk or interventions targeting epigenetic
   pathways to be devised for use in early life. This may pave the way to

Abstract = {{Aggression is often positively correlated with other behavioural traits
   such as boldness and activity levels. Comparisons across populations can
   help to determine factors that promote the evolution of such traits. We
   quantified these behaviours by testing the responses of wild-caught
   poeciliid fish, Brachyrhaphis episcopi, to mirror image stimuli. This
   species occurs in populations that experience either high or low levels
   of predation pressure. Previous studies have shown that B. episcopi from
   low predation environments are less bold than those that occur with many
   predators. We therefore predicted that fish from high predation
   populations would be more aggressive and more active than fish from low
   predation populations. However, we found the opposite - low predation
   fish approached a mirror and a novel object more frequently than high
   predation fish suggesting that `boldness' and aggression were higher in
   low predation populations, and that population-level boldness measures
   may vary depending on context. When tested individually, low predation
   fish inspected their mirror image more frequently. Females, but not
   males, from low predation sites were also more aggressive towards their
   mirror image. Variation in female aggression may be driven by a
   trade-off between food availability and predation risk. This suggests
   that the relationship between aggression and boldness has been shaped by
   adaptation to environmental conditions, and not genetic constraints. (c)

   Four meta-analyses dealing with depression as a CVD risk factor in

   present with an unhealthier lifestyle (nutrition, smoking, physical

   circulatory system are under discussion: (1) hyperregulation of the
   autonomic nervous system (e.g., increased mean heart rate, increased
   heart rate responses, impaired heart rate variability), (2) overshooting
   stress responses of the endocrine system with impaired feedback
   mechanisms (e.g., for cortisol release), and (3) the immune system with
   dysregulated release of acute phase proteins and proinflammatory
   cytokines, all involved in a bidirectional crosstalk with the patient's

Abstract = {{The rates and patterns of growth in weight of European and North
   American infants have changed over the last 100 years. Since the
   development and first use of growth charts for postnatal health
   surveillance a century ago, there appears to have been an increase in
   the weight of 1-year olds of about 1 kg. Taking into account the higher
   past rates of infant morbidity and mortality, and poorer quality of
   artificial feeds, this change is likely to be another expression of the
   secular increase in physical stature consequent on improved hygiene and
   nutrition. Using the new WHO (World Health Organisation) standards of
   infant weight growth, this secular change can be observed for both
   breast-fed and formula-fed babies. The slower weight growth of the
   former, both now and in the past compared with modern formula-fed
   babies, may have implications of our understanding of the risk factors
   for obesity and cardiovascular disease. The variability of infant growth
   in time and space, and the plasticity of developmental processes during
   the life course (fetal life, infancy, puberty and reproduction), means
   that the WHO infant growth standard should not alone be regarded as an
   ideal growth trajectory for all babies. European Journal of Clinical

Abstract = {{Female-biased sexual size dimorphism is common in arthropods, apparently
   driven by fecundity selection in females. Selective pressures that limit
   growth are less often considered. One factor that researchers have
   rarely considered is the possible role of energetic limits on growth.
   The orb weaving spider Nephila clavipes (Linnaeus 1767) is extremely
   sexually size dimorphic. Males are ``normal{''} sized spiders and
   females are up to ten times longer, having passed through several
   additional juvenile instars. This extreme size dimorphism presents the
   opportunity to test for intrinsic energetic costs of gigantism. Prior
   studies have shown that males successfully reach maturity on a range of
   diets, while female dietary requirements increase rapidly with
   increasing size. We here examine the effects of variation in food
   availability on juvenile female development by randomly assigning
   spiderlings from six different families (from six distinct populations)
   to quantitatively varying but qualitatively identical diets. Based upon
   field observations, we expected that dietary restrictions would have the
   greatest effect on duration of instars, particularly later instars, and
   on instar number (because longer total development would lead to
   curtailment of growth at an earlier stage), with relatively little
   effect on growth per molt. Because the diets ranged from higher than
   mean intake observed in the field to well below mean intake, we expected
   females to mature at a wide range of instars (and sizes). Our results
   support the functional relationship among food intake, instar duration,
   and fixed growth per molt (although growth per molt was less canalized
   than suggested by field observations). However, we observed no variation
   in number of instars, and we suggest that these data provide additional
   support for the importance of rare, large prey in the diets of
   web-building spiders.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Imaging studies of pain processing in primary psychiatric
   disorders are just emerging. This study explored the neural correlates
   of stress-induced analgesia in individuals with posttraumatic stress
   disorder (PTSD). It combined functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) and the traumatic script-driven imagery symptom provocation
   paradigm to examine the effects of trauma-related cues on pain
   perception in individuals with PTSD. Methods: The study included 17
   patients with PTSD and 26 healthy, trauma-exposed controls. Participants
   received warm (nonpainful) or hot (painful) thermal stimuli after
   listening to a neutral or a traumatic script while they were undergoing
   an fMRI scan at a 4.0 T field strength. Results: Between-group analyses
   revealed that after exposure to the traumatic scripts, the blood oxygen
   level-dependent (BOLD) signal during pain perception was greater in the
   PTSD group than the control group in the head of the caudate. In the
   PTSD group, strong positive correlations resulted between BOLD signal
   and symptom severity in a number of brain regions previously implicated
   in stress-induced analgesia, such as the thalamus and the head of the
   caudate nucleus. Trait dissociation as measured by the Dissociative
   Experiences Scale correlated negatively with the right amygdala and the
   left putamen. Limitations: This study included heterogeneous traumatic
   experiences, a different proportion of military trauma in the PTSD
   versus the control group and medicated patients with PTSD. Conclusion:
   These data indicate that in patients with PTSD trauma recall will lead
   in a state-dependent manner to greater activation in brain regions
   implicated in stress-induced analgesia. Correlational analyses lend
   support to cortical hyperinhibition of the amygdala as a function of
   dissociation.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the temporal dynamics in the vertical distribution of
   Maurolicus muelleri scattering layers (SL) by examining continuous
   acoustic recordings over a 15 mo period in Masfjorden, Norway,
   complemented by intermittent sampling campaigns. The data revealed known
   patterns as normal diel vertical migration (DVM), midnight sinking
   between dusk and dawn, and periods without migrations, as well as novel
   behaviours consisting of early morning ascents, reverse diel vertical
   migrations, and interrupted ascents in the evening. During the first
   autumn of the study, adult fish modified their normal DVM behaviour by
   suspending their migration in the evening, yet ascending toward the
   surface in the later part of the night to reach upper layers during
   dawn. This behaviour was not observed during the second autumn of the
   study. By mid- to end of November (1st autumn), adult fish had suspended
   the nocturnal ascent entirely, and in the subsequent period until the
   end of January, a fraction of the population rather performed limited
   reverse migrations, slightly shifting their vertical distribution
   upwards during the first part of the day. From January to March 2008,
   fish interrupted their evening ascent at apparently random intervals and
   returned to deeper waters, instead of completing a full ascent to the
   surface. Our study underlines the value of long-term recordings, with
   the results suggesting that M. muelleri has the capability of changing
   its behaviour in response to ontogeny and internal state (satiation and
   hunger) as well as to external stimuli.}},

Pages = {{15-22}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Individual variation is a ubiquitous and important factor that affects
   ecological dynamics. This study examined individual variation in the
   nest-use pattern of the jumping spider Phidippus audax. Although the
   jumping spider is a diurnal species, field observations in this study
   revealed that the majority of individuals remained in their nests during
   the day. An accompanying examination of the hunger level of the spiders
   revealed that spiders that remained in nests were more starved than
   those observed outside nests. If spiders actively forage when they are
   starved, as has been suggested by previous studies, one would expect to
   see the opposite trend (i.e., spiders that remained in nests are more
   satiated). Thus, the pattern observed in the field contradicts the known
   behavioral pattern of the spiders. An individual-based model was used to
   investigate the behavioral mechanism of the spider and the discrepancy
   found in the observations. A basic assumption of the model is that
   spiders possess distinct inactive and active phases (biphasic activity
   pattern), and transitions between the two phases are regulated by the
   hunger level of the spider. Data from a laboratory experiment were used
   to examine the assumptions of the model partially. The model was able to
   capture patterns observed in the data, suggesting that the pattern of
   transitions in biphasic activity is an important trait of the foraging
   behavior of the jumping spider.}},

   Preimplantation embryo development is dynamic and responsive to external

   Preimplantation embryos sense and adapt to their environment either in

   Embryonic responses are beneficial in the short term to ensure survival
   and optimal developmental progression, yet increase the risk of ill

   Learning objectives:
   To be aware that maternal nutrition or in vitro environment influence
   embryonic development, gene expression and metabolism.
   To acknowledge mechanisms by which the preimplantation embryo can sense
   and react to the environment in which it develops.
   To understand the concept that developmental plasticity is advantageous
   to maximise survival chances at an increased risk of later disease,
   should prevailing conditions change.

Abstract = {{Replacement clutches can be crucial to the breeding success of avian
   species, although several factors may influence their outcome and the
   quality of chicks. Here we compare first and replacement clutches of
   Eagle Owls in terms of chick quality, timing of breeding, and number of
   eggs and fledglings. We hypothesize that the propensity to abandon nests
   and start a new clutch could have evolved because females are able to
   produce chicks that are as good as the ones of the first clutch. We
   found that nestlings in replacement clutches were not significantly
   different from nestlings in first clutches, in terms of immune system
   and body condition; nor were there significant differences in clutch and
   brood size. Our findings may be explained by the fact that clutches were
   laid early in the season, perhaps by high-quality parents, and that food
   resources are plentiful in the study area. In order to maximize fitness,
   individuals have to adjust optimally the investment of resources in
   different life-history traits. Thus, the re-nesting behaviour of Eagle

Abstract = {{In the present article the putative role of environmental factors in
   schizophrenia is reviewed and synthesized. Accumulating evidence from
   recent studies suggests that environmental exposures may play a more
   significant role in the etiopathogenesis of this disorder than
   previously thought. This expanding knowledge base is largely a
   consequence of refinements in the methodology of epidemiologic studies,
   including birth cohort investigations, and in preclinical research that
   has been inspired by the evolving literature on animal models of
   environmental exposures. This paper is divided into four sections. In
   the first, the descriptive epidemiology of schizophrenia is reviewed.
   This includes general studies on incidence, prevalence, and differences
   in these measures by urban-rural, neighborhood, migrant, and season of
   birth status, as well as time trends. In the second section, we discuss
   the contribution of environmental risk factors acting during fetal and
   perinatal life; these include infections {[}e.g. rubella, influenza,
   Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2)],
   nutritional deficiencies (e.g., famine, folic acid, iron, vitamin D),
   paternal age, fetal/neonatal hypoxic and other obstetric insults and
   complications, maternal stress and other exposures {[}e.g. lead, rhesus
   (Rh) incompatibility, maternal stress]. Other putative
   neurodevelopmental determinants, including cannabis, socioeconomic
   status, trauma, and infections during childhood and adolescence are also
   covered. In the third section, these findings are synthesized and their
   implications for prevention and uncovering biological mechanisms,
   including oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation, are discussed.
   Animal models, including maternal immune activation, have yielded
   evidence suggesting that these exposures cause brain and behavioral
   phenotypes that are analogous to findings observed in patients with
   schizophrenia. In the final section, future studies including new,
   larger, and more rigorous epidemiologic investigations, and research on
   translational and clinical neuroscience, gene-environment interactions,
   epigenetics, developmental trajectories and windows of vulnerability,
   are elaborated upon. These studies are aimed at confirming observed risk
   factors, identifying new environmental exposures, elucidating
   developmental mechanisms, and shedding further light on genes and
   exposures that may not be identified in the absence of these integrated
   approaches. The study of environmental factors in schizophrenia may have
   important implications for the identification of causes and prevention
   of this disorder, and offers the potential to complement, and refine,
   existing efforts on explanatory neurodevelopmental models. Published by

Abstract = {{Despite ongoing projects involving the breeding and release of equids
   into semi-wild and wild environments, insufficient information is
   available in the literature that describes strategies used by equids to
   adapt and survive in a novel environment. The aim of this study was to
   assess the ability of naive, feral Equus caballus ( horse) mares to cope
   in a novel feral horse environment and investigate possible reasons why
   some may not survive this challenge. Four mares taken from a semi-arid
   desert environment remained in good health but significantly changed
   their movement behaviour pattern when surrounded by prime grazing
   habitat in a mesic temperate grassland. Three of the four mares captured
   from the prime grazing habitat and released in the semi-arid desert
   habitat died, apparently due to stress and/or starvation, within 8 weeks
   of release. The fourth mare survived 4 months but lost considerable
   weight.
   The group of mares relocated to the semi-arid desert environment had
   difficulty adapting to relocation and did not take up the movement
   behaviour strategy of local horses, which required long distance treks
   from a central water hole to distant feeding areas at least 15 km away.
   The movement behaviour, range use and health consequences of relocating
   equids may be of interest to wildlife ecologists, animal behaviourists
   and horse welfare groups. The observations may be used to guide those
   intending on relocating managed domestic and native horses to novel

   participants (n = 943). When testing evolutionary hypotheses explaining
   gender differences in fear of predators, we found partial support for
   the ``physical condition{''} hypothesis, because females either reported
   lower perceived body condition than males and their perceived body
   condition showed significant correlation with fear of brown bear, Ursus
   arctos. The negative association between fear and perceived body
   condition was stronger in males suggesting that fear evolved as a
   response to higher predation pressures on males in our evolutionary
   past, indirectly supporting the ``predation pressure{''} hypothesis.
   Males and participants with higher fear of bears wanted to exterminate
   bears by shooting more than others, suggesting that future management

   animals to have a higher metabolic rate when food availability is high.
   A model based on minimizing the ratio of mortality rate to net gain rate
   is used to determine how a willingness to take risks should be
   correlated with metabolic rate. My results establish that it is not
   always advantageous for animals to take greater risks when metabolic
   rate is high. When foraging intensity and metabolic rate coevolve, I
   show that in a particular case different combinations of foraging
   intensity and metabolic rate can have equal fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Many animals exhibit behavioural syndromes-consistent individual
   differences in behaviour across two or more contexts or situations.
   Here, we present adaptive, state-dependent mathematical models for
   analysing issues about behavioural syndromes. We find that asset
   protection (where individuals with more `assets' tend be more cautious)
   and starvation avoidance, two state-dependent mechanisms, can explain
   short-term behavioural consistency, but not long-term stable behavioural
   types (BTs). These negative-feedback mechanisms tend to produce
   convergence in state and behaviour over time. In contrast, a
   positive-feedback mechanism, state-dependent safety (where individuals
   with higher energy reserves, size, condition or vigour are better at
   coping with predators), can explain stable differences in personality
   over the long term. The relative importance of negative-and
   positive-feedback mechanisms in governing behavioural consistency
   depends on environmental conditions (predation risk and resource
   availability). Behavioural syndromes emerge more readily in conditions
   of intermediate ecological favourability (e. g. medium risk and medium
   resources, or high risk and resources, or low risk and resources). Under
   these conditions, individuals with higher initial state maintain a
   tendency to be bolder than individuals that start with low initial
   state; i.e. later BT is determined by state during an early
   `developmental window'. In contrast, when conditions are highly
   favourable (low risk, high resources) or highly unfavourable (high risk,
   low resources), individuals converge to be all relatively bold or all
   relatively cautious, respectively. In those circumstances, initial
   differences in BT are not maintained over the long term, and there is no
   early developmental window where initial state governs later BT. The
   exact range of ecological conditions favouring behavioural syndromes
   depends also on the strength of state-dependent safety.}},

Abstract = {{When experiencing resource competition or abrupt environmental change,
   animals often must transition rapidly from an ancestral diet to a novel,
   derived diet. Yet, little is known about the proximate mechanisms that
   mediate such rapid evolutionary transitions. Here, we investigated the
   role of diet-induced, cryptic genetic variation in facilitating the
   evolution of novel resource-use traits that are associated with a new
   feeding strategy-carnivory-in tadpoles of spadefoot toads (genus Spea).
   We specifically asked whether such variation in trophic morphology and
   fitness is present in Scaphiopus couchii, a species that serves as a
   proxy for ancestral Spea. We also asked whether corticosterone, a
   vertebrate hormone produced in response to environmental signals,
   mediates the expression of this variation. Specifically, we compared
   broad-sense heritabilities of tadpoles fed different diets or treated
   with exogenous corticosterone, and found that novel diets can expose
   cryptic genetic variation to selection, and that diet-induced hormones
   may play a role in revealing this variation. Our results therefore
   suggest that cryptic genetic variation may have enabled the evolutionary
   transition to carnivory in Spea tadpoles, and that such variation might
   generally facilitate rapid evolutionary transitions to novel diets.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity can improve fitness in unstable environments and
   can be expressed in many traits, such as life history attributes, growth
   and behavioural features. Microhabitat choice can have important
   consequences for development and survival of aquatic organisms and is
   expected to vary in response to stimuli, such as predation risk, food
   availability and temperature. At seasonal sites, microhabitat
   availability and associated benefits may change from season to season,
   which might lead to altered patterns of microhabitat use by tadpoles. We
   investigated this hypothesis in 17 streams from two localities in
   south-eastern Brazil. We tested whether water level drops significantly
   during the dry season, whether lower water level results in altered
   microhabitat availability and whether predation risk changes between
   seasons, based on predator density. We then tested whether tadpoles
   change their pattern of microhabitat use, their spatial niche breadth
   (given by diversity of used microhabitats) and spatial niche overlap (in
   the case of co-occurring species). We were able to include in our
   analyses tadpoles of four species of Hylidae, that occurred throughout
   both seasons. Stream depth decreased in the dry season, but microhabitat
   availability remained relatively stable in many streams, and predator
   density did not change significantly. Tadpoles of three out of the four
   species studied were more abundant during the dry season, which may be
   an adaptation to adjust time of metamorphosis to the rainy season.
   Tadpoles changed their patterns of microhabitat use between seasons,
   although the potential causing factors investigated did not seem to be
   responsible. Tadpole plasticity in microhabitat use may indicate the
   existence of selective pressures that vary through time and space and
   are still not well understood.}},

Abstract = {{Habituation to nonlethal predation stimuli may provide benefits for
   animals living in areas with frequent encounters with low-risk

   their antipredator responses, with shy individuals showing greater
   degree of responsiveness than bold individuals. However, the link
   between habituation or boldness and individual benefits has not been
   thoroughly investigated. We established whether and how two behavioral
   components associated with antipredator responses (habituation and
   boldness, and their interaction) would influence body condition, which
   is a parameter related to fitness. We conducted an outdoor semi-natural
   experiment with Iberian wall lizards (Podarcis hispanica). Individual
   boldness was consistent across contexts, but we did not find any effect
   of boldness or the interaction between boldness and habituation on body
   condition. However, those individuals that habituated more readily to a
   frequent predatory stimulus were able to increase their body condition
   more relative to lizards that habituated less. This finding highlights
   the importance of individual differences in behavioral plasticity, which
   could influence traits related to fitness. Habituation can provide
   benefits for individuals exposed to low-risk predators; however,
   individuals more prone to habituation could also experience mortality
   costs by wrongly habituating to a dangerous predator.}},

Abstract = {{The indirect, ecosystem-level consequences of ocean fishing, and
   particularly the mechanisms driving them, are poorly understood. Most
   studies focus on density-mediated trophic cascades, where removal of
   predators alternately causes increases and decreases in abundances of
   lower trophic levels. However, cascades could also be driven by where
   and when prey forage rather than solely by prey abundance. Over a large
   gradient of fishing intensity in the central Pacific's remote northern
   Line Islands, including a nearly pristine, baseline coral reef system,
   we found that changes in predation risk elicit strong behavioral
   responses in foraging patterns across multiple prey fish species. These
   responses were observed as a function of both short-term ({''}acute'')
   risk and longer-term ({''}chronic'') risk, as well as when prey were
   exposed to model predators to isolate the effect of perceived predation
   risk from other potentially confounding factors. Compared to numerical
   prey responses, antipredator behavioral responses such as these can
   potentially have far greater net impacts (by occurring over entire
   assemblages) and operate over shorter temporal scales (with potentially
   instantaneous response times) in transmitting top-down effects. A rich
   body of literature exists on both the direct effects of human removal of
   predators from ecosystems and predators' effects on prey behavior. Our
   results draw together these lines of research and provide the first
   empirical evidence that large-scale human removal of predators from a
   natural ecosystem indirectly alters prey behavior. These behavioral
   changes may, in turn, drive previously unsuspected alterations in reef
   food webs.}},

Abstract = {{beta-Cyclocitral is often present in eutrophic waters and is a well
   known source of airborne and drinking water malodor, but its production
   and functional ecology are unresolved. This volatile organic compound
   (VOC) is derived from the catalytic breakdown of beta-carotene, and
   evidence indicates that it is produced by the activation of a specific
   carotene oxygenase by all species of the bloom-forming cyanobacterium
   Microcystis. Previous work has shown that beta-cyclocitral affects
   grazer behavior, but the nature of this interaction and its influence on
   predator-prey dynamics was unresolved. The present study combined
   analytical and behavioral studies to evaluate this interaction by using
   Microcystis NRC-1 and Daphnia magna. Results showed that
   beta-cyclocitral was undetectable in live Microcystis cells, or present
   only at extremely low concentrations (2.6 amol/cell). In contrast, cell
   rupture activated a rapid carotene oxygenase reaction, which produced
   high amounts (77+/-5.5 amol beta-cyclocitral/cell), corresponding to a
   calculated maximum intracellular concentration of 2.2 mM. The behavioral
   response of Daphnia magna to beta-cyclocitral was evaluated in a bbe (c)
   Daphnia toximeter, where beta-cyclocitral treatments induced a marked
   increase in swimming velocity. Acclimation took place within a few
   minutes, when Daphnia returned to normal swimming velocity while still
   exposed to beta-cyclocitral. The minimum VOC concentration (odor
   threshold) that elicited a significant grazer response was 750 nM
   beta-cyclocitral, some 2,900 times lower than the per capita yield of a
   growing Microcystis cell after activation. Under natural conditions,
   initial grazer-related or other mode of cell rupture would lead to the
   development of a robust beta-cyclocitral microzone around Microcystis
   colonies, thus acting as both a powerful repellent and signal of poor
   quality food to grazers.}},

   temperament and parental perception of infant growth and appetite.
   Parental beliefs and understanding are crucial determinants of infant
   feeding behaviour; therefore any intervention would need to take account
   of their views. This study aimed to explore UK parents' beliefs
   concerning their infant's size, growth and feeding behaviour and
   parental receptiveness to early intervention aimed at reducing the risk
   of childhood obesity.
   Method: Six focus groups were undertaken in a range of different
   demographic localities, with parents of infants less than one year of
   age. The focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and
   thematic analysis applied using an interpretative, inductive approach.
   Results: 38 parents (n = 36 female, n = 2 male), age range 19-45 years
   (mean 30.1 years, SD 6.28) participated in the focus groups. 12/38 were
   overweight (BMI 25-29.99) and 8/38 obese (BMI >30). Five main themes
   were identified. These were a) parental concern about breast milk,
   infant contentment and growth; b) the belief that the main cause of
   infant distress is hunger is widespread and drives inappropriate
   feeding; c) rationalisation for infants' larger size; d) parental
   uncertainty about identifying and managing infants at risk of obesity
   and e) intentions and behaviour in relation to a healthy lifestyle.
   Conclusions: There are a number of barriers to early intervention with
   parents of infants at risk of developing obesity. Parents are receptive
   to prevention prior to weaning and need better support with best
   practice in infant feeding. In particular, this should focus on helping
   them understand the physiology of breast feeding, how to differentiate
   between infant distress caused by hunger and other causes and the timing
   of weaning. Some parents also need guidance about how to recognize and
   prepare healthy foods and facilitate physical activity for their
   infants.}},

Abstract = {{In aquatic systems, prey animals associate predation risk with cues that
   originate either from the predator or from injured conspecifics. Sources
   and benefits of these cues have received considerable attention in
   river, lake, and pond ecosystems but are less well understood in small
   container ecosystems that can hold less than a liter of water.
   Mosquitoes Aedes triseriatus (Say) and Auks albopictus (Skuse) encounter
   predatory Corethrella appendiculata (Grabham) and Toxorhynchites rutilus
   (Coquillett) in small containers and show antipredatory behavioral
   responses. We investigated the sources of the predation cues to which
   these prey larvae respond. We tested whether Ae. albopictus larvae show
   behavioral responses to cues emanating from the predator or from damage
   to prey caused by the act of predation. We also tested whether Ae.
   triseriatus respond to cues present in fluid or solid residues from
   predator activity. Ae. albopictus showed behavioral modifications only
   in response to waterborne cues from a feeding predator and not to cues
   from a starving predator, indicating that Ae. albopictus respond to cues
   created by the act of predation, which could include substances derived
   from damaged prey or substances in predator feces. Ae. triseriatus
   showed behavioral responses to solid residues from predation but not to
   fluid without those solids, indicating that the cues to which they
   respond originate in predator feces or uneaten prey body parts. Our
   results suggest that cues in this system may be primarily chemicals that
   are detected upon contact with solid residues that are products of the
   feeding processes of these predators.}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Based on mathematical models, antipredator defence mechanisms are
   commonly believed to have stabilizing effects on communities. However,
   empirical data are still lacking.
   2. We tested stabilizing effects of an inducible vertical migration
   defence in two Daphnia pulex clones in a 5-week field enclosure
   experiment. A defended (migrated down into darker water layers in the
   presence of fish chemicals in both laboratory and field experiments) and
   non-defended (no ability to react to fish chemicals) clone were directly
   exposed to fish predators and compared to control enclosures (no fish).
   3. In the absence of planktivorous fish, both defended and non-defended
   clones exhibited boom-and-bust dynamics, probably owing to
   over-exploitation of the food source. Predation almost led to extinction
   of the non-defended Daphnia clone during the experiment and the fish,
   deprived of food, lost weight. However, the population density of the
   defended clone was stable and it did not over-exploit the algal food
   source, while there was a continuous supply of food to the fish, which
   consequently gained weight.
   4. We conclude that both consumptive and non-consumptive (also called
   non-lethal or trait-mediated) predator effects, coupled with prey
   defences, are key contributors to prey stability. This has a positive
   effect on both the predator and the food organism of the prey.}},

Abstract = {{In nestlings, glucocorticoid (GC) secretion has short-term and long-term
   fitness consequences. For example, short-time elevations trigger begging
   activity, whereas chronically elevated GC levels impair body condition,
   growth and cognitive abilities. Despite a growing body of literature on
   personality traits, the effects of selection for fast and slow
   exploration on GC secretion have received little attention. We compared
   baseline and stress-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
   activity of hand-reared great tit nestlings of lines selected for fast
   and slow exploration. Nestling droppings were collected under three
   conditions: control, test (following handling stress, day 14 after
   hatching) and the following day. The concentrations of excreted
   immunoreactive corticosterone metabolites (CM) were determined via an
   enzyme immunoassay. We also observed nestlings' begging behaviour. CM
   differed significantly between the lines. Nestlings of the fast line
   excreted lower CM than slow-line birds. In response to handling stress,
   nestlings excreted significantly higher concentrations of CM than during
   the control and on the day after handling. Sex and begging activity were
   not related to CM levels. Under the control condition, but not after
   handling, males begged significantly more often than females. In both
   lines, adults excreted significantly less CM compared to nestlings. Both
   nestlings and adults of the slow line produced higher baseline CM values
   than fast-line birds. Fast-line nestlings excreted lower baseline CM
   than nestlings of a wild population not selected for fast or slow
   exploration. Slow-line nestlings did not. Our results show that
   selection on the basis of exploratory behaviour affected HPA axis

Title = {{Interactions between the information content of different chemical cues

Journal = {{OIKOS}},

Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1814-1822}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Animals often alter their behaviour, morphology and physiology in the
   presence of predators. These induced defences can be fine-tuned by a
   variety of environmental factors such as predator species, acute
   predation risk or food availability. It has, however, remained unclear
   what cues influence the extent and quality of induced defences and how
   the information content of these cues interact to determine the
   development of antipredator defences. We performed an experiment to
   study the significance of direct chemical cues, originating from the
   predators themselves, and indirect cues, released by attacked or
   consumed prey, for phenotypic responses in Rana dalmatina tadpoles. We
   reared tadpoles in the presence of caged predators (Triturus vulgaris,
   Aeshna cyanea) fed either one or three tadpoles every other day outside
   the tadpole-rearing tanks. Fifteen hours after food provisioning,
   predators were put back into the tanks containing focal tadpoles either
   after washing (direct + digestion-released cues) or with the water
   containing remnants of the prey (direct + all types of indirect cues).
   Our results suggest that direct cues together with digestion-released
   cues can be sufficient to induce strong antipredator responses. Induced
   defences depended on both direct cues, affecting predator-specific
   responses, and the quantity of indirect cues, resulting in graded
   responses to differences in predation threat. Moreover, direct and
   indirect cues interacted in behaviour, resulting in predator-specific
   graded responses. We also observed a decrease in the extent of
   predator-induced responses in large tadpoles as compared to small ones.
   Our results, thus, suggest that prey integrate multiple cues about
   predators to optimize induced defences and that this process changes
   during ontogeny.}},

Journal = {{SALUD MENTAL}},

Volume = {{33}},

Pages = {{535-542}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this second paper of the Brain, Drugs and Genes review we would like
   to discuss illicit drugs and the genetics that may predispose subjects
   to addiction.
   We describe the effects, action sites and pathophysiological
   consequences of the use of these illicit drugs. The drugs that are
   reviewed are marijuana, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and
   3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine or MDMA, also known as ecstasy. All of
   them cause an effect on the brain, modifying the activity of the
   neuronal systems, altering the activity or availability of the
   neurotransmitters or emulating their actions. The risk of dependence is
   related to the velocity with which these drugs induce plastic changes in
   the brain, very much like a learning process. Such changes underlie the
   patient's dependerce to drugs. Therefore when a long term user quits and
   deprives the brain abruptly of these drugs, an abstinence syndrome is
   precipitated and it may be quite severe. Only for marijuana it seems to
   be mild, misleading people to believe this drug does not cause physical
   dependence.
   Marijuana (Cannabis sativa) is a plant which has its active principle
   Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in almost all its parts, i.e. the
   flowers, stems, seeds and leaves. It actually contains over 60
   cannobinoids as well as other chemical compounds. Marijuana causes
   euphoria followed by relaxation and several other reinforcing effects.
   Among the adverse effects marijuana causes: alteration of short-term
   memory, slowness of reflexes, depression and anxiety, bronchitis and
   lung infections. Marijuana effects depend on the activation of the CB1
   and CB2 receptors, distributed in the entire body. The CBI receptor is
   mainly present in the brain. In medicine, Delta 9-THC has been useful in
   treating symptoms caused by chemotherapy, and in treating the anorexia
   caused by the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Also, an antagonist
   of the CB1 receptor, Rimonabant, has been used to treat morbid obesity
   with certain degree of success. However, despite this promising
   application of Rimonabant, the side effects it caused led to its
   withdrawal from the market in Europe, Canada and Mexico.
   Heroin, derived from morphine, which in turn is isolated from opium,
   causes euphoria and analgesia, suppresses hunger, increases energy and
   induces sleepiness. The adverse effects are liver and kidney diseases as
   well as a decrease in breathing and heart rates. This drug acts on the
   opioid receptors: MOR, DOR and KOR. Cocaine, derived from the coca plant
   (Erythroxylum coca) produces immediate rewarding effects that last
   between 30 to 60 min, and causes anxiety once its serum concentration
   drops. Due to its very short half-life, it is the most addictive of all
   drugs. Cocaine reduces hunger, thirst and sleep. The most used forms of
   cocaine are powder and crack (available as rock). The mechanism of
   action by which cocaine and related compounds induce their effects is
   the blockade of the dopamine transporter at the synapsis, leaving
   dopamine available for a longer time at the synapses of the
   motivation-reward system. Cocaine and related compounds induce blood
   vessel constriction, muscular spasm, chest pain, and an increase in
   heart rate and blood pressure, thus augmenting the risk of cardiac
   arrest and stroke.
   The methamphetamine, a synthetic stimulant, is a crystalline, odorless,
   bitter drug which causes a pleasant feeling and euphoria. Its action
   mechanism is the blockade of the dopamine transporter, same as cocaine.
   The effects pursued by the users of crystal methamphetamine are
   increased alertness, increase in physical activity and decrease in
   hunger. Its side effects include increase in body temperature, heart
   rate and blood pressure, thus augmenting the risk for stroke.
   Methamphetamine also triggers violent behavior, anxiety, irritability,
   confusion, paranoia and hallucinations. This compound has been used for
   medical reasons, such as in the treatment of narcolepsy and obesity.
   3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA or ecstasy, is a synthetic
   compound with stimulant and hallucinatory effects. Its action is exerted
   mainly on the serotonin transporter, leaving serotonin available at the
   synapsis for a longer time. After clearance from the bloodstream this
   drug causes severe depression. Ecstasy is also combined with other
   stimulants.
   All the drugs discussed here induce body changes that compromise the
   life of the user, or his health at the very least. Despite this fact,
   the highly reinforcing effects the drugs produce by over activating the
   motivation-rewarding system compel their repetitive use. Not all users,
   however, are equally vulnerable to becoming addicted or respond the same
   way to the use of drugs. The individual response depends, in part, on
   genetic factors, as we discuss in the following section.
   It is evident that not only environmental factors account for the
   vulnerability to addiction. Genetic factors also have a substantial
   contribution. In order to facilitate the understanding of the
   interaction environment-gene, we define the following concepts: gene,
   allele, mutation, polymorphism, heritability and epigenesis. Apparently,
   the genetic contribution to addiction vulnerability varies depending on
   the drug. For example, cocaine and opiates are much more dependant on
   genetic factors to trigger addiction than are nicotine, alcohol or
   marijuana. Mutations or polymorphisms carried by several genes might
   make the difference between being at high or low risk for addiction.
   They may also underlie the degree of response to rehabilitation
   treatments.
   Addiction, then, is a result of an interaction between environment and
   genes. Environmental demands make the organism modify its structure and
   physiology in order to cope efficiently to such demands. One crucial way
   to do so is by changing gene expression. Changes in gene expression may
   be a consequence of chemical rearrangements in the chromatin structure,
   which lead to transcriptional modifications that affect the expression
   of the proteins the genes encode. Consequently, the normal functions of
   such proteins in different systems are also altered. These adaptive
   rearrangements in the chromatin structure are called epigenesis. The
   epigenetic changes induced by environmental stimuli have been proved to
   affect the expression of several neurotransmitter receptors and trophic
   factors, among many other molecules crucial for the proper functioning
   of the Central Nervous System. Hence, these chromatin's structural
   changes, triggered by environmental demands, are most likely to help the
   subject cope with such specific demands. However, this adaptation is not
   free of charge, and requires a toll to be paid which is: vulnerability
   to addiction.
   Finally, one question arises: Who is the person most likely to seek a
   drug of abuse? Statistics have shown that those patients suffering from
   a psychiatric illness. This hypothesis suggests that addiction is a
   symptom or a disease caused by a psychiatric illness such as a
   personality disorder, depression or schizophrenia. Hence, at the end,
   drug addiction would be a co-morbid entity, generating what in Spanish
   we call the dual-disease. On the other hand, the self-medication
   hypothesis also makes sense, at least for an extensive group of
   patients. This hypothesis suggests that patients take drugs of abuse to
   relief the symptoms caused by their psychiatric pathology.
   The present review discusses the interaction between brain circuits,
   drugs and genes to generate an addict patient. We do not intend to
   revise each field exhaustively, but rather we intend to give the reader
   a general scenario on the convergence of these three worlds. Thus it may
   be better understood how addiction develops and how it may be treated.}},

Abstract = {{The family, as the basic social unit, has a decisive role in the health
   and disease of its members. It is the primary unit where health needs
   are formed and solved. By its own resources the family independently
   resolves about 75\% of the total health requirements. In the paper the
   authors study family characteristics which influence family health and
   diseases, indicators of family health and the scale of life values.
   Also, the study evaluates social factors, communication and the
   influence of the usage of psychoactive substances on family health and
   the quality of family life. To form the personality of a child three
   factors are most significant: love, the feeling of safety and the
   presence of harmonious relationship between the parents. Life harmony in
   a family also depends on the quality of structural components of the
   personality and the interaction of motivation of its members. Early
   childhood determines the future personality of the adult person. At that
   period, habits and partially attitudes are formed. In harmonious family
   relationships the parents are the role model to children. Verbal and
   non-verbal communication enrich the relationship among people and enable
   efforts in supporting understanding, compassion and care for others by
   mutual agreement. On the scale of life values of Serbian citizens health
   holds the first position. Immediately following the health issue is good
   relationship in the family. As healthcare is not only the task of
   healthcare services, but also of each individual, family and the society
   as a whole, it is on healthcare personnel to educate the citizens how to
   preserve and improve their own health and the health of their family by
   a continual healthcare and education. Above all, this concerns avoidance
   of bad habits, such as smoking, immoderate alcohol consumption, narcotic
   abuse, physical inactivity, hypercaloric nutrition, etc. Also, it is
   significant to make an early recognition of disease symptoms and to turn
   for help to the chosen doctor on time. Family medicine and family
   doctors can in the best way, entirely and continually, prevent and treat
   numerous diseases occurring as the result of family dysfunction, with
   active participation of each individual, family, healthcare services and
   the community.}},

Abstract = {{Animals' ability to adjust their behaviour when environmental conditions
   change can increase their likelihood of survival. Although such
   behavioural flexibility is regularly observed in the field, it has
   proven difficult to systematically quantify and predict inter-individual
   differences in free-living animals. We presented 24 Zenaida doves
   (Zenaida aurita) on 12 territories with two learning tests in their
   natural habitat in Barbados. The dove pairs showed high site fidelity
   and territoriality, allowing us to test individuals repeatedly while
   accounting for the effects of territorial chases and pair bonds on our
   learning measures. We used a foraging apparatus that enabled Zenaida
   doves to access seed, yet excluded other species, and measured doves'
   performance on colour discrimination and reversal learning tests. We
   found that (1) doves on all 12 territories passed the two tests; (2)
   mates within a pair were consistently solvers or scroungers; (3) sex,
   body condition and territorial chases did not consistently affect
   learning rates; (4) tameness was a significant negative predictor of
   learning to feed from the foraging apparatus and (5) scrounging within
   pairs seemed to facilitate learning. Our study presents a method to
   quantify intraspecific differences in behavioural flexibility in the
   field and relate these to individuals' physical and social traits. (c)

   perceived inadequacy of income and the use of `'religion'' and
   `'disengagement'' to cope with stress. Conclusions: These results are
   the first known to identify coping style and perceived income inadequacy
   as predictors of high CRH. Women with perceived inadequacy of income had
   almost three times the odds for high CRH. Women who used religion or
   disengagement to cope with stress had 14 times and 7 times the odds for
   high CRH levels, respectively. Higher CRH levels are associated with
   preterm birth (PTB). Thus, it may be important to include maternal
   coping style and perceptions of income inadequacy in future
   investigations of CRH levels and PTB.}},

Abstract = {{Seed caching by desert rodents in the family Heteromyidae is an
   important behavioral adaptation for animals living in environments with
   limited and unpredictable food resources. Heteromyids cache seeds
   throughout their home ranges, either concentrated in I location (larder
   hoard) or in multiple, small seed piles (scatter hoards). To minimize
   cache pilferage by other rodents, coexisting species may scatter hoard
   seeds in distinct microhabitats. We examined interspecific differences
   in caching and pilfering behaviors of 3 coexisting heteromyid rodents,
   Merriam's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys merriami), the pale kangaroo mouse
   (Microdipodops pallidus), and the little pocket mouse (Perognathus
   longimembris), to determine if caching microhabitat affects likelihood
   of pilferage. In outdoor enclosures we tracked cache placement and
   measured pilferage of artificial caches using radiolabeled Indian
   ricegrass (Achnatherum hymenoides) seeds. M. pallidus and P.
   longimembris placed seed caches mostly under shrubs, whereas D. merriami
   placed caches predominately in open microhabitat. However, D. merriami
   showed a significant preference for pilfering caches under shrubs,
   whereas P. longimembris did not show a significant preference for
   pilfering caches in either open or undershrub microhabitats. The 2
   species pilfered similar numbers of caches. Coexisting heteroymid rodent
   species may contribute to spatial heterogeneity of available resources
   by caching in different microhabitats, thereby reducing but not
   eliminating cache pilferage by other species. DOI:

Abstract = {{Dieting is an important risk factor for disordered eating and eating
   disorders. Disordered eating occurs on a continuum from dieting and
   restrictive eating, abnormal eating behavior, and finally clinical
   eating disorders. The prevalence of eating disorders is increased in
   elite athletes and for this group the cause of starting to diet is
   related to (a) perception of the paradigm of appearance in the specific
   sport, (b) perceived performance improvements, and (c) sociocultural
   pressures for thinness or an ``ideal{''} body. Athletes most at risk for
   disordered eating are those involved in sports emphasizing a thin body
   size/shape, a high power-to-weight ratio, and/or sports utilizing weight
   categories, such as in some high-intensity sports. In addition to
   dieting, personality factors, pressure to lose weight, frequent weight
   cycling, early start of sport-specific training, overtraining, injuries,
   and unfortunate coaching behavior, are important risk factors. To
   prevent disordered eating and eating disorders, the athletes have to
   practice healthy eating, and the medical staff of teams and parents must
   be able to recognize symptoms indicating risk for eating disorders.
   Coaches and leaders must accept that disordered eating can be a problem
   in the athletic community and that openness regarding this challenge is

Abstract = {{Pb (lead) exposure and stress are co-occurring risk factors
   (particularly in low socioeconomic communities) that also act on common
   biological substrates and produce common adverse outcomes, including
   cognitive impairments. This study sought to determine whether lifetime
   Pb exposure combined with prenatal stress would enhance the cognitive
   deficits independently associated with each of these risk factors and to
   explore associated mechanisms of any observed impairments. Learning was
   evaluated using a multiple schedule of repeated learning and performance
   in female rats subjected to lifetime Pb exposure (0 or 50 ppm Pb in
   drinking water beginning in dams 2 months prior to breeding; blood Pb
   levels similar to 10 mu g/dl), to prenatal restraint stress on
   gestational days 16 and 17, or to both. Blood Pb, corticosterone levels,
   brain monoamines, and hippocampal nerve growth factor levels were also
   measured. Sequence-specific learning deficits produced by Pb,
   particularly the number of responses to correctly learn response
   sequences, were further enhanced by stress, whereas performance measures
   were unimpaired. Statistical analyses indicated significant
   relationships among corticosterone levels, frontal cortex dopamine (DA),
   nucleus accumbens dopamine turnover, and total responses required to
   learn sequences. This study demonstrates that Pb and stress can act
   together to produce selective and highly condition-dependent deficits in
   learning in female rats that may be related to glucocorticoid-mediated
   interactions with mesocorticolimbic regions of brain. These findings
   also underscore the critical need to evaluate toxicants in the context
   of other risk factors pertinent to human diseases and disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The response of bystanders to information available in their social

   In doing so, animals can accrue immediate benefits by manipulating (or
   helping) individuals with whom they are currently interacting and
   delayed benefits by convincing bystanders that they are more fit or
   cooperative than perhaps is warranted. In this paper, I provide some
   illustrative examples of how bystanders could apply added positive
   selection pressure on both cooperative behaviour and dishonest
   signalling during courtship or conflict. I also discuss how the presence
   of bystanders might select for greater flexibility in behavioural
   strategies (e.g. conditional or condition dependence), which could
   maintain dishonesty at evolutionarily stable frequencies under some
   ecological conditions. By recognizing bystanders as a significant

Abstract = {{Inducible defense, which is phenotypic plasticity in traits that affect
   predation risk, is taxonomically widespread and has been shown to have
   important ecological consequences. However, it remains unclear what
   factors promote the evolution of qualitatively different defense
   strategies and when evolution should favor strategies that involve
   modification of multiple traits. Previous theory suggests that
   individual-level trade-offs play a key role in defense evolution, but
   most of this work has assumed that trade-offs are independent. Here we
   show that the shape of the behavioral trade-off between foraging gain
   and predation risk determines the interaction between this trade-off and
   the life-history trade-off between growth and reproduction. The
   interaction between these fundamental trade-offs determines the optimal
   investment into behavioral and life-history defenses. Highly nonlinear
   foraging-predation risk trade-offs favor the evolution of behavioral
   defenses, while linear trade-offs favor life-history defenses. Between
   these extremes, integrated defense responses are optimal, with defense
   expression strongly depending on ontogeny. We suggest that these
   predictions may be general across qualitatively different defenses. Our
   results have important implications for theory on the ecological effects
   of inducible defense, which has not considered how qualitatively
   different defenses might alter ecological interactions.}},

Abstract = {{In the constant darkness of cave environments fish locomotion has to be
   directed by nonvisual spatial information. Four series of tests were
   done to determine the ability of the hypogean cyprinid Phreatichthys
   andruzzii Vinciguerra, 1924 to memorize a synthetic chemical cue
   (morpholine, C4H9NO), to associate it with an area, to utilize such
   information for direct locomotory activity, and to determine how long
   that association is retained in fish memory. Although morpholine acts as
   neutral stimulus for P. andruzzii, after acclimation in
   morpholine-scented areas devoid of food resources specimens showed a
   clear tendency to avoid waters characterized by the odour of that
   chemical. We hypothesize that an association between odours and trophic
   characteristics of an area allows the fish to optimize their exploratory
   activity, as it allows them to recognize areas already experienced to be
   devoid of trophic resources and to avoid these as unprofitable places.
   The above association seems to be memorized for a short time; the
   behavioural response vanishing between 6 and 18 h after the end of the
   acclimation period. After a certain time has elapsed, it could be
   profitable to visit the same areas again to verify the incidental

Abstract = {{In many taxa the timing of metamorphosis is plastic in response to
   predation risk during the pre-metamorphic stage, and trends in both age
   and body size at metamorphosis have been the subject of much study. The
   responses to cues of predators are predominantly to be larger or
   equal-sized at the same age or older at metamorphosis. These
   observations are in direct contrast with existing theoretical treatments
   of this plasticity, which mostly predict earlier and smaller
   metamorphosis and never later and larger metamorphosis without invoking
   indirect effects on growth rate. Here we resolve the discrepancy between
   theory and observation using a dynamic state-dependent model that
   incorporates morphological and behavioral responses to predation risk.
   We allow prey to choose the optimal activity level and/or investment in
   defense over the growth period. We show that under certain conditions,
   metamorphosis at a larger size and later time is likely to be optimal.
   Our analysis allows us to make testable predictions about the changes in
   activity level of prey as they grow and how the effect of providing
   refuges will vary with predator type. Several of these predictions are
   supported by a meta-analysis of metamorphic responses to caged predators
   by larval amphibians and insects. Our predictions lead to insights about
   the feedback effects of antipredator responses on growth and subsequent

Abstract = {{The genic capture model offers a promising solution to the lek paradox.
   Heightened condition dependency of sexually selected traits is a
   prerequisite of this model. Condition dependency is empirically inferred
   by the sensitivity of traits to stressors. The magnitude of ecological
   stress (e.g., competition and predation) experienced by populations
   varies considerably. Thus, condition dependence should manifest more in
   populations experiencing higher levels of stress. We experimentally
   assessed the sensitivity of a sexually selected trait (posterior
   gnathopod) to food resource stress in an amphipod species. We found that
   gnathopod size variation was 59\% higher under food stress, with no
   corresponding effect on nonsexually selected traits. In addition, we
   assessed levels of gnathopod variation and the allometry of gnathopods
   for males sampled from natural populations for two amphipod species that
   experience different levels of stress (driven by contrasting
   size-selective predation and associated life-history trade-offs).
   Populations that experience higher resource stress had both steeper
   allometries and greater gnathopod size variation. These results suggest
   that the magnitude of ecological stress experienced by natural
   populations strongly impacts condition dependency of sexually selected
   traits, and could play an important role in shaping trait variation and

Journal = {{HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{599-605}},

Abstract = {{Proximate mediators of reproductive behaviors in vertebrates have a long
   history of study. In fishes, relatively few studies have focused on
   hormonal control of parental care, despite a comprehensive background on
   the general physiology of fishes, and the frequent occurrence of
   parental care behaviors. Studies on this taxon have repeatedly found
   that the relationships between androgens and paternal care do not follow
   the predictions made in the avian and mammalian literature.
   Glucocorticoids may also have a role in mediating parental behaviors,
   possibly through their role as regulators of metabolism. As such, we
   investigated the role of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) and cortisol in
   mediating parental effort of male smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu)
   by manipulating hormone titers in wild fish. In smallmouth bass, males
   spawn annually with a single female and defend a single brood for up to
   30 days. Treatment of parental fish with cyproterone acetate (CYA; an
   androgen receptor antagonist) resulted in a decrease in nest defense in
   response to a simulated brood predator; however, no changes in nest
   success, nest tending or biochemical indicators of nutritional status
   were detected. Treatment with exogenous cortisol did not change parental
   behavior, but did increase the rate of nest failure, possibly owing to
   the energetic cost of chronically elevated cortisol concentrations. We
   discuss these findings in the context of resource-driven trade-offs and
   highlight life history as an important factor controlling parental
   effort in species with costly parental care behaviors. (C) 2010 Elsevier

   10.1152/jn.00340.2010. Rats use their vibrissa (whiskers) to explore and
   navigate the environment. These sensory signals are distributed within
   the brain stem by the trigeminal complex and are also relayed to the
   superior colliculus in the midbrain and to the thalamus (and
   subsequently barrel cortex) in the forebrain. In the intermediate layers
   of the superior colliculus, whisker-evoked responses are driven by
   direct inputs from the trigeminal complex (trigeminotectal) and feedback
   from the barrel cortex (corticotectal). But the effects of the
   behavioral state of the animal on the spontaneous firing and sensory
   responses of these neurons are unknown. By recording from freely
   behaving rats, we show that the spontaneous firing of whisker sensitive
   neurons in superior colliculus is higher, or in an activated mode,
   during active exploration and paradoxical sleep and much lower, or in a
   quiescent/deactivated mode, during awake immobility and slow-wave sleep.
   Sensory evoked responses in superior colliculus also depend on
   behavioral state. Most notably, feedback corticotectal responses are
   significantly larger during the quiescent/deactivated mode, which tracks
   the barrel cortex responses on which they depend. Finally, sensory
   evoked responses depend not only on the state of the animal but also on
   the orienting response elicited by the stimulus, which agrees with the
   well known role of the superior colliculus in orienting about salient

Abstract = {{Among other strategies to improve fish welfare in rearing environment,
   domestication and/or selective breeding was proposed to minimize fish
   responsiveness to husbandry practices. To verify this hypothesis on a
   recently domesticated specie, the sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, L., an
   experiment was realized, using four populations differing according to
   their level of domestication or selection: one population produced from
   wild parents (Wild), one population produced from parents domesticated
   for one generation (Domesticated) and two produced from parents selected
   for growth for one generation (Selected A and Selected B). The
   experiment was carried out over 91 days with 600 fish (50 fish per tank,
   150 fish per population). After a control period, the fish were
   submitted from day 35 and during 56 days to a stress treatment including
   frequent and random application of 4 acute stressors (pursuing fish with
   a net during 1 min, switching off the light for 2 s during the day or,
   conversely, switching on the light for 2 s during the night, and
   overflying a bird predator silhouette above the tank during 30 s). The
   two variables that were measured, i.e.: fish self-feeding behavior and
   growth performance {[}at days (D) 14, 35, 63, and 91] were both altered,
   albeit differentially according to populations, by the stress treatment.
   During the first stress period (from D35 to D63), all groups modified
   their feeding rhythm and highly increased their feed intake while their
   growth rate decreased (Domesticated and both Selected fish groups) or
   remained stable (Wild). During the second stress period (from D64 to
   D91) fish continued to modify their feeding rhythm (being more and more
   diurnal) and increased again their feed intake; conversely to what
   happened during the first stress period, here, these modifications were
   associated with an improvement of the growth rate of all populations.
   During the whole experiment, both Selected groups and Domesticated fish
   were always characterized by a higher body mass, specific growth rate
   and body condition factor than Wild fish. In conclusion, and according
   to the results of this study, a first generation of domestication or
   selection improved fish growth performance but, at this early stage do
   not modify behavioral responses to repeated acute stress exposure. (C)

Abstract = {{Risk is a fundamental driver of prey behaviour, but the importance of
   risk in the decision-making processes of top predators is poorly
   understood. We investigated the functions of vigilance behaviour in wild
   spotted hyaenas. These large carnivores have few predators but face
   frequent threats of attack and food theft by conspecifics. We made
   repeated observations of vigilance behaviour by hyaenas when they were
   resting, feeding and nursing, and examined variation due to age, group
   size, social rank, and factors related to predation risk. We used these
   observations to test whether vigilance functions in hyaenas to detect
   prey, mates, conspecific threats or interspecific threats, and whether
   functions differ between juveniles and adults. We found that adults were
   more vigilant than juveniles in all contexts. Vigilance by adults was
   greatest when nursing, but nursing females reduced their vigilance as
   cubs matured. Among both age groups, vigilance decreased with increasing
   group size, and hyaenas were less vigilant when feeding on high-quality
   food than when feeding on low-quality food. Social rank did not affect

Abstract = {{Among mammals, social ranking is generally thought to affect the outcome
   of disputes over preferred, limited or future resources. Therefore, we
   should expect individuals' preference for conspecifics to be affected by
   their own and other individuals' competition capacity. Here, we
   investigated the social preference and behavioural response in farmed
   silver fox vixens (Vulpes vulpes) towards unfamiliar vixens of different
   competition capacities, measured by their ability to compete for and
   defend a limited food resource, in a choice test. We found that low
   competition capacity vixens spent significantly less time in front of
   the high competition capacity vixens (2647 +/- 600 s) compared to the
   time they spent in front of the low competition capacity vixens (6041
   +/- 877 s, P < 0.05). in addition, the low competition capacity vixens
   spent significantly less time in front of the high competition capacity
   vixens (2647 +/- 600 s) compared to what the high competition capacity
   vixens did (4215 +/- 657 s, P = 0.03). This suggests that low
   competition capacity vixens perceive high competition capacity vixens as
   a greater potential threat than high competition capacity vixens do.
   Time spent in social exploration, resting, sitting and performing
   aggressive behaviours in front of a stimulus animal were also affected
   by competition capacity of the foxes. The vixens were also retreating
   significantly more from the high competition capacity vixens (2 +/- 0.8
   times) than from the low competition capacity vixens (0.4 +/- 0.4 times,
   P = 0.03), possibly reflecting that the high competition capacity vixens
   were more offensive than the low competition capacity vixens. Our
   results contribute to the knowledge of social behaviour in this species,
   and may have implications for the social housing environment of the farm
   foxes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Collective animal behaviour has attracted much attention recently, but
   cause-and-effect within interaction sequences has often been difficult
   to establish. To tackle this problem, we constructed a robotic fish
   ('Robofish') with which three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus
   aculeatus L.) interact. Robofish is a computer-controlled replica
   stickleback that can be programmed to move around a tank. First, we
   demonstrated the functioning of the method: that the sticklebacks
   interacted with Robofish. We examined two types of interaction:
   recruitment and leadership. We found that Robofish could recruit a
   single fish from a refuge and could initiate a turn in singletons and in
   groups of ten, i.e. act as a leader. We also showed that the influence
   of Robofish diminished after the first 30 min that fish spent in a new
   environment. Second, using this method, we investigated the effects of
   metric and topological inter-individual distance on the influence that
   Robofish had on the orientation of fish in a shoal of ten. We found that
   inter-individual interactions during this turn were predominantly
   mediated by topological, rather than metric, distance. Finally, we
   discussed the potential of this novel method and the importance of our
   findings for the study of collective animal behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity is a major health challenge facing the modern world. Some
   evidence points to obesity itself as the main driver of premature
   mortality. We propose that this view is oversimplified. For example,
   high levels of physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are
   associated with lower mortality, even in those who are overweight or
   obese. To address this issue, we combine epidemiological and
   physiological evidence in a new paradigm that integrates excess calorie
   intake, sedentary behavior, and a maladaptive response to stress. Human
   physiology is optimized to allow large distances to be covered on foot
   every day in order to find enough food to sustain brain metabolism.
   Furthermore, when the body is immobilized by an injury, it triggers
   efficient life-saving metabolic and inflammatory responses. Both these
   critical adaptations are, however, confounded by a sedentary lifestyle.
   The implications of these issues for clinical trial design and
   epidemiologic data analysis are discussed in this article.}},

Abstract = {{Morphological novelties are lineage-specific traits that serve new
   functions(1,2). Developmental polyphenisms have been proposed to be
   facilitators of phenotypic evolution, but little is known about the
   interplay between the associated genetic and environmental
   factors(3-11). Here, we study two alternative morphologies in the mouth
   of the nematode Pristionchus pacificus and the formation of teeth-like
   structures that are associated with bacteriovorous feeding and predatory
   behaviour on fungi and other worms(12-16). These teeth-like denticles
   represent an evolutionary novelty, which is restricted to some members
   of the nematode family Diplogastridae but is absent from Caenorhabditis
   elegans and related nematodes(14). We show that the mouth dimorphism is
   a polyphenism that is controlled by starvation and the co-option of an
   endocrine switch mechanism. Mutations in the nuclear hormone receptor
   DAF-12 and application of its ligand, the sterol hormone dafachronic
   acid, strongly influence this switch mechanism. The dafachronic
   acid-DAF-12 module has been shown to control the formation of arrested
   dauer larvae in both C. elegans and P. pacificus, as well as related
   life-history decisions in distantly related nematodes(17-20). The
   comparison of dauer formation and mouth morphology switch reveals that
   different thresholds of dafachronic acid signalling provide specificity.
   This study shows how hormonal signalling acts by coupling environmental
   change and genetic regulation and identifies dafachronic acid as a key

   the hypothesis that novelty affects performance in a paw preference task

   days prior to the first testing session, HAB mice were placed in the
   testing box daily. After the fourth session, animals were deprived of
   food for 24 h. On the 5th day, food pellets were placed inside a feeding
   tube and animals were allowed to make 25 successful retrievals of food
   pellets. The testing procedure was repeated 4 days later. CT mice were
   not submitted to the habituation sessions. A significant side-dependent
   difference in consistency of laterality was observed between groups in
   the first session: all (100\%) right-pawed CT mice used their right paw
   to make their first successful retrieval of food in the first testing
   session, while only 61\% of left-pawed mice used their left paw. The
   same pattern was observed when the first five retrievals were
   considered: 100\% right-pawed CT mice and 72\% left-pawed CT mice were
   consistent. No differences were observed in the HAB group: in both
   side-preference subgroups, 88\% of the animals showed consistent
   laterality. These results indicate that behavioural lateralization in

Abstract = {{Anorexia nervosa (AN) is perhaps the most lethal mental disorder, in
   part due to starvation-related health problems, but especially because
   of high suicide rates. One potential reason for high suicide rates in AN
   may be that those affected face pain and provocation on many fronts,
   which may in turn reduce their fear of pain and thereby increase risk
   for death by suicide. The purpose of the following studies was to
   explore whether repetitive exposure to painful and destructive behaviors
   such as vomiting, laxative use, and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) was
   a mechanism that linked AN-binge-purging (ANBP) subtype, as opposed to
   AN-restricting subtype (ANR), to extreme suicidal behavior. Study 1
   utilized a sample of 787 individuals diagnosed with one or the other
   subtype of AN, and structural equation modeling results supported
   provocative behaviors as a mechanism linking ANBP to suicidal behavior.
   A second, unexpected mechanism emerged linking ANR to suicidal behavior
   via restricting. Study 2, which used a sample of 249 AN patients,
   replicated these findings, including the second mechanism linking ANR to
   suicide attempts. Two potential routes to suicidal behavior in AN appear
   to have been identified: one route through repetitive experience with
   provocative behaviors for ANBP, and a second for exposure to pain
   through the starvation of restricting in ANR. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Most current wildlife habitat models, such as resource selection
   functions, typically assume a static environment, extrapolate poorly in
   space and time, and often lack linkages to population processes. We
   submit that more mechanistic habitat models that directly consider
   bottom-up resources affecting growth and reproduction (i.e., food) and
   top-down limitations affecting survival are needed to effectively
   predict habitat quality, especially in the presence of rapid
   environmental change. Here we present a general model for estimating
   potential habitat quality (relating to growth and reproduction) and
   realised habitat quality (accounting for survival) using basic knowledge
   of the species' seasonal diet, predicted locations of food resource
   patches and regional patterns in mortality risk. We illustrate our model
   for a threatened population of grizzly bears in west-central Alberta.
   Bi-monthly potential habitat quality successfully predicted habitat
   selection by radio-collared grizzly bears, while multi-seasonal realised
   habitat quality predicted patterns in occupancy-abundance as measured
   from unique bears at hair-snag sites. Bottom-up resources therefore
   predicted patterns of habitat selection, while top-down processes
   (survival) were necessary to scale-up to population measures. We suggest
   that more direct measures of resources and environments that affect
   growth, reproduction and survival, as well as match the temporal scale
   of animal behaviour, be considered when developing wildlife habitat
   models. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   pre- and postnatal development can induce lasting effects on health and
   disease risk in later life up to old age, including later obesity risk,

   Three meta-analyses of observational studies found that obesity risk at
   school age was reduced with early breastfeeding compared to formula
   feeding. We assumed that breastfeeding protects against later obesity by
   reducing the occurrence of high weight gain in infancy and that one
   causative factor is the lower protein content of human milk compared to
   usual infant formulas (the ``early protein hypothesis{''}). We are
   testing this hypothesis in the European Childhood Obesity Project, a
   double-blind, randomized clinical trial enrolling 1,678 infants in five
   countries (Belgium, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain). We have randomized
   healthy infants born at term to receive for the first year infant
   formula and follow-on formula with higher or lower protein contents,
   respectively. The follow-up data obtained at age 2 years indicates that
   feeding formula with reduced protein content normalizes early growth
   relative to a breastfed reference group and the current WHO growth
   standard, which may furnish a significant long-term protection against
   later obesity. We conclude that infant feeding practice has a high
   potential for long-term health effects. The results obtained should
   stimulate the review of recommendations and policies for infant formula

Abstract = {{Plants infested with herbivores release specific volatile compounds that
   are known to recruit natural enemies. The response of natural enemies to
   these volatiles may be either learned or genetically determined. We
   asked whether there is genetic variation in the response of the
   predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis to methyl salicylate (MeSa). MeSa
   is a volatile compound consistently produced by plants being attacked by
   the two-spotted spider mite, the prey of P. persimilis. We predicted
   that predators express genetically determined responses during
   long-distance migration where previously learned associations may have
   less value. Additionally, we asked whether these responses depend on
   odors from uninfested plants as a background to MeSa. To infer a genetic
   basis, we analyzed the variation in response to MeSa among iso-female
   lines of P. persimilis by using choice-tests that involved either (1)
   MeSa presented as a single compound or (2) MeSa with background-odor
   from uninfested lima bean plants. These tests were conducted for starved
   and satiated predators, i.e., two physiological states, one that
   approximates migration and another that mimics local patch exploration.
   We found variation among iso-female lines in the responses to MeSa, thus
   showing genetic variation for this behavior. The variation was more
   pronounced in the starved predators, thus indicating that P. persimilis
   relies on innate preferences when migrating. Background volatiles of
   uninfested plants changed the predators' responses to MeSa in a manner
   that depended on physiological state and iso-female line. Thus, it is
   possible to select for context-dependent behavioral responses of natural
   enemies to plant volatiles.}},

Abstract = {{P>Because the olfactory system plays a major role in food consumption,
   and because `food addiction' and associated morbidities have reached
   epidemic proportions, we tested the hypothesis that dietary energy
   restriction can modify adverse effects of cocaine on behavior and
   olfactory cellular and molecular plasticity. Mice maintained on an
   alternate day fasting (ADF) diet exhibited increased baseline locomotion
   and increased cocaine-sensitized locomotion during cocaine conditioning,
   despite no change in cocaine conditioned place preference, compared with
   mice fed ad libitum. Levels of dopamine and its metabolites in the
   olfactory bulb (OB) were suppressed in mice on the ADF diet compared
   with mice on the control diet, independent of acute or chronic cocaine
   treatment. The expression of several enzymes involved in dopamine
   metabolism including tyrosine hydroxylase, monoamine oxidases A and B,
   and catechol-O-methyltransferase were significantly reduced in OBs of
   mice on the ADF diet. Both acute and chronic administration of cocaine
   suppressed the production of new OB cells, and this effect of cocaine
   was attenuated in mice on the ADF diet. Cocaine administration to mice
   on the control diet resulted in up-regulation of OB genes involved in
   mitochondrial energy metabolism, synaptic plasticity, cellular stress
   responses, and calcium- and cAMP-mediated signaling, whereas multiple
   olfactory receptor genes were down-regulated by cocaine treatment. ADF
   abolished many of the effects of cocaine on OB gene expression. Our
   findings reveal that dietary energy intake modifies the neural
   substrates underlying some of the behavioral and physiological responses
   to repeated cocaine treatment, and also suggest novel roles for the
   olfactory system in addiction. The data further suggest that
   modification of dietary energy intake could provide a novel potential
   approach to addiction treatments.}},

   modern capital-intensive, commercialized agriculture are too risky for
   them as they overwhelmingly belong to the category of small and marginal
   farmers. The various development plans have left a mixed impression on
   the minds of the tribal people. They cannot forget their loss of land,
   their heavy indebtedness, the usury of money-lenders, the daily
   exploitation by contractors, traders, whereby thousands of our tribal
   men and women-folk labour under the system of bonded-labour and a
   curtailment of forest rights and privileges. The development schemes'
   followed by the Government in the form of I.T.D.P, the T.S.P and M.A.D.A
   have failed to augment their income generational capacity on a
   sustainable basis. Consequently, schemes, which are considered as
   success stories by government agencies fail to empower the tribals in a
   real sense, for once the project period is completed, and the technical
   staff cum grass-root workers move out, the apparent statistical
   improvement in the tribals' income-generation abilities rapidly falls,
   and he is back to his old support base of the parasitical money-lender.
   The tribal person has to grapple on a daily basis with a fight for his
   day to day sustenance, and his poverty and lack of know-how of modern
   techniques of production makes him trapped in a perpetual
   subsistence-based economy. They are oriented to tasks, whether it be for
   sustenance or otherwise, which requires group dynamics to succeed, be it
   hunting, food-gathering, folk dancing etc. Thus, tasks requiring
   individual skill, risk, competition, innovation are alien to their
   personality make up. It is high time that development efforts include
   not only elevating the tribal people from their income deficit through
   micro-credit means but the severe deprivation which they suffer on all
   parameters of health and food security is also taken care of. The
   macro-economic policies of the government, however, fail to inspire any
   confidence, since from the late nineties, both long-term loans for
   infrastructural improvement and short-term crop-loans have fallen down
   drastically, and the loans to small and marginal farmers diminished too.
   The tribal youth of today has also become materialistic oriented, and,
   yet, his skill and education levels are not allowing him to access the
   very best in life. His harmony with nature has been disrupted, and he is
   caught between his admiration for the sophistication of urban lifestyle,
   and his rootedness in ancient traditions and practices.}},

Abstract = {{For small tube-building amphipods that live on the algae they consume,
   food and habitat are tightly linked. This study compared two closely
   related amphipods to determine whether the species' algal preferences
   are based on the food value of the algae or on some other aspect of
   their algal habitat. Ampithoe lacertosa and Peramphithoe humeralis are
   both abundant on Shannon Point beach (Anacortes, Washington, USA; 48A
   degrees 30.542' N, 122A degrees 41.070' W) but specialize on different
   algae. In observations and laboratory experiments conducted
   July-September 1997, 2007, and 2008, the two species exhibited markedly
   different choices of food and habitat when offered six common
   macroalgae. Ampithoe lacertosa ate all algae offered, but preferentially
   built tubes on the green alga Ulva lactuca. Survival was relatively low
   among juveniles maintained on single species diets, except when they
   were fed Mazzaella splendens. Conversely, P. humeralis consumed
   primarily the brown kelp Saccharina latissima, Alaria marginata, and
   Desmarestia ligulata and preferred those species for tube building.
   Juvenile P. humeralis could not survive on a diet of U. lactuca or M.
   splendens. While A. lacertosa builds simple, temporary tubes and
   relocates frequently, P. humeralis is a highly thigmotactic species that
   builds long-term, complex tubes on the alga it prefers to eat. Feeding
   and habitat preferences of the two species were not clearly linked to
   nitrogen content of the algae, C:N ratio, or toughness of the algal
   tissue. Instead, preferences of the species may be related to their
   mobility and the permanence of the tubes they build. Ampithoe lacertosa
   and P. humeralis also use different feeding strategies; the former
   appears to mix algae to produce a high-quality diet, while the latter is
   more selective and has a capacity for compensatory feeding. The species
   are abundant on the same protected rocky shores, but specialize on
   different algae for habitat and food. Results suggest that the
   nutritional requirements of these sympatric mesograzers differ
   considerably and even closely related species can exhibit divergent
   behavioral strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation causes negative population trends or even local
   extinction in many species. Understanding the role of fragmentation on
   behavior and space use of animals is an essential part of revealing the
   mechanism behind observed population declines. We studied experimentally
   the effects of small-scale habitat fragmentation on the distribution and
   movement of bank voles (Myodes glareolus) in seminatural enclosures. We
   predicted that besides habitat structure, availability of two resources,
   food for both sexes, and receptive females for males, determine
   individual distribution. We manipulated female density (either 0, 4, or
   12 per enclosure) and followed movements of radio-collared males. We
   also studied the effect of unequal food distribution between the
   fragments on vole distribution. The habitat of 0.25-ha enclosures was
   manipulated by forming either one large, two medium-sized, or four small
   habitat patches surrounded by an inhospitable matrix. Female density and
   distribution clearly affected male spacing behavior. Males had larger
   home ranges in the medium female density enclosures. Furthermore, the
   use of the inhospitable and risky matrix area increased with habitat
   fragmentation. Food supplementation improved individual condition
   measured as body mass but did not affect breeding success. Our
   experiments demonstrated that both small-scale habitat fragmentation and
   resource distribution affect the behavior and condition of individuals.
   Increased fragmentation led to increased risk taking in both mating and
   foraging behavior. This should have direct survival and fitness
   consequences, and therefore our results may be extrapolated to
   population-level consequences of habitat fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Adverse prenatal environment, such as intrauterine growth retardation
   (IUGR), increases the risk for negative neurobehavioral outcomes. IUGR,
   affecting approximately 10\% of all US infants, is a known risk factor
   for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia
   spectrum disorders and addiction. Mouse dams were fed a protein
   deficient (8.5\% protein) or isocaloric control (18\% protein) diet
   through pregnancy and lactation (a well validated rodent model of IUGR).
   Dopamine-related gene expression, dopamine content and behavior were
   examined in adult offspring. IUGR offspring have six to eightfold
   over-expression of dopamine (DA)-related genes (tyrosine hydroxylase
   (TH) and dopamine transporter) in brain regions related to reward
   processing (ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens, prefrontal
   cortex (PFC)) and homeostatic control (hypothalamus), as well as
   increased number of TH-ir neurons in the VTA and increased dopamine in
   the PFC. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (Cdkn1c) is critical for
   dopaminergic neuron development. Methylation of the promoter region of
   Cdkn1c was decreased by half and there was a resultant two to sevenfold
   increase in Cdkn1c mRNA expression across brain regions. IUGR animals

   altered reward-processing, hyperactivity and exaggerated locomotor
   response to cocaine. These data describe significant dopamine-related

Title = {{Evolution of embryonic developmental period in the marine bird families
   Alcidae and Spheniscidae: roles for nutrition and predation?}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUN 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Nutrition and predation have been considered two primary
   agents of selection important in the evolution of avian life history
   traits. The relative importance of these natural selective forces in the
   evolution of avian embryonic developmental period (EDP) remain poorly
   resolved, perhaps in part because research has tended to focus on a
   single, high taxonomic-level group of birds: Order Passeriformes. The
   marine bird families Alcidae (auks) and Spheniscidae (penguins) exhibit
   marked variation in EDP, as well as behavioural and ecological traits
   ultimately linked to EDP. Therefore, auks and penguins provide a unique
   opportunity to assess the natural selective basis of variation in a key
   life-history trait at a low taxonomic-level. We used phylogenetic
   comparative methods to investigate the relative importance of
   behavioural and ecological factors related to nutrition and predation in
   the evolution of avian EDP.
   Results: Three behavioural and ecological variables related to nutrition
   and predation risk (i.e., clutch size, activity pattern, and nesting
   habits) were significant predictors of residual variation in auk and
   penguin EDP based on models predicting EDP from egg mass. Species with
   larger clutch sizes, diurnal activity patterns, and open nests had
   significantly shorter EDPs. Further, EDP was found to be longer among
   birds which forage in distant offshore waters, relative to those that
   foraged in near shore waters, in line with our predictions, but not
   significantly so.
   Conclusion: Current debate has emphasized predation as the primary agent
   of selection driving avian life history diversification. Our results
   suggest that both nutrition and predation have been important selective
   forces in the evolution of auk and penguin EDP, and highlight the
   importance of considering these questions at lower taxonomic scales. We
   suggest that further comparative studies on lower taxonomic-level groups
   will continue to constructively inform the debate on evolutionary
   determinants of avian EDP, as well as other life history parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Developmental plasticity can be integral in adapting organisms to the
   environment experienced during growth. Adaptive plastic responses may be
   especially important in prioritizing development in response to stress
   during ontogeny. To evaluate this, I examined how developmental
   conditions for mourning doves related to early growth and how this
   affected fledging age, an important life-history transition for birds.
   The life history of mourning doves is consistent with strong selective
   pressure to minimize fledging age. Therefore, I predicted that in the
   face of nutritional stress associated with experimental brood-size
   increases, young would prioritize growth to structures that promote
   early fledging to reduce the effect of slowed overall growth on fledging
   age. Increasing brood size slowed overall structural growth of nestlings
   and affected the relative allocation of growth among different body
   parts. Total wing area was the best predictor of fledging age and
   individuals from larger broods had larger wings relative to overall body
   size. Although nestlings from larger broods fledged at later ages owing
   to slower overall growth, prioritization of wing growth reduced this
   effect by an estimated 1.6 days relative to the delay if plasticity
   among body parts had not occurred. This was an 11 per cent reduction in
   the predicted developmental time it took to reach this important
   life-history transition. Results demonstrate that preferential
   allocation to wing growth can affect the timing of this life-history
   transition and that morphological plasticity during development can have
   adaptive near-term effects during avian development.}},

Abstract = {{Specialized predators must obtain all required nutrients from a single
   prey species. In some species nutrient balance may be possible by
   selecting various body parts. We tested how different ant body parts
   affect the fitness of a specialized ant predator and whether the
   predator possesses adaptations in its feeding behaviour that allow
   nutrient balancing while feeding on only a single prey species. We used
   a formicine-specialist spider, Zodarion rubidum, reared on three diet
   types: an entire ant, two ant gasters and two ant foreparts ( heads,
   thoraces and legs) of Lasius ants. Spiders grew faster, survived longer
   and developed earlier on the diet consisting of two ant foreparts.
   Spiders fed on the two ant gasters had the slowest growth, highest
   mortality and slowest development while spiders fed entire ants showed
   intermediate performance. In preference experiments, we studied the
   spiders' consumption of three Formicinae ant species that differ
   markedly in size. With small Lasius ants, spiders equally exploited the
   gaster and the foreparts, but with larger Formica and Camponotus ants,
   spiders fed significantly more on the foreparts than on the gaster.
   Spiders almost always fed on the gaster, suggesting that it might
   include beneficial nutrients. Nutritional analysis of the ant bodies of
   the three species revealed that there were more lipids in the gaster,
   while the foreparts contained more proteins. Our results suggest that
   ant-eating spiders might balance their nutritional needs by selectively
   consuming various body parts of their exclusive prey. (C) 2010 The

Abstract = {{Climate change and habitat destruction are widely recognized as major
   threats to species' survival. As a result of these anthropogenic
   impacts, species are often forced into novel landscapes where their
   persistence is difficult to predict. Knowledge of how individuals move
   or disperse through the landscape, choose habitat in which to settle,
   and produce offspring which survive to repeat the process can greatly
   improve our ability to predict species' persistence. The field of
   behavioral landscape ecology uses a strong theoretical base to explore,
   often experimentally, how the behavior of a particular species is
   affected by heterogeneous and rapidly changing landscapes and can offer
   valuable insight for managing species in the face of human-induced
   environmental changes. When interpreted by modelers, results of
   landscape-level behavioral experiments can be quantified for use in
   predictive models. To this end, we summarize the methods and results of
   research using direct experimental manipulation techniques broken into
   the following categories: translocations, playback experiments, food
   resource manipulations, manipulations of reproductive success, direct
   manipulations of the landscape, and manipulations of predation risk. We
   review and place in a theoretical framework the results from this
   emerging body of research regarding how organisms move in and respond to
   different types of landscapes, both natural and human-altered. We go
   onto highlight the potential of each experimental method to quantify
   different processes, which may be useful when interpreted by modelers
   attempting to parameterize predictive models. Finally, we suggest future
   directions for experimental research that will allow for greater
   integration of behavioral landscape ecology and predictive modeling. (C)

Abstract = {{Background \& aims: To consider the hypothesis that addiction to food,
   or more specifically sucrose, plays a role in obesity and eating
   disorders.
   Methods: By considering the relevant literature a series of predictions
   were examined, derived from the hypothesis that addiction to sucrose
   consumption can develop. Fasting should increase food cravings,
   predominantly for sweet items; cravings should occur after an overnight
   fast; the obese should find sweetness particularly attractive; a
   high-sugar consumption should predispose to obesity. More specifically
   predictions based on the hypothesis that addiction to sugar is central
   to bingeing disorders were developed. Dieting should predate the
   development of bingeing; dietary style rather than psychological, social
   and economic factors should be predispose to eating disorders; sweet
   items should be preferentially consumed while bingeing; opioid
   antagonists should cause withdrawal symptoms; bingeing should develop at
   a younger age when there is a greater preference for sweetness.
   Results: The above predications have in common that on no occasion was
   the behaviour predicted by an animal model of sucrose addiction

Abstract = {{Background The prevalence of chronic sleep deprivation is increasing in
   modern societies with negative health consequences. Recently, an
   association between short sleep and obesity has been reported.
   Purpose Primary objectives: To assess the feasibility of increasing
   sleep duration to a healthy length (approximately 7A1/2 h) and to
   determine the effect of sleep extension on body weight. Secondary
   objectives: To examine the long-term effects of sleep extension on
   endocrine (leptin and ghrelin) and immune (cytokines) parameters, the
   prevalence of metabolic syndrome, body composition, psychomotor
   vigilance, mood, and quality of life.
   Methods One hundred-fifty obese participants who usually sleep less than
   6A1/2 h, are being randomized at a 2:1 ratio to either an Intervention
   or to a Comparison Group. They are stratified by age (above and below
   35) and the presence or absence of metabolic syndrome. During the first
   12 months (Efficacy Phase) of the study, participants are evaluated at
   bi-monthly intervals: the Intervention Group is coached to increase
   sleep by at least 30-60 min/night, while the Comparison Group maintains
   baseline sleep duration. In the second (Effectiveness) phase,
   participants converge into the same group and are asked to increase
   (Comparison Group) or maintain (Intervention Group) sleep duration and
   are evaluated at 6-month intervals for an additional 3 years.
   Non-pharmacological and behavior-based interventions are being utilized
   to increase sleep duration. Endocrine, metabolic, and psychological
   effects are monitored. The sleep, energy expenditure, and caloric intake
   are assessed by activity monitors and food recall questionnaires. At
   yearly intervals, body composition, abdominal fat, and basal metabolic
   rate are measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA),
   computerized tomography (CT), and indirect calorimetry, respectively.
   Results As of January 2010, 109 participants had been randomized, 64 to
   the Intervention Group and 45 to the Comparison Group (76\% women, 62\%
   minorities, average age: 40.8 years; BMI: 38.5 kg/m(2)). Average sleep
   duration at screening was less than 6 h/night, 40.3 h/week. A total of
   28 Intervention and 22 Comparison participants had completed the
   Efficacy Phase.
   Limitations The study is not blinded and the sample size is relatively
   small.
   Conclusions This proof-of-concept study on a randomized sample will
   assess whether sleep extension is feasible and whether it influences
   BMI. Clinical Trials 2010; 7: 274-285. http://ctj.sagepub.com.}},

Abstract = {{The existence of a relationship between cortisol levels, after an acute
   stress, and behavioral activities, immunological profile, and production
   performance in sheep was studied. An initial flock of 30 Comisana ewes
   was involved in the experiment, and each of the 30 ewes was individually
   subjected to an isolation test in a novel environment. Subsequently,
   from the initial flock, 2 groups of 8 Comisana ewes were each
   retrospectively selected, and the animals were divided, according to
   their cortisol concentration 10 min after the isolation test, into high
   cortisol (HC) ewes, having a peak of cortisol concentration > 90 ng/mL
   (average: 119.3 ng/mL +/- 11.8), and low cortisol (LC) ewes having a
   peak of cortisol concentration < 80 ng/mL (average: 52.4 +/- 11.8).
   During the isolation test, the behavior of each animal was
   video-recorded and behavioral activities were registered. Blood samples
   were collected before the isolation test, immediately after the test (10
   min), and at 60, 120, 300 min, 24 h, and 48 h after the test to evaluate
   percentages of T-helper (CD4(+)) and T-cytotoxic (CD8(+)) cells,
   CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio, and IL-1 beta and IL-6 levels. The ewes were milked
   for 3 d after the isolation test to determine cortisol levels and IL-1
   beta and IL-6 concentrations in whey. Milk yield was recorded at each
   milking, and milk samples were analyzed for pH, nutritional parameters,
   renneting properties, and somatic cell count. During the isolation test,
   HC ewes exhibited a shorter duration of movement and fewer bleats than
   LC ewes. The average plasma IL-1 beta concentration was higher in HC
   than in LC ewes. The average whey IL-1 beta and IL-6 concentrations were
   higher in whey from HC ewes than in LC ewes. A positive correlation
   emerged between plasma and whey IL-1 beta concentrations. The average
   CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio in blood was lower in HC than in LC ewes. Time from
   isolation affected the CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio: at 120 min, the
   CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio increased compared with that at 10 min after
   isolation and then decreased until 300 min after isolation. On average,
   ewes with low cortisol concentrations showed higher milk production and
   lower SCC than ewes with high cortisol concentrations. Results suggest
   that plasma cortisol concentration is connected to the behavioral
   response and immune competence of dairy ewes and cytokine
   concentrations. Both whey IL-1 beta and IL-6 can be considered reliable
   indicators of the magnitude of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
   activation. The stress-induced changes in CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio are
   critical for controlling disease incidence and planning appropriate
   vaccination programs. High reactivity of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is also associated with a reduction
   in milk production and an increased predisposition to develop
   intramammary inflammatory processes.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the long-term
   effects of participation in a cardiovascular screening program and of
   dietary counseling on self-reported psychosocial outcomes and health
   concerns. Methods: High-risk subjects (n=563) with hyperlipidemia from
   the Oslo Diet and Antismoking Study (1972-1977) were reexamined after 25
   years and randomly assigned to a new 3-year prospective 2x2 factorial
   placebo-controlled study in 1997 of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
   and/or dietary counseling. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),
   Life Satisfaction Index (LSI), and a new questionnaire on health
   concerns and behavior in response to risk information were collected at
   the 25-year follow-up. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and LSI
   were evaluated at the end of the 3-year Diet and Omega-3 Intervention
   Trial on atherosclerosis (DOIT) in 505 subjects. Results: Twenty-five
   years after the screening program, HADS-anxiety was similar to the
   Norwegian norms (3.3 vs. 3.5), while HADS-depression was significantly
   lower (3.6 vs. 4.1, P<.01). Patients reported that 25 years of awareness
   of hyperlipidemia had influenced health concerns through a moderate
   change in diet habits, some restriction in life conduct, but an
   improvement of the total life situation. After a novel 3-year
   intervention in DOIT, there was no difference between the dietary
   counseling and control group with regard to anxiety, depression, or life
   satisfaction, but HADS-anxiety increased significantly (4.0 vs. 3.3,
   P<.001) in both groups. Conclusion: Compared to the general population,
   screening-positive subjects did not have increased mental distress 25
   years after screening, and beneficial health behavior persisted. Dietary
   counseling did not affect psychosocial outcomes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{We explored the response to habitat desiccation in tadpoles of the warty
   toad Rhinella spinulosa in a manipulative field experiment. We built an
   artificial pond system with two desiccation levels (high and low) and
   populated with tadpoles at Gosner stage 25. Each treatment was
   replicated six times. We measured the survival, size and age at
   metamorphosis, development rate and hind limb length in metamorphs. The
   results showed that tadpoles from the high desiccation ponds accelerated
   their development, reaching metamorphosis at an earlier age than
   tadpoles from the low desiccation ponds. Survival, size at metamorphosis
   and hind limb length were not different between treatments. This
   experiment demonstrated that tadpoles of R. spinulosa accelerate their
   development in response to habitat desiccation. Such plasticity may
   allow them to avoid mortality in short duration ponds. No evidence for a
   trade-off between development time and size at metamorphosis was found
   in this experiment. We suggest that factors such as initial tadpole
   density and nutritional quality of food would contribute towards
   determining whether metamorphosis occurs at the developmental threshold

Abstract = {{Background: Because parental recognition of overweight in young children
   is poor, we need to determine how best to inform parents that their
   child is overweight in a way that enhances their acceptance and supports
   motivation for positive change. This study will assess 1) whether weight
   feedback delivered using motivational interviewing increases parental
   acceptance of their child's weight status and enhances motivation for
   behaviour change, and 2) whether a family-based individualised lifestyle
   intervention, delivered primarily by a MInT mentor with limited support
   from ``expert{''} consultants in psychology, nutrition and physical
   activity, can improve weight outcomes after 12 and 24 months in young
   overweight children, compared with usual care.
   Methods/Design: 1500 children aged 4-8 years will be screened for
   overweight (height, weight, waist, blood pressure, body composition).
   Parents will complete questionnaires on feeding practices, physical
   activity, diet, parenting, motivation for healthy lifestyles, and
   demographics. Parents of children classified as overweight (BMI >= CDC
   85(th)) will receive feedback about the results using Motivational
   interviewing or Usual care. Parental responses to feedback will be
   assessed two weeks later and participants will be invited into the
   intervention. Additional baseline measurements (accelerometry, diet,
   quality of life, child behaviour) will be collected and families will be
   randomised to Tailored package or Usual care. Parents in the Usual care
   condition will meet once with an advisor who will offer general advice
   regarding healthy eating and activity. Parents in the Tailored package
   condition will attend a single session with an ``expert team{''} (MInT
   mentor, dietitian, physical activity advisor, clinical psychologist) to
   identify current challenges for the family, develop tailored goals for
   change, and plan behavioural strategies that best suit each family. The
   mentor will continue to provide support to the family via telephone and
   in-person consultations, decreasing in frequency over the two-year
   intervention. Outcome measures will be obtained at baseline, 12 and 24
   months.
   Discussion: This trial offers a unique opportunity to identify effective
   ways of providing feedback to parents about their child's weight status

Volume = {{213}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1691-1696}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Parental behavior contributes to the success of a diverse array of taxa,
   and female-only nest attendance is particularly widespread. Python
   egg-brooding behavior is an intriguing example of female-only nest
   attendance because it significantly influences several critical
   developmental variables, namely embryonic predation, hydration,
   respiration and temperature. During brooding, females predominately
   adopt a tightly coiled posture that reduces the exchange of heat, water
   vapor, O(2) and CO(2) between the nest and clutch environment, which
   benefits egg water balance at the cost of respiration. To determine the
   plasticity of this important behavior, we manipulated nest temperature
   and humidity while monitoring nest-clutch thermal, hydric and
   respiratory relationships to test the hypothesis that female Children's
   pythons (Antaresia childreni) modify their egg-brooding behavior due to
   an interaction between environmental thermal and hydric conditions.
   During moderate and high nest humidity treatments (23 and 32gm(-3)
   H(2)O, respectively), females spent more time coiling tightly when the
   nest was cooling than when it was warming, which benefited clutch
   temperature. However, brooding females in low-humidity nest environments
   (13 g m(-3) H(2)O) showed a high frequency of tight coiling even when
   the nest was warming; thus, nest temperature and humidity had an
   interactive effect on egg-brooding behavior in support of our
   hypothesis. Our results also suggest that certain egg-brooding behaviors
   (i.e. postural adjustments) are more energetically costly to females
   than other behaviors (i. e. tight coiling). In sum, we provide empirical
   support for the adaptive plasticity of python egg-brooding behavior,
   which offers insight into the general significance of female-only nest
   attendance in animals.}},

Title = {{Systems genetics analysis of body weight and energy metabolism traits in

Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{MAY 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Obesity and phenotypic traits associated with this condition
   exhibit significant heritability in natural populations of most
   organisms. While a number of genes and genetic pathways have been
   implicated to play a role in obesity associated traits, the genetic
   architecture that underlies the natural variation in these traits is
   largely unknown. Here, we used 40 wild-derived inbred lines of
   Drosophila melanogaster to quantify genetic variation in body weight,
   the content of three major metabolites (glycogen, triacylglycerol, and
   glycerol) associated with obesity, and metabolic rate in young flies. We
   chose these lines because they were previously screened for variation in
   whole-genome transcript abundance and in several adult life-history
   traits, including longevity, resistance to starvation stress, chill-coma
   recovery, mating behavior, and competitive fitness. This enabled us not
   only to identify candidate genes and transcriptional networks that might
   explain variation for energy metabolism traits, but also to investigate
   the genetic interrelationships among energy metabolism, behavioral, and
   life-history traits that have evolved in natural populations.
   Results: We found significant genetically based variation in all traits.
   Using a genome-wide association screen for single feature polymorphisms
   and quantitative trait transcripts, we identified 337, 211, 237, 553,
   and 152 novel candidate genes associated with body weight, glycogen
   content, triacylglycerol storage, glycerol levels, and metabolic rate,
   respectively. Weighted gene co-expression analyses grouped transcripts
   associated with each trait in significant modules of co-expressed genes
   and we interpreted these modules in terms of their gene enrichment based
   on Gene Ontology analysis. Comparison of gene co-expression modules for
   traits in this study with previously determined modules for life-history
   traits identified significant modular pleiotropy between glycogen
   content, body weight, competitive fitness, and starvation resistance.
   Conclusions: Combining a large phenotypic dataset with information on
   variation in genome wide transcriptional profiles has provided insight
   into the complex genetic architecture underlying natural variation in
   traits that have been associated with obesity. Our findings suggest that
   understanding the maintenance of genetic variation in metabolic traits
   in natural populations may require that we understand more fully the
   degree to which these traits are genetically correlated with other
   traits, especially those directly affecting fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Feather pecking (FP) is a major welfare problem in laying hens,
   influenced by multiple factors. FP is thought to be redirected foraging
   behaviour, however fearful birds are also known to be more sensitive to
   develop FP. The relationship between fear-responses, foraging and FP is
   not well understood, therefore we studied the behaviour of 16 birds from
   a high feather pecking (HFP) line and 16 birds from a low feather
   pecking (LFP) line at 35 weeks of age inside a plus-maze. Birds were
   from the 10th generation of selection for either high or low FP. First
   exposure to the maze was used to measure birds' fear-responses to a
   novel barren environment. Hereafter, birds were trained three times in
   the maze with four different food-items that were offered in one of the
   four arms (i.e. regular food-pellets, feathers, grass, and mealworms
   hidden in wood-shavings). On the fifth day, birds were tested in the
   maze for 10 min during which they could choose to eat from all available
   food-items. When exposed for the first time in the maze HFP birds walked
   a longer distance, vocalized sooner and had more exploratory pecks
   compared to LFP birds who showed more wing-movements and defecations.
   When given a choice of food inside the maze both lines preferred eating
   worms, but HFP birds had more worm-eating bouts and ate faster than LFP
   birds. The results of this study indicate that HFP birds respond
   actively to fear-eliciting situations, which may originate from a
   proactive coping style. Instead of a clear preference for eating
   feathers, this study supports earlier findings that HFP birds have a
   stronger pecking motivation than LFP birds. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Environmental effects on sets of traits of organisms can have important
   consequences on populations. In marine species with complex life cycles,
   plastic responses in larval traits can affect size at metamorphosis and
   juvenile growth. These traits can ultimately affect survival and
   recruitment. Here, I evaluate. links between pelagic conditions, natural
   variations in larval physiological traits (duration of development, size
   of the megalopa stage), size at metamorphosis, and juvenile growth in
   the shore crab Carcinus mamas. I sampled settling larvae. (megalopae) of
   C. maenas, daily, during the settlement season of three consecutive
   years, in the island of Helgoland (North Sea, German Bight). Megalopae
   were brought to the laboratory where postmetamorphic growth was
   evaluated under different larval food environments. Traits varied
   considerably at several temporal scales; variation was not consistent
   among years. However, the size at metamorphosis was always larger at the
   start of the settlement season. Some variability correlated with
   predicted changes in transport processes and dynamics of plume fronts
   around the study area. Positive relationships between predicted periods
   of formation of plume fronts, settlement rates, and size at
   metamorphosis suggest a link between oceanographic conditions and
   individual traits. Size at metamorphosis explained juvenile growth
   rates: during the first five juvenile stages, larger individuals grew
   faster and reached larger size at stage (that is, at any stage
   observed). Megalopae experiencing ad libitum food conditions grew faster
   as juveniles than those deprived of food, showing that size at
   metamorphosis and juvenile growth respond plastically to variations in
   the larval food environment. I conclude that juvenile growth rate in C.
   maenas can be affected by natural environmental conditions experienced
   by larval stages; this effect is mediated by changes in the. size at
   metamorphosis. Most likely the most important factor operating on the
   size at metamorphosis was food (availability/quality). Since juveniles
   of this species attain a refuge in size from cannibals, changes in size
   at metamorphosis could codetermine the chances of postsettlement
   survival. Further consideration of physiological traits and their
   consequences at the level of populations should lead to a better
   understanding of how pre- and postmetamorphic processes interact and
   explain variability in recruitment in species with complex life cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Individual common carp Cyprinus carpio were screened repeatedly for risk

   evident, and significant consistency in individual responses across

   addition, there was a significant positive relationship between
   individual performance in these two contexts, with fish that explored
   more quickly in the novel environment tending to be among the first to
   gain access to restricted food. In two follow-up studies, resting

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Females often show a preference for exaggerated male sexual traits or
   courtship behaviors. Such preferences can benefit females if trait
   expression is correlated with male genetic quality or phenotypic
   condition. Previous studies of several Photinus fireflies have revealed
   considerable intraspecific variation in the bioluminescent courtship
   signals emitted by males, and have also demonstrated that females prefer
   more conspicuous male signals. Thus, females might gain information
   about male phenotypic quality if courtship signals reflect male
   condition. We examined possible condition-dependence of Photinus male
   courtship signals using two complementary approaches. First we
   experimentally manipulated male mating status, which is expected to
   affect male condition by depleting resources required for nuptial gift
   formation, and looked at how individual male flash signals changed with
   mating status and over time. We used an additional approach to assess
   condition-dependence by examining whether a relationship exists between
   flash signal parameters and measures of male condition and body shape.
   We found that the pulse rate of P. greeni courtship signals was not
   altered by male mating status or age, and that the pulse duration of P.
   ignitus signals was also not affected by male mating status. In P.
   pyralis fireflies, males showed a non-significant trend toward reduced
   signal pulse duration with age. When we examined the relationship
   between male flash signals and condition measures, we found no effect of
   male condition or body shape on courtship signals in P. greeni or P.
   ignitus; in P. pyralis, males with wider body shapes produced longer
   duration flash signals. On the other hand, we found no evidence in P.
   pyralis that condition predicted flash duration. Taken together, these
   results indicate that Photinus males' flash signals do not reflect adult
   male condition, and suggest that females are unlikely to use courtship
   signals as an indicator of male phenotypic quality.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Normal aging leads to an inexorable decline in motor performance,
   contributing to medical morbidity and decreased quality of life. While
   much has been discovered about genetic determinants of lifespan, less is
   known about modifiers of age-related behavioral decline and whether new
   gene targets may be found which extend vigorous activity, with or
   without extending lifespan. Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we have
   developed a model of declining neuromuscular function and conducted a
   screen for increased behavioral activity in aged animals. In this model,
   behavioral function suffers from profound reductions in locomotory
   frequency, but coordination is strikingly preserved until very old age.
   By screening for enhancers of locomotion at advanced ages we identified
   the ras-related Rag GTPase raga-1 as a novel modifier of behavioral
   aging. raga-1 loss of function mutants showed vigorous swimming late in
   life. Genetic manipulations revealed that a gain of function raga-1
   curtailed behavioral vitality and shortened lifespan, while a dominant
   negative raga-1 lengthened lifespan. Dietary restriction results
   indicated that a raga-1 mutant is relatively protected from the
   life-shortening effects of highly concentrated food, while RNAi
   experiments suggested that raga-1 acts in the highly conserved target of
   rapamycin (TOR) pathway in C. elegans. Rag GTPases were recently shown
   to mediate nutrient-dependent activation of TOR. This is the first
   demonstration of their dramatic effects on behavior and aging. This work
   indicates that novel modulators of behavioral function can be identified
   in screens, with implications for future study of the clinical
   amelioration of age-related decline.}},

   Methodology: We applied four methods: (1) an e-mail survey sent to 30
   researchers with experience in triatomines, (2) a statistical
   description of the developmental time of eleven triatomine species, (3)
   a relationship between development time pattern and climatic
   inter-annual variability, (4) a mathematical optimization model of
   evolution of developmental delay (diapause).
   Principal Findings: 85.6\% of responses informed on prolonged
   developmental times in 5(th) instar nymphs, with 20 species identified
   with remarkable developmental delays. The developmental time analysis
   showed some degree of bi-modal pattern of the development time of the
   5(th) instars in nine out of eleven species but no trend between
   development time pattern and climatic inter-annual variability was
   observed. Our optimization model predicts that the developmental delays
   could be due to an adaptive risk-spreading diapause strategy, only if
   survival throughout the diapause period and the probability of random
   occurrence of ``bad'' environmental conditions are sufficiently high.
   Conclusions/Significance: Developmental delay may not be a simple
   non-adaptive phenotypic plasticity in development time, and could be a
   form of adaptive diapause associated to a physiological mechanism
   related to the postponement of the initiation of reproduction, as an
   adaptation to environmental stochasticity through a spreading of risk
   (bet-hedging) strategy. We identify a series of parameters that can be
   measured in the field and laboratory to test this hypothesis. The
   importance of these findings is discussed in terms of global climatic
   change and epidemiological consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Current knowledge suggests that patterns of energy storage and depletion
   in animals are governed by behavioural trade-offs between risks
   associated with feeding and future energy demands. However, the length
   of adverse periods varies over geographical or climatic gradients. To
   explore the potential for genotypic sources of variation in behavioural
   trade-offs, we compared the winter energy-depletion patterns among 13
   wild populations of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) along a
   latitudinal gradient (58-70 degrees N) and performed common-environment
   experiments of energy-state-dependent feeding. In the wild, winter
   lipid-depletion rates were lower for northern than for southern
   populations. The variation in spring lipid levels among the population
   was lower than autumn variation, with storage lipid levels clustered
   close to critical limits for survival. In semi-natural stream channels
   with natural food supply, hatchery-reared fish originating from northern
   populations showed a positive scaling of feeding activity with
   decreasing energy levels, whereas southern populations did not. In
   conclusion, juvenile Atlantic salmon from northern populations defend
   their energy levels more strongly than fish from southern populations.
   Adaptive variation in feeding activity appears important for this
   difference. Thus, the present study shows a link between geographical
   patterns in storage energy trajectories and adaptive differences in
   state-dependent feeding motivation.}},

Abstract = {{Positive assortative mating is a widespread phenomenon in the animal
   kingdom. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this
   reproductive pattern in natural populations, but growing evidence
   suggests that assortative mating most often results from sexual mating
   preferences. Recently, condition-dependent mate choice in the face of
   costly competition for mates has been proposed to explain assortative
   mating in natural populations. Variation in competitive ability may
   generate variation in both the strength and the direction of mate
   preference, resulting in assortative mating with respect to individual
   quality if low-quality competitors are less choosy, or if high-quality
   males and females pair up first, leaving low-quality individuals to form
   pairs between themselves. We investigated individuals' preferences for
   mates on the basis of differential competitive abilities and
   size-dependent costs in mate-guarding behaviour in the amphipod Gammarus
   pulex. Our results show that the presence of an unpaired male close to a
   pair can induce stress that can lead to pair separation. However, no
   direct take-over was observed. In our series of male mate choice
   experiments, under low, high or simulated levels of competition, small
   males made similar choices. Our results suggest that the frequency of
   take-overs, and more generally interference competition, can be
   considered insufficient to induce a reduced preference for large females
   in this population, and is thus unlikely to explain size-assortative
   mating. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Shelter competition is uncommon among social animals, as is the case
   among normally gregarious Caribbean spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus).
   However, healthy lobsters avoid sheltering with conspecifics infected by
   a lethal pathogenic virus, PaV1. These contradictory behaviors have
   implications for shelter use and survival, especially in areas where
   shelter is limited. In laboratory experiments, we tested shelter
   competition between paired healthy and diseased juvenile lobsters in
   shelter-limited mesocosms. Neither healthy nor diseased lobsters
   dominated access to shelters, but lobsters shared shelter less often
   when diseased lobsters were present relative to controls with two
   healthy lobsters. We hypothesized that exclusion of juvenile lobsters
   from shelter results in increased mortality from predation, especially
   for the more lethargic, infected individuals. Field tethering trials
   revealed that predation was indeed higher on infected individuals and on
   all tethered lobsters deprived of shelter. We then tested in mesocosm
   experiments how the contrasting risks of predation versus infection by a
   lethal pathogen influence shelter use. Lobsters were offered a choice of
   an empty shelter or one containing a diseased lobster in the presence of
   a predator (i.e., caged octopus) whose presence normally elicits
   shelter-seeking behavior, and these data were compared with a previous
   study where the predator was absent. Lobsters selected the empty shelter
   significantly more often despite the threat of predation, foregoing the
   protection of group defense in favor of reduced infection risk. These
   results offer striking evidence of how pathogenic diseases shape not
   only the behavior of social animals but also their use of shelters and
   risk of predation.}},

Journal = {{GASTROENTEROLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1514-1524}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND \& AIMS: In human beings, as in most vertebrates, the release
   of the intestinal peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) by ingested food plays a
   major role both in digestion and the regulation of further food intake,
   but the changes in brain function and their underlying activation
   mechanisms remain unknown. Our aim was to explore, using a novel
   physiologic magnetic resonance imaging approach, the temporospatial
   brain activation matrix, in response to ingestion of a lipid meal and,
   by use of a CCK-1 receptor antagonist, to define the role of CCK in this
   activation. METHODS: We studied, in 19 healthy subjects, the brain
   activation responses to ingested lipid (dodecanoic acid) or saline
   (control) with magnetic resonance imaging. Gallbladder volume, plasma
   CCK levels, and subjective hunger and fullness scores were also
   recorded. The experiment was then repeated, with and without prior
   administration of the CCK-1 receptor antagonist dexloxiglumide (600 mg
   orally) with a controlled, randomized order, latin-square design.
   RESULTS: Ingested lipid activated bilaterally a matrix of brain areas,
   particularly the brain stem, pons, hypothalamus, and also cerebellum and
   motor cortical areas. These activations were abolished by
   dexloxiglumide, indicating a CCK-mediated pathway, independent of any
   nutrient-associated awareness cues. CONCLUSION: The identification of
   these activations now defines the lipid-activated brain matrix and
   provides a means by which the gut-derived homeostatic mechanisms of food
   regulation can be distinguished from secondary sensory and hedonic cues,
   thereby providing a new approach to exploring aberrant human
   gastrointestinal responses and eating behavior.}},

Title = {{Individual responses of seabirds to commercial fisheries revealed using

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{487-497}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{P>1. The large amount of discards produced by commercial fisheries can
   have major impacts on marine predator populations: this abundant food
   may increase populations of some scavengers or decrease others via
   accidental bycatch. Yet, despite the conservation implications of
   discard practices, the ecology of individual scavengers is poorly
   understood.
   2. Here, we assess the influence of commercial fisheries' activity on
   the foraging behaviour of individual breeding northern gannets Morus
   bassanus. Using recent developments in stable isotope mixing models
   (Stable Isotope Analysis in R or SIAR) we estimate individual discard
   consumption. Using GPS tracking and the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS),
   we investigate behavioural responses to trawlers.
   3. Analysis of conventional diet samples, as well as stable isotope
   ratios of carbon and nitrogen in blood (plasma and cells), highlight
   marked individual differences in the proportion of fishery discards in
   the diet. Individual differences in foraging behaviour revealed by
   stable isotopes show evidence of both short-term consistency and
   behavioural flexibility.
   4. At-sea path tortuosity of 25 gannets (tracked using GPS loggers)
   revealed scale-dependent adjustments in response to VMS-derived fishing
   vessel locations, as well as to sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a
   concentration and copepod abundance. The results also indicate
   individual variability in behavioural response to trawlers.
   5. Individual differences in the amount of discards estimated from SIAR
   were negatively correlated with differences in foraging trip length and
   body condition, indicating potential fitness consequences.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The management of commercial fisheries
   and apex predators is a daunting task. Ultimately, reducing bycatch and
   removing dependency on discards remain key conservation priorities, but
   managers should also ensure that scavenging species have sufficient
   alternative food to meet their energetic needs, to ameliorate potential
   unforeseen knock-on consequences. The results of Stable Isotope Analysis
   (SIAR) reveal intra-population differences in discard consumption by
   gannets; differences that have impacts on foraging effort and body
   condition. The use of GPS tracking and Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS)
   reveal that gannet at-sea behaviour is influenced by fishing vessels,
   although this also varies among individuals. A combination of SIAR, GPS
   tracking and VMS can be used to study fishery/scavenger interactions in
   detail at the individual level, to answer fundamental questions about
   scavenging behaviour.}},

Journal = {{PLOS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{For nearly all life forms, perceptual systems provide access to a host
   of environmental cues, including the availability of food and mates as
   well as the presence of disease and predators. Presumably, individuals
   use this information to assess the current and future states of the
   environment and to enact appropriate developmental, behavioral, and
   regulatory decisions. Recent work using the nematode worm,
   Caenorhabditis elegans, and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has
   established that aging is subject to modulation through neurosensory
   systems and that this regulation is evolutionarily conserved. To date,
   sensory manipulations shown to impact Drosophila aging have involved
   general loss of function or manipulation of complex stimuli. We
   therefore know little about the specific inputs, sensors, or associated
   neural circuits that affect these life and death decisions. We find that
   a specialized population of olfactory neurons that express receptor
   Gr63a (a component of the olfactory receptor for gaseous phase CO(2))
   affects fly lifespan and physiology. Gr63a loss of function leads to
   extended lifespan, increased fat deposition, and enhanced resistance to
   some ( but not all) environmental stresses. Furthermore, we find that
   the reduced lifespan that accompanies exposure to odors from live yeast
   is dependent on Gr63a. Together these data implicate a specific sensory
   cue (CO(2)) and its associated receptor as having the ability to
   modulate fly lifespan and alter organism stress response and physiology.
   Because Gr63a is expressed in a well-defined population of neurons,
   future work may now be directed at dissecting more complex neurosensory
   and neuroendocrine circuits that modulate aging in Drosophila.}},

Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{623-636}},

Abstract = {{The neurobiology of borderline personality disorder (BPD) remains
   unclear. Dysfunctions of several neurobiological systems, including
   serotoninergic, dopaminergic, and other neurotransmitter systems, have
   been discussed. Here we present a theory that alterations in the
   sensitivity of opioid receptors or the availability of endogenous
   opioids constitute part of the underlying pathophysiology of BPD. The
   alarming symptoms and self-destructive behaviors of the affected
   patients may be explained by uncontrollable and unconscious attempts to
   stimulate their endogenous opioid system (EOS) and the dopaminergic
   reward system, regardless of the possible harmful consequences.
   Neurobiological findings that support this hypothesis are reviewed:
   Frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, frequent and risky sexual
   contacts, and attention-seeking behavior may be explained by attempts to
   make use of the rewarding effects of human attachment mediated by the
   EOS. Anhedonia and feelings of emptiness may be an expression of reduced
   activity of the EOS. Patients with BPD tend to abuse substances that
   target p.-opioid receptors. Self-injury, food restriction, aggressive
   behavior, and sensation seeking may be interpreted as desperate attempts
   to artificially set the body to survival mode in order to mobilize the
   last reserves of the EOS. BPD-associated symptoms, such as substance
   abuse, anorexia, self-injury, depersonalization, and sexual
   overstimulation, can be treated successfully with opioid receptor
   antagonists. An understanding of the neurobiology of BPD may help in
   developing new treatments for patients with this severe disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Although the effects of grazing-induced savannah degradation on animal
   diversity are well documented, knowledge of how they affect space use or
   responding behaviour remains poor. In this study, we analysed space use
   of the spotted sand lizard (Pedioplanis l. lineoocellata) in degraded
   versus nondegraded habitats of southern Kalahari savannah habitats.
   Lizards were radio tracked, daily movement distances recorded and home
   range sizes calculated. In degraded Kalahari savannah habitats where
   plant diversity and perennial grass cover are low but shrub cover high,
   P. lineoocellata moves larger distances (40.88 +/- 6.42 m versus 27.43
   +/- 5.08 m) and occupies larger home ranges (646.64 +/- 244.84 m(2)
   versus 209.15 +/- 109.84 m(2)) than in nondegraded habitats (high plant
   diversity, high perennial grass cover and low shrub cover). We assume
   that this increase in daily movement distances and home range sizes is a
   behavioural plasticity to limited food resources in degraded savannah
   habitats. Although P. lineoocellata is able to adjust to resource-poor
   savannah habitats, the increase in the lizard's movement activities is
   likely to result in a higher predation risk. This is supported by the
   lower availability of protective vegetation i.e. perennial grass cover.
   Hence, we conclude that despite behavioural plasticity of P.
   lineoocellata, overgrazing has a severe negative impact on the space use
   of P. lineoocellata.}},

Abstract = {{Signals increase the fitness of a sender by altering the behaviour of

   the cleaner shrimp Periclimenes longicarpus in the field to test more
   detailed predictions of biological market theory. Shrimps often clapped
   with their pair of claws in response to approaching clients. In line
   with both theory and the previous study, the probability of clapping
   increased when the shrimps had been food deprived and clapping shrimps
   were more likely to clean than nonclapping individuals. However, we
   found no evidence for the market theory prediction that signalling was
   targeted specifically to visiting client species with the option to
   choose other cleaning stations. Instead, shrimps signalled more
   frequently towards predatory clients than towards nonpredatory clients.

Abstract = {{Behavioral syndromes are correlated suites of behavior, analogous to
   human personality traits. Most work to date has been taken from limited
   ``snapshots{''} in space and time, with the implicit assumption that a
   behavioral syndrome is an invariant property, fixed by evolutionary
   constraints or adaptations. However, directional selection on two
   mechanistically independent traits (selective covariance) could also
   result in correlated behaviors. Previously, we have shown that shy/bold
   behavior in Southern dumpling squid (Euprymna tasmanica) across predator
   encounter and feeding risk contexts is genetically and phenotypically
   uncoupled, and hence potentially free to vary independently. Here, we
   collected data on shy/bold behaviors from two independent wild
   populations of squid in two different years to test whether behavioral
   correlations across these same two functional contexts vary through time
   and space. We detected significant influences of population, sex, and
   body size on the expression of boldness in squid within each functional
   context, and this was coupled with significant differences in relative
   population density and adult sex ratio. Despite these changes in
   behavior and demographic parameters, we found that correlations between
   boldness scores across the two functional contexts were largely absent
   in both wild populations of squid in both years. Our work suggests that
   some animal groups may be largely characterized by context-specific
   behavioral expression. A theoretical framework which conceptualizes
   behavioral syndromes resulting from context-specific behavioral rules
   may be needed to fully understand why behaviors are sometimes
   correlated, and why sometimes they are not.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We aimed to assess the pathway from personality to
   alexithymia through mood and anxiety as mediators.
   Method: Three hundred thirty-four subjects (130 male), whose psychiatric
   health was verified by Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and
   Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Axis I
   disorders, completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20), the
   Temperament and Character Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory
   (STAI), and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale
   (CES-D). The schematic models for the pathway analysis from Temperament
   and Character Inventory (TCI) to TAS-20 scores were made.
   Results: Low reward dependence (RD), low self-directedness (S-D), and
   high cooperativeness (CO) had paths to TAS-20 total (P = .000, P = .000,
   and P = .042, respectively). S-D had also an indirect path via
   STAI-state to TAS total. On TAS-20 factor 1, low RD, low S-D, and high
   self-transcendence (ST) had direct effects (P = .004, P = .000, and P =
   .000, respectively). S-D had also an indirect path via STAI-state and
   (CES-D) on TAS-20 factor 1. On TAS factor 2, low novelty seeking (NS),
   high harm avoidance (HA), low RD, low S-D, and high cooperativeness (CO)
   had direct effects (P = .005, P = .011, P = .000, P = .000, and P =
   .004, respectively). On TAS-20 factor 3, low RD and S-D had direct
   effects (P = .002 and P = .000, respectively).
   Conclusion: Current results suggest that although alexithymia is
   affected by the personality, state-dependent mood and anxiety may
   mediate the relationship between alexithymia and personality. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Metabolic syndrome (MetS) represents a combination of cardio-metabolic

   Environmental factors during periods early in development have been
   shown to influence the susceptibility to develop disease in later life.
   In particular, there is a wealth of evidence from both epidemiological
   and animal studies for greater incidence of features of MetS as a result
   of unbalanced maternal nutrition. The mechanisms by which nutritional
   insults during a period of developmental plasticity result in a MetS
   phenotype are now beginning to receive considerable scientific interest.
   This review focuses on recent data regarding these mechanisms, in
   particular the epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of key

   persistent changes and an adult MetS phenotype. A continued and greater

Abstract = {{Populations of Western countries are severely deficient in omega-3
   intake, both in the form of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and the Long
   Chain derivatives (LC-n-3), Eicosa-Pentaenoic-Acid and
   Docosa-Hexaenoic-Acid. Omega-3 insufficiency is a risk factor for
   cardiovascular and cerebral diseases such as coronary heart disease and
   stroke. Stroke is a major cause of mortality and morbidity, and induces
   a significant socioeconomic cost and a marked increase in patient/family
   burden. To date, preventive treatments and neuroprotective drugs
   identified in preclinical studies failed in clinical trials, in part
   because of an inability to tolerate drugs at neuroprotective
   concentrations. Therefore testing alternative protective strategies,
   such as functional foods/nutraceuticals, are of considerable interest.
   We have previously demonstrated that a single injection of ALA reduced
   ischemic damage by limiting glutamate-mediated neuronal death, whereas
   repeated injections displayed additive protective benefits as a result
   of increased neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and neurotrophin expression.
   Because intravenous injections are not a suitable long-term strategy in
   humans, the present study investigated the effect of ALA supplementation
   by an experimental diet containing rapeseed oil (RSO, a rich source of
   ALA) as the only source of lipids for stroke prevention. We tested
   several experimental diets which included 5, 10, and 20\% RSO-enriched
   diet and feeding paradigms (fresh diet was provided once or twice a week
   for 4 or 6 weeks). Our results showed that ALA supplemented diets are
   more sensitive to lipid peroxidation than a regular chow diet. Because
   the diet affected feeding behavior and animal growth, we defined
   concrete guidelines to investigate the effect of omega-3 supplementation
   on neuropathology. Among the different sets of experiments, animals fed
   with 10\% and 20\% RSO-enriched diet displayed a reduced mortality rate,
   infarct size and increased probability of spontaneous reperfusion in the
   post-ischemic period. In addition, a drastic reduction of lipid
   peroxidation levels was observed in the ischemic brain of RSO-fed
   animals. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the potential
   of employing rapeseed oil as a functional food/nutraceutical aiding in
   stroke prevention and protection. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Since 1989, we have conducted a large-scale ecological experiment in
   semiarid thorn scrub of a national park in north-central Chile.
   Initially, we focused on the role of biotic interactions including
   predation, interspecific competition, and herbivory in small mammal and
   plant components of the community. We utilized a reductionist approach
   with replicated 0.56 ha fenced grids that selectively excluded
   vertebrate predators and/or larger small mammal herbivores such as the
   degu, Octodon degas. Although we detected small transitory effects of
   predator exclusions on degu survival and numbers, other species failed
   to show responses. Similarly, interspecific competition (i.e., degus
   with other small mammals) had no detectable numerical effects (although
   some behavioral responses occurred), and degu-exclusions had relatively
   small effects on various plant components. Modeling approaches indicate
   that abiotic factors play a determining role in the dynamics of
   principal small mammal species such as O. degas and the leaf-eared mouse
   (Phyllotis darwini). In turn, these are mainly related to aperiodic
   pulses of higher rainfall (usually during El Nino events) which trigger
   ephemeral plant growth; a food addition experiment. in 1997-2000
   verified the importance of precipitation as a determinant of food
   availability. Since 2004, we have expanded long-term monitoring efforts
   to other important community components including birds and insects in
   order to understand effects of abiotic factors on them; we report some
   of the first results of comprehensive surveys on the former in this
   region. Finally, we recently shifted focus to documenting effects of
   exotic lagomorphs in the park. We installed additional treatments
   selectively excluding small mammals, lagomorphs, or both, from
   replicated grids in order to evaluate putative herbivore impacts. In
   conjunction with increased annual rainfall since 2000, we predict that
   introduced lagomorphs will have increasing impacts in this region, and
   that more frequent El Ninos in conjunction with global climatic change
   may lead to marked changes in community dynamics. The importance of
   long-term experimental studies is underscored by the fact that only now
   after 20 years of work are some patterns becoming evident.}},

   tested for a correlation between exploration behaviour and response
   latency time to a simulated fish predator attack in a fish species,
   juvenile convict cichlids (Amatitlania nigrofasciata). Individual focal
   fish were subjected to a standardized attack by a robotic fish predator
   while foraging, and separately given two repeated trials of exploration
   of a novel environment. We found a strong positive correlation between
   exploration and time taken to respond to the predator model. Fish that
   were fast to explore the novel environment were slower to respond to the
   predator. Our study therefore provides some of the first experimental
   evidence for a link between exploration behaviour and predator-escape

Abstract = {{Personal food preferences can either enhance or Suppress the development
   of obesity and the selection and proportion of macronutrients in the

   LEP receptor (LEPR), adiponectin (ADIPOQ), IL-6 and pro-opiomelanocortin
   (POMC) underlie specific native food preferences and obesity-related
   anthropometric parameters. The total of 409 individuals of Czech
   Caucasian origin were enrolled into the present study and 7 d food
   records were obtained from the study subjects along with selected
   anthropometric measurements. In a subset of study subjects, plasma
   levels of ADIPOQ, LEP and soluble LEPR were measured. Independently of
   the BMI of the individuals, common variations in LEP and LEPR genes were
   associated with specific eating patterns, mainly with respect to timing
   of eating. The LEP + 19A/G polymorphism served as an independent
   predictor for BMI, percentage of body fat and skinfold thickness and
   significantly affected the time structure of the daily energy intake.
   The POMC RsaI polymorphism was associated with percentage of body fat.
   The ADIPOQ 45 T/G polymorphism was associated with the thickness of the
   subscapular skinfold. The LEPR Gln223Arg polymorphism was associated
   with multiple parameters, including diastolic blood pressure, meal sizes
   during the day and plasma ADIPOQ levels. In a separate analysis, soluble
   leptin receptor (sObR) plasma levels and LEP:sObR ratio were
   significantly correlated with systolic blood pressure (beta = -0-66,
   P=0.002; beta = -1.23, P=0.02) and sObR plasma levels also served as an
   independent predictor for diastolic blood pressure (beta = - 0.50;
   P=0-04). To conclude, we report common allelic variants associated with
   specific feeding behaviour and obesity-related anthropometric traits.
   Moreover, we identified allelic variants that significantly influence

Abstract = {{Many organisms have evolved inducible defences in response to spatial
   and temporal variability in predation risk. These defences are assumed
   to incur large costs to prey; however, few studies have investigated the
   mechanisms and costs underlying these adaptive responses. I examined the
   proximate cause of predator-induced shell thickening in a marine snail
   (Nucella lamellosa) and tested whether induced thickening leads to an
   increase in structural strength. Results indicate that although
   predators (crabs) induce thicker shells, the response is a passive
   by-product of reduced feeding and somatic growth rather than an active
   physiological response to predation risk. Physical tests indicate that
   although the shells of predator-induced snails are significantly
   stronger, the increase in performance is no different than that of
   snails with limited access to food. Increased shell strength is
   attributable to an increase in the energetically inexpensive
   microstructural layer rather than to material property changes in the
   shell. This mechanism suggests that predator-induced shell defences may
   be neither energetically nor developmentally costly. Positive
   correlations between antipredator behaviour and morphological defences
   may explain commonly observed associations between growth reduction and
   defence production in other systems and could have implications for the
   evolutionary potential of these plastic traits.}},

Abstract = {{While the prevalence of animal personalities has become apparent in
   recent years, the importance of animal personalities in determining the
   outcome of sexual selection remains imperfectly understood. In
   particular, there are few data on whether repeatable personality
   differences among males are associated with repeatable outcomes of
   male-male interactions within the mating context. Using the bluefin
   killifish, Lucania goodei, we examined the repeatability of individual
   differences in mating behaviours and the stability of dominance rank,
   which partially determines mating success in this species. The
   expression of male behaviours in competition between males and female
   courtship was significantly repeatable over a 5-week period; the number
   of aggressive behaviours to males and females, and the number of
   courtship bouts had significant repeatabilities of 0.71, 0.72 and 0.65,
   respectively. A male's personality or behavioural type within the mating
   context, as measured by a composite measure of the overall level of
   mating behaviour activity, was significantly repeatable at 0.75. Males
   showed repeatable, linear dominance hierarchies, and a male's rank in
   the hierarchy was highly correlated with his behavioural type. Neither
   behavioural type nor dominance rank was associated with body size or
   body condition. The repeatability of behavioural types and stability in
   the outcomes of aggressive interactions suggest that these behavioural
   phenotypes are inherent characteristics of individuals rather than
   short-term responses to recent social experience or daily levels of food
   or stress, and may potentially have an early environmental and/or

   skin of conspecifics. We utilized young juvenile Nicaragua cichlids
   Hypsophrys nicaraguensis to test if the perception of predation risk
   from alarm cue (conspecific skin extract) alone induces an increased
   relative body depth which is a defense against gape-limited predators.
   After two weeks of exposure, siblings that were exposed to conspecific
   alarm cue increased their relative body depth nearly double the amount
   of those exposed to distilled water (control) and zebrafish Danio rerio
   alarm cue. We repeated our measurements over the last two weeks (12 and
   14) of cue exposure when the fish were late-stage juveniles to test if
   the rate of increase was sustained; there were no differences in final
   dimensions between the three treatments. Our results show that 1) the
   Nicaragua cichlid has an innate response to conspecific alarm cue which
   is not a generalized response to an injured fish, and 2) this innate
   recognition ultimately results in developing a deeper body at a stage of
   the life history where predation risk is high {[}Current Zoology 56(1):

Abstract = {{Predator-prey interactions are usually composed of behaviorally
   sophisticated games in which the values of the strategies of foraging
   prey individuals may depend on those of their predators, and vice versa.
   Therefore, any change in the behavior of the predator should result in
   changes to the behavior of the prey. However, this key prediction has
   rarely been tested. To examine the effects of the predator state on prey
   behavior, we manipulated the state of captive Barn Owls, Tyto alba, and
   released them into an enclosure containing Allenby's gerbils, Gerbillus
   andersoni allenbyi, a common prey of the owls. The owls were
   significantly more active when hungry. In response, the gerbils altered
   their behavior according to the state of the owl. When the owl was
   hungry, the gerbils visited fewer food patches, foraged in fewer
   patches, and harvested less food from each patch. Moreover, the gerbils
   kept their foraging bouts closer to their burrow, which reduced the
   overlap among foraging ranges of individual gerbils. Thus, changes in
   the state of the predator affect the foraging behavior of its prey and
   can also mediate competition among prey individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Arctic charr are characterized by an extensive variability in growth and
   body size in natural waters. Although growth traits may involve a
   significant heritable component, most of this intraspecific variation
   presumably is environmentally induced and thus attributable to
   phenotypic plasticity. In the present study, size-at-age and
   length-weight relationship (body condition) were assessed for three
   Finnish Arctic charr populations of different geographical origins and
   extreme size forms (a stunted vs. two large-growing, predatory charr)
   held under standardized rearing conditions for 3 years (up to 37 months
   after hatching). In particular, our interest was to investigate whether
   the differences in growth between the large and the stunted charr as
   observed in the wild populations would diminish when the fish are
   offered suitable food in abundance. Population-specific mean body size
   and condition differed significantly in 0+, 1+, 2+ and 3+ fish. However,
   the identical rearing conditions resulted in the originally stunted
   charr reaching a comparable final mean size (317 mm/427 g) as the large
   charr populations (343 mm/510 g and 359 mm/497 g). Some individuals were
   of the same size as their parents at spawning already at the age of 0+
   years. Furthermore, length-weight regression residuals of the stunted
   charr developed to a notably high level, indicating the largest final
   condition mean. The increase of size variation (CV of weight) in stunted
   charr lasted for over two growth seasons, whereas in large charr it
   remained stable since the end of the first summer. Variations in
   mortality and sexual maturation at age 2 seemed to be less relevant
   factors affecting overall growth performance. The study demonstrates an
   example of the high plasticity involved in the growth of fish: the
   stunted charr possess a tremendous capacity for growth in a benign
   environment, virtually corresponding to that observed in the large
   predatory populations.}},

Abstract = {{1. The detrimental impacts of invasive, non-native species on islands
   are widely acknowledged and it is often best to act rapidly against such
   species, even where uncertainty exists over the best way to proceed. If
   management actions are evaluated and refined, using information learnt
   from the biology of culled animals, this uncertainty can be gradually
   reduced, increasing the likelihood of a successful outcome.
   2. American mink Neovison vison carcasses were collected as part of an
   eradication campaign on several islands of the Outer Hebrides, Scotland,
   and stable isotope analysis was used to describe ecological variation in
   this invasive non-native predator.
   3. Isotope profiles from individual mink whiskers demonstrated how
   behaviour at a population level changed markedly over time. As the
   eradication campaign progressed, mink increased their reliance on marine
   food sources and focused their activity on the coastline. Stable isotope
   analyses also demonstrated sex-related changes in foraging and ranging
   behaviour in relation to food resource availability on the two main
   island complexes.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings contribute to the refinement
   of a campaign to extend the successful eradication of mink from Uist and
   Harris, to the whole of the Outer Hebrides archipelago, UK. They also
   highlight the potential for stable isotope approaches to provide more
   detailed postmortem information that can inform adaptive management of
   wildlife populations for conservation objectives.}},

Abstract = {{The life history of freshwater cladocerans such as Daphnia spp. is
   strongly affected by their environment. Factors such as temperature,
   food quantity and even the presence or absence of predators influence
   growth, reproduction and morphology of individuals. Recently, it has
   also become clear that the quality of the food can affect various life
   history traits of Daphnia. More specifically, the effect of the
   elemental composition of algae, expressed as the C:P ratio, has been
   studied intensively. Daphnia species differ in their response to
   differences in the C:P ratio of their food. Until now, it has been
   unclear whether these species differences are driven by phylogenetic
   constraints or by adaptation to particular environmental conditions.
   Here we present laboratory experiments with 12 Daphnia species from
   three different subgenera originating from a broad range of habitats. We
   compared somatic growth rates and sensitivity to variation in the
   nutrient stoichiometry of the food with habitat parameters, taking into
   account the phylogenetic history of the species. No associations between
   fitness and habitat parameters were detected. However, we found a
   trade-off between sensitivity to P-deficient diets and the maximum
   growth rate on a P-sufficient diet. In several cases, this trade-off
   helps to explain the association between species distribution and
   habitat parameters. We observed no correlation of the sensitivity to P
   limitation with the phylogenetic history of the genus Daphnia. Thus, we
   conclude that the differential responses among Daphnia species to
   variation in P content in food were driven mainly by adaptations to
   their local habitats, and are not constrained by deep evolutionary
   patterns.}},

Volume = {{79}},

Pages = {{25-30}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Social learning is predicted to be adaptive when independent learning is
   time-consuming, dangerous or difficult. For a naive individual
   confronted with an array of novel foods, determining the nutritional
   value of unfamiliar foods can be challenging, and an increased reliance
   on social learning would be favoured by selection. I investigated
   whether the multimodal display of food calling and tid-bitting by
   white-tailed ptarmigan, Lagopus leucurus, hens adaptively biases chicks'
   intake of foods of different nutrient content via social learning.
   Ptarmigan were observed in California's Sierra Nevada alpine for two
   summer seasons. In 116 foraging bouts, I observed 100 instances of hen
   food calling (to six plant species) and 100 responses by chicks. The
   relative proportion of each plant species in the chicks' diet was
   significantly and positively related to the proportion of food calls
   associated with that plant species, but not with its relative
   availability. Plant species that elicited food calls by hens had
   significantly more protein than did random mixtures of plants or than
   did foods eaten by the hens that did not elicit food calls. Chicks of
   hens that often uttered calls consumed diets significantly higher in
   protein than did chicks of hens that rarely called. Preferences were
   maintained as chicks became older and foraged further from their
   mothers, and food calling ceased, indicating social learning. Hens' food
   calling biased chicks' diet choices, supporting the prediction that
   socially acquired information plays a prominent role when an animal is
   seeking a nutrient that is difficult to identify (protein). These
   findings are consistent with the interpretation that ptarmigan hens
   engage in teaching, but further studies are required before it can be
   stated conclusively that they teach their chicks nutritional wisdom. (C)

Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{63-74}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Predators are often unwilling to eat prey with novel appearances (so
   called dietary conservatism). It has repeatedly, although
   controversially, been argued that such wariness can contribute to the
   evolution of bright coloration in prey animals with effective secondary
   defences such as toxins. In this paper we report the results of novel
   evolutionary simulations in which bright prey emerge in otherwise
   cryptic, defended populations, and predators vary in their level of
   dietary wariness. A novel prediction from our simulations is that rare
   aposematic prey can evolve to a dynamic equilibrium with their cryptic
   conspecifics, and persist for long evolutionary timescales without ever
   reaching fixation in prey populations. Furthermore, we show that when
   conditions are more beneficial for new aposematic forms, for example
   because there are many palatable prey in a habitat, then dietary
   conservatism can indeed explain the evolution of aposematism, but the
   generality of this result was considerably restricted by variation in
   levels of dietary conservatism seen within predator populations and by
   increased predator longevity. We use the results to consider the case
   that `receiver biases' could explain aposematism, rather than recently
   suggested models of signal reliability. (C) 2009 The Association for the

Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{153-158}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Pit-building antlion larvae are sit-and-wait predatory insects that
   construct conical pits, from which they ambush prey, in sandy soils. We
   examined the behavioural responses of antlions to the detection of
   various sized prey, which they were not allowed to capture. We found
   that antlions responded faster to smaller prey items, probably because
   larger prey may be considered a source of disturbance rather than a food
   source. Antlion response time to provided prey decreased after feeding
   and was negatively correlated with antlion body mass. Both of these
   results were indicative of a response to prey that depended on both
   internal and external factors. Pit dimensions increased with time at a
   constant rate among antlions in the unsuccessful prey capture or fed
   groups, but at a decelerating rate in the unfed control group. Contrary
   to our expectation, we could not detect differences in the rate of mass
   loss between antlions that were unfed and those experiencing
   unsuccessful prey captures. We also posited that antlions should exploit
   a specific prey type more efficiently as the number of encounters they
   had with it increased. However, there was no support for this prediction
   in our study. Exploring the responses of predators to prey in general,
   and in light of the conditions characterizing their natural habitat in
   particular, can improve our understanding of how predators adapt to cope
   with environmental variability. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study

Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{165-171}},

Abstract = {{Under sexual conflict, males evolve traits to increase their mating and
   reproductive success that impose costs on females. Females evolve
   counteradaptations to resist males and reduce those costs. Sexual
   harassment is a form of sexual conflict in which males make repeated,
   costly attempts to mate. Costs to female foraging or predation risk have
   been measured in several species, but quantitative measurements of
   direct fitness costs are rare. In the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile
   rotundata (Fabricius; Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), males harass females,
   and females resist all mating attempts. We placed bees in large, outdoor
   cages with various male-biased sex ratios. Harassment rate, nest
   progression, offspring production, temperature, and food availability
   were measured daily for 7 days. Harassment rates were highest at
   intermediate sex ratios. Harassment reduced the number of foraging trips
   and increased the duration of foraging trips made by females. Females
   produced offspring at a slower rate when subjected to higher rates of
   harassment. This shows a direct link from sex ratio to harassment to
   female fitness under natural conditions. We also discuss an alternative
   explanation that female resistance is a mechanism for mate choice for
   high-quality males, which would require that indirect benefits accrue
   through either daughters or grandsons, because all sons in haplodiploid
   species arise from unfertilized eggs. (C) 2009 The Association for the

Pages = {{238-260}},
Abstract = {{Although explanatory and predictive powers are 2 closely interconnected
   aspects of conceptual and mathematical models of complex systems, the
   two are not equivalent. The 2 aspects are discussed here for the
   microbial part of photic zone food webs of the marine pelagic. We focus
   on the specific question of how limiting nutrients are transferred from
   the dissolved form, through the microbial food web, to mesozooplankton.
   For this purpose, 5 different nutrient addition experiments are reviewed
   and compared to a `simplest possible' conceptual food web model. The
   experiments range in scale from artificial food webs constructed in
   laboratory chemostats, via mesocosm experiments, to a Lagrangian
   open-ocean addition experiment and cover time scales from days to weeks.
   We conclude that main system responses in all cases can be explained
   within the framework of the simple model, and that each experiment
   therefore also adds credibility to the basic concepts of this model.
   However, different system attributes profoundly affect the pathway and
   speed of nutrient transfer in each experiment. A re-occurring theme
   seems to be how the interactions between flexible stoichiometry and
   predatory processes modify experimental outcomes. Understanding the
   flexibility in the behavior of the system has thus increased with each
   experiment, but the requirement for new ad hoc assumptions to be added
   to the basic model structure in each case makes reliable predictions of
   the experimental outcome appear only possible with further model
   elaboration.}},

Abstract = {{Birds use local environmental Cues to fine-tune the timing of egg laying
   such that the nestling period normally coincides with the local peak in
   food availability. Ambient temperature, vegetation phenology, and insect
   phenology are often considered the most likely Cues, but no previous
   studies have explicitly compared and partitioned their relative effects.
   We used confirmatory path analyses and a long-term study of Blue Tits
   (Cyanistes caeruleus) to identify and measure the relative weighting of
   the causal paths that link laying date to spring phenology and
   temperature in deciduous and evergreen oak forests on Corsica. Path
   analysis showed that the effects of temperature and vegetation phenology
   vary between forest types and season. In deciduous oak forest, where
   females lay eggs early in spring, phenology of vegetation or insects
   sets the laying date. In evergreen oak forest, where breeding occurs
   later in the season, females shift from a predominantly phenology-based
   Cue system to a predominantly temperature-based Cue system. This
   plasticity in the decision process allows birds to minimize the risk of
   mismatching breeding date with the optimal time window and may be
   critical in allowing birds to track human-induced environmental change.

Abstract = {{Intermittent locomotion, characterized by moves interspersed with

   and evolutionary significance relative to continuous locomotion remains
   poorly understood. Although many studies have examined individual
   differences in both intermittent locomotion and boldness separately, to
   our knowledge, no study to date has investigated the relationship
   between these 2 traits. Characterizing and understanding this
   relationship is important, as both locomotion and boldness are
   associated with several ecologically relevant behaviors such as
   foraging, mating, predator evasion, exploration, and dispersal. Here, we
   report on individual differences in boldness (risk-taking behavior) and
   intermittent locomotion in a novel laboratory environment in
   field-caught juvenile bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). Our
   results show that juvenile bluegill sunfish exhibited individual-level
   variation in 2 modes of intermittent locomotion (undulatory and
   labriform swimming) and that this variation was correlated with
   differences in their boldness behavior. Generally, bolder individuals
   spent more time moving fast for longer durations and with shorter pauses
   than more timid individuals. Neither boldness nor locomotion was
   correlated with body size or body condition. This study provides the

Abstract = {{Animals can reduce their uncertainty of predation risk by attuning to

   Although it has never been empirically examined in the context of

   prediction, we assessed the state-dependent mobbing responses of migrant
   and resident songbirds at a fall migration stopover site in eastern
   Canada to stimuli simulating a range of predation risk situations. We
   presented individuals with social cues in the form of playbacks of
   black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) mob-calls conveying graded
   information about predator size in combination with a predator model
   (one of two owl species) that rendered the social information either
   correct or incorrect. The response did not differ based on migratory
   state; both migrant and resident birds stayed longer at experimental
   trials when presented with erroneous social information. In particular,
   response duration of birds presented with a low-threat chickadee
   mob-call and a high-threat model (understating the risk) was
   substantially longer than the response to other low-threat call trials,

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{147}},

Pages = {{883-897}},
Abstract = {{Learning is a ubiquitous phenomenon in foraging animals, allowing
   behavioural optimisation in variable environments. Food imprinting is a
   specific form of learning restricted to the early stages of life and
   with long lasting consequences. However, since coining of the term four
   decades ago, the uniqueness of food imprinting has been largely
   questioned due to a putative mechanistic similarity with associative
   learning. Here, we demonstrate food imprinting in the predatory mite
   Neoseiulus californicus, which primarily feeds on spider mites but may
   use thrips as alternative prey. Brief (24 h) exposure to thrips (contact
   without feeding) early in life resulted in shorter attack latencies and
   consistently higher predation rates on thrips during adulthood.
   Predation and oviposition rates were positively correlated but
   oviposition did not differ between naive and experienced females. Our
   results suggest that food imprinting is indeed special because, unlike
   associative learning, it occurred without reinforcement, was restricted
   to a sensitive phase and persisted into adulthood. Food imprinting seems
   particularly advantageous when prey species availability varies little
   within generations and a given prey is difficult to ingest for young
   small but not older larger life stages. Food imprintability could be
   used to improve the efficacy of biocontrol agents such as N.

Abstract = {{Objective: Extremely low body mass index (BMI) values are associated
   with increased risk for death and poor long-term prognosis in
   individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN). The present study explores
   childhood personality characteristics that could be associated with the
   ability to attain an extremely low BMI.
   Methods: Participants were 326 women from the Genetics of Anorexia
   Nervosa (GAN) Study who completed the Structured Interview for Anorexia
   Nervosa and Bulimic Syndromes and whose mother completed the Child
   Behavioral Checklist and/or Revised Dimensions of Temperament Survey.
   Results: Children who were described as having greater fear or anxiety
   by their mothers attained lower BMIs during AN (p < 0.02). Path analysis
   in the CAN and a validation sample, Price Foundation Anorexia Nervosa
   Trios Study, confirmed the relation between early childhood anxiety,
   caloric restriction, qualitative food item restriction, excessive
   exercise, and low BMI. Path analysis also confirmed a relation between
   childhood anxiety and caloric restriction, which mediated the relation
   between childhood anxiety and low BMI in the GAN sample only.
   Conclusion: Fearful or anxious behavior as a child was associated with
   the attainment of low BMI in AN and childhood anxiety was associated
   with caloric restriction. Measures of anxiety and factors associated
   with anxiety-proneness in childhood may index children at risk for
   restrictive behaviors and extremely low BMIs in AN. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{95-105}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{P>Basal termites possess two developmental features that eusocial
   Hymenoptera lack: the majority of colony members are juveniles whose
   somatic and reproductive development is temporarily or permanently
   suspended, and individual development is characterized by extreme
   phenotypic plasticity. An examination of the literature indicates that
   the basis for these unique ontogenetic characters is not the
   prolongation of a pronymphal stage into postembryonic development, as
   recently suggested. Like other hemimetabolous insects, termites have
   three embryonic cuticles, and the pronymphal (EC3) cuticle is shed
   during or shortly after hatch. Nonetheless, a different developmental
   landmark, dorsal closure, occurs later during embryogenesis in termites
   than it does in their cockroach relatives, clearly indicating
   ontogenetic repatterning from an ancestral state. An alternate
   hypothesis for the origin of isopteran phenotypic plasticity becomes
   apparent if we remain focused on the phylogenetic and social context of
   termite evolution. Altricial development occurs in both vertebrate and
   invertebrate taxa, evolves in response to the parental environment, and
   is displayed by two distantly related, biparental, wood-feeding
   cockroaches, including Cryptocercus, the sister-group to termites. It is
   therefore likely the condition was present in subsocial termite
   ancestors, and played a complex, multidimensional role in the transition
   to eusociality. Most relevant to current arguments is that a shift in
   responsibility for the care of altricial dependents, from parents to the
   first nutritionally independent nymphs in the family (alloparents),
   resulted in the developmental stasis of alloparents at a relatively
   young age. Because early instar cockroaches are not metamorphically
   competent, these young alloparents would have provided a novel
   developmental template on which selection could act.}},

Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{49-57}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The timing of many life history events shows phenotypic plasticity in
   response to the risk of predation. Theory predicts that increased risk
   of mortality in an early stage should select for switching earlier,
   while a higher risk after the transition should select for switching
   later. Here we examined the effects of stage-specific predation risk on
   the timing of hatching of Rana temporaria. Embryos were exposed to
   chemical cues from either an egg predator (Haemopis sanguisuda) or a
   tadpole predator (Aeshna cyanea) to evaluate three specific hypotheses:
   (1) a fixed intermediate response, (2) a `fixed predator' response
   (i.e., either anticipation or delay), and (3) a specific predator
   response (both anticipation and delay). Rana temporaria embryos did not
   discern between pre- and post-hatching specific predators, and they
   hatched prematurely regardless predator type. These results suggest that
   R. temporaria embryos respond to predation risk in a fixed way by
   hatching early, and that they use cues stemming from injured
   conspecifics, which provides a simple, conservative mechanism of risk
   assessment. In conclusion, our data are not anticipated by the
   theoretical consideration that organisms should spend less time in more
   dangerous environments, but they confirm an invariable adjustment of
   hatching time in response to an inscrutable predation risk (response to
   a fixed-predator) in connection with a consistent mechanism mediating
   the perception of predation risk.}},

   comparison against a finite archive of behavioral archetypes, novelty
   comparison against all previously seen behaviors, and a simple linear
   combination of the first method with a standard fitness measure.
   Performance is evaluated on the Santa Fe Trail, a well known GP
   benchmark selected for its deceptiveness and established generalization
   test procedures. Results are compared to a standard quality-based

   objective provided better overall performance, however, solutions
   identified under novelty based fitness functions generally provided much
   better test performance than their corresponding training performance.

Journal = {{GENOME MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Epigenetic processes, primarily DNA methylation and covalent
   modifications of histones, regulate the transcriptional activity of
   genes in a manner that can be modified by environmental cues. This
   allows variation in the expression of the transcriptome without changes
   in the genome. Constraint in the early life environment, such as poor
   early nutrition, is associated with increased risk of non-communicable
   diseases, including cardio-metabolic disease and cancer in later life.
   Such induced phenotypic change involves environmental signals acting
   through developmental plasticity. Recent studies in humans and in animal
   models show that epigenetic processes, in particular DNA methylation,
   have a central role in the induction and stability of novel phenotypes
   and in increased disease risk. Identification of such processes suggests
   the potential for developing biomarkers of disease risk and for
   interventions to prevent or reverse the adverse effects of a poor early
   life environment. At present, knowledge in this area is limited to
   proof-of-principle studies in animal models and some initial studies in
   humans. Before such findings can be translated into reliable biomarkers
   and safe, effective interventions, several fundamental questions need to
   be answered. In order to achieve this, new technologies will be needed
   to support large cohort studies. Despite the early stage of knowledge in
   this field and the intellectual, technological and financial challenges,

Abstract = {{Anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are related disorders of
   unknown etiology that most commonly begin during adolescence in women.
   They are characterized by aberrant patterns of feeding behavior and
   weight regulation, and deviant attitudes and perceptions toward body
   weight and shape. In AN, an inexplicable fear of weight gain and
   unrelenting obsession with being fat, even in the face of increasing
   emaciation, accounts for a protracted course. BN usually emerges after a
   period of food restriction, which may or may not have been associated
   with weight loss. Binge eating is followed either by self-induced
   vomiting, or by other means of compensation for the excess of ingested
   food. There is growing acknowledgement that neurobiological
   vulnerabilities make a substantial contribution to the pathogenesis of
   AN and BN, suggesting that altered brain serotonin (5-HT) function
   contributes to dysregulation of appetite, mood, and impulse control.
   Brain imaging studies, using 5-HT specific ligands, show that
   disturbances of 5-HT function occur when people are ill, and persist
   after recovery. It is possible that a trait-related disturbance of 5-HT
   neuronal modulation predates the onset of AN, and contributes to
   premorbid symptoms of anxiety, obsessionality and inhibition. This
   dysphoric temperament may involve an inherent dysregulation of emotional
   and reward pathways which also mediates the hedonic aspects of feeding,
   thus making these individuals vulnerable to disturbed appetitive
   behaviors. Individuals with AN may discover that reduced dietary intake,
   by reducing plasma tryptophan availability, is a means by which they can
   modulate brain 5-HT functional activity and anxious mood. They enter a
   vicious cycle, because caloric restriction results in a brief respite
   from dysphoric mood. However, malnutrition and weight loss, in turn,
   produce alterations in many neuropeptides and monoamine function, which
   also exaggerates dysphoric mood. Thus, those with AN pursue starvation
   in an attempt to avoid the dysphoric consequences of eating.}},

Abstract = {{Developmental plasticity is the process by which environmental cues in
   early life influence the nature of the phenotype. The near-universal
   capacity for plasticity evolved because it allows the organism to
   maintain or enhance its fitness, either at the time of the challenge (by
   allowing survival) or later in life. Importantly, developmental
   plasticity operates over the normative range of environmental
   experiences. Studies of the long-term consequences of different
   developmental environments for human health and disease have shown that
   growth restriction (altered birth size) is not a prerequisite for
   altered disease risk and that there is a graded effect across the whole
   range of fetal milieu. Thus, the emerging consensus is that `fetal
   programming' reflects the maladaptive consequences of developmental
   plasticity, arising from discordance between the triggering and later
   environments. Such discordance is increasingly likely, both because of
   demographic shifts and because of the rapid change in the nutritional
   and social environments experienced after weaning. Copyright (C) 2010

Volume = {{415}},
Pages = {{83-90}},
Abstract = {{Sessile colonial invertebrates that must tolerate environmental
   variation without the luxury of mobility may be expected to cope with
   such variation through phenotypic plasticity. While plastic responses to
   a range of biotic factors (e.g. predation) are increasingly documented,
   the details of responses to competition (mediated by the densities of
   conspecifics or heterospecifics vying for the same resources) remain
   unclear, despite a rich literature for terrestrial plants on which to
   draw. We examined phenotypic responses to conspecific density in a
   colonial invertebrate (the arborescent bryozoan, Bugula neritina) under
   field conditions. We found that colonies at higher densities were
   generally less fecund, lower in biomass and more elongate than those
   growing virtually alone. We also found such responses to vary only
   subtly with the life history stage of neighbours, with colonies exposed
   to higher densities of contemporary recruits achieving elongation via
   increased budding between bifurcation points and the elongation of
   individual zooids, while colonies exposed to established adults achieved
   elongation via increased budding only. These responses are broadly
   consistent with those of terrestrial plants competing for light and are
   probably due to the combined effects of resource limitation and altered
   flow in high density stands. Future studies are needed to disentangle
   these effects and the extent to which such responses to density in
   branching colonial invertebrates are a passive result of food
   limitation, or reflect active (and potentially adaptive) plasticity to
   other aspects of the local density environment.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{407}},
Pages = {{173-185}},
Abstract = {{Behavioural traits can strongly influence fitness and survival and are
   important mediators of life history trade-offs. This study explored the
   links between mortality trade-offs associated with fast growth during
   larval life and behaviour of individuals during an important life
   history transition. Longitudinal sampling of a cohort of damselfish
   settling on a reef at the end of their larval stage found that
   individuals with small otolith sizes at hatching and low otolith growth
   rates were selectively removed from the local population, while there
   was no apparent selection for size or body condition over the first 24 h
   after settlement. Selection against slow growth (initial larval growth
   and maximum growth) and small size at hatching and settlement were
   accentuated over the first month after settlement. Detailed behavioural
   assessments of naive larvae settled onto habitat patches and monitored
   for 24 h found that initial boldness aided survival, but individuals
   that ventured larger distances from shelter suffered higher mortality.
   Correlations of growth with behavioural attributes were generally poor;
   however, there was a weak correlation between boldness and maximum
   growth. A measure of flexibility in the maximum distance ventured from
   shelter was positively related to initial otolith growth. Our results
   suggest that although early growth which is relatively slow leads to
   higher mortality later in life, and behavioural attributes influenced
   survival, there were only weak correlations between growth history and
   behaviour. This may be due to strong selective pressures on young fish
   to learn novel behaviours rapidly after settlement. Selection may
   promote behavioural flexibility at this key ecological transition.}},

Abstract = {{The present article presents epidemiological, and comparative evidence
   Supporting the hypothesis that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may represent a
   thrifty adaptation selected to compel animals to minimize voluntary
   energy expenditure. The autoimmune, pathophysiological manifestations
   underlying RA are framed here as constituting an evolved, protective
   mechanism that would have influenced animals to avoid exertion and
   maintain a sedentary lifestyle in order to minimize metabolic output and
   ultimately escape starvation. Arthritic pain is characterized here as a
   defensive, innate signal much like fatigue, fever, nausea and reflexive
   pain, and like these, is seen on a continuum varying between
   imperceptible encumbrance and debilitating disability. The epigenetic
   relationship between acute psychological stress and flare-up of
   arthritic symptoms is examined and taken to suggest that arthritis may
   be a predictive, adaptive response to severe stress allowing reductions
   in metabolism to follow adverse conditions or nutritional scarcity. The
   close associations between rheumatoid arthritis and the metabolic
   syndrome are also explored along with potential ties to the ``thrifty
   genotype{''} and ``thrifty phenotype{''} phenomena. This hypothesis is
   examined in the contexts of evolutionary medicine, phenotypic
   plasticity, the stress response and the bioenergetics of thrift. A brief
   and exploratory review of pertinent evidence suggests that RA, its
   subclinical manifestations, and even other forms of arthropathy may
   possibly represent adaptations that promoted metabolic thrift during our
   evolutionary past. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NUTRITION AND DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS}},

Volume = {{2}},
Pages = {{137-149}},
Abstract = {{The incidence of obesity and overweight has almost doubled in Western
   societies over the last 2 decades, a trend mirrored in developing
   nations transitioning to first-world economies. Obesity is strongly
   associated with the comorbidities of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and
   heart disease and represents an enormous burden to health care systems.
   Of even more concern is the increase of around 40\% in the prevalence of
   childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes over the last 20 years. Metabolic
   disease results from complex interactions of many factors, including
   genetic, physiologic, behavioral, and environmental influences. The
   recent rate at which these diseases have increased suggests that
   environmental, eg, epigenetic, and behavioral influences, rather than
   genetic causes, are fuelling the present epidemic. In this context, the
   developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis has highlighted
   the link between periconceptual, fetal, and early infant phases of life
   and the subsequent development of adult obesity and related metabolic
   disorders. Both maternal undernutrition (global and targeted) and
   maternal obesity elicit an obese offspring phenotype. This review will
   examine the role of altered maternal nutrition on obesity risk in
   offspring, the interactions with the postnatal nutritional environment,

Abstract = {{Within a season, successive generations of short-lived organisms
   experience different combinations of environmental parameters, such as
   temperature, food quality and mortality risk. Adult body size of e.g.
   insects is therefore expected to vary both as a consequence of proximate
   environmental effects as well as adaptive responses to seasonal cues. In
   this study, we examined intraspecific differences in body size between
   successive generations in 12 temperate bivoltine moths (Lepidoptera),
   with the ultimate goal to critically compare the role of proximate and
   adaptive mechanisms in determining seasonal size differences. In nearly
   all species, individuals developing late in the season (diapausing
   generation) attained a larger adult size than their conspecifics with
   the larval period early in the season (directly developing generation)
   despite the typically lower food quality in late summer. Rearing
   experiments conducted on one of the studied species, Selenia
   tetralunaria also largely exclude the possibility that the proximate
   effects of food quality and temperature are decisive in determining size
   differences between successive generations. Adaptive explanations appear
   likely instead: the larger body size in the diapausing generation may be
   adaptively associated with the lower bird predation pressure late in the
   season, and/or the likely advantage of large pupal size during
   overwintering.}},

Abstract = {{Recent climate change has caused diverse ecological responses in plants
   and animals. However, relatively little is known about homeothermic
   animals' ability to adapt to changing temperature regimes through
   changes in body size, in accordance with Bergmann's rule. We used
   fluctuations in mean annual temperatures in south-west Germany since
   1972 in order to look for direct links between temperature and two
   aspects of body size: body mass and flight feather length. Data from
   regionally born juveniles of 12 passerine bird species were analysed.
   Body mass and feather length varied significantly among years in eight
   and nine species, respectively. Typically the inter-annual changes in
   morphology were complexly non-linear, as was inter-annual variation in
   temperature. For six (body mass) and seven species (feather length),
   these inter-annual fluctuations were significantly correlated with
   temperature fluctuations. However, negative correlations consistent with
   Bergmann's rule were only found for five species, either for body mass
   or feather length. In several of the species for which body mass and
   feather length was significantly associated with temperature,
   morphological responses were better predicted by temperature data that
   were smoothed across multiple years than by the actual mean breeding
   season temperatures of the year of birth. This was found in five species
   for body mass and three species for feather length. These results
   suggest that changes in body size may not merely be the result of
   phenotypic plasticity but may hint at genetically based
   microevolutionary adaptations.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive livestock systems are characterised by limited input. In such

   varies in terms of space and time, and is heterogeneous and sensitive to
   climatic changes. The low control by the breeders on the immediate

   to be able to fulfill their food requirements by developing specific
   behaviours such as land exploration and selective intake. They also have
   to cope with low feed intake periods of various intensities and
   duration.
   In this paper we demonstrate that herbivores adjust their behaviour and
   physiological responses to cope with their environment and face

Abstract = {{With almost 80\% of the fighting forces composed of child soldiers, this
   is one characterization of the `new wars,' which constitute the dominant
   form of violent conflict that has emerged only over the last few
   decades. The development of light weapons, such as automatic guns
   suitable for children, was an obvious prerequisite for the involvement
   of children in modern conflicts that typically involve irregular forces,
   that target mostly civilians, and that are justified by identities,
   although the economic interests of foreign countries and exiled
   communities are usually the driving force.
   Motivations for child recruitment include children's limited ability to
   assess risks, feelings of invulnerability, and shortsightedness. Child
   soldiers are more often killed or injured than adult soldiers on the
   front line. They are less costly for the respective group or
   organization than adult recruits, because they receive fewer resources,
   including less and smaller weapons and equipment. From a different
   perspective, becoming a fighter may seem an attractive possibility for
   children and adolescents who are facing poverty, starvation,
   unemployment, and ethnic or political persecution. In our interviews,
   former child soldiers and commanders alike reported that children are
   more malleable and adaptable. Thus, they are easier to indoctrinate, as
   their moral development is not yet completed and they tend to listen to
   authorities without questioning them.
   Child soldiers are raised in an environment of severe violence,
   experience it, and subsequently often commit cruelties and atrocities of
   the worst kind. This repeated exposure to chronic and traumatic stress
   during development leaves the children with mental and related physical
   ill-health, notably PTSD and severe personality}},

Title = {{Can translocations be used to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts?}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{428-439}},
Abstract = {{Growing public concerns about lethal methods to mitigate human-wildlife
   conflicts place increasing constraints on wildlife management options.
   Translocations, perceived as humane and non-lethal solutions, are
   increasingly advocated to resolve these conflicts. The present study
   summarises the literature on translocations of wild mammals, with
   particular emphasis on `problem' animals, reviews the impact of
   translocations on survival, behaviour, animal welfare and potential
   spread of diseases, and evaluates the feasibility and effectiveness of
   translocations to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts. Translocations may
   have a detrimental impact on survival rates and lead to extreme
   dispersal movements. In some species, stress-related capture results in
   substantial mortality. In other species, homing causes animals to leave
   the release area. In addition, some animals resume the nuisance
   behaviour at the release site. Individuals that survive a translocation
   may suffer from malnutrition, dehydration, decreased immunocompetence
   and predation. Supportive measures such as acclimatisation pens and
   provision of food and shelter can drastically reduce post-release
   dispersal movements and mortality, although the adoption of these
   measures increases the cost of translocation. Translocations have the
   potential to spread diseases to conspecifics, humans, domestic animals
   and livestock. Health surveillance, seldom implemented, is likely to add
   significantly to the cost of translocation. Very few studies have
   reported the costs of translocations or addressed which stakeholders are
   expected to pay for translocating problem animals. Alternative
   management options are rarely mentioned. Despite the perceived
   humaneness of translocations to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts, the
   fate of translocated animals has been rarely monitored. In addition,
   very few studies have mentioned whether and for how long the conflict
   was resolved. We suggest that determining whether the translocation
   leads to the resolution of the problem should be the main criterion to
   evaluate the success of the translocation of problem animals. We propose
   a list of criteria to assist decisions regarding the suitability,
   effectiveness and humaneness of translocations to manage problems posed
   by wild mammals.}},

Abstract = {{Alcohol addiction is a common affliction with a strong genetic component
   {[}1]. Although mammalian studies have provided significant insight into
   the molecular mechanisms underlying ethanol consumption {[}2], other
   organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster are better suited for
   unbiased, forward genetic approaches to identify novel genes. Behavioral
   responses to ethanol, such as hyperactivity, sedation, and tolerance,
   are conserved between files and mammals {[}3, 4], as are the underlying
   molecular pathways {[}5-9]. However, few studies have investigated
   ethanol self-administration in flies {[}10]. Here we characterize
   ethanol consumption and preference in Drosophila. Files prefer to
   consume ethanol-containing food over regular food, and this preference
   increases over time. Files are attracted to the smell of ethanol, which
   partially mediates ethanol preference, but are averse to its taste.
   Preference for consuming ethanol is not entirely explained by attraction
   to either its sensory or caloric properties. We demonstrate that flies
   can exhibit features of alcohol addiction. First,flies self-administer
   ethanol to pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Second, flies will
   overcome an aversive stimulus in order to consume ethanol. Third, flies
   rapidly return to high levels of ethanol consumption after a period of
   imposed abstinence. Thus, ethanol preference in Drosophila provides a
   new model for studying aspects of addiction.}},

Abstract = {{Several species of seabirds show cyclic patterns of attendance at their

   of Cory's shearwater at three colonies (two oceanic and one located on
   the continental shelf), including the world's largest, at Selvagem
   Grande, Madeira, Portugal and considered several hypotheses concerning
   their causal mechanisms. At Selvagem Grande, cycles were exceptionally
   marked and regular, with a periodicity ranging from 7.8 to 11 days, and
   involved both breeders and nonbreeders. In contrast, variation in
   numbers was aperiodic at a nearby and much smaller colony (Selvagem
   Pequena), and also at the colony located off the Portuguese coast
   (Berlenga Island). We found no relationships between number of birds
   ashore and environmental variables such as wind direction and speed or
   lunar cycle. Cycles did not seem to be driven by oscillations in food
   availability or accessibility, given that they did not correlate with
   daily chick growth rates (which were acyclic) or diet. Despite their
   regularity, cycles were slightly out of phase in different sectors of
   Selvagem Grande, which suggests that social interactions at the colony
   could act as an entrainment agent for an endogenous rhythm, and so
   cycles are probably more likely to occur in large and dense colonies.
   Observations are consistent with the hypothesis that cycles facilitate
   social interactions by maximizing the probability of encounters at the
   colony. However, the exact mechanisms through which these remarkable
   cycles are controlled are still completely unknown, and clearly further
   research is needed. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Exhausted Literature. The Emergence of the New in Samuel Beckett's
   Novels and Plays. The article investigates literary subjectivity in some
   texts by Samuel Beckett. The article proceeds by relating the ways of
   how narration and speech acts constitute literary subjectivity to the
   problems of subjectivity that scientific investigations deal with. While
   successful self-regulation of the organism nourishes the roots of
   subjectivity, i.e. the habits, subjectivity decomposes in states of
   exhaustion, when self-regulation breaks down. As soon as a certain
   threshold is transgressed, fatigue sets in, alters the personality and
   eventually leads to exhaustion - a state, which psychiatrists compare to
   mental illness. Notwithstanding the different explanations given,
   scientists agreed about the effects of exhaustion. According to their
   investigations, the decomposition of personality by exhaustion generally
   does not involve apathy, withdrawal from activity or termination of
   movements, but rather mere action. Similarly, in Beckett's novels and
   plays exhaustion is much more than tiredness, as French philosopher
   Gilles Deleuze observed. For Beckett, exhaustion is rather the model for
   both literary innovation and a new concept of subjectivity, which lie
   explores on the basis of a detailed knowledge of physiology, psychology,
   and psychiatry, but using his own literary means. The exhausted subject
   is beyond any calculus of activity. It will perform an activity even if
   he or she makes mistakes or loses control, and will thus act in an
   unpredictable way. This unpredictable action is not an exception in the
   continuation of the habits, but rather points to the moment when a new
   subjectivity emerges. Such new subjectivity surfaces in Beckett's novels
   and plays in forms of literary innovation.}},

Abstract = {{A major question in the biology of stress and environmental adaptation
   concerns the neurobiological basis of how neuroendocrine systems
   governing physiological regulatory mechanisms essential for life
   (metabolism, immune response, organ function) become harmful. The
   current view is that a switch from protection to damage occurs when
   vulnerable phenotypes are exposed to adverse environmental conditions.
   In accordance with this theory, sequelae of early life social and
   environmental stressors, such as childhood abuse, neglect, poverty, and
   poor nutrition, have been associated with the emergence of mental and
   physical illness (i.e., anxiety, mood disorders, poor impulse control,
   psychosis, and drug abuse) and an increased risk of common metabolic and
   cardiovascular diseases later in life. Evidence from animal and human
   studies investigating the associations between early life experiences
   (including parent-infant bonding), hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis
   activity, brain development, and health outcome provide important clues
   into the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate the contribution of
   stressful experiences to personality development and the manifestation
   of illness. This review summarizes our current molecular understanding
   of how early environment influences brain development in a manner that
   persists through life and highlights recent evidence from rodent studies
   suggesting that maternal care in the first week of postnatal life
   establishes diverse and stable phenotypes in the offspring through
   epigenetic modification of genes expressed in the brain that shape
   neuroendocrine and behavioral stress responsivity throughout life. Birth

Abstract = {{Leaf biomechanical properties are thought to impose a significant
   obstacle to herbivores and as such influence patterns of herbivory more
   than leaf chemistry. However, evidence for the role of structural traits
   in influencing herbivore food choice and performance has come from
   correlative studies, whereas the underlying mechanisms have been given
   little attention. By manipulating the biomechanical properties of a host
   grass species through a combination of lyophilization and milling, and
   providing water separately, we were able to compare behavioral,
   physiological, and developmental responses of the Australian plague
   locust, Chortoicetes terminifera, to the biomechanical properties of
   plant food ( exemplified by toughness) independently of the food's
   macronutrient content and the insect's demand for water. Increasing leaf
   toughness was associated with reduced rates of locust growth and
   prolonged development, with potential ecological consequences. Poorer
   performance on the tougher foods was primarily a consequence of a
   reduced rate of nutrient supply, which occurred as a result of ( 1)
   smaller meals being eaten more slowly, ( 2) slowed gut passage rates,
   which limited how quickly the next meal could be taken, and ( 3) reduced
   efficiency of assimilation of nutrients from food in the gut. In
   addition, there were deleterious changes in the ratio of protein to
   carbohydrate assimilated from the gut. Prolonged development time was
   associated with increased total nutrient demands throughout the extended
   developmental period. Because these demands could not be met by
   increased consumption, there was a decreased efficiency of conversion of
   assimilated nutrients to growth. By disentangling the effects of
   biomechanical properties from macronutrient and water content we have
   shown that leaf biomechanical traits can influence chewing herbivores
   independently of leaf chemical traits.}},

Abstract = {{P>1. For phenotypically plastic organisms to produce phenotypes that are
   well matched to their environment, they must acquire information about
   their environment. For inducible defences, cues from damaged prey and
   cues from predators both have the potential to provide important
   information, yet we know little about the relative importance of these
   separate sources of information for behavioural and morphological
   defences. We also do not know the point during a predation event at
   which kairomones are produced, i.e. whether they are produced
   constitutively, during prey attack or during prey digestion.
   2. We exposed leopard frog tadpoles (Rana pipiens) to nine predator cue
   treatments involving several combinations of cues from damaged
   conspecifics or heterospecifics, starved predators, predators only
   chewing prey, predators only digesting prey or predators chewing and
   digesting prey.
   3. We quantified two behavioural defences. Tadpole hiding behaviour was
   induced only by cues from crushed tadpoles. Reduced tadpole activity was
   induced only by cues from predators digesting tadpoles or predators
   chewing + digesting tadpoles.
   4. We also quantified tadpole mass and two size-adjusted morphological
   traits that are known to be phenotypically plastic. Mass was unaffected
   by the cue treatments. Relative body length was affected (i.e. there
   were differences among some treatments), but none of the treatments
   significantly differed from the no-predator control. Relative tail depth
   was affected by the treatments and deeper tails were induced only when
   tadpoles were exposed to cues from predators digesting tadpoles or cues
   from predators chewing + digesting tadpoles.
   5. These results demonstrate that some prey species can discriminate
   among a diverse set of potential cues from heterospecific prey,
   conspecific prey and predators. Moreover, the results illustrate that
   the cues responsible for the full suite of behavioural and morphological
   defences are not induced by tadpole crushing nor can they be induced by
   generalized digestive chemicals produced when predators digest their
   prey. Instead, both prey damage and predator digestion of conspecific
   tissues appear to be important for communicating predatory risk to
   phenotypically plastic anuran prey. Importantly, the production of
   chemical cues by predators may be unavoidable and prey have evolved the
   ability to eavesdrop on these signals.}},

Abstract = {{Successful invasions are attributed to a combination of adaptations to
   biotic and abiotic conditions and many studies have highlighted the role
   of biological traits of invaders in their success. Among the most useful
   traits for successful establishment in a new ecosystem are the size of
   the invader and its diet and feeding habits. During the last twenty
   years, Dikerogammarus villosus has been one of the most successful
   invaders of large European rivers and lakes. However, regarding feeding
   habits, results were confusing and sometimes contradictory. In this
   study, we attempt to define the feeding strategy of D. villosus using
   their FA content according to sex and the seasonal and the spatial
   variation in its feeding habit. Our results indicated that D. villosus
   is rather unspecialized with plasticity in its feeding behaviour,
   switching between different functional feeding groups depending on
   seasons, habitats and available resources. The selection of high quality
   resources may hence provide a strong advantage during the invasion
   process by optimizing the growth and the reproduction of the invader.}},

Abstract = {{Mounting evidence indicates that the development of the fetus is heavily
   influenced by the intra-uterine milieu during pregnancy, and that such
   influence may have life-long consequences for the individual. The
   intra-uterine milieu is not only influenced by nutritional factors, but
   also by maternal endocrine and autonomic activity. Such activity is
   prone to be affected by an individual's personality, but only little is
   known about influences of maternal personality on the development of the
   fetus. We tested pregnant women for their propensity for impulsive,
   uncontrollable outbursts of temper (referred to here as moderate
   Intermittent Explosive Disorder, mIED). After the women gave birth, we
   measured electrocardiograms (ECGs) from their newborn infants to compare
   ECGs between newborns of women with and without mIED. The data show that
   infants of women with mIED have larger QRS complexes in the
   electrocardiogram, and lower heart rate variability, compared to infants
   of women without mIED. These results reveal effects of maternal mIED on
   the fetal heart development. These effects may predispose the individual

Abstract = {{The present study was designed to examine possible anxiolytic profile of
   aqueous fruit extracts of a medicinal plant Sea buckthorn (Hippophae
   rhamnoides L. spp. Turkestanica) in experimental animal models. Sea
   buckthorn (SBT) is a very potent medicinal and multipurpose plant which
   has gained global significance due to its biochemical and nutritional
   utility in folk medicine. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine with CNS
   depressant properties and a sedative-hypnotic drug traditionally used to
   treat anxiety. Animal models for anxiety-related behavior are based on
   the assumption that anxiety in animals is comparable to anxiety in
   humans. To unravel neurobiological mechanisms underlying normal anxiety
   as well as its pathological variations, animal models are indispensable
   tools. In this investigation rats were treated with the aqueous fruit
   extracts of Sea buckthorn (SBT-FE) (20 and 40 mg/kg P.O.) and diazepam
   at doses of 3.0mg/kg I.P. 1 hr before introducing the groups of animals
   to various experimental models of anxiety. Anti anxiety activity was
   evaluated using elevated plus maze (EPM), light-dark model (LDM) and
   open field test (OFT). Results revealed that in elevated plus maze,
   treatment with aqueous extracts of SBT-FE increased the time spent in
   open arm and total locomotion time in aversive environment. In
   light-dark model treatment with these extracts showed significant
   (p<0.01) increases in time spent in lit-box and in open field test
   treatment with SBT-FE exhibited significant increases in the exploratory
   activity and latency time as compared to controls. The results indicate
   that aqueous SBT-FE is an effective anxiolytic agent and could be useful
   in primary medical care.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological impacts of vehicle traffic are a significant environmental
   management issue on many sandy shores. Impacts usually focus on lethal
   effects of vehicles to organisms, but sub-lethal effects which could
   reduce the fitness of macrofauna populations are equally possible but
   unknown. Consequently, we measured changes in body condition and
   burrowing performance of the beach clam Donax deltoides subjected to
   vehicle traffic on sandy shores in eastern Australia, Body mass index of
   clams on beaches open to traffic was 16\% lower, but gonadosomatic index
   and relative valve thickness were not consistently linked to vehicle
   access to beaches. By contrast, off-road vehicles significantly impaired
   the burrowing performance of clams. After experimental exposure to ORV
   traffic (30 passes) and dislodgement from the sediment, the time taken
   for clams to re-bury into the sand doubled irrespective of the vehicle
   weight used. Because burrowing is such a critical function in the
   behavioural repertoire of sandy beach animals, the traffic-induced
   changes to organisms' performance found in this study may increase
   mortality by causing displacement to less favourable habitats by swash,
   and by intensifying the risk of predation and desiccation. When
   assessing the ecological impacts of vehicles on beach fauna, it is thus
   important to consider both lethal and sub-lethal effects. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{The identification of differentially regulated proteins in animal models
   of psychiatric diseases is essential for a comprehensive analysis of
   associated psychopathological processes. Mass spectrometry is the most
   relevant method for analyzing differences in protein expression of
   tissue and body fluid proteomes. However, standardization of sample
   handling and sample-to-sample variability are problematic. Stable
   isotope metabolic labeling of a proteome represents the gold standard
   for quantitative mass spectrometry analysis. The simultaneous processing
   of a mixture of labeled and unlabeled samples allows a sensitive and
   accurate comparative analysis between the respective proteomes. Here, we
   describe a cost-effective feeding protocol based on a newly developed
   N-15 bacteria diet based on Ralstonia eutropha protein, which was
   applied to a mouse model for trait anxiety. Tissue from N-15-labeled vs.
   N-14-unlabeled mice was examined by mass spectrometry and differences in
   the expression of glyoxalase-1 (GLO1) and histidine triad nucleotide
   binding protein 2 (Hint2) proteins were correlated with the animals'
   psychopathological behaviors for methodological validation and proof of
   concept, respectively. Additionally, phenotyping unraveled an
   antidepressant-like effect of the incorporation of the stable isotope
   N-15 into the proteome of highly anxious mice. This novel phenomenon is
   of considerable relevance to the metabolic labeling method and could
   provide an opportunity for the discovery of candidate proteins involved

Abstract = {{Intraspecific latitudinal clines in the body size of terrestrial
   vertebrates, where members of the same species are larger at higher

   in the body size of eight passerine bird species from south-eastern
   Australia over approximately the last 100 years. Four species showed
   significant decreases in body size (1.8-3.6\% of wing length) and a
   shift in latitudinal cline over that period, and a meta-analysis
   demonstrated a consistent trend across all eight species. Southern
   high-latitude populations now display the body sizes typical of more
   northern populations pre-1950, equivalent to a 78 shift in latitude.
   Using ptilochronology, we found no evidence that these morphological
   changes were a plastic response to changes in nutrition, a likely

Abstract = {{Variation in antipredation behavior should translate into variation in

   decrease the likelihood that an individual is attacked and should

   escape on attack. Escape behaviors become important if animals cannot
   avoid attack. We investigated the relative effects of avoidance and
   escape enhancing behaviors on the survival of juvenile redshanks, Tringa

   the primary behavioral correlate of survival, but when forced, by
   starvation risk, into areas where risk of attack is much higher,
   behaviors that reduce risk of capture once attacked should also promote
   survival. We found that reducing exposure to attack was most important
   for increasing survival and that increased vigilance and foraging
   success rate only increased survival for individuals that spent more
   time in high-risk areas. Use of the high-risk area and survival varied
   between years, suggesting that variation in starvation risk (i.e.,

Abstract = {{The food available to coccinellid larvae and their exposure to predation
   is influenced by where they are placed as eggs. This review examines
   adult distribution and female oviposition strategies which in turn
   determine the distribution of coccinellid larvae in habitats.
   Immigration into a habitat can be influenced by visual and olfactory
   cues related to habitat quality. Adults are retained in a habitat if
   sufficient food resources are present. The abundance and quality of food
   in a habitat affects the reproductive output of a female and survival of
   larvae. Consequently. there is higher retention and oviposition
   preference for sites with abundant essential prey. Coccinellids also
   increase reproduction in response to non-prey foods (i.e., pollen), but
   avoid ovipositing in areas with copious amounts of honeydew. In
   laboratory studies, many plant-derived chemicals have been demonstrated
   to be attractants and oviposition stimulants. The need to place eggs in
   proximity to food for offspring must be weighed against the risk of
   cannibalism and intraguild predation. Lady beetles avoid egg predation
   by reducing oviposition where other adults are present, ovipositing on
   plants associated with less exposure or incidence of intraguild
   predation, and avoiding areas with tracks and frass of con- and
   heterospecific larvae. Indeed, deterrent cues for avoiding predation
   seem stronger than the positive ones associated with food. An
   understanding of the resources needed for successful reproduction and
   larval development in a habitat and the sensory cues that signal these
   resources, and thus elicit oviposition, may enhance our understanding of
   the underlying mechanisms affecting coccinellid distribution in
   habitats. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Differences in bold and shy personality on sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax
   were investigated between a population (wild) produced from wild-brood
   fish and a population (selected) produced from selected-brood fish.
   During the experiment (112 days), fish were reared under self-feeding
   condition to characterize the feeding behaviour of each individual fish.
   Three risk-taking tests (T1, T2 and T3 of 24 h with day-night
   alternation) were carried out at > 1 month intervals on 180 fish of each
   strain in order to monitor D. labrax behaviour over time and in relation
   to the light:dark period. A risk-taking score was evaluated via a
   preference choice between a safe zone (without food) and a risky zone
   (potentially with food) by recording the number and the duration of
   individual passages through an opening in an opaque divider. Results
   showed that fish performed passages preferentially during the night
   period and that wild fish were generally bolder than selected fish
   during T1 and T2 but showed a decrease in risk taking during T3,
   contrary to selected fish which showed a constant increase in their
   risk-taking behaviour. The phenotypic characteristics of the bold fish
   were different in the two strains: wild bold fish were the smallest
   within the wild strain and selected bold fish presented the higher
   growth rate within the selected strain. For both strains, these bold
   fish were also generally characterized by a high feed-demand activity.
   Fish hunger state thus seemed to be the highest motivation for
   risk-taking behaviour under the present conditions. Furthermore,
   behavioural variations over tests such as higher risk taking (number of
   passages) and faster exploratory responses (higher score emergence)
   could be interpreted as relevant indicators of the learning process and
   habituation. According to the results, however, no real difference in
   coping strategy between strains could be observed at this first stage of
   domestication and selection.}},

Abstract = {{Zooplankton accumulate several groups of photoprotective compounds to
   shield against damaging ultraviolet radiation (UV). One of these groups,
   the carotenoids, makes the animals more conspicuous to visually hunting
   predators, whereas others, such as the mycosporine-like amino acids
   (MAAs) may not. The blend of photoprotective compounds is therefore
   important for the UV defense but also for the ability to escape
   predation through crypsis. Here we assess laboratory and field data from
   different latitudes to examine how UV, predation threat, and pigment
   availability ( in food) affects the mixture of UV-protective compounds
   in copepods. Overall, the blend of MAAs and carotenoids was partly
   explained by the availability of MAAs in the food, the UV-threat, and
   the presence of predators. Copepods upregulated their MAA content when
   UV threat was increasing (i.e., if MAAs were abundant in food), and in
   field data this accumulation only occurred at high levels of predation
   threat. If MAAs were scarce, copepods instead compensated with higher
   carotenoid accumulation. However, when there was a high predation threat
   this carotenoid compensatory effect was disadvantageous, and low
   concentrations of both MAAs and carotenoids at high UV-threat resulted
   in lower reproduction. In all, these results showed that carotenoids and
   MAAs are complementary substances, i.e., one is high when the other is
   low, and copepods are, hence, able to adjust their blend of different
   UV-protective compounds to optimize their defenses to the threats of UV
   and predation. These defense systems may buffer against direct food-web
   interactions and help the zooplankton to survive in environments with
   high UV threat.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of diet on longevity are complex because acquired resources are
   shared among growth, reproduction and somatic maintenance. We simplify
   these axes by examining how dietary restriction and competitive contexts
   affect longevity using semelparous males of the Australian redback
   spider (Latrodectus hasselti). Plastic development of L. hasselti males
   results in trade-offs of body condition against faster development if
   females are present, facilitating scramble competition. In the absence
   of females, males develop slowly as high body condition adults, and are
   better equipped for mate searching. Here we focus on effects of diet and
   competitive context on body condition and longevity. Although male
   survival depended on body condition and exercise, contrary to studies in
   a wide range of taxa, dietary restriction did not increase longevity.
   However, there was an interactive effect of diet and competitive context
   on lifespan, because high-diet males reared in the absence of females
   lived longer than males reared in the presence of females. Thus males
   near females pay a survival cost of developing rapidly. This shows that
   life-history trade-offs affected by competitive context can impose
   longevity costs independent of the direct energy expenditure of
   searching, courtship, competition or reproduction.}},

Title = {{The NOURISH randomised control trial: Positive feeding practices and
   food preferences in early childhood - a primary prevention program for
   childhood obesity}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Primary prevention of childhood overweight is an
   international priority. In Australia 20-25\% of 2-8 year olds are
   already overweight. These children are at substantially increased the
   risk of becoming overweight adults, with attendant increased risk of
   morbidity and mortality. Early feeding practices determine infant
   exposure to food (type, amount, frequency) and include responses (eg
   coercion) to infant feeding behaviour (eg. food refusal). There is
   correlational evidence linking parenting style and early feeding
   practices to child eating behaviour and weight status. A focus on early
   feeding is consistent with the national focus on early childhood as the
   foundation for life-long health and well being. The NOURISH trial aims
   to implement and evaluate a community-based intervention to promote
   early feeding practices that will foster healthy food preferences and
   intake and preserve the innate capacity to self-regulate food intake in
   young children.
   Methods/Design: This randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to recruit
   820 first-time mothers and their healthy term infants. A consecutive
   sample of eligible mothers will be approached postnatally at major
   maternity hospitals in Brisbane and Adelaide. Initial consent will be
   for re-contact for full enrolment when the infants are 4-7 months old.
   Individual mother-infant dyads will be randomised to usual care or the
   intervention. The intervention will provide anticipatory guidance via
   two modules of six fortnightly parent education and peer support group
   sessions, each followed by six months of regular maintenance contact.
   The modules will commence when the infants are aged 4-7 and 13-16 months
   to coincide with establishment of solid feeding, and autonomy and
   independence, respectively. Outcome measures will be assessed at
   baseline, with follow up at nine and 18 months. These will include
   infant intake (type and amount of foods), food preferences, feeding
   behaviour and growth and self-reported maternal feeding practices and
   parenting practices and efficacy. Covariates will include
   sociodemographics, infant feeding mode and temperament, maternal weight
   status and weight concern and child care exposure.
   Discussion: Despite the strong rationale to focus on parents' early
   feeding practices as a key determinant of child food preferences, intake
   and self-regulatory capacity, prospective longitudinal and intervention
   studies are rare. This trial will be amongst to provide Level II
   evidence regarding the impact of an intervention (commencing prior to
   age 12 months) on children's eating patterns and behaviours.

Abstract = {{The increase in the incidence of obesity and eating disorders has
   promoted research aimed at understanding the aetiology of abnormal
   eating behaviours. Apart from metabolic factors, obesity is caused by
   overeating. Clinical reports have led to the suggestion that some
   individuals may develop addictive-like behaviours when consuming
   palatable foods, and compulsive eating plays a similar dominant role in
   obesity as compulsive drug taking does in drug addiction. The progress
   made in the development of treatment strategies for obesity is limited,
   in part, because the physiological and neurological causes and
   consequences of compulsive eating behaviour are not clearly understood
   and cannot readily be studied in human subjects. We have developed
   experimental approaches that reflect the functioning of the components
   of eating control, including compulsive food taking in rats. Rats that
   are given free choice between standard chow and a palatable,
   chocolate-containing `Cafeteria Diet' (CD) develop distinct signs of
   compulsive food taking that appear at an early stage. These include the
   inability to adapt intake behaviour in periods of limited or
   bitter-tasting CD access, continued food intake during resting phases
   and changes in fine structure of feeding (duration, distribution and
   recurrence of feeding bouts). The model will help examine the
   neurobiological underpinnings of compulsive food seeking and food taking
   and provides a possibility to study the effects of novel anti-obesity
   compounds on compulsive eating and other components of food-taking
   behaviour in detail. For future use of genetic models, the possibility
   of a transfer to a mouse was discussed.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The last decade has seen the emergence of two new developments in
   behavioural ecology: the discovery of animal personalities and a new
   approach to the analyses of animal behaviour, biological markets.
   Although both regard individual differences in behaviour as adaptive in
   their own right these two developments appear, at first glance, to be
   opposing approaches to analysing animal behaviour. Personalities consist
   of suites of behaviours that are correlated across situations (e.g. some
   animals are consistently more or less aggressive across situations than
   other animals) and assumes that animals are limited in their response to
   their environment. By contrast, the biological market approach considers
   organisms as traders of commodities (e.g. food or grooming) where the
   exchange rates of commodities changes with time and is influenced by
   shifts in the abundance and demand for the commodity, as happens in
   human markets. Biological markets thus view animal behaviour as
   extremely plastic whereas the putative existence of animal personalities
   suggests that animal behaviour may be relatively inflexible. However,
   the two approaches maybe more similar than heretofore realized and may
   be complementary rather than opposing. Here I briefly review each
   approach and show how animal personalities can arise from a biological
   market situation.}},

Abstract = {{This report presents the results of a systematic review of the
   effectiveness of worksite nutrition and physical activity programs to
   promote healthy weight among employees. These results form the basis for
   the recommendation by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services on
   the use of these interventions. Weight-related outcomes, including
   weight in pounds or kilograms, BMI, and percentage body fat were used to
   assess effectiveness of these programs.
   This review found that worksite nutrition and physical activity programs
   achieve modest improvements in employee weight status at the 6-12-month
   follow-up. A pooled effect estimate of -2.8 pounds (95\% CI=-4.6, -1.0)
   was found based on nine RCTs, and a decrease in BMI of -0.5 (95\%
   CI=-0.8, -0.2) was found based on six RCTs. The findings appear to be
   applicable to both male and female employees, across a range of worksite
   settings.
   Most of the studies combined informational and behavioral strategies to
   influence diet and physical activity; fewer studies modified the work
   environment (e.g., cafeteria, exercise facilities) to promote healthy
   choices. Information about other effects, barriers to implementation,
   cost and cost effectiveness of interventions, and research gaps are also
   presented in this article. The findings of this systematic review can
   help inform decisions of employers, planners, researchers, and other

Abstract = {{Dog diets may differ in their effectiveness of maintaining satiety after
   a meal. Consequently, sensations of hunger, feeding motivation, physical
   activity, and sensitivity to environmental stressors; may be increased.
   Dietary fibre may be effective in prolonging postprandial satiety
   depending on type and inclusion level. This study evaluated the effect
   of fibre fermentability on behaviour in dogs. Sixteen healthy adult dogs
   were housed individually and fed a low-fermentable fibre (LFF) diet
   containing 8.5\% cellulose or a high-fermentable fibre (HFF) diet
   containing 8.5\% sugar beet pulp and 2\% inulin. Dogs were fed two equal
   portions at 8:30 and 18:30 according to energy requirements. Behaviour
   of dogs in their home-cage was recorded and analyzed by instantaneous
   scan sampling (2 x 24 h with 15 min intervals) and focal sampling
   continuous recordings (10 min per animal per hour, from 9:00 until
   18:00). Dogs were subjected to a behaviour test composed of the subtests
   open-field, sudden-silence, novel-object, and acoustic-startle. The
   behavioural responses of each dog were recorded. Scores for the scan and
   focal samples were expressed per clock hour and DIET x TIME effects were
   tested statistically using Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML). Data from
   the tests were examined using principal component analysis resulting in
   the compilation of two components. Data were tested statistically for
   DIET and DIET x SUBTEST effects using REML. Variables specific for the
   open-field and novel-object test were analyzed using analysis of
   variance. For the scans, a significant DIET x TIME effect was found for
   resting. At night and in the morning, HFF dogs rested more compared to
   LIFF dogs, but they rested less between 14:00 and 17:00. For the
   continuous recordings, the main findings were a tendency for DIET x TIME
   effect for time spent resting with a pattern consistent with that for
   the scans. The interaction was significant for inactive-alert (lie with
   head up or sitting) with HFF-fed dogs having lower values around
   10:00-11:00 and higher values hereafter. Finally, time spent tail
   wagging was significantly higher for LFF-fed dogs just before the
   evening meal that may indicate higher level of arousal. For the
   behaviour tests, no significant DIET or DIET x SUBTEST effects were
   detected. It is concluded that compared to the LFF diet, the HFF diet
   increased inactivity in kennelled beagle dogs likely through the
   prolongation of postprandial satiety. This effect did not change the
   reaction to stressful events in kennelled laboratory dogs. Enhanced
   susceptibility to environmental stressors at times of hunger in
   sensitive companion dogs may occur but requires further study. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Animal prey has developed a variety of behavioural strategies to avoid
   predation. Many fish species form shoals in the open water or seek
   refuge in structurally complex habitats. Since anti-predator strategies
   bear costs and are energy-demanding, we hypothesised that the
   nutritional state of prey should modify the performance level and
   efficiency of such strategies. In aquaria either containing or lacking a
   structured refuge habitat, well-fed or food-deprived juvenile roach
   (Rutilus rutilus) were exposed to an open-water predator (pikeperch,
   Sander lucioperca). Controls were run without predators. In the presence
   of the predator, roach enhanced the performance of the anti-predator
   strategy and increased the use of the refuge habitat whereby
   food-deprived roach were encountered more often in the structure than
   well-fed roach. Nonetheless more starved than well-fed roach were fed
   upon by the predator. In the treatments offering only open-water areas,
   roach always formed dense shoals in the presence of the predator. The
   shoal density, however, was lower in starved roach. Starving fish in
   shoals experienced the highest predation mortality across all
   experimental treatments. The experiment confirmed the plasticity of the
   anti-predator behaviour in roach and demonstrated that food deprivation
   diminished the efficiency of shoaling more strongly than the efficiency
   of hiding. The findings may be relevant to spatial distribution of prey
   and predator-prey interactions under natural conditions because when
   prey are confronted with phases of reduced resource availability,
   flexible anti-predator strategies may lead to dynamic habitat use
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of fetal programming states that changes in the fetal
   environment during sensitive periods of organ development may cause
   long-lasting changes in the structure and functioning of these organs
   later in life and influence the risk for chronic diseases such as
   coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Fetal growth is a summary
   marker of the fetal environment and is reflected by relatively
   easy-to-obtain measures of size at birth such as birth weight. In the
   last two decades, a body of evidence emerged linking fetal growth with
   behavioural and mental health outcomes later in life. Cognitive
   functioning and behavioural problems in childhood, in particular
   inattention/hyperactivity, have been shown to be inversely related to
   fetal growth. Although results are mixed, risk for personality disorders
   and schizophrenia seems to be linked with fetal growth and adversity,
   while the evidence for mood disorders is weak. Vulnerability for
   psychopathology may also be influenced by prenatal adversity. There is
   evidence for associations of fetal growth with temperament in childhood
   as well as stress reactivity and distress. The associations of fetal
   growth with mental health later in life are potentially caused by
   specific prenatal factors such as maternal smoking, alcohol,
   toxins/drugs, nutrition, psychosocial stress and infection during
   pregnancy. The mechanisms likely involve changes in neurodevelopment and
   in the set point of neuroendocrine systems, and there is evidence that
   prenatal adversity interacts with genetic and postnatal environmental
   factors. Future studies should examine the effects of specific prenatal
   factors and attempt to disentangle genetic and prenatal environmental

Abstract = {{Sleep disorders cause cognitive dysfunction in which impaired neuronal

   maintaining metabolic homeostasis and neuronal plasticity, this study is
   aimed to determine whether melatonin exerts beneficial effects on
   preserving SIRT1 activation following total sleep deprivation (TSD). TSD
   was performed by disc on water method for five consecutive days. During
   this period, animals daily received melatonin at doses of 5, 25, 50 or

   immunohistochemistry together with Morris water maze learning test were
   performed to examine the metabolic, neurochemical, as well as the
   behavioral changes in neuronal plasticity, respectively. The results
   indicate that in normal rats, numerous COX and SIRT1 positive-labeled
   neurons with strong staining intensities were found in hippocampal
   pyramidal and granular cell layers. Following TSD, both COX and SIRT1
   reactivities were drastically decreased as revealed by reduced staining
   pattern and labeling frequency. Behavioral data corresponded well with
   morphological findings in which spatial memory test in water maze was
   significantly impaired after TSD. However, in rats receiving different
   doses of melatonin, both COX and SIRT1 expressions were successfully
   preserved. Considerably better performance on behavioral testing further
   strengthened the beneficial effects of melatonin. These findings suggest
   that melatonin may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy directed for
   preventing the memory deficits resulting from TSD, possibly by
   effectively preserving the metabolic function and neuronal plasticity
   engaged in maintaining cognitive activity.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Previous research has shown that youth who are homeless engage in
   high-risk behaviors. However, there has been little information
   published on nutritional and physical activity behaviors in this
   population, and studies comparing homeless youth in school with their
   non-homeless peers are scarce. This study compares weight-related risk
   behaviors of public high school students in Massachusetts based on
   homeless status.
   METHODS
   We obtained data from 3264 9th through 12th grade students who
   participated in the 2005 Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Survey.
   Multivariable logistic regression, controlling for gender, grade,
   race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation, was performed to assess the
   relationship between homeless status as defined by the McKinney-Vento
   Homeless Assistance Act and weight-related indicators. Analyses were
   weighted and adjusted for the multistage complex sampling design.
   RESULTS
   Of this sample, 4.2\% reported being homeless (n = 152). Higher
   prevalence of homelessness was found among males, racial/ethnic
   minorities, sexual minorities, and students who were not in a
   traditional grade level. The distribution of body mass index was similar
   among students who were homeless and non-homeless (underweight 4.0 and
   3.0\%, and overweight 27.1 and 27.1\%, respectively). Homeless students
   were more likely than non-homeless students to report disordered
   weight-control behaviors including fasting (aOR 2.5, 95\% CI 1.4-4.5)
   and diet pill use (aOR 3.3, 95\% CI 1.6-6.9).
   CONCLUSIONS
   More than 4\% of public high school students in Massachusetts meet the
   federal definition of homelessness. These students are at high risk for
   disordered weight-control behaviors. Policy decisions at the school,
   state, and federal levels should make a concerted effort to target these
   students with social services and nutritional interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral changes of animal species can influence the consequence of
   population dynamics. One of the most remarkable behaviors of animal
   species is the aggregation by which species can reduce predation risk as
   a consequence of dilution or the other effects by forming a group.
   Empirical studies have demonstrated that an incompatibility exists in
   aggregation sincere source competition might become severe at the cost
   of reducing predation pressure from predatory species. Parental care by
   supplying the food consumed by adults to their juveniles would reduce
   the mortality of juvenile due to starvation, but it would reduce the
   reproduction rate at the same time. In this paper, we study a class of
   stage structured resource-consumer models to investigate the effect of
   behavioral changes on population dynamics. It is shown that under the
   presence of trade-off in parental care, moderate degrees of parental
   care will be favored as maximizing the equilibrium density of consumers.
   For consumer species having a long maturation period, consumer species
   might get benefit from dilution effects as a result of aggregation
   despite the elevated resource competition. Aggregation gives rise to two
   different outcomes in consumer extinction. Resource exhaustion as a
   consequence of over-exploitation can induce extinction of consumers due
   to Allee effects if aggregation strongly mediates juvenile survival. (C)

Abstract = {{The costs and benefits of anti-predator behavioral responses should be
   functions of the actual risk of predation, the availability of the
   prey's resources, and the physiological state of the prey. For example,
   a food-stressed individual risks starvation when hiding from predators,
   while a well-fed organism can better afford to hide (and pay the cost of
   not foraging). Similarly, the benefits of resource acquisition are
   probably highest for the prey in the poorest state, while there may be
   diminishing returns for prey nearing satiation. Empirical studies of
   state-dependent behavior are only beginning, however, and few studies
   have investigated interactions between all three potentially important
   factors. Here I present the results of a laboratory experiment where I
   manipulated the physiological state of pond snails (Physa gyrina), the
   abundance of algal resources, and predation cues (Belostoma flumineum
   waterbugs consuming snails) in a full factorial design to assess their
   direct effects on snail behavior and indirect effects on algal biomass.
   On average, snails foraged more when resources were abundant, and when
   predators were absent. Snails also foraged more when previously exposed
   to physiological stress. Snails spent more time at the water's surface
   (a refuging behavior) in the presence of predation cues on average, but
   predation, resource levels, and prey state had interactive effects on
   refuge use. There was a consistent positive trait-mediated indirect
   effect of predators on algal biomass, across all resource levels and
   prey states. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{How individuals balance time spent satisfying nutritional needs and time
   spent being vigilant to protect against potential predation has received
   abundant attention from researchers. Evidence indicates that both social
   conditions and predator risk affect how individuals perceive
   environmental threat, however, the relative influence of each type of
   risk remains unclear. The risk allocation hypothesis considers how
   individuals respond to predation risk over time by adapting their
   investment in high-quality or low-quality vigilance. Here we use the
   risk allocation hypothesis as a guide to examine how different risk
   factors influence vigilance quantity and quality in Cape ground
   squirrels, Xerus inauris. We tested how the social conditions of age,
   sex, distance to a safe refuge, distance from a nearest neighbour and
   predator risk affect the amount of time ( quantity) individuals spend
   vigilant. Individuals were more vigilant in areas with more potential
   predators and when they were further from a safe refuge or nearest
   neighbour. We then tested whether these risk factors that affected
   vigilance quantity also affected vigilance quality by measuring
   exclusive vigilance (high-cost, high-quality) and
   shared-foraging-vigilance (low-cost, low-quality). Individuals in
   high-predation risk areas invested more time in high-cost vigilance
   behaviour than in low-cost vigilance/foraging behaviour compared with
   individuals in low-predation risk areas. Since squirrels invested in
   high-cost vigilance significantly more than in low-cost vigilance
   regardless of distance to a refuge or other squirrels, we suggest that
   combined foraging with vigilance compromises vigilance to lower its
   quality. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{The effects of inducible defenses and constitutive defenses on
   population dynamics were investigated in a freshwater plankton system
   with rotifers as predators and different algal strains as prey. We made
   predictions for these systems using a chemostat predator-prey model and
   focused on population stability and predator persistence as a function
   of flow-through rate. The model exhibits three major types of behavior
   at a high nutrient concentration: (1) at high dilution rates, only algae
   exist; (2) at intermediate dilution rates, algae and rotifers show
   stable coexistence; (3) at low dilution rates, large population
   fluctuations occur, with low minimum densities entailing a risk of
   stochastic rotifer extinctions. The size and location of the
   corresponding areas in parameter space critically depend on the type of
   algal defense strategy. In an 83-day high-nutrient chemostat experiment
   we changed the dilution rate every 3 weeks, from 0.7 to 0.5 to 0.3 to
   0.1 per day. Within this range of dilution rates, rotifers and algae
   coexisted, and population fluctuations of algae clearly increased as
   dilution rates decreased. The CV of herbivore densities was highest at
   the end of the experiment, when the dilution rate was low. On day 80,
   herbivorous rotifers had become undetectable in all three chemostats
   with permanently defended algae (where rotifer densities had already
   been low) and in two out of three chemostats where rotifers had been
   feeding on algae with inducible defenses (that represented more edible
   food). We interpret our results in relation to the paradox of
   enrichment.}},

Abstract = {{There is some agreement in the food policy literature in that inception
   of genetic modification (GM) techniques in food production conveys both
   opportunities and risks which are found to differ across heterogeneous
   populations, which calls for a better understanding of behavioural
   responses to risk and benefit information. one of the major limitations
   of previous behavioural research lies in taking into account food values
   and trust in information sources in a way that causality is accounted
   for. This paper contributes to the literature by examining the
   behavioural process that drives individual's perceptions of GM food
   taking advantage of an empirical choice methodology that corrects for
   endogeneity in decision making relationships, namely structural equation
   modelling. We report the results of an empirical application to
   conceptualise food decision making in three specific Mediterranean
   countries, namely Spain, Italy and Greece. Our first major finding
   indicates that public attitudes toward GM food are being formed from a
   reasoning mechanism that departs from trust in science and in public
   authorities, ultimately determining consumer's final purchasing
   decisions. Our second important finding suggests marked differences in
   the reasoning mechanism that lead to the acceptance of GM food in the
   three countries examined suggesting different food communication

Abstract = {{Despite the potential impact on prey fitness and predator-prey
   interactions, most studies of predation risk ignore physiological
   responses and their dependence upon food level and sex. Therefore, we
   reared male and female larvae of the damselfly Lestes viridis under
   predator stress (dragonfly larvae) at high and low food levels, and
   subsequently scored for important variables of insect immune defence
   (i.e. phenoloxidase) and antioxidant defence {[}i.e. superoxide
   dismutase, and catalase (CAT)]. Under predation risk, larvae did not
   decrease growth rate or immune defence, and only slightly reduced food
   intake in the high food treatment, probably because of time stress, i.e.
   little time available to complete the larval development. However,
   larvae facing predator stress did show an upregulation of antioxidant
   enzymes. This upregulation was dependent upon food level for CAT and
   both food level and sex for SOD, consistent with energetic constraints
   and sex differences in the link between longevity and adult fitness. Our
   results illustrate that predator stress can influence life history,
   behavioural and physiological responses differentially and in a
   context-dependent way. This implies that non-consumptive physiological
   effects of predators on their prey show independent yet similar
   complexities in behavioural and life history response variables. In
   general, our results advocate that mechanistic studies on predator-prey
   interactions may benefit from including physiological variables.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of metabolic rate-temperature (MR-T) reaction norms is of
   fundamental importance to physiological ecology. Metabolic cold
   adaptation (MCA) predicts that populations or species from cooler
   environments will have either a higher metabolic rate at a common
   temperature or steeper MR-T relationships, indicating greater
   sensitivity of respiratory metabolism to temperature. Support for MCA
   has been found in some insect species by comparing species or
   populations differing in latitude. However, the generality of these
   findings are contentious, with most studies either unable to account for
   phenotypic plasticity or the evolutionary relatedness of species or
   populations. Hence, the importance of MCA is vigorously debated from
   both evolutionary and ecological perspectives. Furthermore, few species,
   particularly from tropical environments, have been shown to differ in
   MR-T sensitivity along altitudinal temperature gradients. Here, using
   four populations of tsetse flies (Glossina pallidipes, Diptera:
   Glossinidae) from thermally distinct geographic regions, we test the
   hypothesis that there is evolved variation in MR-T relationships to cold
   climates. We found that a high-altitude equatorial population from a
   cool habitat has a steeper MR-T reaction norm. By contrast, other
   populations from warmer environments in East Africa do not differ with
   respect to their MR-T reaction norms. Squared-change parsimony analyses,
   based on the combined mitochondrial 16S rDNA ribosomal subunit and
   cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), support the hypothesis of adaptive
   differentiation of MR-T reaction norms in the cool-climate population.
   Seasonal adjustments or laboratory-temperature-induced phenotypic
   plasticity changed the intercept of the reaction norm rather than the
   slope, and thus the observed intraspecific variation in slopes of MR-T
   reaction norms could not be accounted for by phenotypic plasticity.
   These results therefore suggest evolutionary adaptation of MR-T reaction
   norms to cool climates (<22 degrees C) in tsetse and provide novel
   support for MCA within an insect species.}},

   two measures of anxiety-like behaviour: the open field and the elevated

   responses in the open field test, characterised by more time spent in
   the aversive central zone and a higher frequency of central and middle

   higher ratio of open compared to total arm entries relative to the

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Prospective studies linking infant temperament, or
   behavioral style, to infant body composition are lacking. In this
   longitudinal study (3 to 18 months), we seek to examine the associations
   between two dimensions of infant temperament (distress to limitations
   and activity level) and two anthropometric indicators (weight-for-length
   z-scores (WLZ) and skin fold (SF) measures) in a population at high risk
   of overweight.
   Methods: Data are from the Infant Care and Risk of Obesity Project, a
   longitudinal study of North Carolina low income African American
   mother-infant dyads (n = 206). Two temperament dimensions were assessed
   using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised. A high distress to
   limitations score denotes an infant whose mother perceives that s/he
   often cries or fusses, and a high activity level score one who moves
   his/her limbs and squirms frequently. Cross-sectional analyses were
   conducted using ordinary least squares regression. Fixed effects
   longitudinal models were used to estimate anthropometric outcomes as a
   function of time varying infant temperament.
   Results: In longitudinal models, increased activity levels were
   associated with later decreased fatness and WLZ. In contrast, high
   levels of distress to limitations were associated with later increased
   fatness at all time points and later increased WLZ at 12 months.
   Conclusion: Infant temperament dimensions contribute to our
   understanding of the role of behavior in the development of the risk of
   overweight in the formative months of life. Identification of modifiable
   risk factors early in life may help target strategies for establishing
   healthy lifestyles prior to the onset of overweight.}},

Abstract = {{Vigilance in animals decreases with group size in many species of birds
   and mammals, but the effect of group size can be confounded by several
   ecological factors, most notably food density. Given that large groups
   often aggregate in areas of higher food density and that vigilance may
   be reduced when animals feed more, the group-size effect of vigilance
   may be confounded by the direct effect of food density on vigilance. In
   this paper, I examine the theoretical expectations regarding the effect
   of food density on vigilance and review the available empirical
   evidence. Two bodies of theory predict either no relationship or a
   negative relationship between vigilance and food density, but none has
   been tested explicitly. The empirical support for a negative
   relationship is mixed given that many studies actually document a
   positive correlation between vigilance and food density. I review the
   factors modulating the effect of food density on vigilance and show that
   there are several reasons to believe that the case against a confounding
   effect of food density is not as strong as expected. In fact, food
   density can actually mask the expected decrease in vigilance with group
   size. A statement about the magnitude of the group-size effect on
   vigilance will require an assessment of the role of food density as well
   as the many factors reviewed here that modulate the effect of food
   density on vigilance in birds and mammals. (C) 2009 The Association for

Abstract = {{Socially influenced learning is important because it can drive the
   spread of novel behaviours among individuals within and between
   generations. While work on a few vertebrates suggests the conditions
   favouring the use of social over individual learning, we know little
   about the evolution of social learning. As a part of an ongoing
   examination of the evolutionary roots of social learning in insects, we
   tested for social learning in locusts, Locusta migratoria. Locusts
   showed rapid individual learning, preferring a diet they ate for a
   single meal of only 20 min over another diet of equal nutritional
   quality. Locusts, however, did not show stronger preference for novel
   food that they had previously consumed while in the presence of a
   conspecific experienced with that food. Furthermore, focal locusts did
   not learn about novel food from (1) experienced conspecifics that were
   observable through a screen, (2) interactions with conspecifics that had
   previously fed on and gave off odours from novel food and (3)
   cannibalizing conspecifics that had recently fed on novel food. Whereas
   our results extend previous work indicating excellent individual
   learning in locusts, they provide no evidence for socially influenced
   learning in a species that, in its gregarious form, has the opportunity
   for social learning and could benefit from such an ability. (C) 2009 The

Abstract = {{One potential trade-off that bold individuals face is between increased
   predation risks and gains in resources. Individuals experiencing high
   predation and hungry individuals (or individuals with low body
   condition) are predicted to show increased boldness. We examined one
   behavioral trait previously reported to be associated with boldness (the
   time individual fish needed to emerge from shelter) in various
   populations of mollies (Poecilia spp.). Our study system included
   several southern Mexican surface streams with high piscine predation and
   high food availability, sulfidic surface streams with high avian
   predation, in which the inhabiting fish show reduced body condition, and
   a sulfidic cave, where predation and body condition are low. Our
   comparison revealed very short times to emerge from the start box in
   populations from non-sulfidic streams. In sulfidic habitats (whether
   surface or cave), it took individual Poecilia mexicana considerably
   longer to emerge from the start box, and the same difference was also
   found in an independent comparison between P. mexicana and the closely
   related, highly sulfide-adapted Poecilia sulphuraria. Fish reared under
   common garden conditions (in the absence of predators and hydrogen
   sulfide) showed intermediate boldness scores to the extremes observed in
   the field. Our data thus indicate that (a) boldness is shaped by
   environmental conditions/experiential effects, but is not heritable, (b)
   predation affects boldness in the predicted direction, but (c) low body
   condition leads to reduced boldness. Extremophile Poecilia spp. spend
   most of their time surfacing to survive under sulfidic and hypoxic
   conditions, which exposes them to increased levels of predations, but
   the fish forage on the bottom. Hence, in this system, increased boldness
   does not increase foraging success. We argue that energy limitation
   favors reducing energetically costly behaviors, and exploring novel
   environments may be just one of them.}},

Abstract = {{Predators are increasingly recognized as key elements in food webs
   because of their ability to link the fluxes of nutrients and energy
   between spatially separated food chains. However, in the context of food
   web connectivity, predator populations have been mainly treated as
   homogeneous units, despite compelling evidence of individual
   specialization in resource use. It is conceivable that individuals of a
   predatory species use different resources associated with spatially
   separated food chains, thereby decoupling cross-habitat linkages. We
   tested whether intrapopulation differences in habitat use in the
   generalist freshwater predator Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) led to
   long-term niche partitioning and affected the degree of ecological
   habitat coupling. We evaluated trophic niche variability at successively
   larger timescales by analyzing gut contents and stable isotopes (delta
   C-13 and delta N-15) in liver and muscle, tissues that provide
   successively longer integration of trophic activity. We found that the
   use of distinct habitats in perch led to intrapopulation niche
   partitioning between pelagic and littoral subpopulations, consistent
   through the various timescales. Pelagic fish showed a narrower niche,
   lower individual specialization, and more stable trophic behavior than
   littoral fish, as could be expected from inhabiting a relatively less
   diverse environment. This result indicated that substantial niche
   reduction could occur in a generalist predator at the subpopulation
   level, consistent with the use of a habitat that provides fewer chances
   of individual specialization. We showed that intrapopulation niche
   partitioning limits the ability of individual predators to link
   spatially separated food chains. In addition, we suggest a quantitative,
   standardized approach based on stable isotopes to measure the degree of
   habitat coupling mediated by a top predator.}},

Abstract = {{An animal's level of vigilance depends on various environmental factors

   In addition, several individual traits may influence vigilance. We
   investigated the effects of body condition, social rank and the state of
   pregnancy on individual vigilance (scanning) rates in individually
   marked European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) of a field enclosure
   population. We found lower rates in young rabbits than in adult females,
   but male and female juveniles did not differ. Vigilance of juveniles was
   positively correlated with their age-dependent body mass (used as a
   measure of body condition), i.e. young rabbits with lower body condition
   scanned less. We suggest that juveniles with low body condition were
   trading off vigilance against feeding to maximise their growth. In
   contrast, there was no significant correlation between body mass and
   vigilance in adult females. Adult females increased scanning rates
   during late pregnancy, which might constitute a behavioural compensation
   because of their lower capacity to escape predator attacks. In addition,
   adult females with low social ranks scanned more than high ranking

Abstract = {{Pond-drying is a model for understanding the causes of life history
   variation in metamorphic organisms. However, we know relatively little
   about how interactions among specific proximate cues of pond-drying
   affect juvenile life history, how those responses might be mitigated by
   diet, and the post-metamorphic consequences for adult fitness. I
   manipulated larval diet, water depth, and water temperature during the
   aquatic larval stage of a temporary pond-dwelling caddisfly, Limnephilus
   indivisus. I predicted that shallow depths and warm temperatures (depth
   x temperature) associated with pond-drying would have negative effects
   on larval survival, growth, development, adult size, female fecundity,
   and adult longevity, but that supplementation of the larval diet should
   mitigate the trade-off between juvenile growth and pre-reproductive
   mortality risk by ameliorating the negative effects of pond-drying (diet
   x depth, diet x temperature) on these traits. Larval survival was
   enhanced by diet supplementation but was not affected by depth or
   temperature. Larval diet and water temperatures acted independently on
   growth, development, and female size, and growth rates were higher when
   larval diets were supplemented relative to ambient diets; development
   times were shorter when temperatures were warmer relative to colder;
   adult females were larger when larvae were fed a supplemented diet but
   smaller when reared in warm water. Larval growth and development were
   not affected by depth, but female size was reduced under shallow
   relative to deep conditions. Female longevity and fecundity were
   affected by the larval diet x female size interaction. Surprisingly,
   this was independent of the depth x temperature interaction on female
   longevity and fecundity suggesting that reductions in adult fitness due
   to juvenile abiotic conditions can be independent of size-at-maturity.
   Future studies should quantify the effect of proximate cues of
   pond-drying on juvenile survival and life history as well as adult
   fitness correlates.}},

Abstract = {{Predators affect prey demography through direct predation and through
   the costs of antipredator behavioral responses, or risk effects.
   Experiments have shown that risk effects can comprise a substantial
   proportion of a predator's total effect on prey dynamics, but we know
   little about their strength in wild populations, or the physiological
   mechanisms that mediate them. When wolves are present, elk alter their
   grouping patterns, vigilance, foraging behavior, habitat selection, and
   diet. These responses are associated with decreased progesterone levels,
   decreased calf production, and reduced population size {[}Creel S,
   Christianson D, Liley S, Winnie JA (2007) Science 315: 960]. Two general
   mechanisms for the effect of predation risk on reproduction have been
   proposed: the predation stress hypothesis and the
   predator-sensitive-food hypothesis. Here, we used enzyme immunoassay to
   measure fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations for 1,205 samples
   collected from 4 elk populations over 4 winters to test the hypothesis
   that the effect of predation risk on elk reproduction is mediated by
   chronic stress. Across populations and years, fecal glucocorticoid
   concentrations were not related to predator-prey ratios, progesterone
   concentrations or calf-cow ratios. Overall, the effect of wolf presence
   on elk reproduction is better explained by changes in foraging patterns
   that carry nutritional costs than by changes in glucocorticoid
   concentrations.}},

   determined the relationship between the biomass of preferred foods at
   burrow systems, group size, per capita direct fitness and offspring

   relationship between group size, the density of burrow entrances to
   which social groups had access, per capita direct fitness, and survival
   of adults and offspring. Group size of core females (i.e. those with
   50\% or more nightly overlap) was negatively correlated with per capita

Abstract = {{Indirect benefits derived by females that mate with males that express
   preferred traits are important to our understanding of `good genes'
   models of sexual selection. However, few studies have explored male
   courtship behaviours with potential indirect benefits conferred to
   females in order to ascertain whether these behaviours serve as honest
   indicators of male quality. Using a common species of wolf spider,
   Pardosa milvina, we addressed the honesty of male courtship behaviours
   in two laboratory experiments. In our first experiment, we quantified
   the repeatability of courtship rate in adult males that were manipulated
   to be in high or low condition and were sequentially presented with
   adult virgin females that similarly differed in body condition. In our
   second experiment, we explored the effect of male courtship rate on
   several measures of fitness: number of offspring produced, days until
   offspring emerged and offspring viability measured as offspring
   survival. Our experiments show that male courtship rate is statistically
   significantly repeatable except when males in high condition have
   repeated encounters with females in low condition. Our results also
   reveal that females have the potential to gain indirect genetic benefits
   by mating with males that naturally court at high rates: females
   produced more offspring that emerged from eggsacs sooner and survived
   starvation better compared to females that mated with males that
   naturally courted at low rates. Our study provides additional support
   that male courtship rate is an honest indicator of quality, and it makes
   the novel finding that the repeatability of courtship rate is context
   sensitive. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{When populations face different environmental conditions, both local
   adaptation and phenotypic plasticity may cause interpopulation
   divergence of behavioral or phenotypic properties on which mate choice
   is based. If sustained, this may result in genetic differentiation even
   in the presence of extant gene flow. Condition dependence of mate choice
   is one of the main mechanisms explaining these environmental effects. We
   tested whether experimental food stress affects mate choice in male and
   female Pirata piraticus spiders from one heavily polluted and one
   unpolluted reference population. Compared with control females,
   food-stressed females from the reference population showed a decreased
   probability of copulation and preferred smaller mates. Females from the
   polluted population, in contrast, did not show a significant response to
   food stress and showed size-assortative mating, most strongly under food
   stress. We explain these results in 2 complementary ways. First, spiders
   from populations that are not adapted to cope with stress may be less
   willing to mate when eggs are not fully matured. Second, food-deprived
   females may show a larger responsiveness toward smaller males because
   the latter resemble prey more and hungry females tend to attack moving
   objects more often. Results from this study support the prediction that
   variation in body condition, driven by local ecological factors, may
   affect mating behavior and may ultimately lead to population divergence
   in important life-history traits such as body size.}},

Abstract = {{Although researchers have Investigated the relationships between
   perceived risk and behavioral risk factors for breast cancer, few
   qualitative studies have addressed the meaning of risk and its impact on
   decision making regarding lifestyle behaviors. This qualitative study
   explored factors involved in the formulation of perceived breast cancer
   risk and associations between risk perception and lifestyle behaviors in
   white and black women with a family history of breast cancer. Eligible
   participants were North Carolina residents in the Sister Study, a
   nationwide study of risk factors for breast cancer among women who have
   at least 1 sister diagnosed with breast cancer. Personal interviews were
   conducted with 32 women. Although most had heightened perceived risk,
   almost 20\% considered themselves below-to-average risk. Participants
   with moderate-to-high perceived risk were more likely to report an
   affected sister and mother, a first-degree relative's diagnosis within 4
   years, and death of a first-degree relative from breast cancer. Many
   women were unaware of associations between lifestyle behaviors and
   breast cancer risk. Only one-third of the women reported healthy
   lifestyle changes because of family history; dietary change was most
   frequently reported. Findings may be important for cancer nurses
   involved in developing breast cancer education programs for women with a
   family history of breast cancer.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: Although cardiac rehabilitation programs have been shown to
   decrease cardiovascular risk, morbidity, and mortality, few programs
   have integrated a balanced mind/body approach in which patients are
   taught the relaxation response and utilize cognitive behavior skills for
   stress management, along with diet and exercise. We examined the medical
   and psychological outcomes of patients treated in such a cardiac
   rehabilitation program in a general hospital setting.
   METHODS: From 1997 to 2005, outcomes were measured in 637 patients with
   coronary artery disease at baseline and after a 3-month program.
   Components of the intervention included smoking cessation, moderate
   aerobic exercise, nutrition counseling, relaxation response training,
   and cognitive/behavioral skills.
   RESULTS: Men and women improved significantly with respect to medical
   outcomes (blood pressure, lipids, weight, exercise conditioning,
   frequency of symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath) and
   psychological outcomes (general severity index, depression, anxiety, and
   hostility) (P<.0001). Patients considered ``at higher risk{''} for
   cardiac events due to high baseline measures improved their measures to
   a less than ``at higher risk{''} level. Data indicate that specific
   components of the intervention, that is, increased relaxation response
   practice and exercise, significantly contributed to these improvements
   (P<.05). Furthermore, age and gender differences, particularly for
   psychological measures, were found; younger patients and female patients
   had greater improvements than older patients and male patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary data for a subsequent
   randomized control trial to test mind/body-based interventions to
   determine the most effective outcomes at an affordable cost.}},

   responses to questions on usual dietary behaviors related to consumption
   of fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, whole grains, lean meat and
   poultry, and discretionary fat. The covariate-adjusted association of
   DBS and mortality from all causes, cancer, and coronary heart disease

   significant in both genders in nearly all categories of covariates.
   Similar trends were observed for DBS associations with mortality from

Abstract = {{Cellular commitment to a specific lineage is controlled by differential
   silencing of genes, which in turn depends on epigenetic processes such
   as DNA methylation and histone modification. During early embryogenesis,
   the mammalian genome is `wiped clean' of most epigenetic modifications,
   which are progressively re-established during embryonic development.
   Thus, the epigenome of each mature cellular lineage carries the record
   of its developmental history. The subsequent trajectory and pattern of
   development are also responsive to environmental influences, and such
   plasticity is likely to have an epigenetic basis. epigenetic marks may
   be transmitted across generations, either directly by persisting through
   meiosis or indirectly through replication in the next generation of the
   conditions in which the epigenetic change occurred. Developmental
   plasticity evolved to match an organism to its environment, and a
   mismatch between the phenotypic outcome of adaptive plasticity and the
   current environment increases the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular
   disease. These considerations point to epigenetic processes as a key
   mechanism that underpins the developmental origins of chronic
   noncommunicable disease. Here, we review the evidence that environmental

Abstract = {{Objective: Personality traits underlie maladaptive behaviors, and
   cognitive and emotional disturbances that contribute to major
   preventable causes of global disease burden. This study examines
   detailed personality profiles of underweight, normal, and overweight
   individuals to provide insights into the causes and treatments of
   abnormal weight. Methods: More than half of the population from four
   towns in Sardinia, Italy (n = 5693; age = 14-94 years; mean +/- standard
   deviation = 43 +/- 17 years) were assessed on multiple anthropometric
   measures and 30 facets that comprehensively cover the five major
   dimensions of personality, using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory.
   Results: High Neuroticism and low Conscientiousness were associated with
   being underweight and obese, respectively. High Impulsiveness
   (specifically eating-behavior items) and low Order were associated with
   body mass index categories of overweight and obese, and with measures of
   abdominal adiposity (waist and hip circumference). Those scoring in the
   top 10\% of Impulsiveness were about 4 kg heavier than those in the
   bottom 10\%, an effect independent and larger than the FTO genetic
   variant. Prospective analyses confirmed that Impulsiveness and Order
   were significant predictors of general and central measures of adiposity
   assessed 3 years later. Conclusions: Overweight and obese individuals
   have difficulty resisting cravings and lack methodical and organized
   behaviors that might influence diet and weight control. Although
   individuals' traits have limited impact on the current obesogenic
   epidemic, personality traits can improve clinical assessment, suggest
   points of intervention, and help tailor prevention and treatment

Abstract = {{Food consumption is controlled by both internal and external factors.
   Environmental signals associated with food may prepare an animal to
   forage, consume and digest more effectively. Furthermore, environmental
   cues that provide information about food availability enable animals to
   make predictions about future food resources and act upon that knowledge
   in appropriate fashion. For example, when exposed to a cue that signals
   the presence of food, animals can eat beyond their present needs to cope
   with predicted future famine. Interestingly, cues previously paired with
   meal interruption have a similar effect. In two experiments,
   food-deprived rats learned to associate one conditioned stimulus (CS+)
   with delivery of a food unconditioned stimulus (US), and another
   stimulus (IS) with an unexpected termination of CS-US trials.
   Subsequently, both CS+ and IS enhanced consumption of the US food by
   sated rats. The results of Experiment 2 indicated that IS's ability to
   potentiate feeding of sated rats in test depended more on its
   accompanying CS+ termination in training than on its signaling
   reductions in US frequency. These experiments may provide a novel animal
   model of binge-like behaviors in sated rats induced by external cues

Abstract = {{Powerful biological mechanisms evolved to defend adequate nutrient
   supply and optimal levels of body weight/adiposity. Low levels of leptin
   indicating food deprivation and depleted fat stores have been identified
   as the strongest signals to induce adaptive biological actions such as
   increased energy intake and reduced energy expenditure. In concert with
   other signals from the gut and metabolically active tissues, low leptin
   levels trigger powerful activation of multiple peripheral and brain
   systems to restore energy balance. It is not just neurons in the arcuate
   nucleus, but many other brain systems involved in finding potential food
   sources, smelling and tasting food, and learning to maximize rewarding
   effects of foods, that are affected by low leptin. Food restriction and
   fat depletion thus lead to a `hungry' brain, preoccupied with food. By
   contrast, because of less (adaptive thrifty fuel efficiency) or lost
   (lack of predators) evolutionary pressure, the upper limits of body
   weight/adiposity are not as strongly defended by high levels of leptin
   and other signals. The modern environment is characterized by the
   increased availability of large amounts of energy-dense foods and
   increased presence of powerful food cues, together with minimal physical
   procurement costs and a sedentary lifestyle. Much of these environmental
   influences affect cortico-limbic brain areas concerned with learning and
   memory, reward, mood and emotion. Common obesity results when individual
   predisposition to deal with a restrictive environment, as engraved by
   genetics, epigenetics and/or early life experience, is confronted with
   an environment of plenty. Therefore, increased adiposity in prone
   individuals should be seen as a normal physiological response to a
   changed environment, not in the pathology of the regulatory system. The
   first line of defense should ideally lie in modifications to the
   environment and lifestyle. However, as such modifications will be slow
   and incomplete, it is equally important to gain better insight into how
   the brain deals with environmental stimuli and to develop behavioral
   strategies to better cope with them. Clearly, alternative therapeutic
   strategies such as drugs and bariatric surgery should also be considered
   to prevent or treat this debilitating disease. It will be crucial to
   understand the functional crosstalk between neural systems responding to
   metabolic and environmental stimuli, i.e. crosstalk between hypothalamic
   and cortico-limbic circuitry. International Journal of Obesity (2009)

Abstract = {{Dispersal is a common response to deteriorating conditions such as
   intense competition, food limitation, predation or parasitism. Although
   it provides obvious advantages, dispersal is often assumed to be costly.
   Selection is therefore likely to have acted to decrease these costs, and
   indeed several studies demonstrated that dispersers and philopatric
   individuals differ in their morphology, physiology and/or behavior.
   Using the common lizard (Lacerta viuipara) as our model system, we
   examined the contribution of phenotypic plasticity to the establishment
   of dispersal-dependent behavioral traits. We used a reciprocal
   transplant experiment in which conditions at the maternal site of
   origin, during offspring development in utero, and at the release site
   were manipulated. We then compared activity, social interactions and
   foraging behavior between individuals that stayed philopatric and those
   that dispersed. Most behavioral traits were also measured at birth and
   after the dispersal phase.
   This study demonstrates that (a) 10 months after the dispersal phase,
   there were still marked behavioral differences between dispersing and
   philopatric individuals, (b) the reaction when confronted to another
   individual was also dispersal-status dependent, a result which strongly
   suggests that individuals are able to recognize the dispersal status of
   same-age conspecifics and (c) none of the behavioral characteristics

Abstract = {{Alterations in nutritional factors during early development can exert
   long-term effects on growth, neural function, and associated behaviors.
   The lipid component of milk provides a critical nutritional source for
   generating both energy and essential nutrients for the growth of the
   newborn. The present study, therefore, investigated the hypothesis that
   nutritional supplementation with a complex milk lipid (CML) preparation,
   derived from the milk fat globule membrane rich in phospholipids and
   gangliosides from young rats, has beneficial effects on teaming behavior
   and postnatal growth and development. Male Wistar rat offspring from
   normal pregnancies were treated from neonatal day 10 until postnatal day
   80 with either vehicle or CML at a dose of 0.2\% (low) and 1.0\% (high)
   based on total food intake (n = 16 per group). Neonatal dosing was via
   daily oral gavage, while postweaning dosing was via gel supplementation
   to a standard chow diet. Animals underwent behavioral tasks related to
   spatial memory, teaming, and cognitive function. Complex milk lipid
   supplementation significantly increased linear growth rate (P < .05),
   and the improved growth trajectory was not related to changes in body
   composition as quantified by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scanning
   or altered plasma lipid profiles. Moreover, this effect was not dose
   dependent and not attributable to the contribution to total energy
   intake of the CML composition. Supplementation of the CML to growing
   rats resulted in statistically significant improvements in parameters
   related to novelty recognition (P < .02) and spatial memory (P < .05)
   using standard behavioral techniques, but operant testing showed no
   significant differences between treatment groups. Supplementation with a

Abstract = {{Objective. This study investigates the clustering of a broad range of
   health-compromising and delinquent behaviors. We examine whether these
   behaviors belong to a single but broad cluster. `risk-taking behavior',
   and whether the nature and degree of clustering in adolescents differs
   from that in adults.
   Method. A representative sample (N =4395) of the Dutch population aged
   12 to 40 (overall response rate 67\%), was asked about various
   health-compromising behaviors, such as alcohol consumption, smoking,
   illegal drug use, unsafe sexual behavior, physical inactivity, poor
   nutrition (such as skipping breakfast and not eating fruit and
   vegetables), poor sleep behavior, unlawful traffic behavior, and
   delinquent and aggressive behavior. Data were collected from fall 2005
   to spring 2006 using internet questionnaires and face-to-face
   computer-assisted interviews.
   Results. No single broad cluster was found. Instead, there were several
   separate but interrelated clusters. The contents of these clusters
   differed between age groups. For young adolescents (12-15) two clusters
   were identified: Alcohol and Delinquency. For older adolescents (16-18)
   and adults (19-40) three clusters were identified: Alcohol, Delinquency

   Conclusion. The findings of this study support a more integrated
   approach to promoting healthier lifestyles, and suggest that the

Title = {{Reducing stillbirths: behavioural and nutritional interventions before
   and during pregnancy}},
Journal = {{BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: The vast majority of global stillbirths occur in low-and
   middle-income countries, and in many settings, the majority of
   stillbirths occur antenatally, prior to the onset of labour. Poor
   nutritional status, lack of antenatal care and a number of behaviours
   increase women's risk of stillbirth in many resource-poor settings.
   Interventions to reduce these risks could reduce the resulting burden of
   stillbirths, but the evidence for the impact of such interventions has
   not yet been comprehensively evaluated.
   Methods: This second paper of a systematic review of interventions that
   could plausibly impact stillbirth rates covers 12 different
   interventions relating to behavioural and socially mediated risk
   factors, including exposures to harmful practices and substances,
   antenatal care utilisation and quality, and maternal nutrition before
   and during pregnancy. The search strategy reviewed indexed medical
   journals on PubMed and the Cochrane Library. If any eligible randomised
   controlled trials were identified that were published after the most
   recent Cochrane review, they were added to generate new meta-analyses.
   Interventions covered in this paper have a focus on low-and
   middle-income countries, both because of the large burden of stillbirths
   and because of the high prevalence of risk factors including maternal
   malnutrition and harmful environmental exposures in these countries. The
   reviews and studies belonging to these interventions were graded and
   conclusions derived about the evidence of benefit of these
   interventions.
   Results: From a programmatic perspective, none of the interventions
   achieved clear evidence of benefit. Evidence for some socially mediated
   risk factors were identified, such as exposure to indoor air pollution
   and birth spacing, but still require the development of appropriate
   interventions. There is a need for additional studies on culturally
   appropriate behavioural interventions and clinical trials to increase
   smoking cessation and reduce exposure to smokeless tobacco. Balanced
   protein-energy supplementation was associated with reduced stillbirth
   rates, but larger well-designed trials are required to confirm findings.
   Peri-conceptional folic acid supplementation significantly reduces
   neural tube defects, yet no significant associated reductions in
   stillbirth rates have been documented. Evidence for other nutritional
   interventions including multiple micronutrient and Vitamin A
   supplementation is weak, suggesting the need for further research to
   assess potential of nutritional interventions to reduce stillbirths.
   Conclusion: Antenatal care is widely used in low- and middle-income
   countries, and provides a natural facility-based contact through which
   to provide or educate about many of the interventions we reviewed. The
   impact of broader socially mediated behaviors, such as fertility
   decision-making, access to antenatal care, and maternal diet and
   exposures like tobacco and indoor air pollution during pregnancy, are
   poorly understood, and further research and appropriate interventions
   are needed to test the association of these behaviours with stillbirth
   outcomes. For most nutritional interventions, larger randomised
   controlled trials are needed which report stillbirths disaggregated from
   composite perinatal mortality. Many antepartum stillbirths are
   potentially preventable in low- and middle-income countries,
   particularly through dietary and environmental improvement, and through
   improving the quality of antenatal care - particularly including
   diagnosis and management of high-risk pregnancies - that pregnant women
   receive.}},

Abstract = {{In vertebrates, stressors such as starvation or predator attacks
   stimulate the rapid elevation of circulating glucocorticoid hormones,
   triggering physiological and behavioral responses that aid immediate
   survival but simultaneously inhibit reproduction. This stress response
   has been proposed to serve as a physiological mediator of life-history
   trade-offs: when the value of current reproduction is high relative to
   the value of future reproduction and survival, a mitigated stress
   response is expected to enable successful breeding and maximize fitness.
   Using phylogenetic comparative analyses, we investigated baseline and
   peak stress-induced plasma corticosterone levels during parental care in
   64 bird species. We found that (1) species with a higher value of the
   current brood relative to future breeding mounted weaker corticosterone
   responses during acute stress, and (2) females in species with more
   female-biased parental care had weaker corticosterone responses. These
   results support the brood value hypothesis, suggesting that the stress
   response evolves as an adaptive basis for life-history strategies.
   Further, we found that (3) baseline corticosterone correlated positively
   with brood value and negatively with body mass, and (4) peak
   corticosterone was greater in species breeding at higher latitudes. The
   latter findings suggest that circulating corticosterone concentrations
   might be matched to the anticipated demands and risks during nesting.}},

Abstract = {{The use of demand curves to derive estimates of motivational strength is
   a popular method for measuring animals' preferences for a range of
   different resources in applied animal behaviour research. In a typical
   experiment, an animal pays a gradually increasing cost (e.g. by pushing
   through a weighted door) in order to access a resource it wants or
   needs. The resulting demand curves are used to calculate several
   measures of the strength of the animal's motivation to access the
   resource. We tested two assumptions that underlie the majority of
   applications of this approach: first, that animals have a fixed energy
   budget to spend on access to resources: and second, that the effect of
   price on demand is not greatly influenced by the order or magnitude of
   the price changes. Sixteen European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were
   trained to push through weighted doors to gain access to one of two
   resources, either a tray of turf, or protective foliage cover. In the
   first stage of the experiment reservation prices were established for
   each bird by daily increasing the force necessary to open the door until
   the bird no longer accessed the resource. In the next stage, five
   different forces, chosen to evenly cover the range between free entry
   and each individual bird's reservation price, were presented in a random
   order under two levels of food availability. Overall, price was the most
   important determinant of demand. However, birds' demand for resources
   was increased by food rationing, suggesting that the cost of pushing the
   weighted doors might not have been energy. Birds' willingness to pay for
   a resource was also dependent upon the order in which the forces were
   presented, and specifically the contrast from the force presented the
   previous day. The results support the continued use of presenting costs
   on an ascending order to measure the demand in captive animals, but
   suggest that random order presentations can be used to check for order
   effects. We also suggest that the concept of a finite energy budget that
   animals have to spend on resources may not be useful in the measurement
   of captive animals' preferences and that a different approach might be
   needed. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anxiety has been implicated in obesity and in the overconsumption of
   highly palatable foods such as those high in fat, sugar, or both. Also,
   the novelty-seeking trait has been associated with failure in
   weight-loss programs. The aim of this study was to investigate the
   associations of experimental anxiety and the self-administration of
   sucrose and high fat pellets in non-food deprived rats across different
   operant schedules. Male Wistar rats were subjected to the elevated
   plus-maze test (EPM) of anxiety-like behavior. The rats were tested for
   fixed ratio 5 (FR5) and progressive ratio (PR) operant responding for
   50\% sucrose, 95\% sucrose, and high-fat pellets. PR active lever press
   response for 95\% sucrose, but not the other pellet types, was
   correlated to \% time spent on open arms (P=0.019) in the EPM. On the
   FR5 schedule, activity (closed arm entries) was correlated to the
   self-administration of 50\% sucrose (P=0.027) and high-fat (P=0.002).
   This indicates an association of novelty-induced activity and
   self-administration of palatable food in sated rats, as well as a
   specific association of PR lever press response for 95\% sucrose and low
   anxiety-like behavior. It has been argued that such active lever press
   response on PR may be interpreted as craving for the reinforcer: thus,
   our findings indicate an inverse relationship of experimental anxiety
   and craving for sucrose. This connection may have implications for human
   situations, since anxiety and novelty-seeking have been associated with
   obesity and failure in weight-loss programs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{In a successive negative contrast (SNC) procedure, subjects used to a
   familiar contingency are unexpectedly shifted to a less favourable one.
   Typically, mammals in the new condition show lower anticipatory and
   consummatory responses than controls that only experience the low
   contingency, but similar experiments in birds have failed to show SNC.
   We investigated SNC in European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris. In
   experiment 1, birds that were shifted from mealworms (preferred food) to
   turkey crumbs (less preferred food) consumed less of the turkey crumbs,
   and showed elevated activity and exploratory feeder probing with respect
   to unshifted starlings exposed throughout to turkey crumbs. This is the
   first report of consummatory SNC in birds. In experiment 2, two groups
   differed in the amount of information. Initially, both groups
   encountered simultaneously one hopper with mealworms and three with
   turkey crumbs. The mealworm hopper was colour coded in group `cued' but
   not in group `uncued'. After a shift, all four feeders contained turkey
   crumbs and were signalled by the colour associated with turkey crumbs
   before the shift. The two groups did not differ in postshift
   consumption, and increased overall activity similarly after the shift.
   Exploratory feeder probing, however, increased significantly less in
   group cued than in group uncued, consistent with the view that informed
   animals adjusted faster (ceased searching for the preferred food) to the
   new conditions. The dissociation between exploration and consumption in
   their sensitivity to available information during the reward downshift
   is discussed in terms of the adaptive implications of SNC. (C) 2008 The

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Domestication and selection for high production have selected animals
   with less energy-demanding behaviour. In the natural environment of the
   ancestors, fitness (reproductive success) is often favoured by an
   ability to locate and remember food sites, whereas in captivity, fitness
   may be more related to the ability to grow and reproduce efficiently
   under stable food conditions. We hypothesized that domestication and
   selection for production traits have caused animals to react less
   actively to food shortage. In this experiment, 26 red junglefowl (RJF)
   and 27 White Leghorn layers (WL), the latter selected for high egg
   production, were exposed to 0, 3 and 24 h of food deprivation while
   housed in furnished cages. After food deprivation, we quantified the
   bird's behaviour, in a series of tests. Birds of both breeds performed
   more foraging-exploring, less preening behaviour and less perching with
   increasing length of food deprivation. However, when tested in a group,
   RJF showed a more active response than WL to food shortage by reducing
   perching time and increasing the foraging and exploration time on the
   ground, which may be interpreted as a more risk-prone behaviour.
   Furthermore, when tested individually, there was a breed effect on
   response in the open field and the novel object tests, where RJF were
   more cautious than WL. The results may reflect different feeding
   strategies: the behaviour of RJF would probably be more adaptive in a
   natural environment, while the behaviour shown by WL may allow more
   investment in production traits in a more predictable environment. (C)

Abstract = {{Selection should favour female preferences for reliable signals of male
   quality when such preferences result in benefits to females. Research on
   bird song suggests that, because song is costly to produce or sustain,
   females are obtaining accurate information about male quality through
   song preferences. Females have been shown to express mating preferences
   for three general categories of costly song features: song output, song
   complexity and geographical variation. A novel mechanism for the
   reliability of song is suggested by constraints on the ability to
   produce rapid, broadband trills (i.e. `vocal performance'). In several
   species of birds, females show a preference for superior vocal
   performance, supporting a key prediction of the hypothesis that vocal
   performance, like other features of song, may be a reliable indicator of
   male quality. In this study, I further test this hypothesis by
   investigating whether female swamp sparrows' preference for vocal
   performance is favoured by selection because it reliably reflects male
   quality. I found that vocal performance in male swamp sparrows was
   correlated with age and size, measured as mass. By preferring males with
   superior vocal performance, female swamp sparrows may obtain direct and
   indirect benefits by mating with older larger males. These results
   support the hypothesis that vocal performance in swamps sparrows is a
   reliable indicator of male quality. (C) 2009 The Association for the

Abstract = {{There is growing international interest in how environmental conditions
   experienced during development can shape adult phenotypes and the extent
   to which such induced changes are adaptive. One physiological system
   that links an individual to changes in environmental circumstances
   during development is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Mammalian
   studies have linked early postnatal stress to later changes in the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; however, the physiological link
   {[}lactational corticosterone (CORT) transfer] between mother and
   offspring during postnatal development constrains the ability to
   determine the direct effects of such stressors on subsequent physiology
   and behavior. Here we present a novel model using an avian species, the
   zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), in which maternal hormonal transfer
   during postnatal development is likely to be absent. Postnatal exposure
   of chicks to the stress hormone CORT was manipulated for a 16-d period
   up until nutritional independence (28 d), and the long-term effects on
   the physiological response to stress determined. CORT doses were scaled
   to mimic the physiological response of juvenile birds to a
   capture-handling-restraint protocol. CORT-fed birds showed exaggerated
   and prolonged responses to acute stress at 60d of age. Our results
   clearly demonstrate that postnatal stress has significant long-term
   effects on the physiological stress response in birds and provides a
   potential mechanism underlying long-term behavioural responses to
   developmental conditions. This study represents the first direct
   evidence for postnatal glucocorticoid programming of the stress response
   using this novel model for postnatal stress. This model therefore
   provides an important tool with which to investigate the role of
   glucocorticoids in shaping adult phenotypes. (Endocrinology 150:

   or non-DMPA contraception user group. The latter group included patients
   using oral contraceptive pills, transdermal contraceptive patch,
   intravaginal contraceptive ring, or other forms of hormonal
   contraception. Following the initial visit, all contraception users
   (DMPA and non-DMPA) visited the clinic every three- or six-months for
   follow-up. During the follow-up visits, patient weight was recorded and
   the patient received Counseling services by a physician, a licensed
   psychologist, and/or a nutritionist as deemed appropriate. Data were
   entered in Microsoft Excel and analyzed using Statistical Analysis
   Software. The results showed no significant difference in weight gain
   between groups. We hypothesize that hormonal contraception in adolescent
   patients, coupled with clinical intervention in form of counseling and
   regular monitoring, over an extended period (longer than 24 rnonths) is
   not associated with significant weight gain.}},

Abstract = {{Larvae of the grapevine moth Lobesia botrana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)
   are a major pest of vine, Vitis vinifera. As larvae have limited energy
   reserves and are in danger of desiccation and predation an efficient
   response to plant volatiles that would guide them to food and shelter
   could be expected. The responses of starved 2nd or 3rd instar larvae to
   volatile emissions from their artificial diet and to single host plant
   volatiles were recorded on a locomotion compensator. Test products were
   added to an air stream passing over the 30 cm diameter servosphere. The
   larvae showed non-directed walks of low rectitude in the air stream
   alone but changed to goal-oriented upwind displacement characterised by
   relatively straight tracks when the odour of the artificial diet and
   vapours of methyl salicylate, 1-hexanol, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol,
   terpinen-4-ol, 1-octen-3-ol, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene and
   (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate were added to the air stream. This
   chemoanemotactic targeted displacement illustrates appetence for certain
   volatile cues from food by starved Lobesia larvae. Analysis of the
   larval behaviour indicates dose dependent responses to some of the host
   plant volatiles tested with a response to methyl salicylate already
   visible at 1 ng, the lowest source dose tested. These behavioural
   responses show that Lobesia larvae can efficiently locate mixtures of
   volatile products released by food sources as well as single volatile
   constituents of their host plants. Such goal-oriented responses with
   shorter travel time and reduced energy loss are probably of importance
   for larval survival as it decreases the time they are exposed to biotic
   and abiotic hazards. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect predator-induced effects on growth, morphology and reproduction
   have been extensively studied in marine invertebrates but usually
   without consideration of size-specific effects and not at all in
   post-metamorphic echinoids. Urchins are an unusually good system, in
   which, to study size effects because individuals of various ages within
   one species span four orders of magnitude in weight while retaining a
   nearly isometric morphology. We tracked growth of urchins,
   Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (0.013-161.385 g), in the presence or
   absence of waterborne cues from predatory Jonah crabs, Cancer borealis.
   We ran experiments at ambient temperatures, once for 4 weeks during
   summer and again, with a second set of urchins, for 22 weeks over
   winter. We used a scaled, cube-root transformation of weight for
   measuring size more precisely and for equalizing variance across sizes.
   Growth rate of the smallest urchins (summer: < 17 mm diameter; winter: <
   7 mm diameter) decreased by 40-42\% in response to crab cues. In
   contrast, growth rate of larger urchins was unaffected in the summer and
   increased in response to crab scent by 7\% in the winter. At the end of
   the 22-week experiment, additional gonadal and skeletal variables were
   measured. Cue-exposed urchins developed heavier, thicker skeletons and
   smaller gonads, but no differences in spine length or jaw size. The
   differences depended on urchin size, suggesting that there are
   size-specific shifts in gonadal and somatic investment in urchins.}},

Abstract = {{Conditions experienced during early life can have profound effects on
   individual development and condition in adulthood. Differences in
   nutritional provisioning in birds during the first month of life can
   lead to differences in growth, reproductive success and survival. Yet,
   under natural conditions shorter periods of nutritional stress will be
   more prevalent. Individuals may respond differently, depending on the
   period of development during which nutritional stress was experienced.
   Such differences may surface specifically when poor environmental
   conditions challenge individuals again as adults. Here, we investigated
   long term consequences of differences in nutritional conditions
   experienced during different periods of early development by female
   zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) on measures of management and
   acquisition of body reserves. As nestlings or fledglings, subjects were
   raised under different nutritional conditions, a low or high quality
   diet. After subjects reached sexual maturity, we measured their
   sensitivity to periods of food restriction, their exploration and
   foraging behaviour as well as adult resting metabolic rate (RMR). During
   a short period of food restriction, subjects from the poor nutritional
   conditions had a higher body mass loss than those raised under
   qualitatively superior nutritional conditions. Moreover, subjects that
   were raised under poor nutritional conditions were faster to engage in
   exploratory and foraging behaviour. But RMR did not differ among
   treatments. These results reveal that early nutritional conditions
   affect adult exploratory behaviour, a representative personality trait,
   foraging and adult's physiological condition. As early nutritional
   conditions are reflected in adult phenotypic plasticity specifically
   when stressful situations reappear, the results suggest that costs for
   poor developmental conditions are paid when environmental conditions
   deteriorate.}},

Abstract = {{The behavioral outcomes of a calorie restricted diet are often neglected
   in favour of a more physiological examination of the consequences of
   calorie restriction (CR). This is especially the case with social
   behavior. A few findings within the maternal CR literature suggest that
   adult male social behavior is altered by this regimen. Despite the
   paucity of findings within the maternal CR literature, a systematic
   investigation of the behavioral phenotype of males administered an
   adult-onset CR is completely lacking and was the focus of the current
   study. Adult male hooded Wistar rats were administered a three week CR,
   with one group receiving a 25\% CR and another group receiving a 50\% CR
   before male-to-male social behavior was examined and compared with ad
   libitium fed males. Various behavioral elements were modulated by CR,
   both the CR25\% and 50\% group initiated contact sooner and engaged in
   greater social activity compared to the ad libitum fed controls. The
   CR25\% group also demonstrated less non-social (self-grooming) behavior
   and a greater frequency of walkovers compared to all groups, indicating
   a propensity towards dominance. The CR50\% group demonstrated greater
   environmental assessment/exploration, as measured by the frequency of
   rearing. As with the maternal CR literature, an adult-onset chronic CR
   induces a more socially active behavioral phenotype and reduces interest
   in non-social behavior in the moderately CR group. Taken together, the
   social behavioral phenotype can be modulated by a CR initiated and
   maintained during adulthood. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Social associations with conspecifics can expedite animals' acclimation

   significantly less than expected with the local residents and more than

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic or natural disturbances can have a significant impact on
   wild animals. Therefore, understanding when, how and what type of human
   and natural events disturb animals is a central problem in wildlife
   conservation. However, it can be difficult to identify which particular
   environmental stressor affects an individual most. We use heart rate
   telemetry to quantify the energy expenditure associated with different
   types of human-mediated and natural disturbances in a breeding
   passerine, the white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus). We fitted 0.5 g heart
   rate transmitters to 14 male vireos and continuously recorded heart rate
   and activity for two days and three nights on a military installation.
   We calibrated heart rate to energy expenditure for five additional males
   using an open-flow, push-through respirometry system showing that heart
   rate predicted 74 per cent of energy expenditure. We conducted
   standardized disturbance trials in the field to experimentally simulate
   a natural stressor (predator presence) and two anthropogenic stressors.
   Although birds initially showed behavioural and heart rate reactions to
   some disturbances, we could not detect an overall increase in energy
   expenditure during 1- or 4-hours disturbances. Similarly, overall
   activity rates were unaltered between control and experimental periods,
   and birds continued to perform parental duties despite the experimental
   disturbances. We suggest that vireos quickly determined that
   disturbances were non-threatening and thus showed no (costly)
   physiological response. We hypothesize that the lack of a significant
   response to disturbance in vireos is adaptive and may be representative
   of animals with fast life histories (e. g. short lifespan, high
   reproductive output) so as to maximize energy allocation to
   reproduction. Conversely, we predict that energetic cost of
   human-mediated disturbances will be significant in slow-living animals.}},

Abstract = {{The primary goal of this article was to illustrate how nutritional
   deficiencies can translate into adult or child mental health problems.
   Whereas brain development and function play an essential role in the
   etiology and maintenance of mental health problems, what is required are
   models that go beyond nutrition-brain relations and integrate the
   contributions of nutritionally related contextual and behavioral
   characteristics. Four such models are presented. The multiple risks
   model derives from evidence showing covariance between nutritional
   deficiencies and other life stressors. Given that poorly nourished
   adults may be less able to actively cope with stressors, nutritional
   deficiencies may accentuate the negative impact of stress exposure on
   mental health. The cross-generational model is based on evidence showing
   less adequate patterns of mother-child interactions when mothers are
   poorly nourished. Impairments in mother-child interactions increase the
   likelihood of child mental health problems and the risk of subsequent
   child nutritional deficiencies. The attachment model derives from
   evidence showing that poorly nourished infants may be less likely to
   elicit the types of maternal child-rearing patterns that translate into
   secure infant-mother attachments. Insecure attachments in infancy are
   associated with an increased risk of both short-term and long-term child
   mental health problems. The temperament model is based on evidence
   documenting that certain patterns of infant temperament are related to
   an increased risk of later behavioral problems. Infant nutritional
   deficiencies can influence the development of temperament, and certain
   temperament patterns can contribute to an increased risk of infant
   nutritional deficiencies. Am J Clin Nutr 2009; 89(suppl): 935S-9S.}},

   significant public health issue. Given current barriers to the effective
   treatment of these problems, researchers are looking to the field of
   nutrition for potential alternatives to better understand and address
   mental health issues. The purpose of this article was to review current
   evidence on the relation between zinc and mental health disorders with a
   focus on 2 mental health problems that commonly affect women and
   children: depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
   (ADHD). A literature search of the databases Medline and PsychInfo was
   conducted with the use of key terms. The review included articles from
   1975 to May 2008, but focused on articles published in recent years.
   Relations between zinc concentrations and behavior in animals; the
   relation between zinc deficiency, depression, and ADHD in patient and
   community samples; and the potential biological mechanisms for these
   relations were explored. The data support a relation between low
   concentrations of zinc and mental health problems, especially in at-risk
   populations. Evidence for the potential use of zinc in treating mental
   health problems comes mainly from patient populations and is strongest
   when zinc is given in combination with pharmacologic treatment. Less

Abstract = {{Background: Depressive disorders are a major source of disability among
   low-income mothers in developing countries.
   Objectives: The objectives were to examine the association of maternal
   depressive symptoms and infant growth among infants in rural Bangladesh
   and to examine how the relation is affected by infant irritability and
   caregiving practices.
   Design: Infant growth was measured among 221 infants at 6 and 12 mo.
   Mothers reported their depressive symptoms and perceptions of their
   infant's temperament, and a home observation of caregiving was
   conducted.
   Results: At 6 mo, 18\% of infants were stunted (length-for-age,22 z
   scores). At 12 mo, 36.9\% of infants were stunted; infants of mothers
   with depressive symptoms had a 2.17 higher odds of being stunted (95\%
   CI: 1.24, 3.81; P = 0.007) than did infants of mothers with few symptoms
   (45.3\% compared with 27.6\%). In a multivariate regression analysis,
   maternal depressive symptoms were associated with 12-mo length-for-age,
   adjusted for 6-mo length-for-age, maternal education, infant sex, birth
   order, receipt of iron and zinc, months breastfed, maternal perception
   of infant temperament, and caregiving observations. Maternal depressive
   symptoms were not related to 12-mo weight-for-length. The relation
   between depressive symptoms and infant growth was not moderated by
   maternal perceptions of infant temperament, but was partially mediated
   by caregiving.
   Conclusions: The finding that infants of mothers with depressive
   symptoms in Bangladesh experience poor linear growth may extend to other
   low-income countries with high rates of food insecurity. Interventions
   to promote growth in infants should include prevention or treatment of
   maternal depressive disorders and strategies to ensure adequate food
   security. Am J Clin Nutr 2009; 89(suppl): 951S-7S.}},

Abstract = {{Cape Gannets Morus capensis are declining in numbers in all breeding
   colonies at the southern African west coast, potentially caused by
   deteriorating food availability. The behavioural responses of
   individuals to changing conditions can provide insights into the
   mechanisms that drive population dynamics. We studied the relationship
   between parental provisioning behaviour and the breeding success of Cape
   Gannets breeding at Ichaboe Island (Namibia) in two years with different
   nesting success, to assess the potential role of variation in food
   availability in explaining variation in chick survival. In 2006/07
   parents delayed the onset of breeding and visited nests at a lower
   frequency than in 2005/06, indicating that food availability was
   limited. Within the years individual differences in provisioning rate
   but not in parental condition were associated with chick growth and
   survival. These associations remained present when controlling for
   seasonal changes. Predation, not starvation, was the main cause of
   mortality. Under poor conditions, as indicated by long foraging trips,
   Cape Gannet parents left small chicks unattended, resulting in many
   being killed by Kelp Gulls Larus dominicanus. Long foraging trips were
   associated with reduced average breeding success, but impacted some
   parents more than others. Knowledge of the origin of this
   inter-individual variability is needed to predict how changes in food
   availability affect seabird population dynamics, which is one of the
   steps towards conservation of these birds.}},

Abstract = {{Polyphenism in larval amphibians has been related to several factors,
   including wetland hydroperiod, food availability, competition, and
   predation. Spadefoot toads (genus Spea Cope, 1866) often exhibit a
   trophic polyphenism by developing distinct carnivore and omnivore larval
   morphotypes. Using a multimodel selection approach, we investigated the
   influence of land use (cropland vs. grassland type) and differences in
   annual precipitation on morphotype expression in Plains spadefoot (Spea
   bombifrons (Cope, 1863)) and New Mexico spadefoot (Spea multiplicata
   (Cope, 1863)) toads in playas. We also examined the relative importance
   of tadpole density, tadpole age, water-loss stress, wetland size,
   density of larval mole salamanders (genus Ambystoma Tschudi, 1838; a
   predator on Spea tadpoles), and food resources on morph occurrence. The
   carnivore morphotype developed almost exclusively in S. bombifrons and
   rarely in S. multiplicata regardless of land use. Habitat availability
   measured by water-loss rate, as well as predation risk and tadpole age,
   were the most important factors influencing carnivore proportions.
   Ambystoma density was positively associated, whereas water-depth loss
   and tadpole age were negatively associated with the proportion of
   carnivores. The greatest proportion of carnivores was observed in
   grassland playas, which had the highest density of Ambystoma predators,
   longest hydroperiods, and experienced water-depth gain. Fairy shrimp
   density was not correlated with the proportion of carnivores. Upland
   land use through cultivation-associated erosion is altering wetland
   trophic structure, which further influences morphotype expression in
   Spea tadpoles and playa amphibian community structure.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the effects of hypoxia on macrobenthic communities in the

   years ago, the macrobenthic community structure did not change in

Abstract = {{Background: African Americans are more insulin resistant than are
   Whites. The purpose of this study was to characterize physiologic and
   psychological (stress coping style) correlates of insulin resistance in
   African Americans and Whites.
   Methods: We examined African American (n = 67) and White (n = 41) men
   and women aged 18-45 years with body mass index 1835 kg/m(2). We used
   the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) and area under the curve for
   insulin (AUC) after a standardized meal as measure of insulin
   resistance. We obtained anthropometric measures and determined maximal
   aerobic power (VO2max) by treadmill exercise. We used stress profile to
   assess stress and coping style.
   Results: Postprandial insulin AUCs were higher in African Americans than
   in Whites. Anthropometric measures and VO2max were related to HOMA-IR
   and AUC. Although self-reported stress level did not differ between
   Whites and African Americans, positive appraisal predicted reduced
   HOMA-IR and negative appraisal coping style predicted increased insulin
   AUC.
   Conclusions: Psychosocial factors may be determinants of health and
   targets of intervention for obesity-related disorders such as insulin
   resistance. Existing behavioral intervention programs, designed with a
   sole emphasis on exercise and nutrition, may fall short of optimal
   effectiveness. (Ethn Dis. 2009;19:104-110)}},

Abstract = {{Both rs17782313 (near MC4R) and rs1421085 (FTO) polymorphisms have been
   consistently associated with increased risk of obesity and with body

   has recently been suggested. We genotyped rs17782313 and rs1421085 in
   5764 relatives from 1109 French pedigrees with familial obesity, 1274
   Swiss class III obese adults as well as in 4877 French adults and 5612
   Finnish teenagers from two randomly selected population cohorts. In all
   subjects, eating behaviour traits were documented through
   questionnaires. We first assessed the association of both single
   nucleotide polymorphisms with BMI and then studied eating behaviour.
   Under an additive model, the rs17782313-C MC4R allele showed a trend
   towards higher percentages of snacking in both French obese children (P
   = 0.01) and Swiss obese adults (P = 0.04) as well as in adolescents from

   familial obesity, this allele tended to be also associated with a higher
   Stunkard hunger score (P = 0.02) and in obese children with a higher
   prevalence of eating large amounts of food (P = 0.04). However, no
   consistent association of the FTO rs1421085-C allele and available

Abstract = {{Artificially selected qualities can reduce fitness in a wild setting,

   Domestic sheep Ovis aries have frequently become feral on islands, which

   body mass and wool traits in feral sheep inhabiting Santa Cruz Island
   (SCI), California for >= 90 years. To elucidate the influence of
   nutrition, we compared the mass of feral island sheep with that of
   island sheep raised in farm conditions. We found that feral sheep on SCI
   were smaller than purported founder breeds, and that most documented
   populations of insular feral sheep worldwide have converged to similar
   body sizes (within 6 kg). SCI rams attained greater mass in farm
   conditions but ewes did not, suggesting phenotypic plasticity in ram
   body mass. Ewes exhibited self-shedding of wool at a greater frequency
   than rams, and sex differences and shedding patterns were consistent
   with thermoregulation and the risk of fly strike disease as benefits of
   wool loss. Pigmentation rates did not increase, further supporting the
   influence of heat stress on wool traits. These changes occurred in < 25
   generations and may have had a genetic basis, representing a potential
   example of rapid evolution in insular feral sheep.}},

Abstract = {{At the time of settlement to the reef environment, coral reef fishes
   differ in a number of characteristics that may influence their survival
   during a predatory encounter. This study investigated the selective
   nature of predation by both a multi-species predator pool, and a single
   common predator (Pseudochromis fuscus), on the reef fish, Pomacentrus
   amboinensis. The study focused on the early post-settlement period of P.
   amboinensis, when mortality, and hence selection, is known to be
   highest. Correlations between nine different measures of body
   condition/performance were examined at the time of settlement, in order
   to elucidate the relationships between different traits. Single-predator
   (P. fuscus) choice trials were conducted in 57.4-l aquaria with respect
   to three different prey characteristics {[}standard length (SL), body
   weight and burst swimming speed], whilst multi-species trials were
   conducted on open patch reefs, manipulating prey body weight only.
   Relationships between the nine measures of condition/performance were
   generally poor, with the strongest correlations occurring between the
   morphological measures and within the performance measures. During
   aquaria trials, P. fuscus was found to be selective with respect to prey
   SL only, with larger individuals being selected significantly more
   often. Multi-species predator communities, however, were selective with
   respect to prey body weight, with heavier individuals being selected
   significantly more often than their lighter counterparts. Our results
   suggest that under controlled conditions, body length may be the most
   important prey characteristic influencing prey survival during predatory
   encounters with P. fuscus. In such cases, larger prey size may actually
   be a distinct disadvantage to survival. However, these relationships
   appear to be more complex under natural conditions, where the expression
   of prey characteristics, the selectivity fields of a number of different
   predators, their relative abundance, and the action of external
   environmental characteristics, may all influence which individuals
   survive.}},

Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{American trypanosomiasis is a parasitic zoonosis that occurs throughout
   Latin America. The etiological agent, Trypanosoma cruzi, is able to
   infect almost all tissues of its mammalian hosts and spreads in the
   environment in multifarious transmission cycles that may or not be
   connected. This biological plasticity, which is probably the result of
   the considerable heterogeneity of the taxon, exemplifies a successful
   adaptation of a parasite resulting in distinct outcomes of infection and
   a complex epidemiological pattern. In the 1990s, most endemic countries
   strengthened national control programs to interrupt the transmission of
   this parasite to humans. However, many obstacles remain to the effective
   control of the disease. Current knowledge of the different components
   involved in elaborate system that is American trypanosomiasis (the
   protozoan parasite T. cruzi, vectors Triatominae and the many reservoirs
   of infection), as well as the interactions existing within the system,
   is still incomplete. The Triatominae probably evolve from predatory
   reduvids in response to the availability of vertebrate food source.
   However, the basic mechanisms of adaptation of some of them to
   artificial ecotopes remain poorly understood. Nevertheless, these
   adaptations seem to be associated with a behavioral plasticity, a
   reduction in the genetic repertoire and increasing developmental

Abstract = {{Blue crabs are cannibalistic, and therefore the scent of injured
   conspecifics represents both a potential food cue, as well as an
   indicator of predation risk. We examined the response of blue crabs to
   conspecific odor alone, as well as in mixtures of attractive cues to
   determine how animals evaluate and respond to this odor. We explicitly
   manipulated risk-sensitivity based on either animal size (an indicator
   of susceptibility to predation) or hunger state (susceptibility to
   starvation) as ways to evaluate theories of risk-allocation, which
   suggest that decreases in predation risk, or increases in the risk of
   starvation, ought to result in diminished responses to sensory cues that
   signal predator presence or activity. Large and small blue crabs were
   challenged to locate the source of odor plumes consisting of the scent
   of injured conspecifics (risk cue), attractive food odors (attractive
   cue), or their mixture (conflicting cue). Neither large nor small blue
   crabs tracked aversive cues, but large blue crabs consistently tracked
   conflicting treatments to their source. Responses to conflicting and
   aversive treatments also involved diminished movement and reduced
   tracking speed relative to behaviors displayed in attractive plumes.
   Thus, even cannibalistic crabs seem to respond more prevalently to the
   apparent predation risk then to food reward, and risk-sensitive
   behaviors have a likely cost in terms of reduced food intake. Starved
   animals were more likely than unstarved animals to track conflicting
   plumes. Both the ontogenic shift and the response of starved animals
   support the notion that the cost of risk-aversive behaviors results in
   this strategy being allocated in proportion to the degree of potential
   risk. Since risk-aversive responses to chemical cues can produce strong
   effects in communities, the size-dependent nature of these responses in
   blue crabs may introduce considerable complexity in interactions between
   blue crabs, their predators, and their prey. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The processes promoting disease in wild animal populations are highly
   complex, yet identifying these processes is critically important for
   conservation when disease is limiting a population. By combining field
   studies with epidemiologic tools, we evaluated the relationship between
   key factors impeding southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis)
   population growth: disease and resource limitation. This threatened
   population has struggled to recover despite protection, so we followed
   radio-tagged sea otters and evaluated infection with 2 disease-causing
   protozoal pathogens, Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis neurona, to
   reveal risks that increased the likelihood of pathogen exposure. We
   identified patterns of pathogen infection that are linked to individual
   animal behavior, prey choice, and habitat use. We detected a high-risk
   spatial cluster of S. neurona infections in otters with home ranges in
   southern Monterey Bay and a coastal segment near San Simeon and Cambria
   where otters had high levels of infection with T. gondii. We found that
   otters feeding on abalone, which is the preferred prey in a
   resource-abundant marine ecosystem, had a very low risk of infection
   with either pathogen, whereas otters consuming small marine snails were
   more likely to be infected with T. gondii. Individual dietary
   specialization in sea otters is an adaptive mechanism for coping with
   limited food resources along central coastal California. High levels of
   infection with protozoal pathogens may be an adverse consequence of
   dietary specialization in this threatened species, with both depleted
   resources and disease working synergistically to limit recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Foraging theory seeks to explain how the distribution and abundance of
   prey influence the evolution of predatory behaviour, including the
   allocation of effort to searching for prey and handling them after they

   behaviour phenotypically within individual lifetimes, few have examined
   the actual evolution of predatory behaviour in light of this theory.
   Here, we test the effects of prey density on the evolution of a
   predator's searching and handling behaviours using a bacterial predator,
   Myxococcus xanthus. Sixteen predator populations evolved for almost a
   year on agar surfaces containing patches of Escherichia coli prey at low
   or high density. Improvements in searching rate were significantly
   greater in those predators that evolved at low prey density. Handling
   performance also improved in some predator populations, but prey density
   did not significantly affect the magnitude of these gains. As the
   predators evolved greater foraging proficiency, their capacity
   diminished to produce fruiting bodies that enable them to survive
   prolonged periods of starvation. More generally, these results
   demonstrate that predators evolve behaviours that reflect at least some
   of the opportunities and limitations imposed by the distribution and

Abstract = {{Many herbivores and omnivores can balance their intake of macronutrients

   balancing in captive mink and found a pronounced ability to balance and

   composition, mink apportioned intake between the two foods to defend a
   near constant ratio and amount (intake target) of the two

   without showing the excessive energy intake on diets with a low
   percentage of protein and energy deficit on diets with a high percentage

Abstract = {{Behavioural field observations are increasingly being used in
   ecotoxicological research to identify potential adverse effects of
   exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs). We investigated
   thermal conditions inside the nest and parental behaviour of glaucous
   gulls, Larus hyperboreus, breeding in the Norwegian Arctic in relation
   to the concentrations of major classes of POPs (organochlorines,
   brominated flame retardants and metabolically derived products)
   accumulated in their blood. Most notably, nest temperature was
   negatively correlated with the concentrations of the sum of (Sigma) DDT,
   Sigma PCB and several quantitatively minor POP classes within the
   incubating parent. To investigate the relationship between incubation
   ability and parental POP exposure further, we experimentally increased
   the costs of incubation by artificially increasing the clutch size from
   two to four eggs. Clutch enlargement was followed by a decrease in nest
   temperature, but this drop in temperature was not associated with POP
   concentrations within the incubating parent. However, males, which had
   higher POP concentrations and lower white blood cell counts than
   females, seemed less able to maintain nest temperature. There was
   virtually no evidence to suggest that Sigma PCB or Sigma DDT were
   associated with changes in the time a bird spent incubating. However,
   there was some indication that nest site attendance by nonincubating
   males was negatively related to Sigma DDT, suggesting that nest
   protection may have been compromised. The results suggest that adverse
   effects of parental POP exposure may occur through suboptimal thermal
   conditions for embryo development and possibly increased egg predation
   risk. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{457-463}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The study of breeding habitat selection has focused mainly on physical
   characteristics of the environment such as nest sites and food
   abundance, both of which are required for successful reproduction.
   However, individuals may have limited time to make settlement decisions,
   and thus, their knowledge of resource availability may be incomplete.
   Furthermore, food abundance during settlement may not reflect levels
   later in the breeding season. An alternative perspective is that the
   most direct measure of habitat suitability is derived from social
   information such as the presence of conspecifics (conspecific
   attraction) or their reproductive performance (habitat copying). We
   tested resource and socially based hypotheses of habitat selection in a
   population of eastern kingbirds, Tyrannus tyrannus, at Malheur National
   Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Oregon, U.S.A. Kingbirds nested in areas
   with a greater proportion of suitable nest trees than what was generally
   available, but many areas with suitable numbers of trees went unused.
   Kingbirds also settled in areas of relatively high insect abundance, but
   only in years when overall abundance was low. We also found support for
   the socially based hypotheses. Relative to where they nested previously,
   kingbirds tended to settle in areas of higher conspecific density. But,
   we found stronger evidence in favour of habitat copying, suggesting that
   dispersing individuals settled in areas that produced more fledglings in
   the previous year. Kingbirds thus appeared to select breeding habitat
   based, in part, on resource availability, but dispersal decisions may be
   influenced by social information, primarily past reproductive success of
   conspecifics. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Inflammation plays an instrumental role in all stages of
   atherosclerosis. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), a systemic
   inflammatory marker, has been gaining recognition as an independent risk
   factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Both baseline hsCRP
   concentrations and drug-induced hsCRP changes are highly variable and
   potentially subject to genetic regulation.
   CONTENT: This review summarizes the current studies examining the effect
   of genetic and environmental factors on baseline plasma hsCRP
   concentrations, with a main focus on C-reactive protein,
   pentraxin-related (CRP) genetic polymorphisms and various dietary
   components that affect hsCRP concentrations. We also address the
   association of CRP genetic variations with CVD risk, a relationship that
   may support or refute the causality of CRP in the atherosclerotic
   process. Moreover, we discuss the impact of CRP genetic polymorphisms on
   hsCRP changes in response to 3-week fenofibrate treatment in the genetic
   intervention of the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network
   study.
   SUMMARY: Genetic variants on the CRP locus and other loci and dietary
   and lifestyle factors are responsible for the interindividual
   variability of plasma hsCRP concentrations. CRP genetic variants further
   influence differing plasma hsCRP response after 3-week fenofibrate
   treatment in patients with metabolic syndrome. Future studies focusing
   on the influence and interaction of genetic variation on the hsCRP
   response to dietary and other behavior modification as well as drug
   treatment could have important implications for the development of more
   personalized preventive and therapeutic approaches to reduce CVD. (C)

Abstract = {{Background Fetal programming of diabetes might originate in early
   pregnancy when fingerprints are permanently established. The mean
   dermatoglyphic ridge count difference between fingertips 1 and 5
   ('Md15') varies with the early prenatal environment. We hypothesized
   that Md15 would be associated with adult-onset diabetes.
   Methods We obtained Md15 from 577 Dutch adults (aged 58.9 years, SD 1.1)
   whose births in 1943-47 were documented in maternity records and from
   260 of their same-sex siblings for whom birth weights were not
   available. Of these 837 participants, complete anthropometry and
   diabetes status (from history or glucose tolerance test) were obtained
   for 819.
   Results After adjustment for age, sex, parental diabetes and adult
   anthropometry, fingerprint Md15 was associated with prevalent diabetes
   {[}odds ratio (OR) = 1.37 per 1 SD (95\% confidence interval
   1.02-1.84)]. This relationship held {[}OR = 1.40 (1.03-1.92)] for
   diabetic cases restricted to those recently diagnosed (within 7 years).
   In the birth series restricted to recently diagnosed cases, the mutually
   adjusted ORs were 1.34 (1.00-1.79) per SD of Md15 and 0.83 (0.62-1.10)
   per SD of birth weight. Further adjustments for maternal smoking,
   conception season or prenatal famine exposure in 1944-45 did not alter
   these estimates. Among 42 sibling pairs discordant for diabetes, the
   diabetic sibling had higher Md15 by 3.5 (0.6-6.3) after multi-variable
   adjustment.
   Conclusions Diabetes diagnosed at age 50+ years was associated with a
   fingerprint marker established in early gestation, irrespective of birth
   weight. Fingerprints may provide a useful tool to investigate prenatal
   developmental plasticity.}},

Title = {{Behavioural plasticity associated with propagule size, resources, and
   the invasion success of the Argentine ant Linepithema humile}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The number of individuals involved in an invasion event, or `propagule
   size', has a strong theoretical basis for influencing invasion success.
   However, rarely has propagule size been experimentally manipulated to
   examine changes in invader behaviour, and propagule longevity and
   success.
   We manipulated propagule size of the invasive Argentine ant Linepithema
   humile in laboratory and field studies. Laboratory experiments involved
   L. humile propagules containing two queens and 10, 100, 200 or 1000
   workers. Propagules were introduced into arenas containing colonies of
   queens and 200 workers of the competing native ant Monomorium
   antarcticum. The effects of food availability were investigated via
   treatments of only one central resource, or 10 separated resources.
   Field studies used similar colony sizes of L. humile, which were
   introduced into novel environments near an invasion front.
   In laboratory studies, small propagules of L. humile were quickly
   annihilated. Only the larger propagule size survived and killed the
   native ant colony in some replicates. Aggression was largely independent
   of food availability, but the behaviour of L. humile changed
   substantially with propagule size. In larger propagules, aggressive
   behaviour was significantly more frequent, while L. humile were much
   more likely to avoid conflict in smaller propagules.
   In field studies, however, propagule size did not influence colony
   persistence. Linepithema humile colonies persisted for up to 2 months,
   even in small propagules of 10 workers. Factors such as temperature or
   competitor abundance had no effect, although some colonies were
   decimated by M. antarcticum.
   Synthesis and applications. Although propagule size has been correlated
   with invasion success in a wide variety of taxa, our results indicate
   that it will have limited predictive power with species displaying
   behavioural plasticity. We recommend that aspects of animal behaviour be
   given much more consideration in attempts to model invasion success.
   Secondly, areas of high biodiversity are thought to offer biotic
   resistance to invasion via the abundance of predators and competitors.
   Invasive pests such as L. humile appear to modify their behaviour
   according to local conditions, and establishment was not related to
   resource availability. We cannot necessarily rely on high levels of
   native biodiversity to repel invasions.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of trap capture in a geographically closed population of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{46}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Open population mark-recapture analysis of unbounded populations
   accommodates some types of closure violations (e.g. emigration,
   immigration). In contrast, closed population analysis of such
   populations readily allows estimation of capture heterogeneity and
   behavioural response, but requires crucial assumptions about closure
   (e.g. no permanent emigration) that are suspect and rarely tested
   empirically.
   In 2003, we erected a double-sided barrier to prevent movement of snakes
   in or out of a 5-ha semi-forested study site in northern Guam. This
   geographically closed population of > 100 snakes was monitored using a
   series of transects for visual searches and a 13 x 13 trapping array,
   with the aim of marking all snakes within the site. Forty-five marked
   snakes were also supplemented into the resident population to quantify
   the efficacy of our sampling methods. We used the program mark to
   analyse trap captures (101 occasions), referenced to census data from
   visual surveys, and quantified heterogeneity, behavioural response, and
   size bias in trappability. Analytical inclusion of untrapped individuals
   greatly improved precision in the estimation of some covariate effects.
   A novel discovery was that trap captures for individual snakes consisted
   of asynchronous bouts of high capture probability lasting about 7 days
   (ephemeral behavioural effect). There was modest behavioural response
   (trap happiness) and significant latent (unexplained) heterogeneity,
   with small influences on capture success of date, gender, residency
   status (translocated or not), and body condition.
   Trapping was shown to be an effective tool for eradicating large brown
   treesnakes Boiga irregularis (> 900 mm snout-vent length, SVL).
   Synthesis and applications. Mark-recapture modelling is commonly used by
   ecological managers to estimate populations. However, existing models
   involve making assumptions about either closure violations or response
   to capture. Physical closure of our population on a landscape scale
   allowed us to determine the relative importance of covariates
   influencing capture probability (body size, trappability periods, and
   latent heterogeneity). This information was used to develop models in
   which different segments of the population could be assigned different
   probabilities of capture, and suggests that modelling of open
   populations should incorporate easily measured, but potentially
   overlooked, parameters such as body size or condition.}},

Abstract = {{In studies of sexual selection, larger size is often argued to increase

   males mature rapidly at small size in the presence of females. In field
   enclosures, we simulated two competitive contexts favouring development
   of divergent male sizes. Relatively smaller males lost when competing
   directly, but had 10 times higher fitness than relatively larger males
   when given the temporal advantage of rapid development. Linear selection
   gradients confirmed the reversal of selection on size, showing that it

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{2-4}},

Month = {{JAN 31}},
Abstract = {{Exploration appears to be carried out for its own purpose due to being
   self-rewarding. Furthermore, it increases environmental certainty with
   the effect of increased predictability and control of the environment.
   We, therefore, supposed that exploratory behaviour is associated with
   positive emotions and could be a valuable tool in the assessment of
   animal welfare from the positive side. Since assessing the level of
   exploration in daily life is time consuming, the goal of our study was
   to develop a feasible on-farm test to estimate the daily exploratory
   level of beef bulls. This was based on the hypothesis that bulls in
   barren environments (here: pens with fully slatted floors) will explore
   an unknown object more than those housed under more enriched conditions
   (here: littered pens). A novel object test at the feed rack over a 1-h
   period was carried out in 64 groups of fattening bulls on farms in
   Germany and Austria. In order to evaluate sensitivity of the test half
   of the barren pens in Germany were slightly enriched after these tests
   and bulls tested again after 1 week. During the first three quarters of
   the test hour, significantly more barren-housed bulls were occupied with
   the objects than animals in littered pens. This was predominantly due to
   more licking/chewing of the novel object. However, the differences in
   exploration levels were only slight. Moreover, the test was not
   sensitive to the slight short-term change in stimulation of the bulls
   following the simple enrichment. The motivational basis for increased
   exploration of the novel object by licking or chewing in bulls kept in
   barren conditions is not clear-cut. While it might reflect that these
   bulls gain less positive emotions from intrinsic exploration in their
   daily life, nutritional aspects may also play a role. While further
   investigations should aim to identify the motivational basis of
   occupation with the novel object and relate true daily exploration
   levels to test results, for the on-farm assessment of good animal
   welfare the test appears not to be promising in its current form. (C)

Abstract = {{This study investigated intra-test and inter-test consistency of dairy
   cattle behavioural responses to a series of tests involving human
   approach and exposure to novelty. Thirty-six lactating Holstein-Friesian
   cows were each subjected to three human approach tests and three novel
   stimuli tests. Flight response score was assessed by an experimenter
   approaching cows when they were in the passageway of the home-pen (AP),
   lying down (AL) and at the feedface (FF). Each human approach test was
   repeated on each cow three times. The intra-animal repeatability
   estimates were 0,65,0.40,0.27 for AP, AL and FF tests, respectively.
   Repeatability evaluates an individual's consistency across tests by
   comparing it to the variation within the group. Cows showed moderate
   consistency in their flight response scores to the different approach
   tests (W(35) - 0.56, P < 0.01). Three novel stimuli (water spray,
   striped boards and flashing light) were individually presented once to
   each cow. Investigatory and reactivity behavioural responses were
   assessed. Cows showed the greatest reactivity response to the water
   spray compared to the striped boards (U(1) - 56, P < 0.001) and flashing
   light (U(1) - 66, P < 0.001). No statistically significant agreement
   existed between the novel stimuli reactivity and investigatory responses
   with the AP flight response scores. In conclusion, consistency over time
   was demonstrated over a relatively short period for the AP test and
   consistency between human approach situations was shown, however,
   consistency between human and novel situations was not found. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{Eating is not only triggered by hunger but also by the sight of foods.
   Viewing appetizing foods alone can induce food craving and eating,

   overeating, identifying its neural correlates is important for
   understanding the current epidemic of obesity. Animal research has
   identified the ventral striatum, amygdala, hypothalamus, medial

   feeding. However, it is unclear whether a similar network exists in
   humans and how it is affected by EFS. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging, we showed that viewing appetizing compared with bland
   foods produced changes in connectivity among the human ventral striatum,
   amygdala, anterior cingulate and premotor cortex that were strongly
   correlated with EFS. Differences in the dynamic interactions within the
   human appetitive network in response to pictures of appetizing foods may

Abstract = {{Escape theory predicts that a prey should start escaping (flight

Abstract = {{There is now clear evidence that the pace and pathway of early growth is
   a major risk factor for the development of a group of chronic diseases
   that include coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and
   hypertension. This has led to a new `developmental' model for these
   disorders. The so-called `fetal origins hypothesis' proposes that the
   disorders originate through developmental plasticity, whereby
   malnutrition during fetal life, infancy and early childhood permanently
   change the structure and function of the body, a phenomenon known as
   `programming'. This paper reviews recent findings in the Helsinki Birth
   Cohort, which comprises 13 345 men and women born in the city during
   1934-1944. There is also an older cohort comprising 7086 people born
   during 1924-1933. We review the paths of pre- and postnatal growth that
   lead to later disease. Children who later develop coronary heart disease
   and type 2 diabetes grow slowly during fetal life and infancy but
   thereafter increase their body mass indices rapidly. Those who later
   develop stroke grow slowly in fetal life, infancy and during childhood.
   We also review how the growth of girls during infancy, childhood and at
   puberty influences chronic disease in the next generation.}},

   limited and the energetic cost of movement is high. In these
   circumstances animals would be expected to minimize movement to avoid
   unnecessary energy expenditures. With the addition of a top predator
   such a strategy may not be compatible with avoiding predation risk,
   therefore animals may increase their movement to avoid detection or
   escape capture. Such increased movement may occur on relatively fine
   scales within an animal's home range or may be manifested in broader
   scale responses such as dispersal or migration. With the reintroduction
   of wolves (Canis lupus) to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 and 1996,
   much attention has focused on the behavioral responses of large
   herbivores to wolf predation risk and the implications of these
   responses on ecosystem structure and function. Investigations are
   numerous but evaluations are complicated due partly to a paucity of data
   on elk (Cervus elaphus) spatial patterns prior to wolf reintroduction.
   We quantified winter movement patterns of a non-migratory elk herd in
   the Madison headwaters prior to the reintroduction of wolves, when
   animals were constrained only by nutritional restrictions, and following
   wolf colonization and establishment, when elk experienced significant
   wolf predation. We evaluated changes in home range size and fidelity and
   described broader scale elk movement patterns such as dispersal and
   migration. We predicted elk would shift from a winter strategy of being
   relatively sedentary and occupying areas based on energetic
   considerations in the absence of wolves, to a more spatially dynamic
   strategy as elk responded to increased predation risk from wolves.
   Furthermore, we incorporated our knowledge of landscape characteristics
   of the system to provide possible explanations for any changes in elk
   spatial responses.}},

Abstract = {{Large herbivores that inhabit seasonal environments face considerable
   challenges when trying to balance the conflicting demands of satisfying
   physiological requirements and avoiding predation. The harsh environment
   imposes strong nutritional constraints which influence activity patterns
   and foraging strategies. In addition, the need to evade predators
   strongly determines the way in which prey behave (Lima and Dill 1990).
   The traditional view is that prey manage food acquisition and predation
   risk by trading one behavior at the expense of the other. However, if a
   range of anti-predator behaviors can collectively be adopted at
   appropriate temporal scales, then this trade-off may be somewhat reduced
   (Lind and Cresswell 2005). Plasticity in prey behaviors may balance the
   need to forage and minimize predation risk, thereby allowing prey to
   remain in an environment that both provides adequate forage resources
   but also poses a high threat of predation. We observed the behavior of
   elk (Cervus elaphus) in the Madison headwaters area of Yellowstone
   National Park during 15 consecutive winter field seasons, accruing
   approximately 3100 h of behavioral data before and after wolf (Canis
   lupus) reintroduction to Yellowstone, when elk were exposed to varying
   degrees of wolf predation risk. We hypothesized that environmental and
   temporal factors would play a fundamental role governing the likelihood
   of winter foraging by elk. We proposed competing hypotheses regarding
   the effect of wolves. Based on the traditional view of the
   foraging-vigilance trade-off, we suspected that the addition of wolves
   to the system would manifest a higher degree of behavioral alertness in
   elk and reduce the likelihood of foraging. Alternatively, increasing
   behavioral alertness when wolves were actively hunting at night would
   manifest increased diurnal foraging. Furthermore, we incorporated our
   knowledge of the range of other behavioral responses exhibited by elk to
   determine if they behaviorally compensated to mediate any fitness costs
   associated with behaviors that reduced predation risk.}},

Abstract = {{How animals use resources at local and landscape scales can differ
   depending on whether starvation is the primary limiting factor or
   significant predation risk also exists. With predation, individuals face
   the added and often conflicting demands of obtaining adequate nutrition
   while reducing predation risk. However, disentangling differences
   between the respective resource selection strategies in a given system
   is rarely possible. We evaluated changes in resource selection and prey
   distribution for a non-migratory elk population formerly limited by
   winter starvation and now subjected to wolf predation in the Madison
   headwaters area of Yellowstone National Park. Analyses of elk resource
   selection prior to wolf establishment (1991-1992 through 1997-1998)
   demonstrated a dynamic spatial and temporal response to changes in snow
   pack at the local and landscape level, with elk selecting areas with low
   snow mass, but forced to occupy areas with higher local snow mass as
   conditions on the winter range became more severe (Chapter 8 by Messer
   et al., this volume). We hypothesized that variables affecting elk
   resource selection prior to wolves would retain their primacy in
   post-wolf models (1998-1999 through 2005-2006), but that the magnitude
   of each would change depending on its contribution to predation risk.
   Broad-scale changes in prey distribution could also occur if the
   collective attributes of a landscape serve to alternately provide areas
   with decreased or increased predation risk. Thus, we also evaluated the
   potential for landscape-scale shifts in the distribution of the elk
   population among the three drainages of the Madison headwaters area if
   elk selected distinct prey refuges and avoided areas where they were
   particularly vulnerable to wolf predation. Alternatively, elk
   distribution shifts among the three drainages could also result from
   differential predation risk with lower densities of animals in high risk
   areas due to the removal by wolves of substantial numbers of prey.}},

Abstract = {{We examined effects of seasonality, larval food availability and larval

   not a simple function of body size. Instead, we suggest that sperm size
   modification was caused by varying rearing densities. Group bred
   individuals produced smaller sperm but transferred at higher rate. This
   indicates a trade-off between sperm number and sperm size as predicted

Abstract = {{Social communication in the house mouse relies heavily on
   pheromone-carrying major urinary proteins (MUPs), which delay release of
   pheromones thus extending longevity of the scent signal. Moreover, MUPs
   appear to play an important role in individual recognition. In the last
   few years, new research has led to some important advances. It has been
   shown that MUPs without their volatile ligands are able to activate
   neurons in vomeronasal organ and elicit behavioural and physiological
   responses in the signal receiver. Furthermore, increasing evidence has
   been found showing that, contrary to the traditional view, MUP
   expression is condition and state dependent, and that this variation may
   provide additional information about an individual. Progress has also
   been made in the description of MUP-like proteins in other rodents; as
   yet, however, the protein variability typical of the house mouse has not
   been observed in any other species. Despite these new results, the
   concept of MUPs has remained more or less unchanged from the date they
   were first recognized as an identity signal. The aim of this review is
   to summarise recent knowledge about MUPs and to discuss previous

Abstract = {{Since the discovery of the double helix, the study of brain function, in
   terms of both physiology and behavioral traits, has resulted in a
   plethora of research linking these activities to the genetic basis of

   well as their potential impairment due to polygenic inheritance, can
   shed light on predispositions to addiction and self-destructive
   behaviors. Genetic information derived from scientific explorations of
   genetic traits may have important links to understanding the basis for
   feelings of well-being and potentially the phenomena associated with
   human happiness. While non-genetic oriented research of social,
   political, and biological studies have addressed the impact of social
   and institutional environments on mass political attitudes and
   behaviors, there is a paucity of solid research on the interrelation and
   influence of genetic and environmental factors on these parameters. The
   separate fields of psychology and molecular biology are subject to

   beginning to emerge as fruitful grounds for identification of specific

Pages = {{11-27}},
Abstract = {{This chapter provides an overview of the truism that both nature and
   nurture determine human athletic ability. The major thesis developed is
   that environmental effects work through the process of growth and
   development and interact with an individual's genetic background to
   produce a specific adult phenotype, i.e. an athletic or nonathletic
   phenotype. On the nature side (genetics), a brief historical review is
   provided with emphasis on several areas that are likely to command
   future attention including the rise of genome-wide association as a
   mapping strategy, the problem of false positives using association
   approaches, as well as the relatively unknown effects of gene-gene
   interaction (epistasis), gene-environment interaction, and genome
   structure on complex trait variance. On the nurture side (environment),
   common environmental effects such as training-level and sports nutrition
   are largely ignored in favor of developmental environmental effects that
   are channeled through growth and development processes. Developmental
   effects are difficult to distinguish from genetic effects as phenotypic
   plasticity in response to early life environmental perturbation can
   produce lasting effects into adulthood. In this regard, the fetal
   programming (FP) hypothesis is reviewed in some detail as FP provides an
   excellent example of how developmental effects work and also interact
   with genetics. In general, FP has well-documented effects on adult body
   composition and the risk for adult chronic disease, but there is
   emerging evidence that FP affects human athletic performance as well.

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Background Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a pervasive pattern
   of instability of interpersonal relationships, affects and identity, as
   well as poorly controlled impulsivity.
   BPD causes serious distress and impairment in social, occupational and
   role functioning, and it is associated with high rates of
   self-destructive behaviors and suicide.
   The American Psychiatric Association (APA) treatment guidelines indicate
   the use of pharmacotherapy to manage state symptoms during periods of
   acute exacerbations and trait vulnerability, while psychotherapy is
   required to attain lasting improvements in patients' personality and
   overall functioning.
   Three symptom dimensions are the main targets for pharmacotherapy of
   borderline personality disorder: affective dysregulation,
   impulsive-behavioral dyscontrol and cognitive-perceptual symptoms.
   APA guidelines recommend choosing antidepressant agents, in particular,
   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and monoamine oxidase
   inhibitors (MAOIs), and mood stabilizers to treat affective
   dysregulation and impulsive-behavioral dyscontrol; low-dose
   antipsychotics are suggested for cognitive-perceptual symptoms.
   Two psychotherapeutic approaches have been shown in randomized
   controlled trials to be efficacious, i.e., psychodynamic therapy and
   dialectical behavior therapy. Cognitive, interpersonal, and support
   psychotherapies have also been considered.
   Objective
   This review aims to report and discuss data from clinical trials,
   reviews and meta-analyses concerning efficacy and tolerability of
   antidepressants in the treatment of borderline personality disorder (
   Tables I, II).
   Methods
   Clinical trials, reviews and meta-analyses of antidepressants in
   patients with borderline personality disorder were identified through
   careful searches in MedLine and other sources.
   Results
   Investigations that considered controlled trials of antidepressant
   agents mainly focused on SSRIs.
   These drugs, mainly fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, are indicated as
   firstline treatments for affective instability (depression, anxiety, and
   outbursts of anger) and impulsive dyscontrol (impulsive aggression,
   self-mutilation, and self-damaging behaviors). SSRIs present lower
   incidence and milder severity of adverse effects than tricyclic
   antidepressants (TCAs) and MAOIs. Risk of toxicity is also lower.
   Available controlled studies indicate that MAOIs can be useful in
   treating borderline personality disorder with main effects on symptoms
   of atypical depression, anger and impulsivity, but the risk of adverse
   effects and the difficulties with adherence to required dietary
   restrictions constitute limitations to their use in clinical practice.
   TCAs are second-choice drugs in treatment of BPD; these agents can
   produce effects on mood instability and irritability control, but
   available results are limited. Clinical experience suggests that TCAs
   may sometimes be indicated for patients with comorbid severe depressive
   disorders. However, their risk for toxicity and potential lethality in
   overdose support the preferential use of SSRIs or related
   antidepressants.
   Although more clinical trials are needed, initial data concerning
   reuptake inhibitors of serotonin and noradrenaline (SNRIs) (duloxetine
   and venlafaxine) are promising. These antidepressants have been found to
   be efficacious in reducing impulsivity, anger, affective instability,
   anxiety, and suicidality.
   Conclusions
   Many antidepressive agents with different mechanism of actions have been
   evaluated in the treatment of patients with borderline personality
   disorder. However, a part of available studies suffer from serious
   methodological limitations. Further controlled trials vs. placebo or
   active agents are required, including larger samples and using longer
   durations of treatments, in order to confirm current indications for
   pharmacotherapy of patients with BPD.}},

   criteria. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the prevalence
   of MetS and its component measures and x(2) analyses to compare these
   results with the most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey Data (NHANES). Stepwise logistic regressions were used to
   identify associated demographic and clinical features. In the subset of

   23.4\% (n = 241) had MetS and 75.6\% (n = 777) met at least one

Abstract = {{Unlike other visceral organs, the gastrointestinal tract has several
   communication channels transmitting to the spinal cord and brain, which
   include vagal afferent neurons, spinal afferent neurons, intestinofugal
   enteric neurons, and endocrine mechanisms. The vagus nerves have long
   been thought to play only a role in the efferent reflex regulation of
   digestion. It has turned out, however, that the majority of fibers in
   the vagus nerves is afferent in nature and subserves an unprecedented
   variety of physiological and pathophysiological roles. Thus, vagal
   afferents have a function in chemonociception and interoception (the
   sense of the physiological state of the body), modify
   affective-emotional processes in the brain, can give rise to nausea and
   vomiting, and carry messages relevant to appetite and nutrition. In the
   context of this book, it is particularly relevant that vagal afferents
   serve as a sensory interface between the peripheral immune system and
   the central as well as autonomic nervous system. Vagal afferents can
   respond to proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta and
   contribute to the behavioral sickness response to infection. In
   addition, they elicit a vagovagal anti-inflammatory reflex that results
   in the stimulation of cholinergic vagal efferents. Upon peripheral
   release, acetylcholine activates alpha7 subunit-containing nicotinic
   receptors on immune cells, which inhibits further release of
   proinflammatory cytokines and suppresses inflammation. These substantial
   advances in the understanding of vagal nerve function offer novel
   therapeutic opportunities for the management of nociception and

Abstract = {{The current chapter reviews the relationship between future time
   perspective, income, health, and age. It is proposed that future time
   perspective, that is, how future experiences and consequences are
   evaluated and compared to the present, is one critical factor for
   understanding decision-making. Many personal decisions involve
   consequences (cost and benefits) that unfold over time. The current
   chapter focuses on health and financial decisions. Promoting preventive
   health behaviors and retirement savings is critical to the well-being of
   all Americans given the demographic trend in the United States toward a
   larger number of older adults using social services (e.g., Social
   Security and Medicare) and fewer working adults to pay for those
   services. Preventive health decisions (e.g., exercise, nutrition, and
   tobacco use) and financial decisions involve a trade-off between
   benefits (e.g., taking a vacation) and costs (e.g., depleting a savings
   account). Furthermore many of the trade-offs for preventive health and
   financial decisions involve an immediate benefit (e.g., eating dessert
   now) versus a delayed cost (gaining weight later) or an immediate cost
   (e.g., inconvenience and time to exercise) versus a delayed benefit
   (e.g., better cardiovascular health). The chapter reviews the
   fundamental concepts of intertemporal choice, time discounting, and
   related empirical research. New and emerging areas of research in future
   time perspective including future representation of events, age and life
   events, and emotion are discussed. In particular, the important role of
   age in future time perspective is identified and discussed. Future
   applications of research with an emphasis on specific determinants
   (e.g., anxiety) that tip decisions toward greater concern for future

   food items placed on the aquarium bottom, and their behaviour (number
   and type of investigated food items, time needed for final choice) was
   observed for 30 minutes. Starved individuals preferentially selected
   more profitable food items as is predicted by Optimal Foraging Theory.
   Choice of food item was probably mediated by contact chemoreception,
   Starvation time and sea star size had significant impact on selectivity.
   Mean number of food items of different quality investigated by sea stars
   starved for 2 weeks was higher then in sea stars starved for 4 weeks.
   Low quality food items by large individuals starved for 2 weeks. Sea
   stars O. validus were also capable of distinguishing between small and
   large food items. Final choice made by sea stars presented with food
   items of differing size depended on their size with large and medium
   individuals choosing mostly large food items. Sea stars starved for 2
   weeks chose higher proportion of large food items than individuals
   starved for 4 weeks. Such strategy in accordance with Optimal Foraging
   Theory allows for flexibility in O. validus feeding behaviour and
   enables this species to survive in harsh marine environment, where food
   resources accessible during the Antarctic winter are scarce and
   unpredictable in space and time.}},

   Studies on Dutch and Chinese cohorts in the Netherlands have found an

Title = {{The effects of heterogeneous regimes on reproductive skew in eutherian
   mammals}},
Booktitle = {{REPRODUCTIVE SKEW IN VERTEBRATES: PROXIMATE AND ULTIMATE CAUSES}},
Year = {{2009}},
Pages = {{84-113}},
Abstract = {{Although several models of reproductive skew have been proposed,
   ``transactional{''} models, on the one hand, and ``tug-of-war{''} or
   ``incomplete control{''} models, on the other hand, are most commonly
   debated. The former hold that dominants control group size by yielding
   ``incentives{''} (a share of total group productivity) to subordinates,
   while the latter advance the idea that the dominant's control over one
   or more subordinates is incomplete. While high skew has been identified
   in several mammalian societies, most research on this topic shows that
   social mammals are likely to display intermediate, low, or variable
   reproductive skew. In an attempt to explain this pattern of results, the
   present chapter shows that mammals have evolved to cope with
   heterogeneous environmental regimes (abiotic and biotic), yielding a
   eutherian adaptive complex comprised of endothermy, relative brain
   enlargement, and behavioral flexibility. It is argued that these
   adaptations to environmental unpredictability favor the evolution of
   alternative phenotypes as well as situation- and condition-dependent
   responses decreasing the likelihood that dominants will be able to
   monopolize subordinates, including females, and that high skew will be
   observed. Additional research is required to highlight similarities and,
   most important, differences in the routes to sociality between insects,
   birds, and mammals (see Vehrencamp 1979).
   A simple mathematical model is presented linking reproductive
   suppression by a dominant to his/her influence on a subordinate and
   consequent ability to monopolize the subordinate. This treatment shows
   that, depending upon conditions, both types of skew models are
   realistic. Reproductive skew is discussed in relation to allocation
   decisions and the different reproductive tactics of female and male
   mammals. All other things being equal, reproductive skew in
   heterogeneous regimes may be limited for taxa with relatively
   generalized phenotypes, because exposure to unpredictable conditions
   increases the likelihood of error, uncertainty, and risk of response
   outcomes, decreasing the ability to control a conspecific.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The ability of inferring mental states of others ( also
   named ``Theory of Mind{''} or ``ToM{''} abilitiy) has been developed due
   an evolution pressure exerted by progressively more complex societies
   and it might be impaired in schizophrenia and in schizotypal
   individuals. Such impairment might explain the occurrence of psychotic
   symptoms in these individuals. Objective: To review critically the
   literature on possible alterations of ToM processing in individuals with
   schizotypy or subsyndromal psychotic symptoms. Methods: We performed a
   search on MedLine database for articles published in English or
   Portuguese between 1990 and 2008, using the phrase ``Schizotypal
   Personality Disorder {[}MeSH] AND ``Theory of Mind{''} OR
   ``Mentalising{''}. Results: Fifteen manuscripts have been selected,
   which used diverse experimental designs and instruments to evaluate
   schizotypal traits, vulnerability to psychosis and ToM abilities.
   Discussion: The reviewed articles aimed to establish relationships
   between vulnerability to psychosis and alterations in ToM processing.
   Some articles also approached the trait or state dependence character of
   ToM impairments. The great majority of the selected manuscripts
   suggested that individuals who scored high in schizotypy scales, as well
   as schizophrenic relatives, do show problems in ToM processing ( which
   suggests a trait dependence character). However, these results should be
   interpreted carefully due to methodological problems seen in the
   majority of the studies.}},

Abstract = {{The field of applied animal behaviour science has seen significant
   changes since David Wood-Gush and others began to study the behaviour of
   domesticated animals in the 1950s. This paper looks at these changes in
   order to provide a perspective on where the science has come from and
   where it might be going. Applied behaviour science for much of the
   Wood-Gush era was primarily interested in the study of the biology of
   domestic animal behaviour rather than directly in animal welfare. The
   post-Wood-Gush era has been characterised by an increasing global
   concern for animal welfare. This has had widespread socio-political
   effects including a marked shift in funding priorities towards support
   for research on animal welfare issues. Consequently research output on
   animal welfare is currently on a steep incline, but there is evidence
   from literature searches that the contribution of applied animal
   behaviour science to this output maybe declining probably reflecting in
   part the wider suite of disciplines (including socio-economics) now
   contributing to welfare research. Despite the likelihood that there will
   continue to be demand for research on animal welfare, applied behaviour
   science should not be complacent over its future. One issue highlighted
   in this paper is the risk that the focus on applied welfare issues may
   limit the strategic development of applied behaviour science. This could
   be particularly detrimental where there is a need to address complex
   issues such as the development of approaches to assessment of subjective
   states in animals. It is proposed that International Society for Applied
   Ethology (ISAE) could help counter these influences by developing a
   strategic plan for the future of applied behavioural science, and the
   developments within the science that are required to meet future
   demands. Examples taken from this paper would be to raise awareness of
   the potential benefits in integrating the different biological
   approaches to welfare research, and the need for theoretical and
   strategic research including a wider use of quantitative modelling. In
   addition there is a growing need for approaches that link animal welfare
   with other societal issues in order to better understand the trade-offs
   between welfare and other concerns. Such a strategy would help focus the
   applied behaviour science community on meeting future challenges and
   should help sustain the legacy of David Wood-Gush and the other early
   pioneers in applied behaviour science into the future. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{When predator chemical cues are present, low activity of prey is a
   commonly seen defensive behavior. However, few studies have explored the

   the possible linkages between behavioral responses and its consequences.
   In this study, we experimentally investigated how behavioral responses
   of Hyla japonica tadpoles to predator chemical cues affect vulnerability
   to a dragonfly nymph Anax parthenope julius. The frequency of tadpoles
   attacked by dragonfly nymphs was lower with chemical cues of predator
   was present than without chemical cues, and most of attacks occurred
   when tadpoles were mobile. When tadpoles were exposed to chemical cues,
   on the other hand, their swimming speed was quicker and swimming
   distance was longer, respectively, and the rates of being approached of
   the swimming tadpoles by dragonfly nymph was lower than those not
   exposed to chemical cues. We found that the tadpoles are induced by
   predator chemical cues not only to generally lower activity but also to
   swim in bursts as additional behavior and that the suite of their
   behavioral responses reduce the vulnerability against dragonfly nymph.
   Tadpoles can receive information about the predation risks by chemical
   cues and adjust their defensive behavior accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{Aphid predators are a systematically disparate group of arthropods
   united oil the basis that they consume aphids as part of their diet. In
   Europe, this group includes Araneae, Opiliones, Heteroptera, chrysopids,
   Forficulina, syrphid larvae, carabids, staphylinids, cantharids and
   coccinellids. This functional group has no phylogenetic meaning but was
   created by ecologists as a way of understanding predation, particularly
   for conservation biological control. We investigated whether trait-based
   approaches could bring some cohesion and structure to this predator
   group. A taxonomic hierarchy-based null model was created from taxonomic
   distances in which a simple Multiplicative relationship described the
   Linnaean hierarchies (species, genera, etc.) of fifty common aphid
   predators. Using the same fifty species, a functional groups model was
   developed using ten behavioural traits (e.g. polyphagy, dispersal,
   activity, etc.) to describe the way in which aphids were predated in the
   field. The interrelationships between species were then expressed as
   dissimilarities within each model and separately analysed using
   PROXSCAL, a multidimensional scaling (MDS) program. When ordinated using
   PROXSCAL and then statistically compared using Procrustes analysis, we
   found that only 17\% of information was shared between the two
   configurations. Polyphagy across kingdoms (i.e. predatory behaviour
   across animal, plant and fungi kingdoms) and the ability to withstand
   starvation over days, weeks and months were particularly divisive within
   the functional groups model. Confirmatory MDS indicated poor prediction
   of aphid predation rates by the configurations derived from either
   model. The counterintuitive conclusion was that the inclusion of
   functional traits, pertinent to the way in which predators fed oil
   aphids, did not lead to a large improvement in the prediction of
   predation rate when compared to the standard taxonomic approach.}},

   the codes of short-term feed appetence in farm and companion animals. A
   comparative oronasal nutrient sensing biology review. Can. J. Anim. Sci.
   88: 535-558. The evolution of the chemical senses has resulted in a
   sensory apparatus for high taste and smell acuity in mammals and birds
   to ensure self-nourishment. Such peripheral chemosensory systems
   function as a code to unfold the nutritional value of feedstuffs. Food
   ingestion simultaneously evokes odor, taste and thermo-mechanical
   (somatosensing) sensations. Olfaction represents the capacity to
   identify feed volatiles that are predominantly derived from essential
   nutrients in plants. Comparative biology of olfaction shows that
   primates and chickens have a smaller olfactory epithelium and fewer
   olfactory receptor (OR) genes than non-primate mammals studied to date
   including farm and companion animals, such as the pig, the cow, the dog,
   the cat and the horse. A significant proportion of the total OR genes in
   mammals and birds have lost their functionality (pseudogenes) in a
   process that seems to reflect a decrease in the animal's reliance on the
   sense of smell, particularly in humans and cows. The taste system allows
   animals to recognize a diverse repertoire of nutrient (sugars, amino
   acids, salts, acids and fats) or toxic related chemical entities that
   provide valuable information about the quality of food. Taste senses
   non-volatile molecules in the oral cavity through taste receptors (TR).
   The TR are expressed in the sensory cells forming the taste buds of the
   tongue's papillae. Taste cells are linked to a network of solitary
   chemosensory cells diffused through many non-taste tissues involved in
   metabolic homeostasis. The number of functional taste receptor genes
   (TASR) in humans is equivalent to that in other mammals and superior to
   that in chickens. The TASR family 1 (TAS1R coding for umami and sweet
   TR) is conserved, in number and type, across the species evaluated, with
   the exception of the sweet receptor in chicken and feline species. The
   TASR family 2 (TAS2R coding for bitter TR) shows a strong adaptive
   capacity to dietary sources and digestive physiology across vertebrates.
   Pseudogenization (loss of gene functionality) in the TAS2R family seems
   to be a frequent strategy. The implications of oronasal nutrient sensing
   related to comparative animal feeding strategies and behaviors such as
   neophobia, feed refusal and hedonic preferences are discussed. Feed
   palatability and appetence might be one of the main driving forces in
   short-term feed consumption. Finally, practical applications relevant to
   animal production are outlined.}},

Abstract = {{Although variation in individual lifestyle and genotype are important
   factors in explaining individual variation in the risk of developing
   obesity in an obesogenic environment, there is growing evidence that
   developmentally plastic processes also contribute. These effects are
   mediated at least in part through epigenetic processes. These
   developmental pathways do not directly cause obesity but rather alter
   the risk of an individual developing obesity later in life. At least two
   classes of developmental pathway are involved. The mismatch pathway
   involves the evolved adaptive responses of the developing organism to
   anticipated future adverse environments, which have maladaptive
   consequences if the environment is mismatched to that predicted. This
   pathway can be cued by prenatal undernutrition or stresses that lead the
   organism to forecast an adverse future environment and change its
   developmental trajectory accordingly. As a result, individuals develop
   with central and peripheral changes that increase their sensitivity to
   an obesogenic environment. It provides a model for how obesity emerges
   in populations in rapid transition, but also operates in developed
   countries. There is growing experimental evidence that this pathway can
   be manipulated by, for example, postnatal leptin exposure. Secondly,
   maternal diabetes, maternal obesity and infant overfeeding are

Abstract = {{To review the human and veterinary literature regarding the
   neurophysiology of dyspnea and to provide evidence for the beneficial
   effects of several novel therapies aimed at the alleviation of dyspneic
   sensations.
   Data sources included scientific reviews, case reports, original
   research publications, and recent research conference proceedings.
   The use of blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic
   resonance imaging technology has revealed that the brain regions
   activated by air hunger in humans are also those activated by fear,
   pain, and thirst perception. In human subjects, it has been found that
   agents known to enhance the firing of pulmonary slowly adapting
   receptors (SARs) can alleviate the sensation of dyspnea without altering
   central respiratory drive. Several small studies have also shown that
   nebulized opioids can reduce the sensation of dyspnea apparently via
   activation of peripheral opioid receptors in the lung.
   There are several animal models relevant to both small and large animal
   clinical patient populations. Treatment of rats with a nebulized SAR
   sensitizing agent (furosemide) enhances SAR firing in response to lung
   inflation. Behavioral escape responses to airway occlusion are reduced
   in lightly anesthetized cats when treated with nebulized furosemide.
   Opioid agonists have been shown to inhibit the release of acetylcholine
   and other mediators from the airways of dogs and guinea pigs. Studies
   using a goat model with bilateral destruction of the pre-Botzinger
   Complex do not support current paradigms of air hunger origination.
   Veterinary patients may benefit from an approach to dyspnea that
   incorporates an understanding of the origins of the unpleasant
   sensations associated with the condition. Several novel therapies have
   shown promise in alleviating dyspneic sensations without altering
   respiratory drive. Further study is needed to determine the safety and
   efficacy of these therapies in veterinary patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Whether alexithymia is a personality trait that increases
   the risk of major depression (MID) is still debated. In this prospective

   Method. The alexithymic levels, the presence of MID and the severity of
   anxious-depressive symptoms were evaluated at intervals of about I month

Title = {{Are leaders good mates? A study of call timing and male quality in a

Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{Within insect and anuran choruses, females are exposed to many male
   sexual signals overlapping in time. In many species, male call timing
   influences mate choice, with females preferentially orienting towards
   males that succeed in calling just before their opponents. The
   mechanisms through which males actively regulate their call timing to
   achieve this have been the focus of much interest. However, no study has
   addressed the problem of the reliability of call leadership as an
   indicator of male quality, which is crucial to females, since basing
   their choice of mate on an unreliable criterion could lead them to
   engage in suboptimal matings, with detrimental effects to their fitness.
   Addressing this question in the European treefrog, Hyla arborea, we
   first ascertained that females preferentially orient towards the first
   of two identical overlapping conspecific calls. We then found that
   within experimental choruses the males with the highest proportion of
   leading calls had significantly higher total calling times, a call
   characteristic encompassing two indicators of signal costliness: call
   duration and call rate. Although we failed to find a link between call
   leadership and male body condition, this study provides novel evidence
   that female preference for leading calls leads to the selection of the
   males with the highest energetic investment in their sexual display. The
   handicap principle predicts that this form of female preference should
   increase the fitness of females by guaranteeing that they select
   high-quality mates. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Although shedding a leg may save an individual's life, it may lower its
   subsequent fitness by decreasing its ability to obtain food, increasing
   its vulnerability to predators, or lowering its success in reproduction.
   We studied the effects of leg loss on common locomotory tasks and
   activity levels in adult male crab spiders Misumena vatia. Over three
   field seasons approximately 30\% of adult males lost one or more legs,
   usually among their four large anterior legs. Although M. vatia do not
   build webs, they use their front legs extensively to traverse lines,
   their most important means of movement. Field-captured males missing one
   or more legs moved 38\% more slowly across lines and 28\% more slowly on
   surfaces than intact males. Since males must hunt to find unmated
   females, this reduced mobility suggests a significant fitness cost for
   males that have lost legs. However, a set of males with experimentally
   autotomized legs moved as rapidly on lines as intact males. Since
   individuals that lost a limb in the field weighed significantly less
   than intact individuals of the same size (carapace width), adjusting for
   leg mass, the slow rates of movement on lines by the field-caught
   individuals missing a leg probably resulted from poor body condition,
   rather than a loss of dexterity. Most studies have explained potential
   loss in fitness from losing a leg as a direct consequence of leg loss,
   seldom invoking indirect effects. The potential for leg loss to reduce
   fitness via impacts on body condition warrants further attention, for it
   could play an important role in cost of autonomy. (C) 2008 The

Abstract = {{When food patch quality varies unpredictably over time, animals may
   benefit from sampling to track these changes. Previous theoretical work
   has shown how patch and environmental characteristics influence the
   optimal sampling policy, but there has been little attention to the
   effects of conspecifics, especially for species that do not live in
   groups. We used a simulation model to investigate the influence of
   conspecifics, as both competitors and providers of social information,
   on the optimal sampling behaviour of nongroup foragers. Competition
   reduces the range of patch characteristics for which frequent sampling
   provides a higher gain rate than rare or no sampling. Under conditions
   where sampling is beneficial, however, competition has little effect on
   the optimal sampling rate. Social information generally decreases the
   optimal sampling rate. However, the effect is small when the social
   information is unreliable. This will often occur when animals forage
   solitarily because of an inability to detect other animals at the patch
   or to distinguish animals that are sampling the patch from those that
   are exploiting it. Thus, the presence of conspecifics should reduce the
   sampling rate of nongroup foraging animals, but the extent of the
   reduction will depend on the reliability of the available social
   information. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Food competition is an expected cost of group living. It is therefore
   puzzling that there is little evidence for competition among
   group-living folivorous monkeys, for example, daily travel distance does
   not seem to increase with group size. It is even more puzzling that
   folivores do not form larger groups despite this apparent lack of food
   competition. This has become known as the folivore paradox, and to date,
   there is no broadly accepted theoretical solution. However, there have
   been no multigroup studies that have controlled for the potentially
   confounding effects of variation in habitat quality. We studied 9 groups
   of red colobus monkeys (Procolobus rufomitratus) in Kibale National
   Park, Uganda, and controlled for spatial and temporal variation in food
   availability. We found that larger groups occupied larger home ranges
   than smaller groups and that group size was related to increased
   foraging effort (longer daily travel distance), increased group spread,
   and reduced female reproductive success. Our results also suggest that
   monkeys in larger groups spent more time feeding and less time engaged
   in social behavior. These results suggest that folivorous red colobus
   monkeys experience within-group scramble competition and possess a suite
   of behavioral responses that may mitigate the cost of competition and
   represent adaptations for group living. The results offer insight into
   the folivore paradox and the evolutionary ecology of group size.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental factors influence variation in life histories by affecting
   growth, development, and reproduction. We conducted an experiment in
   outdoor mesocosms to examine how diet and a time constraint on juvenile
   development (pond-drying) influence life-history trade-offs (growth,
   development, adult body mass) in the caddis fly Limnephilus externus
   (Trichoptera: Limnephilidae). We predicted that: (1) diet
   supplementation would accelerate larval growth and development, and
   enhance survival to adulthood; (2) pond-drying would accelerate
   development and increase larval mortality; and (3) the relationship
   between adult mass and age at maturity would be negative. Diet
   supplementation did lead to larger adult mass under nondrying
   conditions, but did not significantly alter growth or development rates.
   Contrary to predictions, pond-drying reduced growth rates and delayed
   development. The slope (positive or negative) of the female mass-age at
   maturity relationship depended on interactions with diet or pond-drying,
   but the male mass-age relationship was negative and independent of
   treatment. Our results suggest that pond-drying can have negative
   effects on the future fitness of individuals by increasing the risk of
   desiccation-induced, pre-reproductive mortality and decreasing adult
   body size at maturity. These negative effects on life history cannot be
   overcome with additional nutritional resources in this species. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{Vertical migration of Daphnia represents the best-studied
   predator-avoidance behaviour known; yet the mechanisms underlying the
   choice to migrate require further investigation to understand the role
   of environmental context. To investigate the optimal habitat choice of
   Daphnia under fish predation pressure, first, we selected the
   individuals exhibiting strong migration behaviour. The animals collected
   from the hypolimnion during the daytime were significantly larger, being
   more conspicuous, and in turn performed stronger diel vertical migration
   (DVM) when exposed to fish cue. We called them strong migrants. Second,
   we provided the strong migrant D. pulex with food at high and
   intermediate (1 and 0.4 mg C l(-1), respectively) levels, which were
   well above the incipient limiting level and of high quality. They traded
   the benefits of staying in the warm water layer and moved down to the
   cold water in response to fish cue indicating fish predation. The
   availability of food allowed the animals to stay in the cold
   hypolimnion. However, at the low food level (0.1 mg C l(-1)), which is
   an additional constraint on fitness, Daphnia moved away from the cold
   hypolimnion. Poor food condition resulted in strong migrant Daphnia to
   cease migration and remain in the upper warmer water layer. Although
   temperature is known to be a more important cost factor of DVM than
   food, our results clearly show that this is only true as long as food is
   available. It becomes clear that food availability is controlling the
   direction of vertical positioning when daphnids experience a dilemma
   between optimising temperature and food condition while being exposed to
   fish cue. Then they overlook the predation risk. Thus, the optimal
   habitat choice of Daphnia appears to be a function of several variables
   including temperature, food levels and fish predation.}},

Abstract = {{ovarian-based immunological research is currently restricted to proteins

   blood sampling determined the level and duration of immune response.
   Animals were monitored daily, pre- and post-immunization, to determine
   estrous cycling activity and the percentage of reproductive cycles
   yielding viable young. The reproductive tracts and somatic organs of
   VAP1-immunized (n=7), control-immunized (n=3) and non-immunized (n=5)
   animals were collected and examined by histology and transmission
   electron microscopy. VAP1 immunization caused a strong and sustained
   immune response. Elevated levels of VAP1 antibody binding were detected
   in sera following initial injections, and immune titers rose as boosters
   were administered. Immunization had no adverse effect upon animal
   behavior or body condition. immunized females demonstrated no major
   change in annual estrous cycling activity; however, the percentage of
   reproductive cycles resulting in pouch young decreased significantly (P
   < 0.05) by 40\%. Histological and ultrastructural analyses revealed an
   abundance of lipid-like degradation bodies within the ooplasm of
   developing oocytes and the cytoplasm of failing uterine zygotes. Active
   macrophage invasion of enlarged endometrial glands was observed in the

Abstract = {{The present paper describes the main procedures used to slaughter fowl,
   pigs, calves and adult cattle, sheep, and farmed fish, starting on the
   farm and ending with the death of the animal at the abattoir. It reviews
   the currently known causes of stress, indicated by behavioural and
   physiological measurements on the animal level, and by post-mortem
   muscle metabolism. During the pre-slaughter period, psychological stress
   is due to changes of environment, social disturbances and handling, and
   physical stress is due to food deprivation, climatic conditions,
   fatigue, and sometimes pain. The exact causes of stress depend, however
   on the characteristics of each species, including the rearing system.
   For fowl, bird catching and crating, duration and climatic conditions of
   transport and of lairage and shackling are the main known pre-slaughter
   stress factors. For pigs, stress is caused by fighting during mixing of
   pens, loading and unloading conditions, and introduction in the
   restrainer Handling and novelty of the situation contribute to the
   stress reactions. For veal calves and adult cattle, disruption of the
   social group, handling, loading and sometimes unloading conditions,
   fatigue, novelty of the situation and for calves mixing with unfamiliar
   animals are known stress factors. Gathering and yarding of extensively
   reared lambs and sheep causes stress, particularly when shepherd dogs
   are used. Subsequent transport may induce fatigue, especially if sheep
   are commercialised through auctions or markets. In farmed fish, stress
   is predominantly related to environmental aspects such as temperature,
   oxygen, cleanliness of the water and, to a certain extent, stocking
   density and removal of the fish from the water If transport and lairage
   conditions are good and their durations not too long, they may allow
   pigs, calves and adult cattle, sheep, and fish to rest. For certain
   species, it was shown that genetic origin and earlier experience
   influence reactions to the slaughter procedure. Stunning techniques used
   depend on the species. Pigs and fowl are mostly electrically or
   gas-stunned, while most adult cattle are stunned with a captive bolt
   pistol. Calves and sheep may be electrically stunned or with a captive
   bolt pistol. Various stunning methods exist for the different farmed
   fish species. Potential causes of stress associated with the different
   stunning procedures are discussed. The paper addresses further
   consequences for meat quality and possible itineraries for future
   research. For all species, and most urgently for fish, more knowledge is
   needed on stunning and killing techniques, including gas-stunning
   techniques, to protect welfare.}},

   novel food in two populations of the African striped mouse, with
   different social systems: a desert population (group living with
   paternal care and natal philopatry) and a grassland population
   (solitary, paternal care in captivity only and natal dispersal). We
   predicted that both parents would be reliable demonstrators for desert
   striped mice but only the mother would be a demonstrator for grassland
   striped mice. Adults and unweaned young were assigned to one of five
   treatments in captivity: (1) father or (2) mother fed novel food away
   from young; (3) novel food fed to both adults with young present; and
   (4) father or (5) mother fed mouse cubes (control) away from young.
   Juveniles from all treatments individually received novel food after
   weaning. The responses of juveniles to novel food were greater (shorter
   latency, more sniffs) when the mother was the demonstrator, regardless
   of population. Mothers may be more reliable demonstrators than fathers
   because information can be transmitted using multiple channels
   (olfaction, lactation). Our study also showed that fathers were more
   reliable demonstrators and responses to the novel food were greater in
   desert than grassland striped mice. These population differences reflect
   the different social organization of the populations and the
   unpredictable availability of highly nutritious food in the desert. (C)

Abstract = {{Animals are often neophobic towards novel foods, but will incorporate
   them into their diet after interacting with experienced conspecifics.
   Such social learning is likely to be particularly important for young
   animals, for which most foods are unfamiliar. It has been suggested that
   in some species adults actively promote learning about unfamiliar foods
   by teaching offspring, although firm evidence is lacking. I examined
   social influences on learning about novel foods among wild meerkats,
   Suricata suricatta, a species where older group members teach pups
   prey-handling skills. In two experiments, naive pups were significantly
   more likely to eat hardboiled egg, a food item not normally present in
   the diet, and scorpions, a common prey type, if they had interacted with
   experienced conspecifics. I then investigated whether helpers teach pups
   to eat unfamiliar prey by preferentially feeding rare items and through
   direct feeding, where food items are transferred mouth to mouth. Rare
   prey items were fed more frequently than common items, although this may
   reflect nutritional characteristics. Direct feeding was most commonly
   used by juvenile helpers, which typically contribute relatively little
   to cooperative activities, and was more frequent if other helpers were
   nearby. This suggests that direct feeding may be a means of reducing the
   costs of feeding by improving the efficiency of energy transfer and
   minimizing the risks of kleptoparasitism. I conclude that learning about
   novel foods is likely to occur as a by-product of provisioning by
   helpers. There was little evidence that helpers actively teach pups what
   to eat. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   zebrafish (Danio rerio (Hamilton, 1822)) strains to test for genetic
   variation in foraging behavior and whether this variation affected their

   strains differed significantly in their latency to begin foraging from
   the surface of the water under standard laboratory conditions. Fish fed
   sooner when nutrients were restricted, although this was only
   significant in the absence of aversive stimuli. Aversive stimuli caused
   fish to delay feeding in a strain-specific manner. Strains varied in
   food intake and specific growth rate, and feeding latency was
   significantly correlated with food intake. Our results indicate
   significant genetic variation in foraging behavior and the perception of

Abstract = {{Previous research has suggested that bipolar disorder is characterized
   by a state-dependent decrease in the ability to recognize facial affect
   during mania. It remains unclear, though, whether people who are only
   vulnerable to the disorder show these changes in facial affect
   recognition. It is also unclear whether minor shifts in mood affect the
   recognition of facial emotion. Thus, this study examined the effects of
   positive mood induction on the facial affect recognition of
   undergraduates vulnerable to mania. Fifty-two undergraduates completed
   the Hypomanic Personality Scale, and also completed a measure of their
   ability to recognize affect in pictures of faces. After receiving false
   success feedback on another task to induce a positive mood, they
   completed the facial affect recognition measure again. Although we
   expected to find a relationship between higher Hypomanic Personality
   Scale (HPS) scores and an impaired ability to recognize negative facial
   affect after a positive mood induction, this was not found. Rather,
   there was a significant interaction between HPS scores and happiness
   level, such that individuals with higher scores on the HPS who also
   reported higher levels of happiness were particularly adept at
   identifying subtle facial expressions of happiness. This finding expands
   a growing literature linking manic tendencies to sensitivity to positive
   stimuli and demonstrates that this sensitivity may have bearing on
   interpersonal interactions.}},

Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{1. Larvae of a Myrmecaelurus sp. are unique among antlions because they
   have two prey-capture methods; they either ambush prey at the surface,
   or dig pit traps that prey fall in to. It was hypothesised that larvae
   will use the capture method that maximises their net rate of energy
   gain, which will be influenced by food availability (encounter rate) and
   by past energy inputs (body condition).
   2. Costs were estimated by measuring resting and activity metabolic
   rates and determining the duration of pit maintenance at various
   encounter rates with ants that served as prey. Benefits were estimated
   from the energy gained per ant captured at different encounter rates.
   3. Net energy gained was higher with a pit than without one, and was
   influenced more by the differences in prey capture rate between the two
   capture methods, and less by the differences in energy costs associated
   with each method. The proportion of larvae that constructed pits was
   higher when they were in intermediate body condition than when in good
   or in poor body condition.
   4. Thus, the use of one capture method or the other depends on a
   combination of the influences of past net energy gain and the antlion's
   most recent change in encounter rate with prey. Ambushing without a pit
   may serve as a default when physiological constraints limit the larvae's
   ability to invest in pit construction and maintenance, or when larvae
   are sated, and saving the energy of pit construction and maintenance is
   worthwhile.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Increased dietary fat intake is a precipitating factor for
   the development of obesity and associated metabolic disturbances.
   Physically active individuals generally have a reduced risk of
   developing these unhealthy states, but the underlying mechanisms are
   poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of
   feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) on obesity development and fuel
   homeostasis in male and female mice with a trait for increased physical
   activity and in their controls.
   Methods: Male and female mice selectively bred for a high level of wheel
   running behavior over 30 generations and nonselected controls
   (background strain Hsd:ICR) were maintained on a standard lab chow
   high-carbohydrate diet (HCD) or on an HFD (60\% fat). Food intake, body
   weight, indirect calorimetry parameters, spontaneous locomotor activity
   and several hormones relevant to metabolism and energy balance were
   measured.
   Results: On HFD, mice reduced food intake and increased body fat mass
   and plasma leptin levels, with the notable exception of the selected
   females, which increased their ingested calories without any effects on
   body mass or plasma leptin levels. In addition, they had an elevated
   daily energy expenditure (DEE), increased spontaneous cage activity
   (similar to 700\% relative to controls) and higher resting metabolic
   rate (RMR) on the HFD compared with feeding the HCD. The selected males
   also had a higher DEE compared with controls, but no interaction with
   diet was observed. On HCD, adiponectin levels were higher in selected
   male, but not female, mice relative to controls. A marked increase in
   the level of plasma adiponectin was observed on the HFD in selected
   females, an effect of diet that was not observed in selected males.
   Conclusion: Genetically based high locomotor activity renders female,
   but not male, mice resistant to HFD-induced obesity by alterations in
   behavioral, endocrine and metabolic traits that facilitate fat
   utilization rather than limiting HFD intake. International Journal of

Number = {{3-4}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an individual-based model, MORPH, that has been
   designed to predict the effect of environmental change on foraging
   animal populations. The key assumptions of MORPH are that individuals
   within populations behave in order to maximise their perceived fitness,
   but that perceived fitness may not always be positively related to the
   actual chances of survival and reproduction. MORPH has been
   parameterised for coastal birds on several European sites and predicted
   the effect of environmental change, caused by factors such as habitat
   loss disturbance from humans and sea-level rise on the survival and body
   condition of these species. However, MORPH contains a basic framework to
   describe animal physiology and foraging behaviour, and the distribution
   and abundance of the resources required by these animals. Therefore,
   MORPH is not restricted to coastal birds, and is potentially applicable
   to a wider range of systems. To be applied to a forager system, MORPH
   requires parameters describing (i) the distribution of the food supply
   and how food quality and abundance changes through time; (ii) the rate
   at which foragers consume food given the abundance of food and
   competitors; (iii) the amount of food the forager must consume each day
   to survive; (iv) the distribution and seasonal changes in other factors
   which influence the foraging behaviour and survival of foragers. The
   purpose of this paper is to (i) describe MORPH, (ii) give examples of
   its application, (iii) describe the types of systems to which MORPH can
   be applied, and (iv) publish its source code and a user guide. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{This study examined critical periods in development to determine when

   (4\% NaCl; HN) during the prenatal or early postnatal period (birth to 5
   wk). Offspring were fed normal chow thereafter until testing at 6 mo.
   Body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), fluid intake, salt preference,
   response to amphetamine, open field behavior, plasma adrenocorticotropin
   hormone (ACTH), plasma corticosterone (Cort), and adrenal gland weight
   were measured. BW was similar for all offspring. Offspring from the
   prenatal and postnatal HN group had increased BP, NaCl intake, and salt
   preference and decreased water intake relative to NN offspring. Prenatal
   HN offspring had greater BP than postnatal HN offspring. In response to
   amphetamine, both prenatal and postnatal LN and HN offspring had
   increased locomotor behavior compared with NN offspring. In a novel open
   field environment, locomotion was also increased in prenatal and
   postnatal LN and HN offspring compared with NN offspring. ACTH and Cort
   levels 30 min after restraint stress and adrenal gland weight
   measurement were greater in LN and HN offspring compared with NN
   offspring. These results indicate that early life experience with low-

Abstract = {{The mortality risk from hunting/predation should increase animals'
   vigilance and modify their selection of feeding sites. This risk may
   thus be costly if vigilance interferes with feeding and/or if animals
   select poorer but safer feeding sites. We observed the vigilance
   behaviour of roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, feeding in a fragmented
   landscape during and outside the hunting season and compared food
   availability and local landscape features at these feeding sites with
   random paired sites. Roe deer spent more time vigilant during the
   hunting season than outside it. During the hunting season, vigilance
   decreased as the woodland extent within an 800 m radius increased, but
   this was not the case outside the hunting season. Vigilance decreased
   with increasing distance to houses, both during and outside the hunting
   season. When food is abundant, interference with feeding may be low
   because animals can simultaneously process food (chewing) and be
   vigilant. During the hunting season, the total time spent vigilant while
   chewing increased with increasing food abundance to a lesser extent than
   outside the hunting season, suggesting a higher level of costly
   exclusive vigilance during the hunting season. Outside the hunting
   season animals selected feeding sites that provided more food, but
   during the hunting season, as risk (proximity to houses) was positively
   correlated with food availability, animals no longer selected feeding
   sites on the basis of food availability. Taken together, our results

Abstract = {{Avian incubation behaviour is thought to be influenced mainly by ambient
   temperature and food availability. Field studies, however, have
   generated contradictory results; there is little agreement about the
   relative importance of food and temperature and how different components
   of incubation behaviour are affected by them. To date, no studies have
   manipulated both food availability and nest temperature in a controlled
   experiment, making it impossible to assess any potential interaction
   between food and temperature. We experimentally increased both food
   availability and ambient temperature during incubation in the northern
   mockingbird. Our results show that both food availability and
   temperature influence incubation behaviour. Increasing food availability
   enabled females to spend more time on the nest and in self- maintenance
   activities when off the nest. Increasing nest temperature caused females
   to spend less time incubating and to make more trips to and from the
   nest. When both food and temperature were increased, their effects on
   incubation time offset each other. These changes in incubation patterns
   had little effect on fitness, although embryo mass was lowest in the
   treatment in which only heat was increased, suggesting that heat may
   stress embryos, but not when extra food is also provided. Perhaps the
   reason previous studies have yielded contradictory results is that food
   and temperature offset each other in complex ways that could obscure
   their individual effects. Indeed, our experiment shows that food and
   temperature both affect avian incubation behaviour, but that different
   trade- offs apply to each environmental factor. (C) 2008 The Association

Abstract = {{Spiders alter web architecture in response to many environmental
   factors. Yet, the functional implications of this behavioural plasticity
   are poorly understood, especially for spiders that spin long-lasting
   webs such as cobwebs. The western black widow spins a three-dimensional
   web that captures terrestrial prey and can persist for many days.
   However, the shape of the cobweb depends upon changes in the spider's
   body condition. Starved spiders invest more silk in sticky gumfooted
   threads, whereas sated spiders invest more silk in supporting threads.
   We tested the hypothesis that the increased investment in sticky
   gumfooted threads by starved spiders functions to improve the prey
   capture of their webs. Regardless of intrinsic foraging motivation, both
   fed and starved spiders captured more prey, more quickly and more
   efficiently, when hunting on a web that was spun by a starved spider.
   Our study shows that cobweb spiders actively manipulate web-spinning
   behaviours in ways that alter the functions of their webs and that even
   spiders spinning relatively long-lasting webs may use behavioural
   plasticity to respond to changing selective pressures in their

Abstract = {{Bird parents can alert predators to the location of their nest. One
   mitigating option is that parents reduce their nest visitation rate in
   exchange for a lower predation risk. Here, using field data and
   experiments, we show that Siberian jay Perisoreus infaustus parents
   adjust feeding visit rates depending on an interaction of 3 factors:
   predator activity, nest concealment, and food availability. The rate of
   nest visits increased with the degree of nest concealment; yet, this
   relationship was modified by the presence of corvid predators. As the
   vegetation became more dense, parents at sites with high corvid activity
   disproportionately increased their feeding visit rates when compared
   with birds at sites with low corvid activity. We experimentally assessed
   how nesting cover affects this response of parents to the presence of
   corvids by using an Eurasian jay Garrulus glandarius model. Parents
   nesting at open sites ceased nest visits, whereas those nesting in dense
   forest continued feeding, albeit at a lower rate. Cover may thus not
   fully compensate for the effect of predator activity on feeding visit
   rates. However, offspring exposed to high predator activity might still
   receive the same amount of food because parents may adjust load sizes to
   compensate. This idea was confirmed by an experiment showing that in
   areas of high predator activity, food-supplemented birds significantly
   decreased nest visits when compared with nonsupplemented birds. These
   results indicate that some bird species can employ multiple nest-defense
   strategies to reduce predator-attracting nest visits; yet, these
   strategies may carry fitness consequences through reduced offspring

Abstract = {{A positive relationship between the consumption of sweetened dietary
   substances (e.g. saccharin and sucrose) and drug abuse has been reported
   in both the human and other animal literature. The proposed genetic
   contribution to this relationship has been based on evidence from
   behavioral, neurobiological, and linkage studies in heterogeneous and
   homogeneous animal populations. Initial work in several laboratories
   indicated that rodents that are selected for high alcohol consumption
   also display an increased preference for sweets compared with low
   alcohol-consuming animals. More recently, Sprague-Dawley rats have been
   selectively bred based on high saccharin (HiS) or low saccharin (LoS)
   consumption, and these lines represent an ideal opportunity to determine
   whether a reciprocal genetic relationship exists between the consumption
   of sweetened substances and self-administration of drugs of abuse. The
   purpose of this review is to examine a series of studies on the HiS and
   LoS rats for drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior using laboratory
   animal models that represent critical phases of drug abuse in humans.
   The data support the hypothesis that sweet consumption and drug
   self-administration are closely related and genetically influenced.
   Other characteristics of HiS and LoS rats are discussed as possible
   mediators of the genetic differences such as activity, impulsivity,
   novelty reactivity, stress, and emotionality. The interaction of sweet
   preference with biological variables related to drug abuse, such as age,
   sex, and hormonal influences, was considered, as they may be additive
   vulnerability factors with consumption of sweet substances. In the

Abstract = {{As human recreation in natural areas increases, so does the potential
   for disturbance to wildlife, and many factors (environmental,
   disturbance type, experience with humans) influence the impact of
   disturbance. However, there exists no comprehensive examination of the
   effects of human disturbance on ungulate escape responses. I conducted a
   comprehensive review of studies measuring Artiodactyl escape responses
   (e.g., flight initiation distance, distance moved) to experimental
   harassment by humans and vehicles, and meta-analyses aimed at predictive
   questions about the impact of human disturbance on ungulate behavior
   under an optimization framework. I found evidence across studies that
   ungulates pay attention to approacher behavior, have greater perceptions
   of risk when disturbed in open habitats, and females or groups with
   young offspring show greater flight responses than adult groups.
   Increased group size and the presence of hunting showed weak but
   positive heterogeneous effects on flight behavior both between and
   within species. Humans on foot were more evocative than other stimuli
   (vehicles, noises). Populations in areas with higher levels of human
   traffic showed reduced wariness but a lack of alternative sites to move
   to may explain some of this effect. Hunted populations showed
   significantly greater flight responses than non-hunted populations.
   Finally, I suggest five factors to consider when forming predictive
   models of ungulate flight behavior: (1) how seasonal variation in
   reproductive status and body condition effects wariness, (2) the
   relative impacts of lethal and non-lethal human contact, and (3) unique
   natural history traits that may cause differences in flight behavior
   between populations, (4) the availability of alternative sites, and (5)
   shorter distances between feeding sites and refugia can reduce the
   impact of other factors on flight responses. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The pursuit of rewarding experiences motivates everyday human behavior,
   and can prove beneficial when pleasurable, positive consequences result
   (e.g., satisfying hunger, earning a paycheck). However, reward seeking
   may also be maladaptive and lead to risky decisions with potentially
   negative long-term consequences (e.g., unprotected sex, drug use). Such
   risky decision making is often observed during adolescence, a time in
   which important structural and functional refinements occur in the
   brain's reward circuitry. Although much of the brain develops before
   adolescence. critical centers for goal-directed behavior, such as
   frontal corticobasal ganglia networks, continue to mature. These ongoing
   changes may underlie the increased in risk-taking behavior often
   observed during adolescence. Further, typical development of these
   circuits is vital to out ability to make well-informed decisions;
   atypical developement of the human reward circuitry can have severe
   implications, as is the case in certain clinical and developmental
   conditions (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). This review
   focuses on current research probing the neural correlates of

Abstract = {{Spinal cord injury typically results in limited functional recovery.
   Here we investigated whether therapeutic dietary restriction, a
   multi-faceted, safe, and clinically-feasible treatment, can improve
   outcome from cervical spinal cord injury. The well-established notion
   that dietary restriction increases longevity has kindled interest in its
   potential benefits in injury and disease. When followed for several
   months prior to insult, prophylactic dietary restriction triggers
   multiple molecular responses and improves outcome in animal models of
   stroke and myocardial infarction. However, the efficacy of the
   clinically-relevant treatment of post-injury dietary restriction is
   unknown. Here we report that ``every-other-day fasting{''} (EODF), a
   form of dietary restriction, implemented after rat cervical spinal Cord
   injury was neuroprotective, promoted plasticity, and improved behavioral
   recovery. Without causing weight loss, EODF improved gait-pattern,
   forelimb function during ladder-crossing, and vertical exploration. In
   agreement, EODF preserved neuronal integrity, dramatically reduced
   lesion volume by > 50\%, and increased Sprouting of corticospinal axons.
   As expected, blood beta-hydfoxybutyrate levels, a ketone known to be
   neuroprotective, were increased by 2-3 fold on the fasting days. In
   addition, we found increased ratios of full-length to truncated trkB
   (receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor) in the spinal cord by
   2-6 folds at both 5 days (lesion site) and 3 weeks after injury (caudal
   to lesion site) which may further enhance neuroprotection and
   plasticity. Because EODF is a safe, non-invasive, and low-cost
   treatment, it could be readily translated into the clinical setting of
   spinal cord injury and possibly other insults. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. Despite the accelerating global spread of urbanized habitats and its
   associated implications for wildlife and humans, surprisingly little is
   known about the biology of urban ecosystems.
   2. Using data from a 60-year study period, this paper provides a
   detailed description of how the northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis L. -
   generally considered a shy forest species - colonized the city of
   Hamburg, Germany. Six non-mutually exclusive hypotheses are investigated
   regarding the environmental factors that may have triggered this
   invasion.
   3. The spatio-temporal analysis of 2556 goshawk chance observations
   (extracted from a total data set of 1 174 493 bird observations;
   1946-2003) showed that hawks regularly visited the city centre decades
   before the first successful breeding attempts were recorded. Many
   observations were made in parts of the city where territories were
   established in later years, demonstrating that these early visitors had
   encountered, but not used, potential nest sites.
   4. Pioneer settlement coincided with: (i) an increase in (legal) hunting
   pressure on goshawks in nearby rural areas; (ii) an increase in avian
   prey abundance in the city; and (iii) a succession of severe winters in
   the Greater Hamburg area. On the other hand, there was no evidence to
   suggest that the early stages of the invasion were due to: (i)
   decreasing food availability in rural areas; (ii) major habitat changes
   in the city; or (iii) rural intraguild dynamics forcing hawks into urban
   refugia. While breeding numbers of a potential rural source population
   were at a long-term low when the city was colonized, prior to first
   settlement there was a sharp increase of goshawk chance observations in
   the city and its rural periphery.
   5. The urban population expanded rapidly, and pair numbers began to
   stabilize after about 10 years. Ringing data (219 ringed nestlings from
   70 urban broods; 1996-2000) demonstrated that most urban recruits had
   fledged in the city, but also confirmed considerable gene flow between
   urban and rural habitats. Analysis of chance observations (as raw data
   or as detrended time series) suggested a tight coupling of population
   dynamics inside and outside the city.
   6. City-colonizations such as the one described here provide a valuable
   opportunity to study some fundamental aspects of population ecology on a
   scale at which detailed monitoring is logistically feasible.
   Furthermore, a good understanding of urban ecology has become essential
   for efficient wildlife conservation in modern, human-altered
   environments.}},

Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Invasive species may reduce biodiversity in the long term by displacing
   resident species. Previous studies of geckos have suggested that
   invasive species can displace residents by monopolizing limited
   resources, and this competitive advantage may be exacerbated in
   structurally simple human-altered habitats. Lepidodactylus lugubris is a
   parthenogenetic gecko that comprises four major clones. On many Pacific
   islands A-clones have recently become numerically dominant over several
   other clones. We tested the general hypothesis that A-clones displace
   B-clones in structurally simple habitats owing to behavioural
   differences that influence foraging and aggression. Based on previous
   studies and the pattern of invasion, we predicted that A-clones would
   consume more insects and show higher levels of aggression and social
   dominance than would B-clones. We also tested the hypothesis that
   increasing topographic structure would affect clone behaviour
   asymmetrically and reduce the advantages of invading A-clones. We found
   that A-clones consumed more insects and initiated foraging faster
   compared to B-clones. However, A-clones were not consistently socially
   dominant over B-clones. Habitat structure affected foraging tactics,
   reduced aggression and decreased activity, but clones were affected
   equally and A-clones remained superior foragers in the structurally
   complex habitat. Although B-clones were more active, they were also more
   shy. They occupied and defended shelter more, which may partially
   explain their persistence in forested habitat. We conclude that part of
   the advantage A-clones have in structurally simple human landscapes
   stems from their innate boldness, which increases their ability to
   exploit limited food resources. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that the quality ( i. e. nutritional content)
   of food can have important effects on life history and behaviour. Yet
   few studies have considered the role of food quality for mating. We
   tested the effects of diet quality of prey fed to males and females on
   mating behaviours, sexual cannibalism and egg production in the wolf
   spider, Pardosa milvina. Diet quality was manipulated through
   supplementation of the substrate on which Drosophila melanogaster were
   reared on and prey quantity was held constant. There was no effect of
   diet quality on the occurrence of mating or the timing of copulatory
   behaviours. Contrary to our predictions, females on the high-quality
   diet engaged in more attacks on males before and after mating and were
   more likely to cannibalize males following mating. Hence, females do not
   compensate for low-quality diets by increasing attack rates or
   cannibalism on males. Rather, females on the high-quality diet appear to
   be more voracious predators, consistent with results of some foraging
   studies. Egg production of females that matured and mated in the
   laboratory was not affected by diet quality. However,field- caught adult
   females produced eggsacs more quickly when reared on the high-quality
   diet. Our results suggest that the quality of prey can limit the latency
   to female egg production. These results highlight the need for more
   research on the role of food quality for mating interactions and the
   mechanisms responsible for more voracious feeding by females on
   high-quality diets. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Most research on sexual cannibalism has focused on factors influencing

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To discover whether eating behaviour traits show continuity
   and stability over childhood.
   Subjects/Methods: Mothers of 428 twin children from the Twins Early
   Development Study participated in a study of eating and weight in 1999
   when the children were 4 years old. Families were contacted again in
   2006 when the children were aged 10 years, with complete data on 322
   children; a response rate of 75\%. At both times, mothers completed the
   Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ) for each child. Continuity
   was assessed with correlations between scores at the two time points,
   and stability by changes in mean scores over time.
   Results: For all CEBQ subscales, correlations between the two time
   points were highly significant ( P-values <0.001). For satiety
   responsiveness, slowness in eating, food responsiveness, enjoyment of
   food, emotional overeating and food fussiness, correlations ranged from
   r = 0.44 to 0.55, with lower continuity for emotional undereating
   (r=0.29). Over time, satiety responsiveness, slowness in eating, food
   fussiness, and emotional undereating decreased, while food
   responsiveness, enjoyment of food and emotional overeating increased.
   Conclusions: Eating behaviours, including those associated with a
   tendency to overeat, emerge early in the developmental pathway and show
   levels of individual continuity comparable to stable personality traits.
   Appetitive traits related to higher satiety tended to decrease with
   maturation, while those associated with food responsiveness tended to
   increase. This pattern is consistent with strong tracking of body mass
   index alongside a progressive increase in the risk of obesity.}},

Abstract = {{1. Marine invertebrates use egg nutrients to develop the functional
   feeding larva and then enter a facultative feeding period (FFP) when
   development can proceed without food because larvae are supported by
   maternal reserves. Facultative feeding reduces starvation risk and so is
   important for larval success. It may also influence egg size evolution
   because FFP length correlates with egg size.
   2. We quantified energetic lipid (triglyceride, TG) utilisation in unfed
   and fed larvae as an index of larval nutritive condition in the tropical
   echinoid Tripneustes gratilla during the FFP to determine if fed larvae
   would use the buffer provided by endogenous provisions to improve their
   condition or accelerate development. We predicted that: (i) the
   condition of unfed and fed larvae should diverge before egg TG is
   exhausted and/or (ii) that the size of fed larvae should outstrip that
   of unfed larvae.
   3. Temperate echinoplutei exhibit phenotypic plasticity, increasing the
   length of their food capture apparatus (arms) in nutrient-poor
   conditions. We examined the generality of this phenomenon in a
   morphometric analysis of growth in the tropical larva of T. gratilla. We
   hypothesized that plastic arm growth in starved larvae would occur
   before the FFP ends as a bet hedging strategy to prepare for hard times
   ahead when lack of reserves may render this response impossible.
   4. We found that fed larvae diverged in condition (higher TG) but not in
   size compared with starved larvae before egg energetic lipids were
   exhausted. In addition, unfed larvae showed plastic arm growth before
   the end of the FFP.
   5. Lack of divergence in growth of unfed and fed larvae suggests there
   may be an imperative to maintain a nutrient storage buffer against
   starvation due to unpredictable future planktonic food supply. The FFP
   of T. gratilla exceeds 8 days, considerably longer than that of other
   echinoids with similarly sized eggs, emphasizing that egg quality may be
   more important than egg size as a predictor of the FFP in fecundity-time
   models of egg evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Redshanks Tringa totanus that are preyed upon by Sparrowhawks Accipiter
   nisus at the Tyninghame Estuary, Firth of Forth, Scotland, provide an
   example of how the starvation-predation risk trade-off results in
   mortality. In this trade-off, animals cannot always optimize
   anti-predation behaviour because anti-predation behaviours, such as
   avoiding predators, are usually incompatible with foraging behaviours
   that might maximize intake rates. Therefore, as animals compensate for
   starvation risk, predation risk increases. Sparrowhawks are the main
   direct cause of death in Redshanks at Tyninghame. Sparrowhawk attack
   rate is determined by Redshank vulnerability, and vulnerability
   decreases as group size and distance to cover increase, and probably as
   spacing decreases. But reduction of predation vulnerability reduces
   feeding rate because areas away from cover are less food-profitable and
   grouping results in increased interference competition. Increased
   starvation risk in midwinter means Redshanks are forced to feed on
   highly profitable prey, Orchestia amphipods, the behaviour of which
   means that Redshanks are forced to feed vulnerably, in widely spaced
   groups, close to predator-concealing cover. Therefore, it is the
   constraints that limit the ability of Redshanks to feed in large, dense
   flocks away from cover that ultimately lead to mortality. We investigate
   this hypothesis further by testing the prediction that mortality can be
   predicted directly by cold weather and population density. We
   demonstrate that the overall number of Redshanks and the proportion of
   Redshanks killed increase in cold months when controlling for population
   size. We also demonstrate that the proportion of Redshanks killed
   increases when there are fewer Redshanks present, because the success
   rate of hunting Sparrowhawks increases, probably because effective
   management of predation risk through flocking is constrained by a low
   population size. Redshanks therefore provide an example of how directly
   mortality caused by predation arises from starvation risk and other
   constraints that prevent animals from optimizing anti-predation
   behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Second generation antipsychotics (SGA) induce substantial
   weight gain but the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon remain
   speculative.
   Objective: To explore eating behaviors among SGA-treated patients and
   compare them with nonschizophrenic healthy sedentary individuals
   (controls).
   Methods and Procedures: Appetite sensations were recorded before and
   after a standardized breakfast using visual analog scales. Three hours
   after breakfast, a buffet-type meal was offered to participants to
   document spontaneous food intake and food preferences. Satiety quotients
   (SQs) were calculated to determine the satiation of both meals and the
   Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) was used to document eating
   behaviors. Body composition and abdominal fat distribution were
   assessed.
   Results: Compared with controls (n = 20), SGA-treated patients (n = 18)
   showed greater adiposity indices (P <= 0.04). Patients' degree of hunger
   was also higher following the standardized breakfast (P = 0.03).
   Moreover, patients had significantly higher cognitive dietary restraint,
   disinhibition, and susceptibility to hunger scores than the reference
   group (P <= 0.05). Disinhibition in the reference group was positively
   associated with hunger triggered by external cues (r = 0.48, P = 0.03)
   whereas internal cues seem to mainly regulate emotional susceptibility
   to disinhibition in patients (r = 0.56, P = 0.02). Higher strategic
   restraint behavior in patients was associated with decreased satiation
   right after the buffet-type meal (r = -0.56, P = 0.02).
   Discussion: These exploratory findings suggest that patients under SGA
   seem to develop disordered eating behaviors in response to altered
   appetite sensations and increased susceptibility to hunger, a factor
   which may influence the extent of body weight gain triggered by these
   drugs.}},

Abstract = {{Prevalence of obesity in preschool children has increased dramatically
   in recent years. The preschool years (age 3-6 years) have been regarded
   as critical for the programming of energy balance, via the concept of
   early `adiposity rebound'. Children who undergo early adiposity rebound
   are at increased risk of later obesity. Recent evidence suggests that
   associations between timing of adiposity rebound and later obesity may
   not reflect programming, but might denote that `obesogenic' growth
   trajectories are often established by the preschool period. Studies of
   objectively-measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour in
   preschool children show that levels of physical activity are typically
   low and sedentary behaviour high. The review of evidence presented here
   is supportive of the hypothesis that physical activity is protective
   against obesity in the preschool period, and that sedentary behaviour,
   particularly television viewing, is obesogenic. Definitive evidence on
   dose-response relationships between physical activity, sedentary
   behaviour and obesity remain unclear. Dose-response evidence could be
   obtained fairly readily by intervention and longitudinal observational
   studies that use accelerometry in preschool children. The
   generalisability of much of the evidence base is limited and there is a
   need for research oil the influence of physical activity and sedentary
   behaviour in the preschool years in the aetiology of obesity in the
   developing world.}},

Abstract = {{Prey scarcity compromises population survival, especially for specialist
   predators. Supplementary feeding is a management tool that can be
   applied to reverse the decline of food-limited populations. We analyse
   how a population of Iberian lynx, a threatened food specialist,
   initially reacted to, and subsequently used, supplementary food.
   Twenty-seven feeding stations (FS) with domestic rabbits were placed in
   the Donana Biological Reserve, SW Spain, between 2002 and 2005. We
   recorded lynx tracks inside and around stations to analyse
   spatio-temporal patterns of use, as well as the performance of several
   station designs. Iberian lynx used 62\% of the FS installed, and
   consumed most of the supplied food. All station designs were used and
   food provision apparently covered the energetic needs of the lynx
   inhabiting the reserve. There was spatial aggregation in the use of the
   FS. Fourteen weeks were needed on average for lynx to become familiar
   with feeding stations and making a regular use of the supplementary
   food. Seasonal variations in consumption frequency appeared to be
   modulated by fluctuations of wild rabbit numbers throughout its annual
   cycle as well as by variation in energy demand of breeding females. The
   Iberian lynx responded positively to our supplementary feeding
   programme. We show that this technique allows the persistence of lynx
   populations during long periods in areas where wild rabbits are
   extremely scarce. Supplementary food may be used to sustain lynx
   whenever rabbit populations need recovery, as well as in the context of
   lynx restocking or reintroduction programmes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Immigration, emigration, migration, and redistribution describe
   processes that involve movement of individuals. These movements are an
   essential part of contemporary ecological models, and understanding how
   movement is affected by biotic and abiotic factors is important for
   effectively modeling ecological processes that depend on movement. We
   asked how phenotypic heterogeneity (body size) and environmental
   heterogeneity (food resource level) affect the movement behavior of an
   aquatic snail (Tarebia granifera), and whether including these
   phenotypic and environmental effects improves advection-diffusion models
   of movement. We postulated various elaborations of the basic
   advection-diffusion model as a priori working hypotheses. To test our
   hypotheses we measured individual snail movements in experimental
   streams at high- and low-food resource treatments. Using these
   experimental movement data, we examined the dependency of model
   selection on resource level and body size using Akaike's Information
   Criterion (AIC). At low resources, large individuals moved faster than
   small individuals, producing a platykurtic movement distribution;
   including size dependency in the model improved model performance. In
   stark contrast, at high resources, individuals moved upstream together
   as a wave, and body size differences largely disappeared. The model
   selection exercise indicated that population heterogeneity is best
   described by the advection component of movement for this species,
   because the top-ranked model included size dependency in advection, but
   not diffusion. Also, all probable models included resource dependency.
   Thus population and environmental heterogeneities both influence
   individual movement behaviors and the population-level distribution
   kernels, and their interaction may drive variation in movement behaviors
   in terms of both advection rates and diffusion rates. A behaviorally
   informed modeling framework will integrate the sentient response of
   individuals in terms of movement and enhance our ability to accurately
   model ecological processes that depend on animal movement.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of prey to respond to novel predator cues may depend on the
   generality or specificity of the response to predator cues. We used
   laboratory behavioral experiments to examine the ability of tadpoles of
   three species of anurans (American toad, Bufo americanus; bullfrog, Rana
   catesbeiana; and green frog, R. clamitans) to respond to the presence of
   two native potential predators (bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus; and
   largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides) and one non-native potential
   predator (goldfish, Carassius auratus). We also examined the effect of
   tadpole size on the behavioral responses of American toads and green
   frogs to predator cues. All three species of tadpoles responded to the
   presence of predator cues, although the specific responses varied among
   species. American toads and green frogs reduced activity in the presence
   of at least some fish cues, but bullfrog tadpoles did not change their
   activity. Bullfrogs decreased use of vegetation in the presence of some
   predator cues, whereas American toads and green frogs did not. American
   toads only responded to the presence of bluegill cues but not the other
   fish predator cues, whereas bullfrogs and green frogs responded more
   generally to the fish predators. In both American toads and green frogs,
   tadpole size affected behavior. For American toads, activity increased,
   as did the use of the vegetated side of the aquarium, in larger
   tadpoles. Not only did size affect American toad behavior, but it also
   influenced the responses of the tadpoles to predator cues. For green
   frogs, activity decreased in larger tadpoles. Our results suggest that
   behavioral responses of tadpoles to predator cues can be influenced by
   both the identity of the predator and the prey, as well as the size of
   the potential prey.}},

Abstract = {{In a series of experiments, we investigated the effects of food
   availability and risk frequency on the dynamics of predator-induced
   changes in growth and morphology of prey fish using goldfish (Carassius
   auratus) as our test species. In experiment 1, we fed goldfish high or
   low food rations and exposed them to either alarm cues from
   conspecifics, cues from swordtails or a water control. After 60 days,
   goldfish in the alarm cue treatment significantly increased their body
   depth and body weight but had smaller body length than goldfish exposed
   to swordtails cues or water, likely reducing their vulnerability to
   gape-limited predators. Importantly, food level had an impact on the
   amplitude of the morphological changes. In experiment 2, goldfish were
   exposed to two different frequencies of predation cues or a water
   control for 50 days. The cues were either continued or discontinued from
   day 51 to 100, and all cues were resumed from day 101 to 150. We found
   that goldfish exposed to predation cues increased their depth and weight
   at a faster rate than did the goldfish exposed to water, and of
   particular significance was the fact that frequency of risk had an
   effect on the amplitude of the change. When the cues were interrupted,
   the increase in growth rate parameters was reduced to the level of the
   goldfish exposed to water. However, when the cues were resumed, the rate
   increased to match the growth rate of the goldfish that were
   continuously exposed to the cues. Finally, we staged encounters between
   goldfish of differing morphologies and yellow perch (Perca flavescens)
   and found that deep-bodied goldfish had better survival than the
   shallow-bodied ones. These experiments illustrate the dynamic nature of
   inducible morphological defences.}},

Abstract = {{Collective detection and predation risk dilution are two nonexclusive
   mechanisms that can allow a reduction in antipredator vigilance in large
   animal groups. The two mechanisms make remarkably similar predictions in
   many contexts, and disentangling their relative contribution has proven
   empirically difficult thus far. We examined a situation where predators
   are more likely to attack from one side of the group. Provided that all
   foragers in the group can detect the predator equally well, the
   collective detection hypothesis predicts that all individuals will adopt
   the same vigilance level if this mechanism acted alone. In terms of risk
   dilution, individuals that are on the riskier side of the group, namely
   those on the attack side, are unlikely to benefit to the same extent as
   other groupmates from the presence of companions, and should have a
   higher level of vigilance than more buffered foragers further inside the
   group. We show that semipalmated sandpipers on the riskier side of
   flocks were more vigilant and thus pecked at a lower rate than those in
   the centre of the flocks and those on the less risky side. The
   proportion of successful pecks did not vary with spatial position within
   the flocks, suggesting that differences in food availability did not
   confound the above findings. We conclude that it is unlikely that
   collective detection acted alone and that risk dilution, acting alone or
   in combination with collective detection, shaped antipredator vigilance
   in an avian prey under predation risk. (c) 2008 The Association for the

Abstract = {{A wide variety of fish species release chemical alarm cues upon

   effects of short-term food deprivation on the response to, and the
   production of, chemical alarm cues in the coral reef-dwelling goby
   Asterropteryx semipunctatus (family Gobiidae). Gobies deprived of food
   for 4 days did not react with fright when exposed to conspecific skin
   extracts. However, when the same individuals had been fed ad libitum,
   they responded with a typical alarm reaction to the skin extracts,
   including decreased movement and feeding. In a second experiment, gobies
   were exposed to skin extracts from conspecifics that had been food
   deprived and from conspecifics fed ad libitum. Damaged skin from
   food-deprived individuals did not elicit an alarm response in

Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Whether animal signals convey honest information is a central
   evolutionary question, since selection pressures could, in some
   circumstances, favour dishonesty. A prior study of signalling in hermit
   crabs proposed that the cheliped extension display of Pagurus bernhardus
   might represent such an instance of dishonesty. A limitation of this
   conclusion, however, was that honesty was defined in the context of size
   assessment, neglecting the potential information that displays might
   transmit about signallers' variable internal states. Recent analyses of
   signalling in this same species have shown that its displays provide
   reliable information about the amount of risk crabs are prepared to
   tolerate, which therefore might enable signallers to use these displays
   to honestly convey their motivation to take such risks. Here we test
   this `honest advertisement of motivation' hypothesis by varying crabs'
   need for food and analysing their signalling during simulated feeding
   conflicts against a model. When crabs were starved for 1-5 days, they
   dropped significantly in weight. Despite this decrement in
   resource-holding potential and energy reserves, crabs were more likely
   to perform cheliped extension displays the longer they were food
   deprived. Longer-starved crabs, whose subjective resource value was
   greater, also displayed at a higher rate and were more likely to risk
   seizing the food from the model. We conclude that cheliped extension is
   a reliable indicator of crabs' internal state and suggest how this
   honest signal might operate in conflicts over a variety of other
   resources in addition to food. We propose that future studies detecting
   apparent dishonesty should analyse many possible signal-state
   correlations before concluding a signal is actually dishonest. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{Behaviour and morphology were both shown to differ between 1+ perch from
   two lakes that in earlier studies showed differences in size-specific
   predation risk. As the level of nourishment is known to affect behaviour
   and morphology, we fed perch of the two lakes in tanks for 40 days with
   two food levels, to study whether observed differences remain stable
   with changes in food availability. The perch fed in excess grew
   significantly, while the perch at the low food conditions lost weight,
   clearly indicating undernourishment. In aquarium experiments, the
   starved perch from both lakes were much bolder in the trade-off between
   foraging and predator avoidance than their well-fed conspecifics. In
   addition, the shape of perch differed significantly between feeding
   treatments. At low food levels perch got a more slender body, while at
   high food levels they developed a deeper body and a relatively smaller
   head. Independent of feeding level, the comparison between the two lakes
   revealed a clearly deeper body and a larger head area for one
   population, a shape difference that remained stable after the feeding
   period. The results give evidence that the level of nourishment is an
   important factor that quickly alters risk-taking behaviour. In body
   morphology, however, more stable shape characteristics must be
   distinguished from more flexible ones. Consequently, the level of
   nourishment is a potential factor that may quickly hide other proximate
   cues and must be considered attentively in studies, in which shape
   changes and behaviour are related to environmental factors like diet,
   predation pressure or habitat diversity.}},

Abstract = {{1. Human outdoor recreational activities are increasing and have a
   significant impact on wildlife. There are few methods suitable for
   investigating the response of rare and endangered species to human
   recreational activities, although the impact can be assessed at various
   scales by measuring both physiological and behavioural responses to
   disturbance.
   2. Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus are suffering strong population
   declines throughout central Europe. We examined the effects of ski
   tourism on capercaillie habitat use and adrenocortical activity,
   measured non-invasively in droppings.
   3. During three winters, 2003-06, we radio-tracked 13 capercaillie. In
   the southern Black Forest in Germany, we sampled 396 droppings of these
   and additional individuals before and after the start of the ski season.
   We tested whether the intensity of human winter recreational activities
   affected home range location and habitat use, and we identified those
   factors influencing the concentration of corticosterone metabolites (CM)
   in droppings.
   4. Capercaillie used habitats subject to ski tourism. Although the
   latter did not affect home range location, capercaillie preferred
   undisturbed forests within their home ranges and avoided areas with high
   recreation intensity in the ski season. Faecal CM levels of individuals
   in areas with low recreation intensity were significantly lower than
   those in areas with moderate or high recreation intensity during the
   entire study period.
   5. We conclude that ski tourism affects both habitat use and endocrine
   status in capercaillie, with potential negative consequences on body
   condition and overall fitness.
   6. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates the relevance of
   studying wildlife responses at various temporal and spatial scales, and
   the value of using multiple methods applied to the same individuals to
   monitor the impact of human recreational activities on a free-ranging
   species. In order to protect capercaillie populations, we recommend that
   managers keep forests inhabited by capercaillie free from tourism
   infrastructure and retain undisturbed forest patches within skiing
   areas.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Increased fruit and vegetable intake can reduce cancer risk.
   Information from this study contributes to research exploring health
   disparities in high-risk dietary behavior. Purpose: Changes in fruit and
   vegetable behavior were evaluated to assess the effects of a
   low-intensity, physician-endorsed dietary intervention in a rural
   population. Methods: The study was a randomized trial of 754 patients
   from 3 physician practices in rural Virginia. Low-literacy nutrition
   education materials and personalized dietary feedback were administered
   by mail and telephone. Mixed model analysis of variance was used to
   determine the effect of the intervention on fruit and vegetable intake
   behavior, knowledge, intentions, and self-efficacy at 1, 6, and 12
   months. Findings: The intervention effect was moderated by age, race,
   sex, and education. Intake at 1 and 6 months was increased for older and
   younger participants and those with some college, and further maintained
   at 12 months by those who did not complete high school. African
   Americans in the intervention group displayed significantly greater
   intentions to increase fruit/vegetable intake than whites/others.
   Knowledge of fruit/vegetable recommendations significantly increased in
   the intervention group at 12 months, particularly for men. Conclusions:
   For the rural population, a low-intensity physician-endorsed self-help
   dietary intervention was successful in initiating fruit and vegetable
   dietary changes at 1 and 6 months post-intervention, and increasing
   intentions to change in African Americans. The relationship of the
   moderating effects of age, race, sex and education need to be further
   explored in relation to dietary intervention and dietary behavior change
   for the rural population.}},

Abstract = {{Almost all life histories are phenotypically plastic: that is,
   life-history traits such as timing of breeding, family size or the
   investment in individual offspring vary with some aspect of the
   environment, such as temperature or food availability. One approach to
   understanding this phenotypic plasticity from an evolutionary point of
   view is to extend the optimality approach to the range of environments
   experienced by the organism. This approach attempts to understand the
   value of particular traits in terms of the selection pressures that act
   on them either directly or owing to trade-offs due to resource
   allocation and other factors such as predation risk. Because these
   selection pressures will between environments, the predicted optimal
   phenotype will too. The relationship expressing the optimal phenotype
   for different environments is the optimal reaction norm and describes
   the optimal phenotypic plasticity. However, this view of phenotypic
   plasticity ignores the fact that the reaction norm must be underlain by
   some sort of control system: cues about the environment must be
   collected by sense organs, integrated into a decision about the
   appropriate life history, and a message sent to the relevant organs to
   implement that decision. In multicellular animals, this control
   mechanism is the neuroendocrine system. The central question that this
   paper addresses is whether the control system affects the reaction norm
   that evolves. This might happen in two different ways: first, the
   control system will create constraints on the evolution of reaction
   norms if it cannot be configured to produce the optimal reaction norm
   and second, the control system will create additional selection
   pressures on reaction norms if the neuroendocrine system is costly. If
   either of these happens, a full understanding of the way in which
   selection shapes reaction norms must include details of the
   neuroendocrine control system. This paper presents the conceptual
   framework needed to explain what is meant by a constraint or cost being
   created by the neuroendocrine system and discusses the extent to which
   this occurs and some possible examples. The purpose of doing this is to
   encourage endocrinologists to take a fresh look at neuroendocrine
   mechanisms and help identify the properties of the system and situations
   in which these generate constraints and costs that impinge on the
   evolution of phenotypic plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Feeding adult rats with high fat (HF) diets can alter their hypothalamic
   pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis responsiveness. In the present study, we
   examined the effect of a high fat diet, applied in rats from weaning to
   puberty, on their behavior and HPA axis status at puberty onset. Wistar
   rats of both sexes were fed postweaning with two diets containing either
   24\% fat (high fat, HF) or 4.3\% fat (normal chow) by weight. HF
   enhanced puberty onset in female rats, without increasing body weight
   gain in either sex, compared with chow-fed animals. In the forced swim
   test, HF males exhibited a more active behavioral response on the first
   day, whereas HF females a more passive response during the second day of
   the test, as compared with their chow-fed counterparts. In the open
   field test, HF females showed increased sniffing but reduced rearing,
   compared with chow-fed females and were less explorative than HF males
   in the central arena. All animals could learn and recall a water maze
   task though HF males spent more time in the opposite quadrant than
   chow-fed males during memory test. The HPA axis status of these animals
   was investigated under basal conditions. Pubertal fat-fed males had
   lighter adrenals, while females heavier ones, compared with their
   counterparts. In addition, plasma corticosterone levels of female rats
   were increased and glucocorticoid receptor levels in their hypothalamus
   were reduced due to fat diet, while in males no such changes were
   detected. We conclude that HF feeding during the prepubertal period can
   affect behavior and the HPA axis of rats at puberty onset, well before
   the appearance of the obese state, in a sexually dimorphic manner. Fat
   diet impacted more the female HPA axis, suggesting that their system is
   more sensitive to fat-induced nutritional imbalance during adolescence.
   Present data suggest that the fat-induced nutritional imbalance in young
   females may lead to neuroendocrine dysfunction that in turn may trigger
   the appearance of stress-related disorders during adolescence. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{Laboratory rats are routinely killed using a gradually increasing
   concentration of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) gas. However, CO, exposure has
   been shown to cause aversion and to increase exploratory and escape
   behaviours in rats. We examined whether these responses are due, in
   part, to novelty, using two different approaches. For the first
   experimental approach, we used approach-avoidance testing to examine gas
   aversion by pairing gas exposure with a food reward. Rats were tested
   with repeated exposure to a gradually increasing concentration of either
   CO, (Experiment 1) or a novel odour (Experiment 2) to determine whether
   these stimuli cause aversion, and to document whether rats show
   habituation to these stimuli. We reasoned that aversion associated with
   novelty would decline with repeated exposure, but that aversion due to
   other factors would not. During control sessions in Experiment 1, rats
   were tested with air and they ate for an average of 266 +/- 4 s (mean
   S.E.M.). However, on the four CO(2) test days they stopped eating after
   only 30 +/- 2 s. Across the first three days of testing with CO(2), the
   latency for rats to stop eating and leave the test cage did not change,
   and the average CO(2) concentrations at these time points were 11 and
   14\%, respectively. On the final day of testing with CO(2), after eight
   additional days of CO(2) exposure, these latencies had increased
   slightly, but rats were still leaving the chamber at only 18\% CO(2). In
   contrast, rats in Experiment 2 showed similar latencies to stop eating
   and leave the test cage with both air and a novel odour (232 versus 235
   +/- 14 s), and their responses did not change with repeated exposure.
   These results suggest that novelty has only a minor effect on rats'
   aversion to CO(2). For the second experimental approach, we examined the
   behavioural responses of rats during baseline and during exposure to a
   gradually increasing concentration of either CO(2) or peppermint odour
   (Experiment 3) to determine which of the behavioural responses observed
   during CO(2) exposure can be attributed to novelty. In comparison to
   baseline, rats that underwent forced exposure to either CO(2) or a novel
   odour showed increased activity and rearing, and spent more time with
   the nose touching the cage lid. However, only one of 16 rats performed
   escape behaviours during exposure to the novel odour, while 10 of 16
   rats performed escape behaviours during CO(2) exposure. These results
   indicate that exploratory behaviours observed during CO(2) exposure
   could be due to novelty, but that escape behaviours are not. Both of the
   experimental approaches indicate that novelty accounts for only a minor
   portion of rats' responses to CO(2) exposure. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Maintenance of demographically and genetically self-sustaining
   populations in captivity can assist conservation of threatened species.
   Captivity can, however, lead to changes in phenotype, though to date
   this issue has received little attention in reptiles. We compared
   phenotypic differences in the now critically-endangered Otago skink
   (Oligosoma otagense) between wild specimens (Otago, southern New
   Zealand) and in captivity (North Island). Individuals of this
   long-lived, viviparous species have been maintained up to three
   generations in captivity, primarily by private herpetoculturists, but
   increasingly there is interest in integrating management of captive
   stocks with conservation in situ. For the same snoutvent length, captive
   skinks pooled across three colonies had a significantly heavier body
   mass, wider tail base, longer tail (juveniles only), faster growth rate
   and much slower sprint speed than in the wild. Captive skinks also
   lacked ectoparasitic mites and haemogregarine parasites, and experienced
   warmer temperatures with probably greater access to food. Our study
   demonstrates the importance of not treating captive management for
   conservation as a tool of last resort. Important questions, if
   captive-raised animals are to be released to the wild, are is it better
   for released skinks to run swiftly or to be heavy-bodied, and what role
   does reinfestation with native parasites have in determining this
   balance? We also recommend genetic analysis and studbook management of
   captive stocks, research to determine implications of heavy body mass
   for reproduction in captivity, and production of at least some offspring
   for release inside larger enclosures within the local climate. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{There is a general trend that parasitism risk declines as latitude
   increases. Host populations breeding at high latitudes should therefore
   invest less in costly immune defenses than populations breeding in
   temperate or tropical zones, although it is unknown if such an effect is
   mediated by environmental (photoperiodic) or genetic factors or both.
   Acquired immune function (humoral, cell-mediated) and behavioral
   sickness responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; mimics bacterial
   infection) were assessed in two subspecies of white-crowned sparrow
   (Zonotrichia leucophrys) that breed at different latitudes in western
   North America. Zonotrichia l. gambelii (GWCS) is a high-latitude breeder
   (47-68 degrees N) while Z. l. pugetensis (PWCS) breeds at temperate
   latitudes (40-49 degrees N). Captive males of each subspecies were
   acclimated to (1) a short day (non-breeding) photoperiod (8L:16D), (2)
   the breeding photoperiod of PWCS (16L:8D), or (3) the breeding
   photoperiod of GWCS (20L:4D). Photoperiod was manipulated because
   shorter day lengths may enhance immune function. In support of a genetic
   effect, humoral responses to diphtheria-tetanus vaccination were
   significantly higher in PWCS compared to GWCS, regardless of
   photoperiod. There were no differences in cell-mediated responses to
   phytohemagglutinin (PHA) between subspecies or among photoperiods. For
   sickness responses to LPS, a significant interaction between photoperiod
   and subspecies was found, with long day GWCS producing stronger sickness
   responses (losing more weight, eating less) than short day GWCS and PWCS
   on all day lengths. However, these effects were influenced by
   photoperiodic changes in body condition. In conclusion, we find evidence
   for genetic control of immune responses across latitude, but no support
   for environmental (photoperiodic) regulation. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Antipredator defenses are expected to decrease toward higher latitudes
   because predation rates are predicted to decrease with latitude.
   However, latitudinal variation in predator avoidance and defense
   mechanisms has seldom been studied. We studied tadpole antipredator
   defenses in seven Rana temporaria populations collected along a 1500-km
   latitudinal gradient across Sweden, along which previous studies have
   found increasing tadpole growth and development rates. In a laboratory
   common garden experiment, we measured behavioral and morphological
   defenses by raising tadpoles in the presence and absence of a predator
   (Aeshna dragonfly larva) in two temperature treatments. We also
   estimated tadpole survival in the presence of free-ranging predators and
   compared predator densities between R. temporaria breeding ponds
   situated at low and high latitudes. Activity and foraging were generally
   positively correlated with latitude in the common garden experiment.
   While all populations responded to predator presence by decreasing
   activity and foraging, high-latitude populations maintained higher
   activity levels in the presence of the predator. All populations
   exhibited defensive morphology in body and tail shape. However, whereas
   tail depth tended to increase with latitude in the presence of predator,
   it did not change with latitude in the absence of the predator. Predator
   presence generally increased larval period and decreased growth rate. In
   the southern populations, predator presence tended to have a negative
   effect on metamorphic size, whereas in the northern populations
   predators had little or a positive effect on size. Latitude of origin
   had a strong effect on survival in the presence of a free-ranging
   predator, with high-latitude tadpoles experiencing higher mortality than
   those from the low latitudes. In the wild, predator densities were
   significantly lower in high-latitude than in mid-latitude breeding
   ponds. Although the higher activity level in the northern populations
   seems to confer a significant survival disadvantage under predation
   risk, it is probably needed to maintain the high growth and development
   rates. However, the occurrence of R. temporaria at high latitudes may be
   facilitated by the lower predator densities in the north.}},

Abstract = {{Eating disorders appear with relative frequency in sports, such as
   gymnastics, figure skating or resistance sports, in which weight control
   is important. Their incidence is greater in women, frequently appearing
   a low self-esteem, a distorted body image in which the body is perceived
   with an excess of weight, inefficiency, perfectionism and a sense of
   control loss, with compensatory attempts exerted through food
   manipulation and the use of inadequate methods of control weight.
   Frequently, they are associated in female athletes to irregularities of
   the menstrual cycle, reduction of the bone mineral density and
   osteoporosis, giving rise to so-called female athlete triad.
   Cardiovascular problems, a greater incidence of fractures, and muscular
   power and resistance losses which impair performance, can also develop.
   Between the risk for their appearance are attempts to lose weight, often
   by recommendation of the coach, increases of training loads associated
   to weight losses, characteristics of the personality that take to
   excessive preoccupation by body image, or injuries and traumatisms.
   Treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach, with participation of
   physicians, psychologists/psychiatrists, nutricionists, coaches and
   family, being specially important the emphasis on preventive measures.}},

Abstract = {{Under-nutrition and obesity are multi-determined. The multiple
   determinants of either under-nutrition or obesity are linked, thus
   forming a system of influences. How a system of linked multiple
   influences functions is illustrated with specific reference to early
   nutritional deficiencies. The traditional explanation that child
   nutritional deficiencies are due to food scarcity or a lack of family
   economic resources has been increasingly questioned. In the UNICEF
   extended care model, deficiencies in children's nutritional intake are
   due to family economic and food resources and to specific caregiver
   resources. The role of three caregiver resources, maternal education,
   intelligence and depression are reviewed. Evidence also is presented on
   the need to take into account child characteristics, as an additional
   set of influences on nutritional deficiencies. Using a systems
   perspective this review documents how the relation to nutrition of
   family and caregiver resources and child characteristics can be mediated
   or moderated by alternative linked influences such as cultural
   characteristics, maternal input into family economic decisions and
   social support networks. Based on this review a revised extended care
   model is presented, explicitly integrating child characteristics and
   specific mediating and moderating links between multiple predictors of
   child nutritional deficiencies. This is followed by a brief discussion
   on how a systems perspective can also apply to the study of childhood

Abstract = {{Anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are related disorders of
   unknown etiology that most commonly begin during adolescence in women.
   AN and BN have unique and puzzling symptoms, such as restricted eating
   or binge-purge behaviors, body image distortions, denial of emaciation,
   and resistance to treatment. These are often chronic and relapsing
   disorders, and AN has the highest death rate of any psychiatric
   disorder. The lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of this illness
   has hindered the development of effective interventions, particularly
   for AN. Individuals with AN and BN are consistently characterized by
   perfectionism, obsessive-compulsiveness, and dysphoric mood. Individuals
   with AN tend to have high constraint, constriction of affect and
   emotional expressiveness, ahendonia and asceticism, whereas individuals
   with BN tend to be more impulsive and sensation seeking. Such symptoms
   often begin in childhood, before the onset of an eating disorder, and
   persist after recovery, suggesting they are traits that create a
   vulnerability for developing an ED. There is growing acknowledgement
   that neurobiological vulnerabilities make a substantial contribution to
   the pathogenesis of AN and BN. Considerable evidence suggests that
   altered brain serotonin (5-HT) function contributes to dysregulation of
   appetite, mood, and impulse control in AN and BN. Brain imaging studies,
   using 5-HT specific ligands, show that disturbances of 5-HT function
   occur when people are ill, and persist after recovery from AN and BN. It
   is possible that a trait-related disturbance of 5-HT neuronal modulation
   predates the onset of AN and contributes to premorbid symptoms of
   anxiety, obsessionality, and inhibition. This dysphoric temperament may
   involve an inherent dysregulation of emotional and reward pathways which
   also mediate the hedonic aspects of feeding, thus making these
   individuals vulnerable to disturbed appetitive behaviors. Restricting
   food intake may become powerfully reinforcing because it provides a
   temporary respite from dysphoric mood. Several factors may act on these
   vulnerabilities to cause AN to start in adolescence. First,
   puberty-related female gonadal steroids or age-related changes may
   exacerbate 5-HT dysregulation. Second, stress and/or cultural and
   societal pressures may contribute by increasing anxious and obsessional
   temperament. Individuals with AN may discover that reduced dietary
   intake, by reducing plasma tryptophan availability, is a means by which
   they can modulate brain 5-HT functional activity and anxious mood.
   People with AN enter a vicious cycle which accounts for the chronicity
   of this disorder because caloric restriction results in a brief respite
   from dysphoric mood. However, malnutrition and weight loss, in turn,
   produce alterations in many neuropeptides and monoamine function,
   perhaps in the service of conserving energy, but which also exaggerates
   dysphoric mood. In summary, this article reviews findings in brain
   chemistry and neuroimaging that shed new light on understanding the
   psychopathology of these difficult and frustrating disorders. (C) 2007

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN FUNCTIONS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: While low-grade inflammation has consistently been observed
   in subjects with depression, studies on the possible relationship
   between inflammation and other aspects of brain function are as yet
   sparse. In this study, we aimed to investigate the possible association
   between serum levels of the inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP)
   and personality traits.
   Methods: In this study, serum levels of high-sensitivity CRP were
   determined by ELISA in a population of 270 42-year-old women recruited
   from the population registry who had been assessed using the Temperament
   and Character Inventory. Self-reported previous or ongoing depression
   was also recorded. Unpaired two-tailed t-tests were used for comparison
   between two groups and correlations were evaluated by the calculation of
   Pearson'sr-coefficient.
   Results: The temperament trait harm avoidance was positively (r = 0.227,
   p < 0.05) and the character trait self-directedness was negatively (r =
   -0.261, p < 0.01) associated with serum levels of CRP (p-values
   corrected for multiple comparisons). The correlations between the
   personality traits and CRP were observed also after exclusion of
   subjects reporting ongoing depression (n = 26). Whereas women reporting
   ongoing depression showed significantly increased levels of CRP as
   compared to non-depressed women (n = 155), women reporting a history of
   depression displayed no significant difference in CRP levels as compared
   to women that reported that they had never been depressed.
   Conclusion: Serum levels of CRP in women was found to be associated with
   the personality traits harm avoidance and self-directedness. In
   addition, moderately elevated levels may be a state dependent marker of
   depression.}},

   supplementation of the ewe}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Neonatal lamb mortality represents both a welfare issue (due to the
   considerable suffering and distress) and an important production
   inefficiency. In lambs, approximately 80\% of mortality can be
   attributed to the starvation-mismothering-exposure complex and occurs in
   the first 3 days after birth. It was the object of this review to
   determine the micronutrient(s) most likely to have a positive effect on
   neonatal lamb survival when included above the requirement for that
   micronutrient. Micronutrients discussed were Co, Cu, I, Fe, Mn, Se, Zn,
   vitamins A and E and n-3 fatty acids. For Co, Fe, Mn and Zh, there was
   no evidence of positive responses to supplementation. Cu and I had
   toxicity thresholds that were sufficiently close to requirement that
   supplementing above requirement presented a risk of inducing toxicity.
   In the case of vitamin A while serum concentrations indicated that
   sub-optimal status did exist, long-term buffering from liver stores
   (from grazing) makes experimentation difficult and practical benefits to
   supplementation unlikely. Therefore, the most likely candidates for
   supplementation were Se vitamin E and fatty acids. Fatty acid
   supplementation with fish oils or docosahexaenoic acid-containing algal
   biomass consistently improved lamb vigour but it is unlikely that
   supplementation will be economic. Positive responses to Se
   supplementation throughout gestation were recorded. However, in many
   studies the Se status of control ewes was marginal and there is a need
   for more studies where control ewes are clearly adequate in Se. Positive
   responses to vitamin E supplementation above requirement in the
   last-third of gestation were observed but the optimum dietary inclusion
   of vitamin E and period of feeding during pregnancy still require
   clarification.}},

Abstract = {{Resource selection plasticity and behavioral dominance may in. fluence
   the ability of a species to respond to changes in resource availability,

   requirements. We examined the response of several dominant and
   subordinate cavity-nesting species to a reduction in the availability of
   an essential resource (nesting cavities) using the novel experimental
   approach of blocking the entrances to high-quality cavities. We
   monitored nest abundance on seven treatment and 13 control sites (aspen
   groves in a grassland matrix) in British Columbia, Canada, for two years
   pretreatment (2000-2001), two years during treatment (2002-2003), and
   two years posttreatment (cavities reopened; 2004-2005). At the community
   level, nest abundance declined by 50\% on treatment sites following
   cavity blocking and returned to pretreatment levels following cavity
   reopening. Nest abundance of European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), a
   dominant secondary cavity-nester (SCN), declined by 89\% and failed to
   recover posttreatment. Conversely, nest abundance of Mountain Bluebirds
   (Sialia currucoides; a subordinate SCN) increased following cavity
   blocking and remained high following reopening. Tree Swallows
   (Tachycineta bicolor) were unaffected by cavity blocking. We suggest
   that starlings, while being the dominant SCN, may be limited by
   availability of suitable nest sites, whereas bluebirds may be limited by
   starling abundance. We propose that plasticity in nest site preferences
   of subordinate cavity-nesters may enable them to contend with natural
   variation in availability of critical resources, such as nest cavities
   and food, in addition to coping with interspecific competition. This is
   the. first community-level, multiyear study involving manipulation of

Title = {{Cultural perceptions of healthy weight in rural Appalachian youth}},
Journal = {{RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Rates of overweight among US children have been rising
   over the past three decades. Changes in lifestyle behaviors, including
   dietary and physical activity habits, have been examined thoroughly to
   identify correlates of weight status in children. Youth in rural US
   Appalachia are at a disproportionately greater risk for obesity and
   related health complications. Inadequate physical activity and poor
   dietary habits are two primary causes of obesity that have been noted in
   West Virginia adolescents. Few existing data describes the decisional
   balance in performing lifestyle behaviors, nor the perceptions of these
   youth regarding their beliefs about weight. The purpose of this study
   was to identify the perceptions of a healthy weight in rural Appalachian
   adolescents.
   Methods: Ninth grade students were recruited from classroom
   presentations in four high schools throughout West Virginia. Interested
   parent-caregiver pairs returned forms to indicate interest in
   participation. Separate focus group interviews were conducted
   concurrently with adolescent and parents or caregivers to identify the
   cultural perceptions of a healthy weight. Questions were developed using
   grounded theory to explore how a healthy weight was defined, what
   factors dictate body weight, the perceived severity of the obesity
   issue, and the social or health ramifications of the condition. Verbatim
   transcripts were analyzed to identify dominant themes, and content
   analysis provided text segments to describe the themes. This article
   describes the data obtained from the adolescent focus groups.
   Results: When asked what defined a healthy weight, the adolescents who
   participated in the focus groups placed great value on physical
   appearance and social acceptability. Students believed there was a
   particular number, either an absolute weight or body mass index value
   that determined a healthy weight. These numbers were usually conveyed by
   a physician; however, there was also a general acceptance of being
   `thick' or a reliance on `feeling healthy' as a determinant of
   maintaining a healthy weight. Despite these beliefs, many teens had
   unrealistic and unhealthy perceptions of weight. Female participants
   were more concerned with weight than males, some to the point of
   obsession. Both males and females expressed a social stigma associated
   with overweight. Issues of guilt and diminished self-esteem were
   prevalent. When asked about the extensiveness of the problem of
   childhood overweight, the students indicated that a degree of
   familiarity with being overweight has developed and `you just get used
   to {[} seeing] it.' Because of the rising rates of chronic disease in
   this region, a fear was evident in these youth about the increased risk
   of developing these conditions in those who are overweight. Experiences
   with family members with diabetes and cardiovascular disease fueled
   these concerns, which instilled a fear of becoming overweight in many of
   the students. Many perceptions of healthy weight and appropriate body
   size were shaped by the media and entertainment industry. Additionally,
   some participants admitted to performing unsafe practices to reduce body
   mass, such as very low calorie diets or fasting.
   Conclusions: Youth in rural Appalachia present similar perceptions about
   weight as other children; however, differences in perceived healthy
   lifestyle habits and a general acceptance of a higher average body
   weight present additional challenges to addressing the increasing
   problem of child overweight. Despite the relative isolation of many of
   these communities, the media has a profound impact on weight valuation
   that has been intertwined with school-based health education and
   cultural values of health.
   These data will provide valuable information for the development of
   obesity prevention programs in rural Appalachia.}},

   enhancement}},
Journal = {{SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT PREVENTION AND POLICY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Performance enhancement (PE) is a natural and essential
   ingredient of competitive sport. Except for nutritional supplement
   contamination, accidental use of doping is highly unlikely. It requires
   deliberation, planning and commitment; and is influenced by a host of
   protective and risk factors.
   Hypothesis: In the course of their career, athletes constantly set goals
   and make choices regarding the way these goals can be achieved. The
   cycle of choice-goal commitment-execution feedback on goal
   attainment-goal evaluation/adjustment has numerous exit points, each
   providing an opportunity for behaviour change, which may or may not be
   related to the use of prohibited methods. The interplay between
   facilitating and inhibiting systemic and personality factors, constantly
   influenced by situational factors could result in an outcome vector of
   `doping attitudes', which combines with subjective norms to influence
   intentions to choose prohibited PE methods. These influences also vary
   from one stage of athlete development to the next, making some athletes
   more vulnerable to engaging in doping practices than others, and more
   vulnerable at certain time periods-and not others.
   Testing the hypothesis: Model-testing requires a series of carefully
   planned and coordinated studies. Correlational studies can establish
   relationships where the directionality is not-known or not important.
   Experimental studies with the manipulation of doping expectancies and
   risk factors can be used to demonstrate causality and evaluate potential
   intervention strategies. The final model can be tested via a behavioural
   simulation, with outcomes compared to those expected from literature
   precedence or used as a simulated computer game for empirical data
   collection.
   Implications: A hypothesized life-cycle model of PE identifies
   vulnerability factors across the stages of athlete development with the
   view of informing the design of anti-doping assessment and intervention.
   The model suggests that, instead of focusing on the actual engagement in
   prohibited PE practices, deterrence strategies are likely to be more
   effective if they target the influencing factors at the appropriate
   stage and identify groups of athletes and their respective career
   stages, which pose particular risks of engagement in doping practices.
   This enables a more effective intervention approach by targeting
   specific risk factors and expectancies.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Because individuals high on hostility may be at risk for alcohol
   abuse due to serotonergic dysfunction and greater reactivity to stress,
   we examined the effects of acute dietary tryptophan enhancement and
   stress on mood and craving for alcohol in low-hostile (LoH) and
   high-hostile (HiH) individuals. Methods: Thirty-four LoH and 33 HiH
   heavy social drinkers {[}selection based on the Hostility scale from the
   Buss and Perry Aggression Questionnaire (1992)] received either
   tryptophan-enriched or control diet and underwent a stress-induction
   procedure. Trait differences between the two hostile groups were
   explored using personality, anxiety, and depression questionnaires.
   Mood, craving for alcohol, and salivary cortisol levels (CORT) were
   measured before and after tryptophan and after stress-induction. Heart
   rate (HR) was measured during stress-induction. Results: HiHs compared
   to LoHs scored higher on the depression and anxiety trait scales as well
   in the character dimension Harm Avoidance and reported more of stress
   exposure over the past month. They also showed more negative mood and
   higher craving for alcohol. Diet alone did not produce any subjective or
   physiological effects. Stress increased CORT, HR, negative mood, and
   craving for alcohol. HiHs displayed higher CORT increase and lower
   cardiovascular reactivity in response to stress compared to LoHs.
   Opposite to the predictions, tryptophan enhancement selectively
   facilitated stress-induced increase in craving in the HiHs. Conclusion:
   Among heavy drinkers HiHs report higher craving for alcohol and show
   greater reactivity to stress as measured by CORT and negative mood. The
   effects of stress on craving in HiHs may be mediated by a serotonergic
   mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Wolf, Canis lupus, recolonization of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem
   provides a rare opportunity to identify behaviours facilitating
   coexistence between sympatric canids. We investigated interactions
   between coyotes, Canis latrans, and recolonizing wolves at ungulate
   carcasses in Montana's Madison Range. We used a field-experimental study
   design consisting of a two-level carcass treatment (wolf presence, wolf
   absence) to assess factors influencing coyote risk assessment, carrion
   consumption and aggressive encounters with wolves. Socially dominant
   coyotes (alphas and betas) responded to wolf presence by increasing the
   proportion of time spent vigilant while scavenging. Vigilance behaviour
   was more pronounced when scavenging closer to structurally complex
   vegetation where lateral occlusion inhibited the ability of coyotes to
   scan for, and possibly escape from, returning wolves. Despite greater
   time spent vigilant, alpha coyotes consumed the greatest amount of
   carrion biomass by feeding on carcasses in earlier stages of consumption
   when organs and large muscle tissues were still present. This finding
   suggests that alpha coyotes might trade off greater risk for
   higher-quality food items. Coyotes would aggressively confront wolves:
   numerical advantage by coyotes and the stage of carcass consumption were
   influential in determining whether coyotes were able to displace wolves
   from carcasses. Coyotes relied on a gradient of risk-sensitive
   behaviours, ranging from elevated vigilance to aggressive confrontation,
   to manage risk associated with wolf presence. Identification of these
   behaviours, and their sensitivity to numeric and social factors, is an
   important step in elucidating mechanisms of resource partitioning in
   social canids. The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Reduced fetal growth has been closely associated with an increased risk
   for the development of chronic disease in later life. Accumulating
   evidence indicates that fetal exposure to excess glucocorticoids
   represents a critical mechanism underlying this association.
   Approximately 7\% of pregnant women are at risk of preterm delivery and
   these women are routinely treated with synthetic glucocorticoids (sGC)
   between 24 and 34 of weeks gestation to improve neonatal outcome. Animal
   studies have demonstrated that maternally administered sGC crosses the
   placenta, affecting fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
   development, resulting in changes in HPA axis function that persist
   throughout life. These changes appear to be modulated at the level of
   glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) in
   the brain and pituitary. As the HPA axis interacts with many other
   physiological pathways, the changes in endocrine function are also
   sex-specific and age-dependent. Alterations in behavior, particularly
   locomotion, in animals exposed to sGC in utero have also been
   demonstrated. Consistent with the finding in animal models, emerging
   human data are indicating attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder
   (ADHD)-like symptoms in children exposed to repeated courses of sGC in
   utero. This behavioral phenotype is likely linked to alterations in
   dopamine (DA) signaling, suggesting that sGC are able to permanently
   modify or `program' this system. Finally, it is emerging that changes in
   HPA axis function and behavior following antenatal exposure to sGC are
   transgenerational and likely involve epigenetic mechanisms. A
   comprehensive understanding of the acute and long-term impact of sGC
   exposure in utero is necessary to begin to develop recommendations and
   treatment options for pregnant women at risk of preterm delivery. (C)

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Because hormones mediate physiological or behavioral responses to
   intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli, they can help us understand how animals
   adapt their foraging decisions to energetic demands of reproduction.
   Thus, the hormone corticosterone deserves specific attention because of
   its influence on metabolism, food intake and locomotor activities. We
   examined the relationships between baseline corticosterone levels and
   foraging behavior or mass gain at sea in a diving seabird, the Adelie
   penguin, Pygoscelis adeliae. Data were obtained from free-ranging
   penguins during the brooding period (Adelie Land, Antarctica) by using
   satellite transmitters and time-depth-recorders. The birds were weighed
   and blood sampled before and after a foraging trip (pre-trip and
   post-trip corticosterone levels, respectively). Penguins with elevated
   pre-trip corticosterone levels spent less time at sea and stayed closer
   to the colony than penguins with low pre-trip corticosterone levels.
   These short trips were associated with a higher foraging effort in terms
   of diving activity and a lower mass gain at sea than long trips.
   According to previous studies conducted on seabird species, these
   results suggest that penguins with elevated pre-trip corticosterone
   levels might maximize the rate of energy delivery to the chicks at the
   expense of their body reserves. Moreover, in all birds, corticosterone
   levels were lower post-foraging than pre-foraging. This decrease could
   result from either the restoration of body reserves during the foraging
   trip or from a break in activity at the end of the foraging trip. This
   study demonstrates for the first time in a diving predator the close
   relationships linking foraging behavior and baseline corticosterone
   levels. We suggest that slight elevations in pre-trip corticosterone
   levels could play a major role in breeding effort by facilitating
   foraging activity in breeding seabirds. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Some small mammal populations require human interference to conserve
   rare or threatened species or to minimize adverse effects in plant
   production. Without a thorough understanding about how small rodents
   behave in their environment and consideration of how they react to
   management efforts, management will not be optimal. Social behavior,
   spatial and temporal activity patterns, predator avoidance and other
   behavioral responses can affect pest rodent management. Some of these
   behavioral patterns and their causes have been well studied. However,
   their impact on pest rodent management, especially for novel management
   approaches, is not always clear. Habitat manipulation occurs necessarily
   through land use and intentionally to reduce shelter and food
   availability and to increase predation pressure on rodents. Rodents
   often respond to decreased vegetation height with reduced movements and
   increased risk sensitivity in their feeding behavior. This seems to
   result mainly from an elevated perceived predation risk. Behavioral
   responses may lessen the efficacy of the management because the desired
   effects of predators might be mediated. It remains largely unknown to
   what extent such responses can compensate at the population level for
   the expected consequences of habitat manipulation and how population
   size and crop damage are affected. It is advantageous to understand how

   associated with the mechanism of refugium use (although confounded by
   substrate size), which reduced energy expenditure. Growth (body size and
   mass) was reduced in sand (absence of refugia) relative to growth in
   gravel, regardless of current velocity, and nymphs made almost no
   investment in body length (variation in allometry). The effect of
   current velocity on behavior was less marked in sand than in gravel
   because of a possible confounding effect of direct exposure of nymphs to
   flow on sand (i.e., no available refugia). In sand, individuals were
   located mainly on the food source (erect leaf discs) at current
   velocities of 3 cm/s, but feeding was depressed. Therefore, nymphal

   developmental trajectories depending on current velocity because

Abstract = {{Rationale Early environment can shape the development and function of
   the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system and represents a possible
   risk factor for adult pathologies. One critical variable in the early
   environment is nutrition, and exposure to high fat (HF) in adulthood is
   known to change this DA system.
   Objectives We tested whether perinatal HF intake in rats could have
   long-term effects on DA function and behavior in adult offspring.
   Materials and methods Rat dams were fed either a control (5\% fat, CD)
   or high fat (30\% fat, HF) diet during the last week of gestation and
   lactation, and adult offspring were tested (PND 56-90) after weaning on
   CD. Locomotor responses to acute and repeated doses of D-amphetamine
   (AMP, 0.75 mg/kg bw) were determined as were indices of DA function in
   the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and the
   prefrontal cortex (PFC).
   Results Adult HF offspring displayed increased tyrosine hydroxylase
   expression in the VTA and NAc and significant increases in DA and DOPAC
   content in the NAc, suggesting an elevated DA tone in this target field.
   In the NAc, there were no significant changes in D1, D2 receptors, or DA
   transporter (DAT) levels between diet groups. Perinatal HF feeding
   reduced AMP-induced locomotion and behavioral sensitization to AMP,
   suggesting that early diet might have caused long-lasting
   desensitization of postsynaptic receptor mechanisms in the NAc.
   Conclusions Our results demonstrate that both synthetic activity in VTA
   neurons and the responsiveness of accumbens DA neurons is altered by
   maternal nutrition. These effects subside long after termination of
   exposure to the HF diet.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Foraging behaviour is an essential ecological process
   linking different trophic levels. A central assumption of foraging
   theory is that food selection maximises the fitness of the consumer. It
   remains unknown, however, whether animals use innate or learned
   behaviour to discriminate food rewards. While many studies demonstrated
   that previous experience is a strong determinant of complex food choices
   such as diet mixing, the response to simple nutritional stimuli, such as
   sugar concentrations, is often believed to be innate.
   Results: Here we show that previous experience determines the ability to
   track changes in sugar composition in same-aged individuals of a
   short-lived migratory songbird, the garden warbler (Sylvia borin).
   Although birds received identical foods for seven months prior to the
   experiment, wild-caught birds achieved higher sugar intake rates than
   hand-raised birds when confronted with alternative, differently
   coloured, novel food types. Hand-raised and wild birds did not differ in
   their initial colour selection or overall food intake, but wild birds
   were quicker to adjust food choice to varying sugar intake.
   Conclusion: Over a period of at least seven months, broader previous
   experience translates into a higher plasticity of food choice leading to
   higher nutrient intake. Our results thus highlight the need to address
   previous long-term experience in foraging experiments. Furthermore, they
   show that hand-raised animals are often poor surrogates for testing the
   foraging behaviour of wild animals.}},

Title = {{The emergence of leaders and followers in foraging pairs when the
   qualities of individuals differ}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Foraging in groups offers animals a number of advantages,
   such as increasing their likelihood of finding food or detecting and
   avoiding predators. In order for a group to remain together, there has
   to be some degree of coordination of behaviour and movement between its
   members (which may in some cases be initiated by a decision-making
   leader, and in other cases may emerge as an underlying property of the
   group). For example, behavioural synchronisation is a phenomenon where
   animals within a group initiate and then continue to conduct identical
   behaviours, and has been characterised for a wide range of species. We
   examine how a pair of animals should behave using a state-dependent
   approach, and ask what conditions are likely to lead to behavioural
   synchronisation occurring, and whether one of the individuals is more
   likely to act as a leader.
   Results: The model we describe considers how the energetic gain,
   metabolic requirements and predation risks faced by the individuals
   affect measures of their energetic state and behaviour (such as the
   degree of behavioural synchronisation seen within the pair, and the
   value to an individual of knowing the energetic state of its colleague).
   We explore how predictable changes in these measures are in response to
   changes in physiological requirements and predation risk. We also
   consider how these measures should change when the members of the pair
   are not identical in their metabolic requirements or their
   susceptibility to predation. We find that many of the changes seen in
   these measures are complex, especially when asymmetries exist between
   the members of the pair.
   Conclusion: Analyses are presented that demonstrate that, although these
   general patterns are robust, care needs to be taken when considering the
   effects of individual differences, as the relationship between
   individual differences and the resulting qualitative changes in
   behaviour may be complex. We discuss how these results are related to
   experimental observations, and how the model and its predictions could
   be extended.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of group size and the number of helpers on reproductive
   success is crucial to understand the evolution and maintenance of
   cooperative breeding. In northern Spain, carrion crows form kin-groups
   (three to nine individuals) where up to five individuals contribute to
   rearing the young. Using data from 99 different territories, followed
   over 10 years, we showed that group size was positively correlated with
   the annual number of fledglings produced, after controlling for the
   potential confounding effect of territory quality. This occurred
   through: (1) an increased probability for larger groups of renesting
   after early nest failure; (2) a higher probability of nest success; and
   (3) a higher number of fledglings produced in successful attempts.
   Video-recorded observations at the nests showed that chicks received
   more food in larger groups during the first 10 days of life, when the
   risk of starvation is highest, suggesting a role of allofeeding by
   additional carers in augmenting the reproductive success of a group. In
   crows, indirect and direct benefits through increased production of

Abstract = {{A central question in behavioral ecology has been why animals live in
   groups. Previous theories about the evolution of sociality focused on
   the potential benefits of decreased risk of predation, increased
   foraging or feeding efficiency, and mutual aid in defending resources
   and/or rearing offspring. This paper argues that access to mutualistic
   endosymbiotic microbes is an underappreciated benefit of group living
   and sets out to reinvigorate Troyer's hypothesis that the need to obtain
   cellulolytic microbes from conspecifics influenced the evolution of
   social behavior in herbivores and to extend it to nonherbivores. This
   extension is necessary because the benefits of endosymbionts are not
   limited to nutrition; endosymbionts also help protect their hosts from
   pathogens. When hosts must obtain endosymbionts from conspecifics, they
   are forced to interact. Thus, complex forms of sociality may be more
   likely to evolve when hosts must repeatedly obtain endosymbionts from
   conspecifics than when endosymbionts can be obtained either directly
   from the environment, are vertically transmitted, or when repeated
   inoculations are not necessary. Observations from a variety of taxa are
   consistent with the ideas that individuals benefit from group living by
   gaining access to endosymbionts and the complexity of social behavior is
   associated with the mode of acquisition of endosymbionts. Ways to test
   this theory include (a) experiments designed to examine the effects of
   endosymbionts on host fitness and how endosymbionts are obtained and (b)
   using phylogenetic analyses to examine endosymbiont-host coevolution
   with the goal of determining the relationship between the mode of
   endosymbiont acquisition and host sociality.}},

Abstract = {{Fetal programming encompasses the role of developmental plasticity in
   response to environmental and nutritional signals during early life and
   its potential adverse consequences (risk of cardiovascular, metabolic
   and behavioural diseases) in later life. The first studies in this field
   highlighted an association between poor fetal growth and chronic adult
   diseases. However, environmental signals during early life may lead to
   adverse long-term effects independently of obvious effects on fetal
   growth. Adverse long-term effects reflect a mismatch between early
   (fetal and neonatal) environmental conditions and the conditions that
   the individual will confront later in life. The mechanisms underlying
   this risk remain unclear. However, experimental data in rodents and
   recent observations in humans suggest that epigenetic changes in

   fetal programming. Improvements in our understanding of the biochemical

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We illustrate the theoretical plausibility that fishery removal of
   sharks can indirectly alter predation pressure on different fish species
   via the behavioural responses of mesoconsumers released from predator
   intimidation. Our dynamic state variable model of foraging decisions by
   harbour seals, a mesopredator, predicted indirect effects of the removal
   of Pacific sleeper sharks on two species consumed by seals, Pacific
   herring and walleye pollock, as mediated by seal behaviour. Herring, a
   fatty fish, form near-surface aggregations that often are ephemeral and
   widely dispersed. Pollock are found in the deeper strata preferred by
   sharks and have lower energy density than herring, but also are larger
   and their more continuous distribution potentially makes them the more
   predictable resource for seals. During simulations, predation risk from
   sharks produced an asymmetric trophic cascade mediated by the seal's
   underutilisation of deeper, riskier strata. Risk management by seals
   reduced mortality on pollock, which required riskier access in deep
   strata, while increasing mortality on herring, which could be accessed
   with less risk in shallow strata. This effect, however, attenuated if
   herring were scarcer and seal energy state was poor. During shark
   removal scenarios, seals shifted to deeper strata, increasing pollock
   consumption and substantially decreasing use of herring; the
   proportional change was greatest if seals were in good energy state.
   Prior studies have addressed how shark declines might affect community
   structure through density responses by species consumed by sharks;
   earlier models incorporating antipredator behaviour of the mesopredator
   (i.e. Ecosim/Ecospace) allow for activity reduction but not for the
   spatial shifts that altered the asymmetric trophic cascade in our
   simulations. Our results suggest that shark declines might have stronger
   ecological consequences than previously recognised if we account for
   spatial and diet shifts by mesoconsumers released from shark
   intimidation.}},

Abstract = {{The ecological impacts of the indirect effects of predators are well
   established, but the evolutionary consequences are unknown. Predators
   often decrease prey density, which indirectly increases the resources
   available to surviving prey. This ecological effect could provide a link
   to evolution because it is generally assumed that resource availability
   influences life history evolution. Yet, predictions from theory that
   consider food availability are inconsistent, and evidence for an
   important role of resources in shaping life history evolution is absent.
   We compared life history traits in a Trinidadian killifish, Rivulus
   hartii, from fish communities that differ in predation intensity;
   predators are associated with lower population density and faster growth
   rates. To determine whether the indirect effects of predators influence
   evolutionary change, we reared second-generation-born fish under two
   food levels that approximated natural differences in resources between
   communities. Rivulus from sites with predators are younger and smaller
   at maturity. They have increased reproductive investment and produce
   many small eggs and smaller hatchlings. Such divergence is predicted as
   a direct effect of predation. We also found significant interactions
   between predator community and food level for age and size at maturity,
   fecundity, and egg size. These interactions, whereby the differences
   between communities were more pronounced at high-food levels, argue that
   evolution in Rivulus has been influenced by the indirect effects of
   predators mediated through resource availability. Rivulus from sites
   with predators better exploit the higher resources in those habitats.
   Therefore, both direct and indirect effects of predators have
   evolutionary consequences.}},

Abstract = {{We used novel techniques for assessing resource value to investigate
   what additions to a barren cage female laboratory rabbits, Oryctolagus
   cuniculus, value. We tested motivation to reach two resources that are
   potentially practical enrichments: a platform (providing a partly
   enclosed space and a raised area) and limited social contact with
   another rabbit through wire mesh and compared these to food and an empty
   space. To reach these resources, rabbits had to pay entry costs (pushing
   through weighted doors) which increased every 2 days. With rising costs,
   rabbits generally rescheduled their behaviour, often reducing visit
   number and increasing visit length. Measures from economics and
   behavioural ecology ranked the relative importance of resources
   similarly (food >= social contact >= platform > empty cage). `Travel
   cost consumer surplus' (the area under a demand curve of price versus
   number of visits) ranked food and social contact similarly, but higher
   than the platform; `aggregate consumer surplus' (the area under a plot
   of weight against the number of rabbits paying each price level for the
   resource) placed food higher than both social contact and the platform;
   `reservation price' (maximum weight pushed) did not discriminate between
   the three resources; and `expenditure rate' (weight x visits/days) again
   ranked food and social contact similarly, but higher than the platform.
   Overall, rabbits' motivation for access to limited social contact thus
   came close to that for food, suggesting that they value this highly.
   Rabbits were almost as strongly motivated to be near a platform, but
   rarely used it, suggesting it might serve a `bolt hole' function. (C)

Abstract = {{Extensive livestock production is a low-input technology, in which means
   of production and labour are kept to a minimum level necessary to ensure
   profitability and arc located ill accordance with fodder resources. It
   enables animals to cypress their natural behaviour such as grazing,
   swimming, rooting and sandbathing. This production method is safer for
   the environment by maintaining landscape and cultural functions and
   using native breeds and varieties adapted to local conditions. It
   reduces risk to product safety and enables higher product quality.
   Because of their low profitability and at the same time other desirable
   characteristics, extensive production systems must be supported at EU
   and national level. This support is implemented under the second pillar
   of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Rural areas cover 93\%, of
   Poland's territory. Poland's natural and soil conditions arc inferior to
   average soil conditions in the European Union, Poland has 215 native
   breeds of animals, including 75 breeds, varieties and lines of farm
   animals that arc particularly useful for extensive production coupled
   with grazing in semi-natural areas. As many as 330,028 farms specialize
   in animal husbandry based oil file g-razing system. A total of 72,138
   farms received agri-environmental subsidies as part of the Rural
   Development Plan for 2004-2006. In 2006, 9194 farms with 220,000 ha of
   agricultural land were recorded and inspected as part of the organic

   agricultural anti food products in the EU are evidence that Polish farms
   arc competitive and comply with stringent standards in terms of product

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{308-315}},
Abstract = {{Population studies often focus on demographic and genetic consequences
   of dispersal strategies, generally within an evolutionary framework.
   Adaptive investment in dispersal is generally assessed from single types
   of (pre-)dispersal behaviour that are presumed to reliably reflect the
   dispersal strategy adopted. Various spider families show a striking and
   quantifiable display, known as tiptoe behaviour that prepares
   individuals for take-off prior to (passive) aerial dispersal
   (ballooning). The lack of efficient control mechanisms during ballooning
   prevents individuals from actively selecting a suitable habitat for
   landing. Ballooning dispersal is therefore often regarded as a wind
   lottery preceded by individual-based risk assessment. Our laboratory
   experiments showed that the duration of tiptoe behaviour can be used as
   an indicator of silk thread length, which is related to the potential
   dispersal distance. For two related species, Erigone arctica and E.
   dentiplapis, tiptoe duration decreased independently of sex after
   starvation, while more complex reaction norms were observed for tiptoe
   frequency.
   Because these two aspects of dispersal behaviours show different
   responses towards a simple stress-factor (starvation) in two related
   spider species, we conclude that the level of plasticity in dispersal
   investment can be subject to selective forces affecting different
   dispersal properties in different ways. Our results, hence, plead for a
   more holistic approach when addressing evolutionary and applied
   questions related to dispersal. (C) 2007 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

   the eggs, and released the juveniles into the wild. We used a reciprocal
   transplant design in a year of severe drought to distinguish between
   environmental and population-specific sources of variation. The levels
   of autumn activity differed between release sites (activity was higher
   at the more productive, high-elevation site) and between maternal sites
   of origin (at the low-elevation site, juveniles of low-elevation origin
   were less active than those of high-elevation origin). Although clutch
   mass was similar at both sites, eggs from low-elevation females were
   larger but fewer than those from high-elevation ones. Larger Juveniles
   and those from high-elevation clutches had higher survival rates. The
   juveniles recaptured in autumn at the low-elevation site were smaller as

   results suggest that the scarcity of prey at the low-elevation site is a
   selective pressure resulting in limitation of activity, given the
   increased energy expenditure and risk of predation incurred by active
   lizards. Thus, at the low-elevation site inactivity would be
   advantageous for most juveniles, and only the smaller ones would have to
   remain active frequently enough to accumulate sufficient reserves prior

   affecting vulnerability}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{19-44}},
Abstract = {{Environmental change can increase the vulnerability of aquatic species
   to toxic chemicals by challenging an organism's aptitude to respond to
   chemicals or to repair toxic injury or by modifying animal behaviours
   like migration or predation. On the other hand, xenobiotics may affect
   the capacity of aquatic species to adapt to environmental challenges
   that come with change (e.g., pathogens, temperature). Across Canada we
   have identified a number of circumstances where chemicals and
   environmental variability have likely worked together to affect
   vulnerability of aquatic organisms. For example in the Maritimes,
   exposure to municipal wastewater or bleached kraft pulp mill effluent
   altered immune function in bivalves and increased their risk of
   developing haemocytic neoplasia, a disease known to cause high
   mortality. Northwest Atlantic cod stocks have experienced large-scale
   changes in environment and exhibit marked seasonal cycles in energy
   reserves. The risk associated with subsequent redistribution of
   persistent chemicals in the body together with nutritional deficiency is
   presently under evaluation since it could affect the recovery of these
   endangered stocks. In the Great Lakes, the introduction of an invasive
   fish species, the alewife, modified the diet of salmonids, which led to
   a deficiency of the vitamin thiamine in eggs causing early mortality.
   Contaminants may interact with thiamine deficiency and thus critically
   impair recruitment of salmonids. Viewing the risks presented by toxic
   chemicals from the point of view of species vulnerability, offers
   managers opportunities to mitigate such risks, for example, through
   habitat, ocean and fisheries management. Further research is needed to
   develop biomarkers of vulnerability, identify most vulnerable life
   stages and populations, to understand the interactions between global
   environmental changes, nutritional status, pathogens and toxic
   chemicals, and to develop integrated approaches to manage vulnerability
   of aquatic ecosystems to toxic chemicals.}},

Title = {{INTRAGUILD INTERACTIONS AND POPULATION REGULATION IN PLETHODONTID
   SALAMANDERS}},
Journal = {{HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{22}},
Pages = {{31-53}},
Abstract = {{In this paper I review the contributions of analytic and experimental
   research oil intraguild predation and interspecific competition to our
   understanding of population regulation in plethodontid salamanders.
   Henry Wilbur's model of population regulation in amphibians serves as a
   framework for the arguments. Much of the discussion is based on studies
   of eastern North American plethodontids that have been the focus of most
   of the research. Ensembles of plethodontids in this region include
   species with complex fife cycles (i.e., larval development) and simple
   life cycles (i.e., direct development). Interactions between members of
   these two life-history categories appear to be weaker than those within
   categories. Whereas there is no definitive evidence of factors that
   regulate populations of plethodontid salamanders, interspecific
   competition and intraguild predation do appear to contribute in some
   ensembles. Food and space have been identified as limiting resources in
   interspecific competition. Although predation of larger on smaller
   salamanders may be relatively rare in nature, the threat of predation
   appears to promote behavioral responses in members of the smaller
   species that reduce risks but may lower fitness through other effects.
   The role of extralimital predators and competitors in regulation of
   these salamanders is largely untested. ideally, future research should
   involve manipulative experiments on unenclosed field plots that examine
   effects of resources, intraguild competitors and predators, and
   extralimital predators on populations of key species of plethodontids.}},

Title = {{Non-lethal effects of predation in birds}},
Journal = {{IBIS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{150}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{3-17}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Predators can affect individual fitness and population and community
   processes through lethal effects (direct consumption or `density'
   effects), where prey is consumed, or through non-lethal effects
   (trait-mediated effects or interactions), where behavioural compensation
   to predation risk occurs, such as animals avoiding areas of high
   predation risk. Studies of invertebrates, fish and amphibians have shown
   that non-lethal effects may be larger than lethal effects in determining
   the behaviour, condition, density and distribution of animals over a
   range of trophic levels. Although non-lethal effects have been well
   described in the behavioural ecology of birds (and also mammals) within
   the context of anti-predation behaviour, their role relative to lethal
   effects is probably underestimated. Birds show many behavioural and
   physiological changes to reduce direct mortality from predation and
   these are likely to have negative effects on other aspects of their
   fitness and population dynamics, as well as affecting the ecology of
   their own prey and their predators. As a consequence, the effects of
   predation in birds are best measured by trade-offs between maximizing
   instantaneous survival in the presence of predators and acquiring or
   maintaining resources for long-term survival or reproduction. Because
   avoiding predation imposes foraging costs, and foraging behaviour is
   relatively easy to measure in birds, the foraging-predation risk
   trade-off is probably an effective framework for understanding the
   importance of non-lethal effects, and so the population and community
   effects of predation risk in birds and other animals. Using a trade-off
   approach allows us to predict better how changes in predator density
   will impact on population and community dynamics, and how animals
   perceive and respond to predation risk, when non-lethal effects decouple
   the relationship between predator density and direct mortality rate. The
   trade-off approach also allows us to identify where predation risk is
   structuring communities because of avoidance of predators, even when
   this results in no observable direct mortality rate.}},

Title = {{Attitudes and behaviour towards organic products: an exploratory study}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RETAIL \& DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{158+}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The aim of this paper is to identify consumers' attitudes and
   behaviour towards organic products in Greece.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on a non-probability
   quota sample of 660 respondents to explore the attitudes and behaviour
   of Greek consumers towards organic food products.
   Findings - Greek consumers seem to be informed about environmental and
   health issues. They seek information about the nutritional value of food
   and demand more products free from chemical residues. The results show
   that most consumers associate organic consumption mainly with fruit and
   vegetables. Although demographics seem to affect attitudes towards
   organics, their value in explaining actual behaviour is minimal.
   Research limitations/implications - It is recognized that the data
   gathered in this study focus on the metropolitan area of Thessaloniki,
   Greece. The specific area though, is considered to be representative of
   the total Greek population. The results confirm that health, concern for
   the environment, animal welfare and support of the local economy are
   drivers of organic consumption. However, there is an indication that the
   importance of motives and barriers may vary for different product
   categories and perhaps future research should focus on product
   segmentation.
   Practical implications - Although certain similarities in consumers'
   attitudes towards organic food products have been identified, this paper
   records the variation in behaviour towards organics among the various
   consumer groups examined in Greece, and highlights the gap between
   attitudes and actual behaviour. Given the complexity of consumer
   decision making, future research should explore the other value
   trade-offs that consumers make.
   Originality/value - This paper attempts to provide evidence on the
   relatively under researched area of organics attitudes and behaviour in
   Greece.}},

Title = {{Homology in a context dependent predatory behavior in spiders (Araneae)}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARACHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{352-359}},
Abstract = {{Stereotyped behaviors have been routinely used as characters for
   phylogeny inference, but the same cannot be said of the plastic aspects
   of performance, which routinely are taken as a result of ecological
   processes. In this paper we examine the evolution of one of these
   plastic behavioral phenotypes, thus fostering a bridge between
   ecological and evolutionary processes. Foraging behavior in spiders is
   context dependent in many aspects, since it varies with prey type and
   size, spider nutritional and developmental state, previous experience
   and, in webweavers, is dependent on the structure of the web. Reeling is
   a predatory tactic typical of cobweb weavers (Theridiidae), in which the
   spider moves the prey toward her by pulling the capture thread (gumfoot)
   to which it is adhered. Predatory reeling is dependent on the gumfoot
   for its expression, and has not been previously reported in orbweavers.
   In order to investigate the evolution of this web dependent behavior, we
   built artificial, pseudogumfoot lines in orbwebs and registered
   parameters of the predatory tactics in this modified web. Aspects of the
   predatory tactics of 240 individuals (12 species in 4 families) were
   measured, and the resulting data were optimized on the phylogeny of
   Orbiculariae. All species perform predatory reeling with the
   pseudogumfoot lines. Thus, predatory reeling is homologous for the whole
   Orbiculariae group. In nature, holes made by insects in ecribellate orbs
   produce pseudogumfoot lines (similar to out experimentally modified
   webs), and thus reeling occurred naturally in ecribellates.
   Nevertheless, outside lab conditions, predatory reeling does not occur
   among cribellate orbweavers, so that this behavior could not have been
   selected for in the cribellate ancester of orbweavers. Cribellate
   spiders are flexible enough as to present novel and adaptive predatory
   responses (reeling) even when exposed for the first time to conditions
   outside their usual environment. Thus, the evolution of reeling suggests
   and alternative mechanism for the production of evolutionary novelties;
   that is, the exploration of unusual ecological conditions and of the
   regular effects these abnormal conditions have on phenotype expression.}},

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{35-40}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The ``cost-benefit{''} hypothesis states that avian body organs show
   mass changes consistent with the trade-off between their functional
   importance and maintenance cost, which may vary throughout the annual
   cycle. Flightless moulting common scoter Melanitta nigra in Danish
   marine waters select rich undisturbed offshore feeding areas lacking
   predators, suggesting active feeding during moult. We tested four
   predictions relating to organ size during flightlessness in moulting
   male common scoter under this hypothesis. Namely that (i) pectoral
   muscles would show atrophy followed by hypertrophy, but that there would
   be no change in (ii) leg muscles and heart (the locomotory architecture
   required to sustain diving for food), (iii) digestive organs and liver
   (required to process food), or (iv) fat deposits (because birds could
   fulfil daily energy requirements from locally abundant food resources).
   Dissection of scoters collected at different stages during wing moult
   south of the Danish island of L ae so provided data on organ size that
   were consistent with these predictions. Pectoral muscle mass showed a
   c.23\% atrophy during the middle of the flightless period relative to
   that at the end of moult. There was no significant loss in leg muscle,
   heart, digestive organs (except gizzard mass), liver, fat reserves or
   body mass with remigial growth. These findings are consistent with the
   hypothesis that common scoter moult in a rich feeding area, and rely on
   their diet to meet the nutritional requirements of remigial moult. These
   results differ in detail from those of a similar study of terrestrial
   feeding moulting greylag geese Anser anser, but because of the widely
   differing ecology of the species concerned, both sets of findings
   provide strong support for the hypothesis that variations in phenotypic
   plasticity in size of fat stores, locomotor and digestive organs can be
   interpreted as evolutionary adaptations to meet the conflicting needs
   (feather growth, nutritional challenges and predator avoidance) of the
   flightless moult period in different Anatidae species.}},

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{366}},
Pages = {{245-258}},
Abstract = {{Flexibility in activity time budgets allows animals to cope with
   heterogeneous and changing environments. Many marine predators, such as
   seabirds, exhibit flexibility in their foraging behaviour to buffer
   reproductive success against periods of low prey availability. Over 3
   years, 2004 to 2006, we studied the foraging behaviour of a threatened
   seabird, the marbled murrelet Brachyramphus marmoratus in southwestern
   Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. An information-theoretic
   approach was used to compare among factors (temporal, spatial,
   environmental, and competitors) that may influence diving activity. We
   also quantified local prey availability by hydroacoustic surveys and
   regional oceanographic conditions (chlorophyll a concentrations and
   upwelling indices) to investigate relationships between diving activity,
   food supply and environmental conditions. Prey indices varied spatially,
   seasonally, and annually, showing reduced prey availability during
   incubation and chick-rearing of 2005. Upwelling indices and chlorophyll
   a concentrations, as an index of primary productivity, were delayed in
   2005. Year and breeding phase had the greatest impact on diving
   activity, with additional variation among sites. Murrelets increased
   diving activity in years and seasons with scarce prey and poor
   oceanographic conditions (incubation and chick-rearing 2005) and
   decreased diving activity at sites with high prey availability. There
   was a linear relationship between diving activity and food availability,
   suggesting no clear thresholds in response to decreases in prey. Despite
   their flexible activity budgets, increased foraging effort by murrelets
   in 2005 was inadequate to ensure average levels of reproductive success.
   Thus, flexible foraging behaviour by murrelets may be ineffective to
   buffer reproductive success when environmental conditions are extremely
   poor.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing life expectancy, cognitive decline is becoming a
   major public health problem. Selenium is thought to be involved in the
   maintenance of functional brain activity and in protection against
   oxidative stress. This idea is supported by the finding that the brain
   retains high selenium levels under conditions of persistent dietary
   selenium deficiency. Recently, we showed that in human, aging was
   associated with a decrease in plasma selenium while a lowered selenium
   status was associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline,
   suggesting that selenium decrease during ageing should not be
   underestimated as an emphasizing of brain ageing. The aim of this study
   was to evaluate the effects of a selenium restricted versus normal diet
   on brain antioxidant status and behavioural reactivity of old rats. In
   rats fed selenium restricted diet, plasma Se and GPx activity decreased
   significantly. After 12 weeks of restricted-diet, the fall in plasma Se
   was of 30\% but only 5\% in cerebellum. In brain we observe a decrease
   on complex I and IV of the mitochondria respiratory chain, but no
   significant alterations in redox status assessed by TBARS, SH groups,
   GPX, GSH and antioxidant power using ferric reducing antioxidant power
   (FRAP). Furthermore, the level of oxidative DNA cortex damage assessed
   by comet assay was similar between the groups. Se deficient animals
   exhibited a behaviour similar to their control when placed in a open
   field test. Our results suggest that a Se deficient diet during ageing
   could be associated with an accelerated brain ageing monitored by a
   decrease in mitochondrial complex I and IV but did not support the
   hypothesis of an increased oxidative stress. Further study is now
   necessary to understand by which mechanism Se acts on brain
   mitochondrial function and complementary tests on other brain function
   should be worked out.}},

Abstract = {{Noncardiac or unexplained chest pain can be defined as recurrent
   angina-like or substernal chest pain thought to be unrelated to the

   years) referred to a cardiology practice with NCCP. Eighty control
   subjects, matched for age, gender, and education level, were included in
   the study. Each subject was evaluated with TCI, Beck Depression
   Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The TCI assesses four
   dimensions of temperament, namely, novelty seeking, harm avoidance,
   reward dependence and persistence and three dimensions of character,
   being self-directedness, cooperativeness and self-transcendence. We
   found higher harm avoidance scores and lower self-directedness and
   cooperativeness scores in patients group than those in healthy control
   subjects. High harm avoidance scores were associated with high
   depression level. However, all the character subdimensions were
   associated with an elevated level of depression. In the stepwise

   and self-directedness levels. These findings suggest state and trait

Abstract = {{Clonal plant networks consist of interconnected individuals (ramets) of

   Here, feeding preferences of a generalist herbivore (Spodoptera exigua)
   for differently-aged ramets of Trifolium repens were studied, and
   changes in herbivore preference in response to systemic defense
   induction were investigated.
   Dual-choice tests were used to assess the preference of herbivores for
   young versus mature ramets of induced and uninduced plants,
   respectively. Additionally, leaf traits related to nutrition,
   biomechanics and chemical defense were measured to explain variation in
   tissue quality and herbivore preference.
   Young ramets were heavily damaged in control plants. After systemic
   defense induction, damage on young ramets was greatly reduced, while
   damage on mature ramets increased slightly. Defense induction increased
   leaf strength and thickness, decreased leaf soluble carbohydrates and
   substantially changed phenolic composition of undamaged ramets connected
   to attacked individuals.
   Systemic induced resistance led to a more dispersed feeding pattern
   among ramets of different ages. It is proposed that inducible defense
   acts as a risk-spreading strategy in clonal plants by equalizing
   herbivore preference within the clone, thereby avoiding extended
   selective feeding on valuable plant tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic research has focused on identifying linkages between
   polymorphisms and phenotypic traits to explain variations in complex
   biologies. However, the magnitude of these linkages has not been
   particularly high. Conversely, the ability of developmental plasticity
   to generate biological variation from one genotype is well understood,
   while interest has emerged in the clinical significance of epigenetic
   processes, particularly those influenced by the external environment.
   Enviromnental cues in early development may induce responses that
   provide adaptive advantage later in life. The benefit of such responses
   depends on the fidelity of the prediction of the future environment.
   Life history and physiological changes mediated through epigenetic
   processes then follow, determining the later phenotype. Developmental
   mismatch, leading to disease, can arise from discordance between the
   fetal enviromnent, which is relatively constant across generations, and
   the postnatal nutritional environment, which can change drastically
   within and between generations. Metabolic disorders represent the
   outcome of an individual living in an energetically inappropriate
   environment. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that individual
   capacity to live in a given energetic environment is influenced by
   developmental factors acting through epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic
   biomarkers may be able to identify a risk of developmental mismatch and
   thus offer the opportunity for nutritional or other intervention.

Title = {{A short introduction in the memoirs of the Romanian imprisonment}},
Journal = {{PHILOLOGICA JASSYENSIA}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{25-38}},
Abstract = {{Short literature, the diaries and the memories of those who suffered
   during the popular democracy, but also the numerous public articles and
   debates after 1989 made us familiar, at least as witnesses, with the
   idea of prison and with the prison reality. The prison, which influenced
   the destiny of so many persons (from political personalities or
   intellectuals of some notoriety, to common individuals), becomes not
   only a natural component of every day life, but also a valuable element
   of it. Thus, paradoxically, the prison appears as a special place which
   filters the people's morality and character.
   Prison has always been a place of abuses, but never these abuses reached
   such intensity as during the totalitarian dictatorships, when it became
   a means of annihilation, of repression and besides all, of destruction.
   This prison invasion in everyday life has totally changed a situation
   which was considerably different before XXth century and that literature
   kept at a low level.
   The memories of the former anti-communists prisoners can be classified,
   at the existential level, from two points of view: as a physical fight
   and resistance proof and as inner endurance. The first is epically
   organized as an adventure novel, while the second is, mostly, a
   confession text. The Romanian prisoner oscillates between Don Quijote
   and Iov. These Quixotic forms are nothing but a hectic search of the
   human, a supreme exercise of the free agency. On the other side, the
   main form of existence in prison is not action, but reflection. The
   prisoner doesn't prove less courage, he is not a timorous person; on the
   contrary, he lives a real euphoria of accomplishment in endeavor and he
   is able to face the guardians, to make demonstrative actions, risking in
   this way very rough punishments. But he doesn't ``realize{''} himself as
   a prisoner and regime enemy by this attitude, but in the way he
   assimilates intellectually and morally the unique experience that he
   lived, turning it into a stage towards self-fulfillment.
   The memories from the prison show something more (and in this point they
   touch the literary side): that suffering, humiliation, fear, starvation,
   coldness and torture awake the latency of unconcealed predispositions,
   of an aptitude for literature (even if many of the writings don't have a
   special aesthetic value). From this point of view, the testimonies of
   the political prisoners from behind the bars during the ``madding

Abstract = {{To elucidate the potential for colony growth and the dispersal of aphids
   in relation to the ant attendance, the mobility, tolerance of
   starvation, colony growth, and dispersal were examined in the ant-tended
   Aphis craccivora Koch and the non-ant-tended Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris
   under the absence of predators and ants. The increase of the dispersal
   rate with density was more conspicuous in Ac. pisum than Ap. craccivora.
   The success rate of dispersal was higher in Ac. pisum than Ap.
   craccivora. These results would be derived from the higher ability of
   dispersal by walking in Ac. pisum than Ap. craccivora. The longer legs,
   higher walking speed, and stronger tolerance of starvation in Ac. pisum
   might result in a higher ability of dispersal by walking. These traits
   may have developed in relation to non-ant attendance, because Ac. pisum
   aphids frequently escape from natural enemies by dropping from the host
   plant. On the other hand, Ap. craccivora have not developed
   morphological and behavioral traits concerning dispersal by walking,
   because increasing colony size without dispersal is likely to be
   advantageous for ant attraction. Escaping behaviors of Ap. craccivora
   from natural enemies have not been well developed due to the ant's
   defense against natural enemies. The proportion of alatae in Ap.
   craccivora was higher than in Ac. pisum instead of a lesser ability for
   dispersal by walking in Ap. craccivora. The differences in ant
   attendance have been influenced in the development of morphological and
   behavioral traits concerning the dispersal ability, and then, different
   potentials for reproduction and dispersal have developed in ant-tended
   aphids and non-ant-tended aphids.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the sociodemographic and
   developmental characteristics of children with food refusal and children
   with no history of feeding problems. Design: Cross-sectional
   case-control study. Sample. 30 children aged 1-6 years who were seen in
   the outpatient clinics for food refusal formed the case group, and 30
   healthy children matched for age, sex, and socioeconomic status formed
   the control group. Methods. Anthropometric indices and early
   developmental characteristics of all the children in the study were
   evaluated and also their developmental levels were determined using the
   Ankara Developmental Screening Inventory. Results: The mean age of
   children with food refusal was 42.4 +/- 17.6 months, and the male/female
   ratio was 12/18. Children with food refusal had shorter mean
   breastfeeding durations and lower mean birth weights, body mass index,
   percentage height for age, and percentage weight for height values than
   those of the controls. There were no significant differences between the
   2 groups in developmental delays. Conclusions: These results suggest
   that food refusal may be related to lower birth weight and shorter

   Australian New South Wales electorates}},
Journal = {{RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Discourses around men's health refer to greater
   risk-taking behaviour, the social construct of masculinity and
   differences between men's and women's rates of death and disease. These
   ways of describing `men's health' may be inadequate, but many men,
   particularly rural men, experience health disadvantage.
   Method: A written postal survey was used to collect demographic data,
   eating behaviours using the Food Habit Score, alcohol use, physical
   activity behaviours using an adaptation of the Pilot Study of the
   Fitness of Australians and attitudes to health and body image. Subjects
   and Setting: The survey was sent to 2000 randomly selected men in two
   New South Wales Riverina federal electorates in June 2004, with 529
   returns (27\% response). Main outcome measures: Food Habit Scores;
   regularity of physical activity; frequency and amount of alcohol use;
   degree of agreement with statements about attitudes to health and body
   image. Statistical analyses: Descriptive statistics using frequencies
   and cross tabulations were performed with further univariate analyses
   conducted at a level of significance of 5\%.
   Results: Approximately one-third of the men achieved a poor Food Habit
   Score (<= 10 out of 20). Age was not significantly associated with diet
   quality, but those in higher skilled occupations had a better diet,
   compared with those in less skilled occupations (p<0.01). Eighty-seven
   percent of the respondents drank alcohol and of those, almost half
   consumed only one or two alcoholic drinks at each session. Nearly a
   quarter of the men reported that they had more than four drinks on each
   drinking occasion. Almost half the men did no `vigorous' exercise, but
   42\% did heavy labouring/gardening at least three times a week. The men
   with poor dietary habits were more likely to agree with less desirable
   attitudes to health, such as needing a health scare before changing
   lifestyle behaviours (p<0.001). The low response rate (27\%) limits the
   ability to generalise these results to the whole male population in the
   Farrer and Riverina federal electorates.
   Conclusion: This study describes the eating and physical activity
   behaviours of a sample of rural men and highlights the attitudes that
   are associated with poor lifestyle behaviours among this hard to reach
   group. Implications: Health promotion programs targeting men, especially
   rural men, should address existing attitudes to health which may impact
   on lifestyle behaviours.}},

Title = {{The welfare of piglets}},
Booktitle = {{WELFARE OF PIGS: FROM BIRTH TO SLAUGHTER}},
Year = {{2008}},
Pages = {{97-131}},
Abstract = {{With reference primarily to the `Five Freedoms' defined by the Farm
   Animal Welfare Council (London, UK), the present chapter reviews the
   behavioural and physiological welfare requirements of domestic piglets
   from birth until weaning: (1) comfort and housing requirements; (2)
   nutrition and welfare; (3) viability and health; (4) behavioural needs;
   and (5) fear, stress and suffering. The general aim is to evaluate the
   effects of housing and management practices on the biological responses
   (behaviour, physiology, health, performance) of piglets in relation to
   their needs. Suitable and practicable modifications are put forward for
   the improvement of welfare under commercial production conditions.
   Whereas serious welfare problems directly caused by nutrition and
   disease are less prevalent because of their obvious and immediate
   economic impacts, some welfare impairments still occur that result from
   psychobiological suffering and insufficient attention to the comfort
   requirements and behavioural needs of piglets. Some of the aspects that
   can help to improve the piglet welfare are discussed in this chapter.
   High mortality of piglets after farrowing is a major problem. This can
   be countered by ensuring adequate design of the farrowing environment to
   minimise the risk of crushing, by providing an optimal thermal
   environment and sufficient and comfortable lying space for all piglets,
   and by increasing supervision at farrowing and during the suckling
   period. The detrimental effects of tail docking, teeth resection and
   castration on welfare can be diminished by modifying or improving the
   techniques themselves; by using analgesic protocols; and by promoting
   the development of general and local anaesthetics that alleviate both
   acute and chronic pain. The abrupt weaning of piglets has been linked to
   many critical aspects of welfare (e.g. aggression, rearrangement of
   environment and feed) which can be improved by implementing a more
   gradual weaning process using sow-controlled systems and/or mixing of
   piglets prior to weaning. In addition, these alternative housing
   practices combined with environmental enrichment allow the animals to
   display more of their natural behavioural repertoire and to experience
   various stimuli which can help to prevent boredom and behavioural
   disorders.}},

Abstract = {{A summary of the epidemiology, etiology and therapy of obesity is given
   with special emphasis on psychosomatic aspects.
   Overweight and obesity are widespread and go hand in hand with an
   increased health risk. The etiology of obesity is multifactorial based
   on gene/environment interactions; hyperalimentation and physical
   inactivity, as an expression of the rapid technical advancements within
   the past decades, have, however, had a decisive influence on the
   pandemic spreading of obesity.
   The prevalence of mental disorders is increased particularly in obese
   women. Although phylogenetically of relevance, an environment that
   associates slimness with beauty health, physical and mental proficiency
   leads to a stigmatization of the obese. The results are mental symptoms
   and disorders. On the contrary, mental problems up to and including the
   full clinical picture of mental disorders may lead to changes in eating
   and exercise behaviour, the result of which may be a sustained positive
   energy balance with overweight and obesity. The success of conservative
   weight reduction measures in obesity is inadequate. Surgical measures
   are more successful, but they are only indicated for severe obesity.
   The psychosomatic and psychotherapeutic approach to over-weight and
   obesity is multifactorial and indispensable. Obesity is not an eating
   disorder; it may, however, be the result of hyperalimentation into which
   pathogenetic and mental factors have been incorporated.}},

Abstract = {{Processes of seed predation and dispersal are crucial for tree
   regeneration and forest dynamics. To understand the role of the dung
   beetle, Thorectes lusitanicus (Col., Scarabaeoidea, Geotrupidae) as
   secondary seed disperser in Mediterranean oak forests, its food
   preference was investigated in the field and in the laboratory. This
   paper had for objectives (1) to explore the feeding preferences for
   acorns of the two species available in the field: Quercus suber and
   Quercus canariensis, and (2) to study the olfactory and palatability
   response of T. lusitanicus to different food resources (oak acorns and
   dung) under laboratory conditions. The number of beetles in the field
   was curvilinearly related to the number of acorns, being higher when the
   number of acorns was intermediate. The maximum values of T. lusitanicus
   density corresponded to those plots located under Q. suber trees with
   the highest total weight of acorns. Bioassays with a four-armed
   olfactometer showed that T. lusitanicus was clearly attracted to
   volatiles of Q. suber acorns more than to of dung. Palatability
   bioassays also showed significant preferences for acorns of Q. suber in
   comparison with the typical food previously described for this beetle
   species (dung). According to our results, we suggest that a diet based
   on acorns (due to their high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids)
   probably satisfies the nutritional requirements of T. lusitanicus during
   winter, larval development, and metamorphosis. (c) 2007 The Association

Abstract = {{The concept of farm animal welfare can, for practical purposes, be
   translated into the so-called Five Freedoms.(1) Organic farming aims to
   meet animal welfare needs and should therefore comply with these
   Freedoms. The first Freedom, from hunger and thirst, is met in any
   system properly managed to organic standards. The Freedom from thermal
   and physical discomfort is challenged as organic husbandry systems face
   more climatic extremes. However, they also provide more `control' to the
   animal by offering a choice when seeking warmth or a cool place to lie.
   The Freedom from pain, injury and disease is the most complicated one.
   Organic farming virtually bans mutilations (e.g. debeaking, tail
   docking), although some are still allowed and practised (e.g.
   castration). Organic animals are more exposed to wildlife and at risk of
   contracting infectious diseases. However, it is possible (although not
   proven) that organically managed animals are more resistant to illness.
   The Freedom to express normal behaviour is met through environmental
   enrichment and group housing. The Freedom from fear and distress is
   supported by e.g. extra (social) space. In conclusion, if animal health
   can be maintained, organic farming is very well placed to provide good

Abstract = {{Cancer is one of the most frequent causes of death in Germany. The
   reasons of various cancer diseases still remain uncertain. There is a
   long-standing discussion about associations between personality,
   depression, stress, and stressful life events, respectively, and the
   development of malignant neoplasms. Evidence for a role of psychosocial
   factors in development of cancer is not unequivocal despite many years
   of research on the subject. Current prospecvertive investigations do not
   support the conventional wisdom of a direct influence for personality in
   the development of cancer. Much of the research has been impaired by
   methodological flaws such as inadequate sample size, failure to adjust
   for potential confounders, lengths of follow-up, use of a variation of
   different measurements of cancer, and psychosocial variables.
   Furthermore, specific personality traits and various life events are
   associated with certain health-related behavior and lifestyle factors,
   e.g., smoking or an unhealthy nutrition. These unhealthy habits can
   increase cancer risk. Psychological parameters may alter immune and
   endocrine function and it has long been hypothesized that, through this
   pathway, psychosocial factors may affect cancer incidence.
   In conclusion, study results to substantiate the role of psychosocial
   factors in the development of various cancers are inconclusive.
   Contradictory results may be explained by methodological shortcomings.

Abstract = {{We studied individual variation in the antipredator response of the
   fishing spider, D. triton, in a variety of developmental and behavioural
   contexts. We examined our data with respect to two general hypotheses:
   (1) startled spiders should modulate their boldness according to
   context-specific variables (e.g. developmental stage, feeding
   opportunities, mating opportunities, parental investment, body
   condition, etc.), and/or (2) an individual spider's boldness will be
   consistent (i.e. positively correlated) across contexts such that
   boldness in any given context is well predicted by boldness in other
   contexts. We found some support for the former, context-specific
   hypothesis and strong support for the latter, `behavioural-syndromes'
   hypothesis. While spiders were significantly bolder in the presence
   versus absence of prey, boldness did not fluctuate with developmental
   stage, mating opportunities, parental investment or condition in the
   manner predicted. Instead, boldness in adult spiders was well predicted
   by a syndrome of positively correlated bold behaviours across functional
   contexts. We suggest that animal behaviour most often reflects a
   combination of context-specific behavioural optimization and
   context-general expression of behavioural syndromes, as was seen in this
   experiment. We further suggest that disentangling the relative magnitude
   of these two general mechanisms in a wide variety of taxa, covering many
   behavioural-ecological contexts, will provide great insights into (1)
   population ecology (e.g. the success of invasive/pest species and the
   failure of threatened species), (2) community ecology (e.g. species
   coexistence, trophic dynamics), and (3) evolutionary ecology (e.g.

Abstract = {{This study has been carried out to ``identify highly sensitive behavior
   on healthy nutrition (orthorexia nervosa-ON){''} in residence medical
   doctors (MD) in the Faculty of Medicine. Diagnoses of ON was based on
   the presence of a disorder with obsessive-compulsive personality. The
   study is a cross-sectional research, which reached out to the entire 318
   MD. The ORTO-15 test was used to propose a diagnostic proceeding and to
   try verify the prevalence of ON. Those subjects who were classified
   below 40 from the ORTO-15 test are accepted to have ON.
   Chi-square test, ANOVA (univariate) analysis and logistic regression
   were used for analyses of the data. Mean score of the participants from
   the ORTO-15 test is 39.8 +/- 0.22, and there is no statistical
   difference between women and men. A total of 45.5\% of the residence MD
   involved in the research scored below 40 in the ORTO-15 test. Those who
   do their food shopping themselves, skip a meal with a salad/fruit, care
   about the quality of the things they eat, think that eating outside is
   healthy, look at the content of what they eat and the content of food is
   important in selection of a product score lower in their average marks
   in ORTO-15 and the difference among the groups is statistically
   significant. Food selection of 20.1\% of the male participants and
   38.9\% of the female participants among the residence MD is influenced
   by the programs on nutrition/health in mass-media. The difference
   between the groups is statistically significant (p < 0.05). Female
   medical doctors are more careful than men of their physical appearance
   and weight control and consume less caloric food, which is statistically
   significant. Since those who exhibit ``healthy fanatic{''} eating habits
   may have a risk of ON in the future, it would be useful to conduct
   studies that identify the prevalence of ON in the public. (c) 2007

   arousal-related behaviors and that their combination would further
   increase arousal behavior. Following baseline testing, animals (n=28)
   were divided into 3 groups that, in different experimental phases,
   received either estradiol (in subcutaneous capsules), restricted diet (a
   liquid diet providing 60\% of daily caloric requirements) or a
   combination of those two. An automated arousal behavior monitoring
   system was used to measure home cage voluntary motor activity and
   sensory responsiveness, these being components of a new operational
   definition of `generalized arousal'. Key findings: (1) During the light,
   all treatments reduced voluntary activity. (2) In the dark, estrogens
   increased, while estrogens in combination with restricted diet
   decreased, horizontal activity. (3) In the dark, restricted diet alone
   had little effect on voluntary activity, but reduced it when combined
   with estrogen treatment. (4) All treatments reduced responses to the
   olfactory stimulus. The dependence of results on time of day was
   unexpected. Further, different patterns of results for the three
   treatments suggest that estrogens and food restriction did not have
   equivalent or additive effects on arousal. While contrary to the main
   prediction, these findings are discussed in terms of the animals'
   adaptive preparations for reproduction {[}Schneider, J.E., 2006.

Abstract = {{Although there is accumulating evidence of growth-rate optimization by
   natural selection, the coevolution of growth rate and risk-taking
   behavior has not been sufficiently documented. The Atlantic silverside
   fish, Menidia menidia, displays countergradient variation in growth
   across a latitudinal gradient: genotypes from Nova Scotia (NS), for
   example, grow in length twofold faster than those from South Carolina
   (SC). Past work has established that fast growth is adaptive in northern
   climates, but the trade-off is poorer swimming performance and higher
   susceptibility to predators. We compared escape behavior and willingness
   to forage under threat of predation among growth genotypes reared and
   tested under common-garden conditions. When chased with a predator
   model, NS fish occupied shelter more quickly than SC fish. When food was
   supplied after a chase, NS fish reemerged from the shelter much more
   quickly than SC fish and immediately commenced feeding, whereas many SC
   fish displayed timid behavior and did not feed. When food was absent
   following a chase, however, NS fish remained in the shelter longer than
   did SC fish and both displayed timid behavior. Hence, the fast-growing
   NS genotype was bolder than SC fish in the presence of food, but shyer
   in the absence of food. These behaviors are adaptive given the
   physiological constraints intrinsic to each genotype. Experiments on
   captive populations of silversides that had been artificially selected
   for fast or slow growth confirmed that foraging behavior is genetically
   correlated with intrinsic growth rate, although in these trials the
   fast-growth genotype was always more bold, regardless of food
   availability, as would be expected in the absence of predators. We
   conclude that risk-taking foraging behavior coevolves adaptively with
   intrinsic growth rate in M. menidia.}},

Abstract = {{Early nutrition shapes life history. Parents should, therefore, provide
   a diet that will optimize the nutrient intake of their offspring. In a
   number of passerines, there is an often observed, but unexplained, peak
   in spider provisioning during chick development. We show that the
   proportion of spiders in the diet of nestling blue tits, Cyanistes
   caeruleus, varies significantly with the age of chicks but is unrelated
   to the timing of breeding or spider availability. Moreover, this
   parental prey selection supplies nestlings with high levels of taurine
   particularly at younger ages. This amino acid is known to be both vital
   and limiting for mammalian development and consequently found in high
   concentrations in placenta and milk. Based on the known roles of taurine
   in mammalian brain development and function, we then asked whether by
   supplying taurine-rich spiders, avian parents influence the stress
   responsiveness and cognitive function of their offspring. To test this,
   we provided wild blue tit nestlings with either a taurine supplement or
   control treatment once daily from the ages of 2-14 days. Then pairs of
   size- and sex-matched siblings were brought into captivity for
   behavioural testing. We found that juveniles that had received
   additional taurine as neonates took significantly greater risks when
   investigating novel objects than controls. Taurine birds were also more
   successful at a spatial learning task than controls. Additionally, those
   individuals that succeeded at a spatial learning task had shown
   intermediate levels of risk taking. Non-learners were generally very
   risk-averse controls. Early diet therefore has downstream impacts on
   behavioural characteristics that could affect fitness via foraging and
   competitive performance. Fine-scale prey selection is a mechanism by
   which parents can manipulate the behavioural phenotype of offspring.}},

Abstract = {{In social insects, decisions are usually predicted to be more accurate
   than individual decisions, because individual preferences are amplified
   at the group level. Although social caterpillars, as individuals,
   possess considerable `nutritional wisdom' and have the capacity to
   regulate their nutrient intake: does this mean that the collective
   nutritional decisions made by colonies are better? We investigated
   individual feeding responses and collective decisions when caterpillar
   colonies were faced with different food sources. Forest tent
   caterpillars, Malacosoma disstria, had to choose between nutritionally
   balanced and unbalanced food sources placed at opposite ends of a
   bridge. At the individual level, caterpillars showed a clear preference
   for the balanced food source. In contrast, at the collective level,
   colonies of caterpillars randomly chose one of the two, and then became
   trapped for at least 24 h as a result of trail following behaviour. If
   the first caterpillar found the unbalanced food, it was followed by the
   others and the colony was unable to reverse this choice. This study
   provides evidence for a novel potential cost to group living, and shows
   that group feeding behaviour cannot always be simply predicted from
   individual preferences. Crown Copyright (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier

   where fish communities are just beginning to recover from the effects of
   decades of acidification and metal stress. The predation regimes
   investigated included six lakes with no predators, four lakes recently

   well-established ( >= 15 years) predator populations. Netting survey
   results indicated that yellow perch biomass was 69\% lower in lakes with
   predators. In lakes recently invaded by predators, perch displayed
   earlier ontogenetic diet shifts from zooplankton to benthos and much
   poorer growth during their first growing season. Energy investment
   (lipid content per egg) in eggs by mature females was also less in the
   lakes recently invaded by predators. Growth potential in adult perch
   (age 1), estimated by nucleoside diphosphokinase, was highest in lakes
   with established predators. Body condition, controlling for size of
   perch, was also greatest in established predator lakes. Perch body shape
   in lakes with predators showed a shift from a typical streamlined,

Abstract = {{1. An organism's growth parameters are expected to depend on
   environmental constraints, such as predation risk and food supply.
   However, antipredator responses, food intake, and thus growth of an
   animal may be mediated by behavioural traits, which are likely to differ
   among developmental stages. In this study, it was investigated how the
   relationship between growth and behavioural antipredator responses
   changes during ontogeny in the time-constrained dragonfly species
   Libellula depressa, and which factors influenced specific behavioural
   decisions at different points in ontogeny.
   2. The results revealed that behavioural strategies differed between
   larval developmental sages, depending on associations between larval
   growth, food supply, and predation risk. Early in ontogeny, faster
   development was correlated with high larval activity and high food
   supply. This resulted in high activity levels under high food conditions
   irrespectively of predator presence, and under low food supply in
   predator absence only. In the intermediate stage of development, all
   larvae displayed a high activity level, which was correlated in general
   with fast development. However, growth later in ontogeny was not only
   influenced by the activity level, but also by predator presence and food
   supply, with larvae reared under high food supply and/or in presence of
   predators attaining a higher final mass. Thus, not only the way in which
   larval growth parameters and behaviour are related changed during
   development, but also whether the factors influenced larval growth and
   behaviour. Once the larvae reached the ultimate stage of development, in
   which they overwinter, behavioural patterns observed were consistent
   with model predictions.
   3. It is advocated that behavioural plasticity of prey organisms in
   different developmental stages should be analysed in the context of
   associated growth variables.}},

   loss being associated with declining populations and mass gain with

   response to higher predation risk, they are likely to be experiencing a

Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Council Directive 91/630/EEC1, as amended, laying down minimum standards
   for the protection of pigs, requires the Commission to submit to the
   Council a report, based on a scientific opinion of the European Food
   Safety Authority (EFSA), concerning the welfare various aspects of
   housing and husbandry systems for farmed pigs. EFSA has therefore been
   required to provide a Scientific Opinion on several aspects of this, one
   concerning fattening pigs. The opinion should include: the effects of
   stocking density, including group size and grouping methods, space
   requirements and the impact of stall design and different flooring types
   taking into account different climatic conditions.
   The Scientific Opinion was adopted by the Panel on Animal Health and
   Welfare (AHAW) on 6 September 2007.
   Based on the scientific data presented in the Scientific Report and risk
   assessment, conclusions and recommendations were drawn. In relation to
   disease, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections and
   production-related diseases can have a major impact on the welfare of
   fattening pigs. Management, inspection and other disease prevention
   measures, handling, hygiene, floor type and the manure system have major
   effects on disease risk and significant importance for ensuring good
   welfare. At post-mortem slaughter inspection, pigs kept outdoors usually
   have a lower prevalence of lesions due to respiratory infections than
   indoor pigs but higher risk of some internal parasites. Leg disorders,
   which are caused by a complex of factors including genetic selection and
   high energy and high protein diet, are a major problem.
   Interactions between many aspects of the biological functioning of pigs
   and effects of housing and management on welfare are described. Without
   suitable rooting and manipulation materials, pigs are likely to direct
   tactile behaviour towards companions using aggression or other causes of
   poor welfare. Manipulable material makes any floor more attractive for
   exploration and pigs prefer the presence of straw to an unbedded floor.
   The provision of appropriate foraging material is difficult in pens with
   fully slatted floors unless there is automatic shredding in the waste
   disposal system.
   If the ambient temperatures are too high, adequate space to separate
   from other pigs, sufficient contact with a cool floor, access to
   outdoors, air-flow rates to help evaporation, water on the skin, or more
   drinking water help to avoid over-heating. In the case of too low a
   temperature, better insulation of the floor lowers the risk of
   hypothermia.
   When there is too little sensory input, because of social isolation, a
   barren environment or too little light intensity, pigs are likely to
   show abnormal behavioural and physiological responses. Flashing lights
   can be disturbing to pigs and poor welfare is also associated with light
   of a wavelength or intensity that does not allow the pig to discriminate
   the behaviour of other pigs or materials.
   The genetic selection for rapid growth and lean meat without enough
   consideration of other factors has led to some widespread and serious
   problems. However, selective breeding to eliminate the halothane gene
   has improved pig welfare.
   Poor quality pen design can cause poor welfare in pigs because of parts
   that cause injury, or disturbance and aggression. If pigs do not have
   sufficient exercise, there can be adverse effects on bone and muscle
   development. Dunging behaviour (urination and defecation) is facilitated
   by design of the housing system and good management. Mixing unacquainted
   pigs leads to a substantial risk of fighting, injury and production
   loss.
   Recommendations presented in the Scientific Opinion include the need to
   provide an environment and management so that the negative consequences
   of poor welfare such as injurious behaviours, physiological problems and
   immunosuppression, caused in barren environments, are avoided. In this
   sense, it is recommended that pigs should be provided with manipulable,
   destructible materials, wallows, lighting of appropriate wavelength and
   intensity, water of a quality and quantity sufficient for their needs,
   and a balanced diet with no harmful contaminants. In order to minimise
   disease in pigs, and hence poor welfare, effective disease preventive
   and management procedures should be in place. The design of
   accommodation for pigs should be such that the pigs have sufficient
   exercise for normal bone and muscle development. There should be further
   efforts to select and breed so that problems of pig welfare, including
   cardiovascular malfunction, risk of early death and leg disorders are
   maintained at a low level.
   The recommendations for further research are mainly focused on the
   evaluation of the effects of the exposure to several factors (i.e.
   barren environment, light intensity, noise, respiratory disorders) on
   the welfare of fattening pigs. Recommendations for further research in
   relation to the heavy pig production are also provided.
   The methodology and the results of this scientific report and opinion
   should be developed to identify welfare outcomes (indicators) that are
   valid and can be used in an animal welfare monitoring system.}},

Abstract = {{Vasopressin affects behavior via its two brain receptors, the
   vasopressin 1a and vasopressin 1b receptors (Avpr1b). Recent work from
   our laboratory has shown that disruption of the Avpr1b gene reduces
   intermale aggression and reduces social motivation. Here, we further
   characterized the aggressive phenotype in Avpr1b -/- (knockout) mice. We
   tested maternal aggression and predatory behavior. We also analyzed the
   extent to which food deprivation and competition over food increases
   intermale aggression. We quantified defensive behavior in Avpr1b -/-
   mice and later tested offensive aggression in these same mice. Our
   results show that attack behavior toward a conspecific is consistently
   reduced in Avpr1b -/- mice. Predatory behavior is normal, suggesting
   that the deficit is not because of a global inability to detect and
   attack stimuli. Food deprivation, competition for food and previous
   experience increase aggression in both Avpr1b +/+ and -/- mice. However,
   in these circumstances, the level of aggression seen in knockout mice is
   still less than that observed in wild-type mice. Defensive avoidance
   behaviors, such as boxing and fleeing, are largely intact in knockout
   mice. Avpr1b -/- mice do not display as many `retaliatory' attacks as
   the Avpr1b +/+ mice. Interestingly, when territorial aggression was
   measured following the defensive behavior testing, Avpr1b -/- mice
   typically show less initial aggressive behavior than wild-type mice, but
   do show a significant increase in aggression with repeated testing.
   These studies confirm that deficits in aggression in Avpr1b -/- mice are
   limited to aggressive behavior involving the attack of a conspecific. We
   hypothesize that Avpr1b plays an important role in the central
   processing that couples the detection and perception of social cues
   (which appears normal) with the appropriate behavioral response.}},

Abstract = {{The corticotropin-releasing factor ( CRF) system is the primary central
   mediator of stress-like states, coordinating behavioral, endocrine, and
   autonomic responses to stress. Although induction of anorexia is a well
   documented effect of CRF receptor agonist administration, the central
   sites and behavioral processes underlying this phenomenon are poorly
   understood. The present studies addressed this question by examining the
   neuroanatomical, behavioral, and pharmacological mechanisms mediating
   decreases in feeding produced by the CRF1/CRF2 receptor agonist
   urocortin. Separate groups of food-restricted male Sprague Dawley rats
   were given infusions of urocortin ( 0, 50, 125, 250 ng/0.5 mu l) into
   the lateral septum (LS) and immediately afterward were rated on a wide
   array of behaviors (locomotion, rearing, grooming, stereotypies)
   including a microstructural analysis of ingestive behavior. Intra-LS
   urocortin infusion dose-dependently reduced feeding and drinking while
   concomitantly increasing grooming, stereotypies, and ethological plus
   traditional measures of anxiety-like responses in the elevated
   plus-maze. Urocortin infusion into neighboring sites (lateral ventricle,
   medial caudate) had no effects. Coinfusion into the LS of the mixed
   CRF1/CRF2 receptor antagonist D-Phe-CRF(12-41) (0, 100, 1000 ng/0.5 mu
   l) or the novel selective CRF2 receptor antagonist Astressin2B ( 0, 500,
   1000 ng/0.5 mu l) blocked urocortin-induced effects, but the
   CRF1-selective antagonist NBI27914 ( 0, 500, 1000 ng/0.5 mu l) had no
   effect, although it completely reversed the behavioral sequelae of CRF
   when infused into the basolateral amygdala. These results indicate that
   one of the modes through which the CRF system promotes anorexia is the
   recruitment of stress-like states after stimulation of CRF2 receptors
   within the LS.}},

Abstract = {{Human depression and anxiety disorders show inherited biases across
   generations, as do antisocial disorders characterized by aggression.
   Each condition is preceded in children by behavioral inhibition or
   aggressive behavior, respectively, and both are characterized by
   separation anxiety disorders. In affected families, adults and children
   exhibit different forms of altered autonomic nervous system regulation
   and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity in response to stress.
   Because it is difficult to determine mechanisms accounting for these
   associations, animal studies are useful for studying the fundamental
   relationships between biological and behavioral traits. Pharmacologic
   and behavioral studies suggest that infant rat ultrasonic vocalizations
   (USV) are a measure of an early anxiety-like state related to separation
   anxiety. However, it was not known whether or not early ultrasound
   emissions in infant rats are markers for genetic risk for anxiety states
   later in life. To address these questions. we selectively bred two lines
   of rats based on high and low rates of USV to isolation at postnatal (P)
   10 days of age. To our knowledge, ours is the only laboratory that has
   ever selectively bred on the basis of an infantile trait related to
   anxiety. The High and Low USV lines show two distinct sets of patterns
   of behavior, physiology and neurochemistry from infancy through
   adulthood. As adults High line rats demonstrate 4
   ``anxious{''}/{''}depressed{''} phenotypes in behavior and autonomic
   nervous system (ANS) regulation to standard laboratory tests. In Lows,
   on the other hand, behavior and autonomic regulation are consistent with
   an ``aggressive{''} phenotype. The High and Low USV lines are the first
   genetic animal models implicating long-term associations of contrasting
   ``coping styles{''} with early attachment responses. They thus present a
   potentially powerful model for examining gene-environment interactions
   in the development of life-long affective regulation. (c) 2007 Elsevier

Title = {{Developmental origins of life history: Growth, productivity, and

Abstract = {{There is now much evidence that early life undernutrition elevates risk
   of diseases like cardiovascular disease. Less clear is whether the
   underlying developmental plasticity in metabolism and physiology evolved
   to serve an adaptive function, beyond these effects on pathophysiology.
   This review builds from principles of life history theory to propose a
   functional model linking early environments with adult biology. An
   organism has metabolic potential in excess of survival requirements,
   called productivity, that supports growth before being shunted into
   reproduction after growth ceases. This concept from inter-specific
   studies leads to the prediction that plasticity in growth rate will be
   positively correlated with components of future adult reproductive
   expenditure. Consistent with this idea, evidence is reviewed that early
   nutrition or growth rate predict offspring size in females, and
   increased somatic investment related to reproductive strategy in males.
   Thus, population birth weight and sexual size dimorphism are predicted
   to increase in response to improvements in early nutrition. A striking
   feature of the continuity of metabolic production is its perpetuation
   not merely during the lifecycle but across generations: in females,
   growth rate predicts future nutritional investment in reproduction,
   which in turn determines fetal growth rate in the next generation.
   Growth and reproduction serve as mutually-defining templates, thus
   creating a phenotypic bridge allowing ecologic information to be
   maintained during ontogeny and transmitted to offspring. Resetting of
   metabolic production in response to maternal nutritional cues may serve
   a broader goal of integrating nutritional information within the
   matriline, thus providing a more reliable basis for adjusting long-term
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Lifestyle factors, including diet, are critical in the prevention and
   treatment of type 2 diabetes. Because weight gain increases diabetes
   risk, and even modest weight reduction reduces risk, weight management
   is paramount in lessening the occurrence and effects of diabetes. Weight
   loss interventions should include patient education, behavioral
   strategies, physical activity, energy intake deficits of 500 to 1000
   kcal/day, and prevention of recidivism. Macronutrient distribution
   ranges of diets for diabetic patients follow those of the Dietary
   Reference Intakes, allowing for individualization according to a
   patient's metabolic responses, needs, and preferences. Nutrients to be
   limited include saturated fats, artificial trans fats, cholesterol, and
   sodium, whereas nutrients to be emphasized include monounsaturated fatty
   acids, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, fibers, antioxidants, and
   minerals, including potassium, magnesium, calcium, and chromium. Food
   sources are advised rather than supplements. Sugars can be
   isocalorically substituted for starches without detriments to glycemic
   control. Diets with low glycemic index or load may have modest benefits
