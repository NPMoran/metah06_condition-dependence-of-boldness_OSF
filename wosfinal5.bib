Abstract = {{Individuals have to trade- off energy intake against the risk of
   predation when foraging. However, in group-living species, social
   interference will limit the range of choices for subordinate
   individuals. The trade- off between foraging and predation risk may be
   even more complex in species that associate in family groups because
   relatives can provide benefits to each other that are withheld from
   nonrelatives. As a consequence, nonrelatives may be forced to take
   greater risks to gain similar amounts of energy as relatives. Here, I
   investigate how the energy-risk trade- off varies among individuals in a
   social, group- living species, the Siberian jay, Perisoreus infaustus.
   Groups in this species consist of a breeding pair, together with
   retained offspring and/ or nonrelated immigrants. I manipulated food
   quality at feeding sites that differed in their visibility to predators
   and observed the differences in foraging patterns between different
   group members. Adults and their offspring fed more often at the
   protected feeding site when it contained high- quality food, but
   switched to the more exposed site when this site offered higher quality
   food than the protected site. In contrast, immigrants spent a similar
   amount of time at each feeding site, independent of food quality. Birds
   generally spent more time waiting for access to the high- quality food
   source and protected feeding site, and family members generally harassed
   immigrants that tried to access these sites. None the less, all birds
   had a similar overall food intake, suggesting that immigrants pay
   substantially higher costs than other members to attain the equivalent
   level of energy intake. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{In studies of refuge use as a form of antipreclator behavior where prey
   hide in response to a predator's approach, factors such as foraging
   costs and the perceived risk in a predator's approach have been shown to
   influence the hiding behavior of prey. Because few studies of waiting
   games have focused on mammals, we studied the hiding behavior of the
   yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris), a ground-dwelling rodent.
   We tested the prediction that marmots vary hiding time as a function of
   predator approach speed and presence and absence of food outside their
   refuge and that marmots hide differently depending on their relative
   condition. We conducted ``fast approaches{''} and ``slow approaches{''}
   in the presence and absence of extra food and evaluated hiding times.
   Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that the interaction between
   the approach speed and the presence and absence of food influenced
   hiding behavior; body condition had a smaller, but nonsignificant
   effect. We then developed a state-dependent dynamic model to explore
   potential fitness consequences of these decisions. The model suggested
   that the overall survival of a population is substantially reduced when
   individuals make suboptimal decisions. Our research builds on previous
   studies, indicating that animals integrate both costs and benefits of
   hiding when determining their hiding times.}},

Abstract = {{The ex situ population of maned wolves is not self-sustaining due to
   poor reproduction, caused primarily by parental incompetence. Studies
   have shown that environmental enrichment can promote natural parental
   behaviors in zoo animals. The objective of this study was to determine
   the effects of environmental enrichment on behavioral and physiological
   responses of maned wolves. During an 8-week experimental period, daily
   behavior observations and fecal sample collection were conducted on four
   adult wolves (2.2) individually housed in environments without
   enrichment. After 2 weeks, the wolves were chronologically provided with
   2-week intervals of hiding dead mice around the exhibit, no enrichment,
   and introduction of boomer balls. Responses of the wolves to enrichment
   were assessed based on activity levels and exploratory rates, as well as
   the level of corticoid metabolites in fecal samples collected daily
   throughout the study period. Providing wolves with environmental
   enrichment significantly increased exploratory behaviors (P < 0.05),
   especially when mice were hidden in the enclosure. Fecal corticoid
   concentrations were increased during periods of enrichment in males (P <
   0.05), but not in females. Overall, there were no correlations between
   behavioral responses to enrichment and fecal corticoid levels.
   Behavioral results suggest that environmental enrichment elicits
   positive effects on the behavior of captive maned wolves. There is
   evidence suggesting that providing animals with ability to forage for
   food is a more effective enrichment strategy than introducing objects.
   There is need for a longer term study to determine the impact of
   environmental enrichment in this species.}},

Abstract = {{If changes in animal behavior resulting from direct human disturbance
   negatively affect the persistence of a given species or population, then
   these behavioral changes must necessarily lead to reduced demographic
   performance. We tested for the effects of human disturbance on Olympic
   marmots (Marmota olympus), a large ground-dwelling squirrel that has
   disappeared from several areas where recreation levels are high. We
   assessed the degree to which antipredator and foraging behavior and
   demographic rates (survival and reproduction) differed between sites
   with high recreation levels (high use) and those with little or no
   recreation (low use). Compared with the marmots at low-use sites,
   marmots at high-use sites displayed significantly reduced responses to
   human approach, which could be construed as successful accommodation of
   disturbance or as a decrease in predator awareness. The marmots at
   high-use sites also looked up more often while foraging, which suggests
   an increased wariness. Marmots at both types of sites had comparable
   reproductive and survival rates and were in similar body condition.
   Until now, the supposition that marmots can adjust their behavior to
   avoid negative demographic consequences when confronted with heavy
   tourism has been based on potentially ambiguous behavioral data. Our
   results support this hypothesis in the case of Olympic marmots and
   demonstrate the importance of considering demographic data when
   evaluating the impacts of recreation on animal populations.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible time budgets allow individual animals to buffer the effects of
   variable food availability by allocating more time to foraging when food
   density decreases. This trait should be especially important for marine
   predators that forage on patchy and ephemeral food resources. We
   examined flexible time allocation by a long-lived marine predator, the
   Common Murre (Uria aalge), using data collected in a five-year study at
   three colonies in Alaska (USA) with contrasting environmental
   conditions. Annual hydroacoustic surveys revealed an order-of-magnitude
   variation in food density among the 15 colony-ye'ars of study. We used
   data on parental time budgets and local prey density to test predictions
   from two hypotheses: Hypothesis A, the colony attendance of seabirds
   varies nonlinearly with food density; and Hypothesis B, flexible time
   allocation of parent murres buffers chicks against variable food
   availability. Hypothesis A was supported; colony attendance by murres
   was positively correlated with food over a limited range of
   poor-to-moderate food densities, but independent of food over a broader
   range of higher densities. This is the first empirical evidence for a
   nonlinear response of a marine predator's time budget to changes in prey
   density. Predictions from Hypothesis B were largely supported: (1)
   chick-feeding rates were fairly constant over a wide range of densities
   and only dropped below 3.5 meals per day at the low end of prey density,
   and (2) there was a nonlinear relationship between chick-feeding rates
   and time spent at the colony, with chick-feeding rates only declining
   after time at the colony by the nonbrooding parent was reduced to a
   minimum. The ability of parents to adjust their foraging time by more
   than 2 h/d explains why they were able to maintain chick-feeding rates
   of more than 3.5 meals/d across a 10-fold range in local food density.}},

   for an eating disorder throughout the follow-up period compared to

   rates of major depression, anxiety disorders, and disruptive behavior
   disorder compared to ADHD girls without eating disorders. Girls with
   ADHD and eating disorders had a significantly earlier mean age at

Abstract = {{The complex interplay between neural and endocrine responses following
   food intake regulates ingestive behaviour and ultimately determines
   subsequent energy intake. These processes include cognitive,
   gastrointestinal-derived and metabolic mechanisms. Such physiological
   responses to the ingestion of food initiate short-to medium-term
   inhibition of intake (satiety). However, in clinical states in which
   systemic inflammation is evident there is a more profound satiety
   response and a clear absence of motivation to eat that is evident as
   loss of appetite. These negative influences on energy intake can
   contribute to poor nutritional status, and consequently poor physical
   function, and impact on rehabilitation and recovery. Cytokine mediators
   of the inflammatory response directly influence feeding behaviour at the
   hypothalamic nuclei and may explain the lack of motivation and desire
   for food. However, additional detrimental effects on appetite are
   brought about because of alterations in intermediary metabolism present
   in inflammation-induced catabolism. This process forms part of the host
   response to inflammation and may explain symptoms, such as early
   satiety, frequently reported in many patient groups. In clinical states,
   and cancer in particular, pharmacological strategies have been employed
   to ameliorate the inflammatory response in an attempt to improve energy
   intake. Some success of this approach has been reported following
   administration of substrates such as EPA. Novel strategies to improve
   intake through administration of anti-cytokine drugs such as thalidomide
   may also be of benefit. However, drugs that oppose the actions of
   neurotransmitter pathways involved in central induction of satiety, such
   as 5-hydroxytryptamine, have failed to improve intake but appear to
   enhance enjoyment of food. Such findings indicate that therapeutic
   nutritional targets can only be achieved where novel pharmacological
   therapies can be supported by more innovative and integrated dietary
   management strategies. Many of these strategies remain to be elucidated.}},

Abstract = {{Columbina passetina and C. minuta (Aves, Columbidae) are two Neotropical
   species of Ground Doves with similar morphology, behavior and natural
   history. However, they exhibit notably different distributions on
   Caribbean islands. While C. passerina is found on a majority of them, C.
   minuta is restricted in the Caribbean to Trinidad. We hypothesized that
   an explanation for this extreme difference in ranges is due to
   differences in at least three traits often associated with successful
   island colonization: morphological structures that promote long flight
   efficiency, dietary plasticity and water requirements. We tested the
   first factor by comparing several wing measurements and the other two
   factors with experiments on wild-caught birds in controlled conditions.
   We did not find significant differences in wing measures. However, C.
   passerina showed greater dietary plasticity, a wider diet breadth and
   lower daily water requirements than C. minuta. Keeping in mind that
   island colonization success may be shaped by many variables, we
   concluded that the success of C. passerina maintaining populations on so
   many Caribbean islands is at least partially explained by its ability to
   survive in environments with unpredictable food changes and severe fresh
   water limitations as usually found on some Caribbean islands.}},

   traits associated with survival in one life-history stage can strongly
   affect the performance in subsequent stages with important repercussions

   most influential in determining patterns of survival in a cohort of reef
   fish, we compared the characteristics of Pomacentrus amboinensis
   surviving early juvenile stages on the reef with those of the cohort
   from which they originated. Individuals were collected at hatching, the
   end of the planktonic phase, and two, three, four, six and eight weeks
   post-settlement. Information stored in the otoliths of individual fish
   revealed strong carry-over effects of larval condition at hatching on
   juvenile survival, weeks after settlement (i.e. smaller-is-better).
   Among the traits examined, planktonic growth history was, by far, the
   most influential and long-lasting trait associated with juvenile
   persistence in reef habitats. However, otolith increments suggested that
   larval growth rate may not be maintained during early juvenile life,
   when selective mortality swiftly reverses its direction. These changes
   in selective pressure may mediate growth-mortality trade-offs between
   predation and starvation risks during early juvenile life. Ontogenetic

Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{63-69}},

Abstract = {{By facilitating avoidance of kin competition and inbreeding, natal
   dispersal can have direct fitness consequences. Mechanisms that optimize
   indirect fitness may be equally important. When relatives compete for
   the same resources (kin competition), evolution of elevated dispersal
   rates can be favoured, so that most resource competition is among
   nonrelatives. When offspring are incapable of dispersing, maternal
   behaviour may influence natal dispersal in a positive way, by spreading
   offspring throughout the habitat. By combining laboratory and field
   observations, we studied dismounting behaviour of spiderlings from the
   maternal abdomen (i.e. maternal care) and mobility patterns of female
   wolf spiders, Pardosa monticola. Laboratory observations on the duration
   of maternal care indicated that spiderlings desert the maternal abdomen
   gradually within 185 h of hatching. Detailed behavioural monitoring
   within the spider's habitat showed that females carrying spiderlings on
   their back were more mobile with greater directionality of movement than
   females of other reproductive states. This alteration in female
   mobility, together with the gradual dismounting of offspring from the
   abdomen, indicates maternally induced natal `hitchhiking' dispersal.
   These findings show that maternal effects may influence natal dispersal
   not only through condition dependence, but also by the active spreading
   of offspring throughout the habitat before they actively (decide to)
   disperse. This gradual dismounting of offspring is evolutionarily
   beneficial for the avoidance of kin competition. (C) 2007 The

   Questionnaires (FCQ-T and FCQ-S), as developed by Cepeda-Benito,
   Gleaves, Williams, and Erath, {[}2000. The development and validation of
   the State and Trait Food Cravings Questionnaires. Behavior Therapy, 31,
   151-173], were modified in order to construct an index of general food
   craving instead of specific food craving. The factor structure, validity
   and reliability of the modified questionnaires, renamed as the Trait and
   State General Food Cravings Questionnaires (G-FCQ-T and G-FCQ-S), were
   investigated in three separate studies. Firstly, exploratory factor
   analyses were conducted, which yielded a G-FCQ-T with a four-factor
   structure, that was considerably shorter as compared to the original
   (nine-factor) FCQ-T, and a G-FCQ-S of which the factor structure was
   highly comparable to the original FCQ-S. Secondly, in an attempt to
   replicate the factor structures of the G-FCQ-T and the G-FCQ-S as found
   in Study 1, confirmative factor analyses were performed. Results
   indicated adequate fits for both questionnaires. In addition, the
   test-retest reliability of both versions was satisfactory and an
   analysis of the construct validity generally revealed the expected
   results. In Study 3, the validity of the state version of the G-FCQ was
   further investigated by relating scores on this questionnaire to indices
   of food deprivation and satiation. Results indicated that the G-FCQ-S
   indeed measures food craving as a variable state, which is influenced by
   situational and temporal variables. Altogether, it can be concluded that
   the G-FCQ-T and G-FCQ-S are both reliable and valid measures of general
   trait-like and state-dependent food craving. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Competition is predicted to affect the expression of inducible defenses,
   but because costs of behavioral and morphological antipredator defenses
   differ along resource gradients, its effects on defenses may depend on
   the traits considered. We tested the predictions from different defense
   models in tadpoles of the common frog Rana temporaria, which exhibit
   both types of defenses. In an outdoor experiment, we exposed the
   tadpoles to nonlethal predators (Aeshna dragonfly larvae) and to a
   gradient of intraspecific competition. Morphological responses did not
   follow any of the expected patterns, since investment in defense was not
   affected by resource level. Instead, tail depth decreased in the absence
   of predators. Behavioral defenses followed a state-dependent model.
   Overall, the defense strategy of the tadpoles revealed a shift from
   morphological and behavioral defenses at low tadpole density to
   morphological defense only at high density. This difference probably
   reflects the different efficiency of the defenses. Hiding is an
   effective means of defense, but it is unsustainable when resources are
   scarce. Morphological responses become more important with increasing
   density to compensate for the increase in behavioral risk-taking. Our
   results indicate that competition can strongly affect reaction norms of
   inducible defenses and highlight the importance of integrating
   ecological parameters that affect the cost-benefit balance of phenotypic
   plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe menstrual disturbance in eating disorders (ED).
   Method: We describe menstrual history in 1,705 women and compare eating,
   weight, and psychopathological traits across menstrual groups.
   Results: Menstrual dysfunction occurred across all eating disorder
   subtypes. Individuals with normal menstrual history and primary
   amenorrhea reported the highest and lowest lifetime body mass index
   (BMI), respectively. Normal menstruation and oligomenorrhea groups
   reported greater binge eating, vomiting, and appetite suppressant use.
   Amenorrhea was associated with lower caloric intake and higher exercise.
   Harm avoidance, novelty seeking, perfectionism, and obsessionality
   discriminated among menstrual status groups. No differences in comorbid
   Axis I and II disorders were observed.
   Conclusion: Menstrual dysfunction is not limited to any eating disorder
   subtype. BMI, caloric intake, and exercise were strongly associated with
   menstrual function. Menstrual status is not associated with comorbidity.
   Menstrual irregularity is an associated feature of all ED rather than
   being restricted to AN only. (c) 2007 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Arctic Cervids face considerable challenges in sustaining life in a
   harsh and highly seasonal environment, and when to forage is a key
   component of the survival strategy. We predict that a cervid maximizes
   net intake of energy to change the duration of feeding-ruminating cycles
   depending on season, and pays no attention to light or other
   activity-entraining cues. Still, in periods of bad weather it may pay
   energetically to reduce exposure and heat loss. We investigated
   environmental impact on the seasonal and daily activity pattern of a
   food-limited, predator-free arctic deer, the Svalbard reindeer. We found
   that the reindeer indeed had season-dependent feeding-rumination
   intervals, with no distinct peaks in activity at sunrise and sunset, as
   would be expected if animals maximize energy intake rates in
   predator-free environments. However, they temporarily reduced activity
   when exposed to low temperature and increased precipitation during
   winter, possibly to conserve energy. We provide insight into the
   behavioural strategy of Svalbard reindeer which enables them to cope
   with such an extreme environment.}},

Abstract = {{Food availability can strongly affect predator-prey dynamics. When
   change in habitat condition reduces the availability of one prey type,
   predators often search for other prey, perhaps in a different habitat.
   Interactions between behavioural and morphological traits of different
   prey may influence foraging success of visual predators through
   trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs), such as prey activity and
   body coloration. We tested the hypothesis that foraging success of
   stream-dwelling cutthroat trout (Onchorhyncus clarki) on cryptically
   coloured, less-active benthic prey (larval mayfly; Paraleptophebia sp.)
   can be enhanced by the presence of distinctly coloured, active prey
   (larval stonefly shredder; Despaxia augusta). Cutthroat trout preyed on
   benthic insects when drifting invertebrates were unavailable. When
   stonefly larvae were present, the trout ate most of the stoneflies and
   also consumed a higher proportion of mayflies than under mayfly only
   treatment. The putative mechanism is that active stonefly larvae
   supplied visual cues to the predator that alerted trout to the mayfly
   larvae. Foraging success of visual predators on cryptic prey can be
   enhanced by distinctly coloured, active benthic taxa through
   unidirectional facilitation to the predators, which is a functional
   change of interspecific interaction caused by a third species. This
   study suggests that prey-predator facilitation through TMIIs can modify
   species interactions, affecting community dynamics.}},

Volume = {{73}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Both sexes of the turquoise-browed motmot, Eumomota superciliosa,
   display their long-racketed tail in an exaggerated side-to-side wag
   display in two contexts. In the. rst, the wag display is performed in
   the presence of predators (predator-elicited wag display), and evidence
   supports the hypothesis that the signal functions as a pursuit-deterrent
   signal (Murphy 2006, Behavioral Ecology, 17, 547-553). In the second,
   the wag display is performed in the apparent absence of predators
   immediately before feeding nestlings ( prefeeding wag display). I tested
   four hypotheses on the adaptive significance of the prefeeding wag
   display: ( 1) a dishonest, preemptive, pursuit-deterrent signal given in
   case predators are present; ( 2) a nonfunctional mis. re of the
   predator-elicited wag display; ( 3) a signal that alerts nestlings to
   the delivery of food; ( 4) a sexually selected signal that advertises
   parental quality to potential mates. There was no support for the
   hypotheses that the prefeeding wag display was directed to nestlings or
   potential mates. The wag display was generally performed where nestlings
   could not detect the signal and the display did not vary with the sex of
   the displaying bird, the presence of the mate, or the size of the food
   carried in the signaller's bill. Evidence presented in this paper is
   most consistent with the hypothesis that the predator-elicited wag
   display and the prefeeding wag display are performed as a response to
   the presence or the potential presence of a predator. I discuss the
   possibility that the prefeeding wag display functions as a dishonest,
   pursuit-deterrent signal. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Although numerous species of sea urchins often cover themselves with
   small rocks, shells and algal fragments, the function of this covering
   behaviour is poorly understood. Diving observations showed that the
   degree to which the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis covers
   itself in the field decreases with size. We performed laboratory
   experiments to examine how the sea urchin's covering behaviour is
   affected by the presence of predators, sea urchin size, wave surge,
   contact with moving algae blades and sunlight. The presence of two
   common sea urchin predators did not influence the degree to which sea
   urchins covered themselves. Covering responses of sea urchins that were
   exposed to a strong wave surge and sweeping algal blades were
   significantly greater than those of individuals that were maintained
   under still water conditions. The degree to which sea urchins covered
   themselves in the laboratory also tended to decrease with increasing
   size. Juveniles showed stronger covering responses than adults, possibly
   because they are more vulnerable to dislodgement and predation. We found
   that UV light stimulated a covering response, whereas UV-filtered
   sunlight and darkness did not, although the response to UV light was
   much weaker than that to waves and algal movement. Our observations
   suggest that the covering behaviour of S. droebachiensis has evolved as
   an adaptation to protect it from mechanical injuries associated with
   abrasion and dislodgement, and to a lesser extent as a defence against
   UV radiation. The covering behaviour may reduce the sea urchin's ability
   to move and this would limit its ability to forage and to. ee from
   predators. In this case, the covering behaviour may have evolved as a
   trade-off between locomotion and limiting environmental stresses. (C)

Abstract = {{Animals show specific morphological, physiological and behavioural
   adaptations to diurnal or nocturnal activity. Cathemeral species, i.e.
   animals with activities distributed over the 24-h period, have to
   compromise between these specific adaptations. The driving evolutionary
   forces and the proximate costs and benefits of cathemerality are still
   poorly understood. Our goal was to evaluate the role of predator
   avoidance, food availability and diet quality in shaping cathemeral
   activity of arboreal mammals using a lemur species as an example. For
   this, two groups of collared lemurs, Eulemur collaris, were studied for
   14 months in the littoral forest of southeastern Madagascar. Data on
   feeding behaviour were collected during all-day and all-night follows by
   direct observation. A phenological transect containing 78 plant species
   was established and monitored every 2 weeks to evaluate food
   availability during the study period. Characteristics of food items and
   animal nutritional intake were determined via biochemical analyses. The
   ratio of diurnal to nocturnal feeding was used as response variable in
   the analyses. The effects of abiotic environmental variables were
   removed statistically before the analyses of the biotic variables. We
   found that diurnal feeding lasted longer during the hot-wet season
   (December-February), whereas nocturnal feeding peaked during the hot-dry
   and cool-wet seasons (March-August). Although the lemurs foraged mostly
   in lower forest strata during daylight and used emergent trees
   preferably at night, the variables which measured animal exposure to
   birds of prey failed to predict the variation of the ratio of
   diurnal/nocturnal feeding. Ripe fruit availability and fiber intake are
   the two variables which best predicted the annual variation of the lemur
   diurnality. The data indicate that feeding over the whole 24-h cycle is
   advantageous during lean periods when animals have a fibre-rich,
   low-quality diet.}},

   Disorder Examination (EDE), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the
   TCI. Treatment was based on the transdiagnostic cognitive behavior
   theory and treatment of ED, adapted for an inpatient setting. Treatment
   effects were tested by paired ANOVA, adjusted for covariates. No effects

Abstract = {{Background: Individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) exhibit severe
   disturbances in appetite regulation, including delayed meal termination,
   early return of hunger after a meal, seeking and hoarding food and
   eating of non-food substances. Brain pathways involved in the control of
   appetite in humans are thought to include the hypothalamus, frontal
   cortex (including the orbitofrontal, ventromedial prefrontal,
   dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas), insula, and
   limbic and paralimbic areas. We hypothesised that the abnormal appetite
   in PWS results from aberrant reward processing of food stimuli in these
   neural pathways.
   Methods: We compared functional MRI blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD)
   responses while viewing pictures of food in eight adults with PWS and
   eight normal weight adults after ingestion of an oral glucose load.
   Results: Subjects with PWS demonstrated significantly greater BOLD
   activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex than controls when
   viewing food pictures. No significant differences were found in serum
   insulin, glucose or triglyceride levels between the groups at the time
   of the scan.
   Conclusions: Individuals with PWS had an increased BOLD response in the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex compared with normal weight controls when
   viewing pictures of food after an oral glucose load. These findings
   suggest that an increased reward value for food may underlie the
   excessive hunger in PWS, and support the significance of the frontal
   cortex in modulating the response to food in humans. Our findings in the
   extreme appetite phenotype of PWS support the importance of the neural
   pathways that guide reward related behaviour in modulating the response
   to food in humans.}},

Abstract = {{In this review we evaluate whether universal behavioral and metabolic
   mechanisms exist, which permit marine proto- and metazooplankton to
   persist in continuously food-limited environments such as the North
   Pacific Subtropical Gyre and other oligotrophic ocean systems. We
   re-visit the issue of what processes account for low steady-state
   abundance of the dominant groups of planktonic grazers: phagotrophic
   protists and copepods, by examining evidence for the four processes
   proposed by Strom et al. (2000): grazing thresholds, behavioral response
   to prey patchiness, top-down control of grazers, and mixotrophy
   (combination of photosynthesis and phagotrophy in protists) and/or
   omnivory (switching between alternate prey types). Published
   observations reveal that grazing thresholds, below which feeders reduce
   their feeding efforts and, with that, their metabolic expenditures, do
   exist. There are also studies suggesting that both protistan and small
   metazoan plankton feeders may take advantage of patchiness of food
   particles and are frequently mixotrophic and/or omnivorous. Predator
   patchiness in response to prey patches may facilitate top-down control
   of grazers. Finally, we discuss processes, which may lead to low quasi
   steady-state abundances of food particles and feeders.}},

Abstract = {{Using the density of food left in a patch after foraging - i.e. the
   giving-up density (GUD) - as a behavioural indicator, short-term
   foraging studies on birds in the dry and wet fringing forests and
   savanna habitats of the Amurum Forest Reserve, Laminga, Nigeria, were
   used to evaluate whether widespread food abundance will affect their
   behaviour in these apparently-different habitats. The effect of the dry
   season on feeding activity and the effects of temperature within, and
   between, days were also investigated. Results showed that GUDs were
   highest in dry fringing forests, intermediate in wet fringing forests,
   and lowest in savanna. This difference may have been as a result of a
   difference in food abundance between habitats. The availability of water
   in the wet fringing forests may have affected the feeding behaviour of
   the birds in the wet gully habitat compared with those of the dry gully.
   The behaviour of birds in response to time of day was affected by
   temperature, as there was no difference between GUDs in open and covered
   habitats in the mornings at lower temperatures, but lower GUDs were
   recorded in cover (at higher temperatures) in the afternoon when birds
   may - due to thermoregulatory costs - retreat to cover more often.
   However, temperature had no effect on GUDs over season. A reduction in
   GUDs towards the end of the dry season, as food resources deplete, gives
   further credence to the observation that food abundance affects
   behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Response variability, a fundamental characteristic of behavior, may be

   reinforcement, periodicity of reinforcement, and type of schedule have
   resulted in mixed findings. Contingencies have also been arranged to
   directly influence operant response variability. These include lag
   reinforcement schedules, differential reinforcement of novel behavior,
   differential reinforcement of less frequent behavior, and percentile
   reinforcement schedules. These procedures are discussed in terms of
   practicality and implications for use in applied settings. Contingencies
   and treatment packages that indirectly influence response variability
   are addressed in terms of response allocation, response generalization,
   and response covariation. Studies on the effects of a variety of other

Abstract = {{Animals use behavioural plasticity to cope with conflicting selective
   pressures. We investigated how prey availability affects the spinning of
   cobwebs, whose architecture influences both prey capture and defence.
   Fed western black widows spun cobwebs containing more silk than did
   fasted spiders. However, fed spiders invested relatively less silk in
   the sheets and sticky gumfooted threads of webs and relatively more silk
   in supporting threads than did fasted spiders. The material properties
   of silk spun by fed and fasted spiders were relatively similar, but silk
   threads spun by fed spiders were twice as thick as those of fasted
   spiders, increasing web strength by 225\%. Finally, spiders fed late in
   the experiment did not reproduce, even though they received the same
   amount of food as spiders fed earlier, 43\% of which reproduced. The
   reallocation of silk in cobwebs away from sheets and sticky gumfooted
   threads, which function in prey capture, to supporting threads, which
   surround spiders with defensive clouds of silk, is consistent with
   reduced foraging effort and increased predation risk avoidance by fed
   spiders. Furthermore, this behavioural shift occurs as spiders are
   reproducing, when spiders can most afford the costs of reduced prey
   capture and would most benefit from enhanced protection. Our results
   contrast with those of previous studies on orb-weaving spiders, which
   found reductions in the sizes of webs as spiders caught more food. Thus,
   the architectures of spider webs reflect many selective pressures, the
   effects of which may vary with physiological state. (C) 2007 The

   densities we found a threshold, above which intake rate still increased
   linearly but with a lower slope, possibly reflecting a switch from
   filter-feeding to a scooping foraging mode.
   The present study shows that food intake rate in teal is linearly
   related to food availability within the range of naturally occurring

Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity has been the object of considerable interest over
   the past several decades, but in few cases are mechanisms underlying
   plastic responses well understood. For example, it is unclear whether
   predator-induced changes in gastropod shell morphology represent an
   active physiological response or a by-product of reduced feeding. We
   address this question by manipulating feeding and growth of intertidal
   snails, Littorina obtusata, using two approaches: (i) exposure to
   predation cues from green crabs Carcinus maenas and (ii) reduced food
   availability, and quantifying growth in shell length, shell mass, and
   body mass, as well as production of faecal material and shell
   micro-structural characteristics (mineralogy and organic fraction) after
   96 days. We demonstrate that L. obtusata actively increases
   calcification rate in response to predation threat, and that this
   response entails energetic and developmental costs. That this induced
   response is not strictly tied to the animal's behaviour should enhance

Abstract = {{Perch Perca fluviatilis of age 0+ years were caught in a gravel pit lake
   in June (unimodal size distribution) and in July (bimodal size
   distribution) to analyse morphological differences between the two
   growth cohorts. Independent of size, 0+ year perch developed a deeper
   body and perch of the large size cohort had an even deeper body than
   perch of the small size cohort. This might have been adaptations to
   either piscivory or planktivory, but might also be a hint that 0+ year
   perch of the small size cohort were undernourished and that they
   developed on a different trajectory than individuals of the large size
   cohort. In a second step the study was extended with a mesocosm
   experiment. This part of the study was designed to provide preliminary
   evidence for the extent to which morphological variations may be due to
   the consumption of different food resources when other factors such as
   habitat use could be neglected. Two groups of 0+ year perch in four
   mesocosms were fed for 40 days with the same biomass of either plankton
   or cyprinids. Although the experimental groups at the end of the
   experiment did not differ in size, they differed in morphology. The
   mouth of the piscivorous 0+ year perch became larger, the pectoral fins

   These results provide further evidence that the type of food is

   phalangium, which provide, together with specialized cryptic behaviors,
   protection against predators. Although our data suggest that the

Abstract = {{Predator-generated variation in prey energy intake remains the dominant
   explanation of adaptive response to predation risk in prey life history,
   morphology and physiology across a wide range of taxa. This
   ``behavioural hypothesis{''} suggest that chemical or visual signals of
   predation risk reduce prey energy intake leading to a life history
   characterized by a small size and late age at maturity. However,
   size-selective predation can induce either smaller size-early age or
   large size-late age life history. The alternative ``physiological
   hypothesis{''} suggests that size-selective cues decouple the
   relationship between energy and life history, acting instead directly on
   development. Here we use a series of experiments in a fish-daphnid
   predator-prey system to ask whether size-selective predator cues induce
   a physiological mediation of development, overshadowing behaviourally
   based changes in food intake. We found fish chemical cues reduce the net
   energy intake in Daphnia magna, suggesting a behaviourally mediated
   reduction in energy. Experimental manipulation of food levels show
   further that reductions in food lead to later but smaller size at
   maturity. However, in line with the physiological hypothesis, we show
   that D. magna matures earlier and at a smaller size when exposed to fish
   predation cues. Furthermore, our data shows that they do this by
   increasing their development rate (earlier maturity) for a given growth
   rate, resulting in a smaller size at maturity. Our data, from a classic
   size-selective predation system, indicate that predator-induced changes
   in this system are driven by physiological mediation of development
   rather than behavioural mediation of energy intake.}},

Abstract = {{There is now considerable evidence that elements of the heritable or

   life-long alterations in gene expression. Such nongenomic tuning of
   phenotype through developmental plasticity has adaptive value because it
   attempts to match an individual's responses to the environment predicted
   to be experienced. When the responses are mismatched, disease risk
   increases. An example of such mismatch is that arising either from
   inaccurate nutritional cues from the mother or placenta before birth, or
   from rapid environmental change through improved socioeconomic
   conditions, which contribute substantially to the increasing prevalence

Abstract = {{Childhood obesity is growing rapidly worldwide. Although there have been
   enormous advances in the genetic underpinnings of obesity in recent
   years, the pathways that lead to obesity are still not completely
   understood. one of the ongoing challenges is the lack of a comprehensive
   definition of the obese phenotype that encompasses intermediary
   phenotypic expressions of biological and behavioral nature. Interactions
   between genetic and environmental factors, including nutrient exposures
   and dietary behaviors, can influence the development of the obese
   phenotype. Specifically, genes play a decisive role in the etiology of
   childhood obesity under the permissive circumstances of an obesogenic
   environment (increase in energy intake with a decrease in physical
   activity). Like many diseases, the causes of obesity are complex and
   their investigation requires novel approaches. Given the many
   contributors to obesity (weight gain, weight loss, weight maintenance,
   variability in body composition), as well as the dynamic nature of this
   issue, genomic tools must continue to be employed to evaluate all
   dimensions of the obesity phenotype, such as biochemical
   characteristics, susceptibility markers, nutrient intake, feeding
   practices and gene-environment interactions. Fundamental knowledge of
   the types of genes involved and available gene-diet interaction studies

   existing literature in this specific domain of childhood obesity,
   ongoing investigations utilizing large cohorts have potential for
   providing the knowledge needed for targeted interventions in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Many different physiological changes have been observed in wild
   waterfowl during the flightless stage of wing moult, including a loss of
   body mass. We aimed to determine whether captive barnacle geese (Branta
   leucopsis) would show the characteristic decrease in body mass during
   their wing moult, even though they had unlimited and unrestricted access
   to food. Fourteen captive geese were weighed at 1-2-week intervals for
   two complete years. During the flightless period of the moult, body mass
   decreased by approximately 25\% from the pre-moult value. To understand
   the basis of this change, the rate of oxygen consumption was measured
   during daytime and nighttime at six points in the second year, and at
   three points (before, during and after wing moult) behavioural
   observations were made. Measurements of the rate of oxygen consumption
   showed an 80\% increase above that of the nonmoulting periods of the
   year. We propose that metabolism was increased during moult because of
   the cost of feather synthesis. Although food was available, the captive
   birds chose not to forage and instead increased the proportion of time
   spent resting. It is likely that this behaviour in response to wing
   moult is a strategy to avoid predation in the wild. Thus, the innate
   nature of this behaviour has potential survival value for wild birds of
   this species. We conclude that the increase in metabolism led to the use
   of endogenous energy reserves because the birds reduced rather than
   increased their food intake rates, and as a result, the barnacle geese
   lost body mass during wing moult.}},

Abstract = {{Different emotions are accompanied by different bodily states and it is
   unclear which brain structures are involved in both, the cerebral
   representation of the bodily change and the representation of its
   perception. Structures connecting bodily signals and interoceptive
   awareness could trigger, in a feedforward manner, behavioral responses
   appropriate to maintain a desired state of the cardiovascular system.
   The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study aimed at
   identifying brain structures that are mutually activated during
   interoceptive awareness of heartbeats and during cardiovascular arousal.
   Additionally, we searched for brain regions connecting interoception
   with feelings. During the interoceptive task (directing attention
   towards heartbeats in relation to an exteroceptive task) the thalamus,
   the insula, the medial frontal/dorsal cingulate and the inferior frontal
   gyrus, as well as the somatomotor cortex were activated. The conjunction
   of the interoceptive awareness of heartbeats and cardiovascular arousal
   revealed structures presumably connecting both conditions, i.e. the
   right thalamus, insula, somatomotor cortex, and the dorsal cingulate as
   well as medial frontal gyrus. Furthermore, the degree of interoceptive
   awareness predicted the degree of activation of both the insula and the
   medial frontal/dorsal cingulate gyrus. Negative feelings correlated with
   the BOLD response of the interoceptive awareness condition in the dorsal
   cingulate gyrus extending into the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. We
   provide evidence that the insula, the dorsal cingulate gyrus, and the
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex are specifically involved in processing
   cardiac sensations. The dorsal cingulate gyrus and the dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex presumably represent the neural substrates of
   experiencing negative emotions. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Avian incubation attentiveness has important fitness consequences
   through its influence on the number and quality of hatched young and
   energetic costs imposed on parents. Nest attentiveness is highly
   variable across species and geographical regions. We reviewed the
   literature and found a worldwide pattern that nest attentiveness of
   passerines is generally lower in south temperate and tropical regions
   than in north temperate regions. We also conducted a food manipulation
   experiment to assess the extent to which nest attentiveness may reflect
   proximate responses versus an evolved behaviour. We used the karoo
   prinia, Prinia maculosa, in South Africa, which has very low nest
   attentiveness (similar to 49\%) compared with that of many passerine
   birds. We provided supplemental food during early incubation to
   experimental females and compared nest attentiveness and on- and
   off-bout lengths of experimental and paired control females. Nest
   attentiveness of females at food-provisioned nests was significantly
   higher than that of control females (57\% versus 49\%).
   Food-supplemented females also spent significantly less time off the
   nest than did control females, whereas mean on-bout lengths did not
   differ. However, mean nest attentiveness of food-provisioned females was
   still substantially below that of other similar bird species worldwide.
   Food can be an important proximate influence on parental care behaviour,
   but proximate influences of food do not explain broad latitudinal
   patterns of attentiveness. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Predation plays a key role in shaping mammalian communities through prey
   killed and through the decisions and choices of both predators and prey.
   We used an extensive data set from observed hunts of a diurnal large
   African carnivore, the cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus, in combination with
   analysis techniques originally developed in the field of economics
   (discrete choice models) to examine predation decisions within the
   context of the immediate environment and the reproductive and hunger
   status of individuals. This is one of the first attempts at an
   integrated understanding of the suite of ecological and behavioural
   factors that influence hunting decisions in a large carnivore. The
   decision of a cheetah to hunt or not was influenced by the abundance of
   their main prey, the reproductive status of the cheetah and the presence
   of competitors and predators, but not by the hunger level of the
   cheetah. Given that the decision to hunt is taken, prey choice is then
   driven by the time of year, the sex of the predator, the abundance of
   prey and the presence of competitors. We believe that discrete choice
   models may provide a new step forward in our ability to understand the
   decisions that animals make in their natural environment. (c) 2007 The

Abstract = {{The general consensus is that brain serotonin (5-HT) inhibits feed
   intake in teleost fishes and other vertebrates. Dietary manipulations
   with the 5-HT precursor tryptophan (TRP) have, however, yielded
   contradictory effects on feed intake, while studies of the endocrine
   response to stress indicate that the effects of TRP-enriched feed are
   context dependent. A characteristic behavioural response to stress is a
   reduction in feed intake, and in the present study we investigated
   whether pre-treatment with TRP-enriched feed affected stress-induced
   changes in feeding behaviour in brown trout (Salmo trutta). After
   acclimatisation in observation aquaria, isolated fish were fed control
   or TRP-supplemented feed for 7 d, whereupon they were transferred to a
   novel environment, in which all fish were fed control feed. Transfer to
   a new environment resulted in decreased feeding in both the TRP
   pre-treated and the control-treated group. However, this decrease was
   more pronounced in the control-treated group. Previous experiments have
   concluded that stimulation of brain 5-HT systems by TRP enhancement does
   not affect feed intake in salmonid fishes, but in these studies food
   intake was observed in unstressed animals only. The present study
   suggests that pre-treatment with dietary TRP attenuates stress-induced
   anorexia. Hence, it appears that the effect of dietary manipulations of
   TRP on feeding behaviour is dependent on the stress levels experienced
   by experimental animals. These behavioural data are discussed in the
   context of the involvement of 5-HT in appetite regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Introduced disease is a major mortality factor in some populations of
   bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). Epizootics of infectious
   keratoconjunctivitis (IKC) and contagious ecthyma occurred in bighorn
   sheep in the Silver Bell Mountains of south-central Arizona, USA, from 1
   December 2003 to 31 March 2004. Our objectives were to 1) investigate
   the influence of the epizootic on abundance and demographics and 2)
   examine how IKC affected the mortality, behavior, and movements of
   clinically affected animals. Morbidity was 39\%, and all sex and age
   classes were affected. The population declined 23\%, with most mortality
   in the adult female (1 M, 11 F) segment of the population. Of the
   diseased animals that were marked (n = 27), 44\% recovered and 44\%
   died. Predation (50\%) and starvation (33\%) were the primary causes of
   mortality of diseased bighorn sheep. Bighorn sheep that were infected
   spent less time feeding and moved less than noninfected animals during
   the epizootic. Managers might be able to minimize losses of infected
   animals through predator control. To minimize losses to starvation,
   managers should refrain from any activity that disturbs infected animals
   (including treatment) because disturbances increase energy expenditures
   and expose infected animals to injury.}},

Abstract = {{For animals with complex life cycles, recent models of sexual
   size-dimorphism at maturity assume three key variables to optimise
   larval life history: activity in the larval stage, development time, and
   size at maturation. However, model predictions remain largely untested.
   In the territorial dragonfly Libellula depressa (Odonata) exhibiting a
   flexible development time we tested for male-biased sexual
   size-dimorphism and sex differences in larval activity, development
   time, and growth rate. Based on models we predicted that males achieved
   their larger size compared to females by a longer development rather
   than being more active. Results revealed that males took longer to
   develop and achieved a larger size than females but were not more
   active. Compared to males, females exhibited a higher growth rate which
   was not achieved by an activity-mediated increased food intake. We
   conclude that sexual size-dimorphism in species with a flexible
   development time is mediated by differences in developmental length but
   not activity. Furthermore, sexes differ in their plastic responses to
   food availability and predator presence making it necessary to consider
   sex-specific differences in testing further life history responses.}},

Abstract = {{Developmental vitamin D (DVD) deficiency alters brain development and

   vitamin D deficiency during gestation and examine the effects on
   developmental milestones and behaviour in adult offspring. By
   manipulating the withdrawal and reintroduction of vitamin D in the diet
   of female Sprague-Dawley rats, their offspring were subjected to four
   different prenatal vitamin D conditions: (a) control (normal vitamin D
   throughout gestation); (b) early-DVD deficiency; (c) late-DVD
   deficiency; and (d) full-DVD deficiency. We show that the standard
   measure for vitamin D status, 25(OH)D-3, can be significantly
   manipulated within 7 days by dietary intervention. We also show that
   levels of the active form of this vitamin, 1,25(OH)(2)D-3, replete
   within the same time frame as 25(OH)D-3 but are slower to deplete.
   Developmental milestones remained normal across all four dietary groups.
   Concerning the adult behavioural phenotype, both full- and late-DVD
   deficiency were associated with MK-801 induced hyperlocomotion. Overall,
   these data suggest that vitamin D deficiency restricted to late
   gestation only is sufficient to disrupt adult brain functioning in the

Abstract = {{New World monkeys exhibit a color vision polymorphism. It results from
   allelic variation of the single-locus middle-to-long wavelength opsin
   gene on the X chromosome. Females that are heterozygous for the gene
   possess trichromatic vision. All other individuals possess dichromatic
   vision. The prevailing hypothesis for the maintenance of the color
   vision polymorphism is through a consistent fitness advantage to
   heterozygous trichromatic females. Such females are predicted to be more
   efficient than dichromats when detecting and selecting fruit. Recent
   experiments with captive callitrichid primates provided support for this
   hypothesis by demonstrating that color vision phenotype affects
   behavioral responses to contrived food targets. Yet, the assumptions
   that trichromatic females acquire more calories from fruit, or that
   number of offspring is linked to caloric intake, remain untested. Here,
   we assess if, in the wild, heterozygous trichromatic individuals in a
   group of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) enjoy an energetic
   advantage over dichromats when foraging on fruit. Contrary to the
   assumptions of previous theoretical and experimental studies, our
   analysis of C. capucinus foraging behavior shows that trichromats do not
   differ from dichromats in their fruit or energy acquisition rates. For
   white-faced capuchins, the advantage of trichromatic vision may be
   related to the detection of predators, animal prey, or fruit under
   mesopic conditions. This result demonstrates the importance of using a
   fitness currency that is relevant to individual animals to test
   evolutionary hypotheses.}},

Abstract = {{Resource polymorphisms, intraspecific variation in morphology due to
   differential resource use, are common across a wide range of animal
   taxa. The focus in studies of such polymorphisms has been on external
   morphology, but the differential use of food resources could also
   influence other phenotypic traits such as the digestive performance. In
   the present study, we experimentally demonstrate that Eurasian perch
   (Perca fluviatilis L.) display adaptive plasticity in gut length when
   exposed to different food types. Perch fed a less digestible food type
   developed relatively longer guts compared to fish fed a more easily
   digested food type. This divergence in gut length was also apparent
   under natural conditions because perch inhabiting the littoral and
   pelagic habitats of a lake differed in resource use and relative gut
   length. Despite that the digestive system in perch is plastic, we found
   that individuals switching to a novel food type might experience an
   initial fitness cost of the diet switch in the form of a temporary
   reduction in body condition. These results show the importance of gut
   length plasticity for an ontogenetic omnivore but also a cost that might
   prevent diet switching in polymorphic populations. (c) 2007 The Linnean

Abstract = {{In amphibians and fishes, evidence is increasing that chemical cues from
   injured conspecifics can play a role in the chemical labelling and
   learned recognition of unfamiliar predators. In this laboratory study,
   we tested the prediction that prior chemical exposure to a non-native
   predator feeding on conspecific tadpoles will subsequently allow
   tadpoles of the common toad (Bufo bufo) to recognize the chemical cues
   specifically released by this starved predator. Furthermore, we
   investigated the vulnerability of this chemically-mediated process to
   herbicide contamination. With these aims in view, groups of tadpoles
   were kept either unexposed or exposed for ten days to chemical cues from
   Turkish crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus) previously fed on tadpoles,
   both in uncontaminated water and in the presence of four sublethal
   concentrations of amitrole (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg.l(-1)). We then
   assessed the effects of the six conditioning treatments on general
   activity and behavioural response to chemical cues from starved
   crayfish. Larval treatments did not affect the general activity of the
   tadpoles. By contrast, the treatments had significant effects on the
   behavioural response to the test solution prepared form starved
   crayfish. The only tadpoles to show an antipredator behavioural response
   to the chemical stimulation from starved crayfish belonged to the groups
   derived from chemical exposure to tadpole-fed crayfish in uncontaminated
   water and in contaminated water with the lowest concentration of
   amitrole (0.01 mg.l(-1)). Conversely, this chemical stimulation produced
   no behavioural change in the control group or in the groups derived from
   exposure to tadpole-fed crayfish in contaminated water containing 0.1, 1
   and 10 mg.l(-1) of amitrole. This study demonstrates that chemical cues
   released during the predator's feeding activity can subsequently be used
   by common toad tadpoles in the recognition of an unfamiliar predator. In
   addition, our results show that the presence of sublethal amitrole
   concentrations can impair this recognition process. Such a pesticide
   effect might be especially detrimental for amphibian populations

Abstract = {{Obesity is considered a public health crisis. In order to tackle this,
   an enhanced appreciation of what drives some consumers to overeat is

   However, there is variation in the extent to which this translates into
   weight gain. Understanding whether susceptibility is dispositional or
   learned will shape prevention and treatment programmes. This review
   identifies situational cues that promote overeating and dispositional
   traits, such as impulsivity and sensitivity to reward, which make some
   individuals specifically vulnerable to overeating. These traits are
   likely to contribute to the development of the obese state, but also
   present barriers to weight management. Personalised nutrition and

Month = {{FEB 22}},
Abstract = {{Some animals give specific calls when they discover food or detect a
   particular type of predator. Companions respond with food-searching
   behaviour or by adopting appropriate escape responses. These signals
   thus seem to denote objects in the environment, but this specific
   mechanism has only been demonstrated for monkey alarm calls. We
   manipulated whether fowl (Gallus gallus) had recently found a small
   quantity of preferred food and then tested for a specific interaction
   between this event and their subsequent response to playback of food
   calls. In one treatment, food calls thus potentially provided
   information about the immediate environment, while in the other the
   putative message was redundant with individual experience. Food calls
   evoked substrate searching, but only if the hens had not recently
   discovered food. An identical manipulation had no effect on responses to
   an acoustically matched control call. These results show that chicken
   food calls are representational signals: they stimulate retrieval of
   information about a class of external events. This is the first such
   demonstration for any non-primate species. Representational signalling
   is hence more taxonomically widespread than has previously been thought,
   suggesting that it may be the product of common social factors, rather

Abstract = {{Despite the isolation of placental folate receptors 25 y ago and
   progress in defining the mechanism of folate delivery, considerable gaps
   remain in the literature for each level of the maternal-placental-fetal
   unit. Although a critical role of placental folate receptors in
   maternal-to-fetal folate transport was shown by use of the isolated
   perfused-placental cotyledon model a decade ago, in vivo confirmation is
   still needed. Knockout of folate receptors in mice, and knockdown of
   folate receptors by delivery of antisense oligonucleotides at gestation
   day 8 or antibodies to folate receptor, results in profound
   developmental abnormalities in the fetus, ranging from neural tube
   defects to neurocristopathics such as cleft-lip and cleft-palate,
   cardiac septal defects, and eye defects. These abnormalities can be
   prevented by ensuring the entry of folate into cells via alternative
   pathways. Controlled dietary folate restriction studies also identified
   adverse effects on reproductive performance, implantation, and fetal
   growth and other subtler (microscopic) defects in murine fetal
   development. Longitudinal follow-up showed that gestational folate
   deficiency results in behavioral changes-an anxiety phenotype-during
   adulthood in these mice, which supports the Barker hypothesis. The
   extent to which these findings are relevant to humans is unclear,
   however. Nevertheless, the high incidence of neural tube defects among
   North Indian women, who chronically subsist on one-third to one-half of
   the optimum folate needed to prevent birth defects, underscores the
   magnitude of the public health problem and emphasizes the urgent
   challenge to define the most efficient way to ensure adequate dietary
   folate for hundreds of millions of such women at risk in developing
   countries.}},

Title = {{Aggressive females seize central positions and show increased vigilance

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{239-247}},

Abstract = {{Decreased risk of predation is a key benefit of group living, and
   selfish herd theory predicts competition for the relative safety of
   central positions. Spatial position also affects behaviour, as
   individuals trade-off their feeding and vigilance to mitigate the risk
   of predation. Female eiders, Somateria mollissima, often pool their
   broods and share brood rearing, and anti-predatory vigilance is a core
   parental care activity. Females are assumed to trade-off vigilance and
   feeding, as efficient recovery of condition is crucial for energetically
   stressed postincubating females. Evidence shows that a female's own
   ducklings are closer to her than unrelated young in amalgamated broods
   and that predation of ducklings by gulls is edge biased, so a female's
   spatial position should correlate with the survival prospects of her
   brood. We identified determinants of female spatial position
   (aggression, structural size, body weight, age, clutch size) within
   multifemale brood-rearing coalitions, and explored whether spatial
   position affected female activities. Female aggression frequency was the
   only significant predictor of centrality in brood-rearing coalitions,
   and female age was positively associated with aggression. Investment in
   vigilance, but not investment in feeding, increased with spatial
   centrality; instead, central females devoted less time to other
   activities (resting, preening and moving). We conclude that central
   eider females do not need to trade-off vigilance and feeding. Heavy body
   weight did not guarantee a favourable position in brood-rearing
   coalitions, which may help explain our previous finding that female
   eiders in best body condition when their brood hatches tend their brood
   alone. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Nuptial feeding can evolve as sensory traps where the male exploits the
   female's foraging motivation in a sexual context. The nuptial prey gift
   of the nursery-web spider Pisaura mirabilis is wrapped in white silk,
   and it has been suggested that males initially exploit the maternal care
   instinct by producing a nuptial gift that resembles the female's eggsac.
   In mating experiments we examined whether males exploit the female's
   foraging motivation or the female's maternal care instinct. We carried
   out a gift-switching experiment, where males presented an eggsac, a
   wrapped fly or an unwrapped fly as nuptial gifts. Females fed on eggsacs
   as well as on prey gifts. Mating success was similar for males with both
   wrapped and unwrapped gifts, indicating that wrapping per se does not
   increase male mating success. In a food manipulation experiment, we
   investigated the effect of the female's hunger level on male mating
   success. Hungry females were more likely to accept a gift and copulate;
   hence the female's hunger state is decisive for male mating success. Our
   results strongly suggest that the female's foraging motivation is the
   true context for the maintenance of the nuptial gift. (c) 2006 The

Abstract = {{Environmental enrichment programs provide benefits to both captive
   animals and the facilities that house them, but cost time and resources
   to design, implement, and maintain. As yet, there have been few
   theoretically based guidelines to assist animal care staff in
   establishing cost-efficient enrichment methods that both elicit the
   desired behavioral changes and maintain their success over time. We
   describe several well-studied principles from the field of experimental
   analysis of behavior, including intrinsic reinforcement, extrinsic
   reinforcement, habituation, extinction, and schedules of reinforcement
   that could be very useful for evaluating the short- and long-term
   effectiveness of enrichment. We use this theoretical framework to
   generate testable hypotheses and provide examples of enrichment studies
   relevant to our predictions. In particular, we suggest that enrichment
   devices that offer extrinsic reinforcement (food, social access, etc. as
   a result of performing behaviors) should produce greater and more
   prolonged changes in behavior than devices that rely on the behavior
   itself being reinforcing to the animal. For techniques that provide no
   extrinsic reinforcement, using stimuli that are novel, are more
   different from the environment, have been withheld or altered in some
   way, or are presented less frequently may help reduce habituation. For
   techniques that provide extrinsic reinforcement, making reinforcement
   more difficult to obtain and providing more or higher quality
   reinforcers may increase the long-term success of the enrichment
   program. In addition, enrichment may be more effective if animal care
   staff avoid continuously reinforcing behaviors after they are
   established, enriching immediately after feeding, and exposing animals
   to enrichment when reinforcement is no longer available. While the
   current enrichment literature supports the application of behavior
   analytic theory, empirical evaluation of many of our predictions is
   still needed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many similarities exist between the overconsumption of food, which

   the effects of anorectic drugs on responding maintained by high
   incentive, but nutritionally unnecessary, food reinforcers using an Fl
   15(fixed-ratio 10:S) schedule of reinforcement, similar to that used in
   studies on the incentive properties of drugs of abuse. Rats were trained
   to respond on a lever to gain access to two high incentive foods -
   chocolate chip cookies and cheese. Under the Fl 15(FR 10:S) schedule,
   every 10th response (fixed-ratio 10) delivered a tone and light
   conditioned stimulus. The first ratio completed 15 min after the start
   of the session produced the conditioned stimulus and opened a door to
   give access to a piece of cookie. After 5 min to consume the high
   incentive food, a second 15-min interval was started, terminating in
   access to a second reinforcer, cheese. Once trained, the rats were given
   free access to laboratory chow in the home cage. They continued to work
   for the high incentive foods for a period of over 1 year, showing a
   pattern of responding appropriate to an FI(fixed-ratio) schedule.
   Naloxone (1.0 mg/kg), fenfluramine (1 and 2 mg/kg), D-amphetamine (0.25
   and 0.5 mg/kg), and rimonabant (3 mg/kg) significantly reduced
   responding, especially in the second interval. In contrast, complete
   removal of the high incentive food from the test procedure did not
   immediately reduce the rate of responding, tending to increase it in the
   second of the intervals. Apparently, the drugs did not reduce responding
   by reducing the experienced magnitude of the high incentive food, but
   more probably by reducing the animals' motivation. Behavioural

Abstract = {{We analyzed whether habitat deterioration due to ski slopes affected
   lizards' behavior, and whether these changes in behavior had
   consequences for the body condition and health state of lizards. Results
   suggested that habitat deterioration in ski slopes not only implied a
   loss of optimal habitat for lizards, but also led to an increase in
   perceived risk of predation. Males seemed to adjust their movement
   patterns to differences in risk, increasing their movement speed during
   their displacements across risky areas within ski slopes, but as a
   consequence, they incurred loss of body condition. A laboratory
   experiment supported that fleeing at high speeds in areas without
   refuges can be a factor responsible for reduced body condition. However,
   changes in body condition did not affect sprint speed of lizards. Our
   study provides new evidence that behavioral strategies to cope with
   increased predation risk, due to human-induced habitat deterioration,
   may affect body condition of lizards. Our results have applications for
   the design of conservation plans for this endangered lizard species.
   Environmental impact studies should be performed before opening new ski
   slopes, but taking into account not only the presence of lizards but
   also their body condition. An effective way to decrease the effects of

Abstract = {{Psychological correlates of obesity remain under controversy. As eating
   behaviors and dieting history have been previously related to obesity
   status, these dietary variables may contribute to identify overweight
   and obese individuals who are at higher risk of having an impaired
   psychological well-being.
   Objective: The main purpose of this cross-sectional study was to verify
   the hypothesis of a relationship between weight status and psychological
   well-being, and to examine whether cognitive dietary restraint,
   disinhibition, susceptibility to hunger and dieting history could be
   related to psychological well-being
   Design and subjects: In a sample of 101 postmenopausal women, we
   performed anthropometric measurements (weight, height and body mass
   index (BMI)), and measured psychological well-being (PER Questionnaire).
   The Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) and a questionnaire about
   dieting history (dieters: had already been on a diet; non-dieters: had
   never been on a diet) were also administrated.
   Results: A trend for a significant relationship was observed between BMI
   and psychological well-being (r = - 17; P = 0.08). Significant negative
   relationships were observed for disinhibition, susceptibility to hunger
   and all their subscales with psychological well-being (- 0.28 <= r <= -
   0.48), whereas no significant differences in psychological well-being
   were observed between dieters and non-dieters. Finally, women displaying
   a higher score for habitual susceptibility to disinhibition (which is
   the subscale of TFEQ that was the most closely related to psychological
   well-being) had a lower level of psychological well-being, regardless of
   their weight status.
   Conclusion: These results show that, as well as being related to weight
   status, TFEQ-factors are also related to psychological well-being. More
   specifically, individuals who display higher levels of disinhibition may
   be at higher risk of having an impaired psychological well-being.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Decades of research have produced substantial data on elk (Cervus
   elapbus) diets in winter, when foraging conditions are most likely to
   affect population dynamics. Using data from 72 studies conducted in
   western North America between 1938 and 2002, we collated data on elk
   diets and environmental variables. We used these data to quantify diet
   selection by elk and to test whether variation in elk diets is
   associated with habitat type, winter severity, period of winter, human
   hunting, and study method. Graminoids (grasses and grass-like plants
   such as sedges) dominated elk diets and consistently occurred at a
   higher proportion in the diet than in elk foraging habitats, indicating
   preference. Forbs commonly made up <= 5\% of the diet, with no evidence
   for preference; we conclude that forb use is largely incidental to
   grazing for graminoids. Browse was consumed in proportion to its
   availability, implying that the amount of browse in the diet was
   primarily determined by habitat use rather than selection. Comparing the
   diets of elk and sympatric ruminants, elk consistently selected
   graminoids more strongly than sympatric ruminants with the exception of
   bison (Bison bison), suggesting that elk are not environmentally forced
   to adopt the graminoid-biased diet that they normally select. The
   proportion of open meadows and grasslands on winter ranges was strongly
   and positively associated with graminoid consumption by elk. The
   proportion of graminoids in the diet was significantly lower in elk
   experiencing severe winter conditions or predation risk from human
   hunting. The period of winter (early, middle, and late) had only small
   effects on elk diets, as did the method by which the diet was
   determined. Overall, variation in elk diets is well-explained by a
   consistent tendency to select graminoids if available, modified by
   winter habitat type, predation risk, and winter severity, which can
   constrain habitat selection and access to grazing opportunities. To
   fully understand variation in foraging behavior, biologists should
   recognize these broad patterns when interpreting resource selection
   data. Managers should recognize that inconspicuous behavioral responses
   to environmental stimuli can alter the diet in ways that probably carry
   nutritional consequences.}},

Abstract = {{The brain takes a primary position in the organism. We present the novel
   view that the brain gives priority to controlling its own adenosine
   triphosphate (ATP) concentration. It fulfils this tenet by orchestrating
   metabolism in the organism. The brain activates an energy-on-request
   system that directly couples cerebral supply with cerebral need. The
   request system is hierarchically organized among the cerebral
   hemispheres, the hypothalamus, and peripheral somatomotor,
   autonomic-visceromotor, and the neuroendocrine-secretomotor neurons. The
   system initiates allocative behavior (i.e. allocation of energy from
   body to brain), ingestive behavior (intake of energy from the immediate
   environment), or exploratory behavior (foraging in the distant
   environment). Cerebral projections coordinate all three behavioral
   strategies in such a way that the brain's energy supply is guaranteed
   continuously. In an ongoing learning process, the brain's request system
   adapts to various environmental conditions and stressful challenges.
   Disruption of a cerebral energy-request pathway is critical to the
   development of obesity: if the brain fails to receive sufficient energy
   from the peripheral body, it compensates for the undersupply by
   increasing energy intake from the immediate environment, leaving the
   body with a surplus. Obesity develops in the long term. (c) 2007

Abstract = {{The animat approach constitutes an intriguing attempt to study and
   comprehend the behavior of adaptive, learning entities in complex
   environments. Further inspired by the notions of co-evolution and
   evolutionary ``arms races{''}, we have developed Symbiosis, a virtual
   ecosystem that hosts two self-organizing, combating species - preys and
   predators. All animats live and evolve in this shared environment, they
   are self-maintaining and engage in a series of vital activities -
   nutrition, growth, communication - with the ultimate goals of survival
   and reproduction. The main objective of Symbiosis is to study the
   behavior of ecosystem members, especially in terms of the emergent
   learning mechanisms and the effect of co-evolution on the evolved
   behavioral strategies. In this direction, several indicators are used to
   assess individual behavior, with the overall effectiveness metric
   depending strongly on the animats net energy gain and reproduction rate.
   Several experiments have been conducted with the developed simulator
   under various environmental conditions. Overall experimental results
   support our original hypothesis that co-evolution is a driving factor in

Pages = {{253-278}},
Abstract = {{The subjective expected utility (SEU) model rests on very strong
   assumptions about the consistency of decision making across a wide range
   of situations. The descriptive validity of these assumptions has been
   extensively challenged by behavioral psychologists during the last few
   decades, and the normative validity of the assumptions has also been
   reappraised by many statisticians, philosophers, and economists,
   motivating the development of more general utility theories and decision
   models. These generalized models are characterized by features such as
   imprecise probabilities, nonlinearly weighted probabilities,
   source-dependent risk attitudes, and state-dependent utilities,
   permitting the pattern of the decision maker's behavior to change with
   the decision context and to perhaps satisfy the usual SEU assumptions
   only locally. Recent research in the emerging field of neuroeconomics
   sheds light on the physiological basis of decision making, the nature of
   preferences and beliefs, and interpersonal differences in decision
   competence. These findings do not necessarily invalidate the use of
   SEU-based decision analysis tools, but they suggest that care needs to
   be taken to structure preferences and to assess beliefs and risk
   attitudes in a manner that is appropriate for the decision and also for
   the decision maker.}},

   phenomenon can be considered as a subset of the broader processes of
   developmental plasticity by which organisms adapt to their environment
   during their life course. Such adaptive processes allow genotypic
   variation to be preserved through transient environmental changes. Cues
   for plasticity operate particularly during early development; they may
   affect a single organ or system, but generally they induce integrated
   adjustments in the mature phenotype, a process underpinned by epigenetic
   mechanisms and influenced by prediction of the mature environment. In
   mammals, an adverse intrauterine environment results in an integrated
   suite of responses, suggesting the involvement of a few key regulatory
   genes, that resets the developmental trajectory in expectation of poor
   postnatal conditions. Mismatch between the anticipated and the actual
   mature environment exposes the organism to risk of adverse
   consequences-the greater the mismatch, the greater the risk. For humans,
   prediction is inaccurate for many individuals because of changes in the
   postnatal environment toward energy-dense nutrition and low energy
   expenditure, contributing to the epidemic of chronic noncommunicable
   disease. This view of human disease from the perspectives of life
   history biology and evolutionary theory offers new approaches to
   prevention, diagnosis and intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Prey organisms are confronted with time and resource allocation
   trade-offs. Time allocation trade-offs partition time, for example,
   between foraging effort to acquire resources and behavioral defense.
   Resource allocation trade-offs partition the acquired resources between
   multiple traits, such as growth or morphological defense. We develop a
   mathematical model for prey organisms that comprise time and resource
   allocation trade-offs for multiple defense traits. Fitness is determined
   by growth and survival during ontogeny. We determine optimal defense
   strategies for environments that differ in their resource abundance,
   predation risk, and defense effectiveness. We compare the results with
   results of simplified models where single defense traits are optimized.
   Our results indicate that selection acts in favor of integrated traits.
   The selective advantage of expressing multiple defense traits is most
   pronounced at intermediate environmental conditions. Optimizing single
   traits generally leads to a more pronounced response of the defense
   traits, which implies that studying single traits leads to an
   overestimation of their response to predation. Behavioral defense and
   morphological defense compensate for and augment each other depending on
   predator densities and the effectiveness of the defense mechanisms. In
   the presence of time constraints, the model shows peak investment into
   morphological and behavioral defense at intermediate resource levels.}},

Abstract = {{Postnatal manipulation studies involving human handling suggest that

   environment have similar effects on maternal behaviour and the
   offspring's behavioural and HPA responses to stressors. We housed Lister
   hooded dams and their litters in systems made of a nest cage (NC) and an
   exploration cage (EC) connected by a tunnel and varied access to food
   either spatially or temporally until postnatal day 8. Dams recein
   periods each day (IEC-fed dams). Although EC-fed dams spent more time in
   the EC and less time ived food ad libitum in the NC (NC-fed dams) or EC

   NC-fed dams, FC-fed dams nursed in longer bouts which may indicate a

Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{215-225}},

Abstract = {{We studied individual and herd level behavioural responses of elk to
   spatial and temporal variation in the risk of predation by wolves over
   three winters in the Upper Gallatin drainage, Montana, U.S.A. Within a
   given drainage, elk of both sexes moved into or closer to protective
   cover (timber) in response to wolf presence. Cow elk responded to
   elevated risk by increasing vigilance in exchange for foraging, and
   large mixed (cow, calf, spike) herds substantially decreased in size. In
   contrast, when wolves were present, bulls did not increase vigilance
   levels, or decrease feeding, and small bull-only groups slightly
   increased in size. As a consequence, small bull-only herds and large
   mixed-sex herds converged on a similar size when wolves were present. We
   think this response is a balancing of the benefits of risk dilution with
   increased detectability or attractiveness of larger herds to wolves.
   Based on proportions in the population, wolves overselected bulls and
   underselected cows as prey. Thus, bulls showed weaker antipredator
   responses than cows, despite facing a greater risk of predation. Using
   marrow fat content from elk killed by wolves as an indicator of body
   condition, bulls were in significantly worse body condition than cows
   throughout the winter, and condition deteriorated for both sexes as
   winter progressed. Overall, we conclude that antipredator behaviours
   carry substantial foraging costs, that bulls, because of their poorer
   body condition, are less able to pay these costs than cows, and that
   differences in ability to pay foraging costs probably explain
   sex-specific differences in antipredator behaviours. (c) 2006 The

Abstract = {{Recent food scares have increased consumer concern about meat safety.
   However, the Greek `traditional' meat supply chain from producers to
   local butchers does not seem to realise the pressing consumer demand for
   certified meat quality. Or is it that, in such food chains, this demand
   is not so pressing yet? The present paper seeks to answer this question
   based on a survey conducted in the Athens area, involving a sample of
   268 participants responsible for food purchasing decisions. The survey
   mainly aims to develop an integrated model of factors that affect
   consumer-perceived meat quality and to develop the profile of different
   consumer segments in relation to these perceptions. The substantial
   findings of the survey include the fact that, despite their enormous per
   capita consumption, the majority of consumers are not particularly
   involved in the meat-purchasing process. Rather they attach importance
   to visual intrinsic quality cues evaluated in a pre-purchasing context.
   In this respect, intrinsic quality cues are assigned a role similar to
   that of quality certification; coupled with the choice of traditional
   channels and the resulting personal relation with the butcher, they can
   be understood as efforts to decrease risk of the purchasing decision.
   Moreover, consumers with such behaviour seem to relate domestic country
   of origin of meat mostly with perceptions of general safety. Finally, a
   small, but promising trend with substantial marketing implications of
   frequent purchases of chicken and pork at supermarkets should not be
   ignored. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance and behaviour of mammalian prey species such as the
   European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are known to be regulated by the
   availability of both food for maintenance and reproduction and shelter
   for protection against predators and harsh weather. However, the effect
   of vegetation structure and temporal variations in food availability on
   habitat selection and spatial behaviour are still poorly understood. The
   present study investigated the relationship between rabbit spatial
   ecology and vegetation structure and food quality and quantity in three
   neighbouring areas in SW Spain that differed in the distribution and
   amount of refuge sites and food patches. In all, 35 rabbits were
   radiotracked in the three study areas and home range and core area sizes
   in different seasons and at different times of the day estimated.
   Spatial behaviour was then compared with parameters of vegetation cover
   and food quantity and quality. Lastly, rabbit habitat selection at two
   Levels was studied: home range selection and selection within home
   ranges. Home range size varied from one study area and season to
   another, but was not dependent on either sex or the availability or
   quality of food. We suggest that differences in home range size between
   study areas respond to differences in vegetation cover, with smaller
   home ranges in areas with higher proportion of sheltering vegetation. It
   was found that habitat selection patterns varied between the three areas
   in terms of the need for rabbits to exploit to a maximum the scarcest
   resource in each situation, thereby optimising access to both feeding
   and refuge patches. This pattern was manifest at the home range level of
   habitat selection but not at the level of selection within home ranges.
   Findings were consistent with the high behavioural plasticity of the
   European rabbit in its native habitats and provide useful information

Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{464-474}},
Abstract = {{Ecological conditions and food quality have influence on age and size at
   metamorphosis of organisms with complex life cycles. However, little is
   known about the foraging behaviour and how diet choice is influenced by
   the ecological conditions. The present study poses two major questions:
   (1) how do different diets (high protein, low protein and both diets
   together) influence larval performance, and (2) how does diet choice
   change with ecological conditions (interference competition, predation
   and pond drying)? To address the second question, we offered both types
   of food to tadpoles under the different circumstances. We measured food
   consumption of the two food types, along with the growth rate and
   developmental stage of tadpoles. We expected that under unfavourable
   growth conditions, larvae would select high-protein food, which would
   promote development and allow individuals to escape these high-risk
   environments. High-protein food promotes development, but results in
   smaller tadpoles, whereas low-protein food promotes growth with slower
   development. The mixture of the two is better only in terms of growth
   rate. Our study of tadpoles showed that diet selection may not be
   constant but can vary depending on the ecological context in predictable
   ways. When exposed to interference competition and drying ponds,
   tadpoles fed on food that enhanced development, whereas in the control
   group and in predation treatments, they fed selectively on food that
   favoured growth. Our data indicate that diet selection by tadpoles may
   confer adaptive responses to ecological changes. Such
   selection/responses would increase growth, development, and survival.

Abstract = {{Purpose of review The aim of this review is to highlight the traditional
   and newly recognized suicide risk factors in patients with mood
   disorders.
   Recent findings Current research findings clearly suggest that suicidal
   behaviour in patients with mood disorder is a `state-dependent'
   phenomenon. Recently, there is, however, a growing body of evidence that
   besides the well accepted clinically explorable suicide risk factors in
   mood disorders (e.g., severe depression, prior suicide attempt, comorbid
   anxiety, substance use, personality disorders and so on), mixed state of
   depression could also be an important precursor of suicidal behaviour.
   This might be particularly true in unrecognized cases of bipolar
   depressives, when antidepressant monotherapy (unprotected by mood
   stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics) can worsen the clinical picture
   and rarely induce an aggressive or self-destructive behaviour.
   Summary In the majority of patients with mood disorders, suicidal
   behaviour is predictable and preventable, with a good chance. A careful
   and systematic exploration of suicide risk factors in patients with mood
   disorder helps clinicians to identify patients at high suicide risk. A
   successful, acute and long-term treatment of these patients
   substantially reduces the suicidal behaviour even in this high-risk

   developmental decisions made during fetal and early postnatal life to
   maximize subsequent fitness. However, this fitness advantage is lost if
   the early and later environments are mismatched. Rats undernourished in
   utero by maternal underfeeding develop features of the metabolic
   syndrome, especially if fed on a high-fat diet, but transient neonatal

Abstract = {{Measures of animal behavior can be used in a variety of situations to
   make inferences about the environment and population status. Work by our
   research group shows that migratory shorebirds adjust their usage of,
   and behavior at, stopover sites in response to environmental conditions.
   Motivated by this, we built an individual-based model of migrating
   shorebirds moving through a sequence of alternating small and large
   stopover sites. Birds at larger sites are safer from predators, but we
   assumed that less food is available than at small sites. In the model,
   both predation risk and food intake are density-dependent, and the
   behavior of migrants is controlled by two rules: one that determines
   whether a bird will depart a stopover site, and one that controls the
   individual's foraging versus vigilance intensity. The optimal behavior
   is calculated by maximizing a payoff function that depends on arrival
   date and arrival energy stores at the final site. We used this model to
   predict mass gain, foraging intensity, and usage by migrants of small
   and large sites under various conditions. We examined the effects of a
   flyway-wide reduction in the amount of food, a flyway-wide increase in
   predation danger, and the effects of lowering the overall population
   size. The mass action of many individuals, each optimizing its migration
   timing and routing, leads to the emergence of distinctive patterns of
   behavior and site choice under these differing environmental conditions.
   When food availability is reduced throughout the flyway, Our model
   predicts that foraging intensity increases at every stopover site,
   thereby forcing birds to accept greater danger to maintain the fitness
   benefit of a timely arrival to the breeding area. A flyway-wide increase
   in predation danger results in fewer migrants choosing (and/or migrants
   staying a shorter time at) small stopover sites, balanced by a higher
   usage of large sites. These effects contrast with what is observed under
   true population declines, when the usage of both small and large sites
   declines.}},

   tragedy. A major problem is that multiple barriers exist, making it
   difficult for individuals with serious mental illness to access quality
   health care. Additionally, compared with the average American, people
   with serious mental illness are more likely to engage in unhealthy
   lifestyle practices, such as lack of regular physical activity, poor
   nutrition and overeating, smoking and other substance abuse, irregular
   and inadequate steep, and failure to visit health care practitioners
   regularly. These unhealthy behaviors and the added burden of
   antipsychotic medication side effects increase the risk for cardiac and
   metabolic diseases. However, best-practice models exist that provide the
   knowledge and tools to assist people with serious mental illness in
   making informed decisions about healthier lifestyle behaviors, including
   addressing tobacco use and excess weight. The challenge is how to
   integrate these practices effectively into routine behavioral health
   care. The growing problem of premature death calls for urgent public
   action to transform the current mental health care system into a more
   integrated system of care. Because of their holistic training and
   approach to care, nurses are well prepared to work collaboratively with
   both mental and physical health care providers and systems. In the new
   mental health care system, both psychiatric and physical health care
   providers will need to broaden their treatment paradigm to address the
   whole person. An integral part of behavioral health services will be to
   ensure that the health status of all individuals is assessed, that there
   are medical monitoring protocols in place for people taking
   antipsychotic medication, that each individual has a primary care
   provider, and that there is an effective mechanism in place for
   communication between behavioral health and primary care providers. A
   transformation of the existing mental health care system toward a system
   that utilizes a coordinated, multi-disciplinary, holistic approach not
   only may effectively bridge the existing gap between mental and physical
   health, but also may ultimately save lives.}},

Abstract = {{Some water fleas Daphnia change their head morphology to reduce
   predation risk in response to chemical substances (kairomones) released
   from larvae of the invertebrate predator Chaoborus (Insecta: Diptera).
   We tested for evidence of the costs associated with elongation of the
   head spine in Daphnia galeata and the consequences of these costs on the
   inducibility of head spine elongation in predictable and unpredictable
   environments. We exposed D. galeata in outdoor experimental ponds to
   conditions under which predation pressure by Chaoborus larvae and the
   concentration of kairomones from this predator were controlled for about
   70 days. In the laboratory, we then used Daphnia clones collected from
   the outdoor ponds to investigate the inducibility of head spine
   formation in response to Chaoborus kairomones.
   The inducibility of head spine formation increased in D. galeata from
   the ponds that had contained both predators and kairomones, whereas in
   water fleas from the ponds containing only kairomones the plasticity
   (inducibility) of head spine formation decreased compared with that in
   the control ponds. These results suggest that the production of a
   defensive head spine, its phenotypic plasticity, or both entail some
   costs. Contrary to our predictions, exposure to Chaoborus kairomones in
   the laboratory resulted in head lengths that were not significantly
   different among any of the clones from the three outdoor treatments.
   We found no evidence for costs associated with head spine elongation in
   terms of fecundity, time to maturity, or intrinsic rate of natural
   population increase. Average within-clone partial correlations
   calculated for head length and intrinsic rate of natural population
   increase, corrected for body length, were not significantly negative,
   indicating no cost of defence. This was probably because food conditions
   in the laboratory were so good that the costs of defence could not be
   detected. Furthermore, community-level changes, such as changes in food
   conditions caused by manipulation of the predation regime in the outdoor
   ponds, might have worked as selection pressures and confounded the
   results.}},

Abstract = {{The use of bright coloration to warn predators of toxic prey, termed
   aposematism, is a defensive strategy well studied in terrestrial
   ecosystems. Some marine animals have contrasting color patterns and
   chemical defenses but few studies have tested the behavior of marine
   predators in response to aposematic coloration. In this study we tested
   fish feeding behavior in response to different types of cues including
   contrasting color patterns and sponge and nudibranch chemical extracts
   in the field at 2 reefs on Guam. Using agar-based food to keep food
   quality consistent, chemical extracts and 2 out of 5 contrasting color
   patterns reduced feeding by natural assemblages of reef fish at both
   reefs. Phyllidia varicosa (from Palau), P. elegans (Guam) and
   Phyllidiella pustulosa (Palau) crude extracts deterred feeding by fish,
   but P. pustulosa extracts from Guam did not. To determine if a chemical
   extract can act as an olfactory defense we videotaped fish behavior as
   they approached food containing nonpolar extracts of Acanthella
   cavernosa, the dietary sponge of Phyllidiella granulatus. Fish
   approached and then tasted the food with the chemical extract
   significantly less often than the control and the crude extract of
   another sponge Stylissa massa. In feeding assays with a contrasting
   color pattern combined with the chemical extract at natural
   concentrations, fish were deterred by the extract regardless of the

   feeding. Reef fish can use multimodal signa Is including visual, taste

Title = {{Schizophrenia and phenotypic plasticity: Schizophrenia may represent a
   predictive, adaptive response to severe environmental adversity that
   allows both bioenergetic thrift and a defensive behavioral strategy}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL HYPOTHESES}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{383-394}},
Abstract = {{It is well recognized that investigation into the relationship between
   early life programming and subsequent neurological disorders may have
   powerful implications for understanding the human vulnerability to
   psychopathology. The present article will propose that schizophrenia may
   be adaptively programmed by early environmental adversity permitting
   physiological and behavioral characteristics that would have created a
   fitness advantage in the ancestral environment under conditions of
   nutritional scarcity and severe environmental stress. This proposition
   will be analyzed in terms of phenotypic plasticity theory which explains
   how and why specific environmental stressors can alter normal gene
   expression resulting in an alternative phenotype that is better suited
   for an adverse environment. The primary neurophysiological symptoms of
   schizophrenia can be induced in animals through exposure to prenatal and
   postnatal stressors, and that schizophrenia itself is known to be
   associated with exposure to stress during development, supports the view
   that the ``disorder{''} may represent a predictive, adaptive response to
   adversity. In fact, maternal malnutrition, maternal stress, multiparity,
   short birth interval and stress provoking postnatal events are well
   recognized epidemiological risk factors for schizophrenia that may
   represent cues for the initiation of epigenetic programming.
   Behavioral and physiological characteristics of schizophrenia will be
   analyzed and interpreted as protective in the context of environmental
   hardship. For instance, the hypometabotic areas of the schizophrenic
   brain - the hippocampus and the frontal lobes - are the same areas that
   are known to become adaptively hypometabolic in response to starvation,
   stress and variations in ecological rigor in birds and mammals.
   Individuals with schizophrenia are also highly genetically inclined to
   develop the metabolic syndrome, which is widely thought to allow
   developmentally deprived mammals to conserve energy under poor
   circumstances. It is well known that schizophrenia features an
   up-regulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and an exaggerated
   stress response - both alterations thought to represent predictive,
   adaptive responses to stress in mammals - which may have increased
   attentiveness to the environment and created a defensive,
   vigilance-based behavioral strategy. The habituation deficits
   characteristic of schizophrenia - which can be induced in other mammals
   through stress - may represent a cognitive strategy that alerts the
   organism to salient, potentially informative stimuli and that permits it
   to be more impulsive and vigilant. Inability to calm instinctual drives,
   ignore arousing stimuli, and inhibit transient desires are all core
   characteristics of the disorder, which predict social and vocational
   disabilities in modern times, but may have amounted to a robust, selfish
   strategy in prehistoric times. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{The crisis of the female self in fin de siecle Austrian women writers'
   narratives}},
Journal = {{MODERN AUSTRIAN LITERATURE}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1+}},
Abstract = {{The crisis of identity and its consequence, the fragmentation of the
   self, were major themes explored by fin de siecle Austrian writers.
   Inspired in particular by Nietzsche (the loss of transcendence), Freud
   (the splitting of the ego into its conscious and subconscious parts),
   and Ernst Mach (with his statement that ``The Ego must be given up,{''}
   ({''}das Ich ist unrettbar{''}), the ``joyous apocalypse{''} of the
   Habsburg Empire was reflected in its literature as the loss of a unified
   self on the one hand, and the longing for wholeness on the other.
   Gotthart Wunberg has pointed out the following characteristics of
   Austrian fin de siecle modernity in literature: a consciousness of the
   lack of unity and disparity in the world determined by historical
   discontinuity, and a dissociation of the personality, a ``relativity of
   values,{''} and a ``lack of qualities{''} (104). He cites Hugo von
   Hofmannsthal, Robert Musil, and Hermann Broch as the principal authors
   whose works embody these characteristics. One could certainly add Arthur
   Schnitzler to this list, in particular his novella Leutnant Gustl
   (1900), often referred to as the first narrative in the German literary
   context to use the stream-of-consciousness technique.
   Whereas much has been written on the topic of the crisis of the self in
   relation to male authors such as those mentioned above, along with
   others included in the literary canon, thus defining this crisis as
   male-centered, the numerous turn-of-the-century women writers have been
   ignored by the writers of literary history and have been only recently
   rediscovered by feminist scholars. One reason for this omission, cited
   by Livia Wittman, may be that many fictional texts written by women of
   this period do not apply any new literary techniques, but rather ``seem
   to fit into the mold of `classic realism' with its illusion of language
   as medium of communication between narrator and reader, with its
   hierarchy of discourses, and with its necessary closure{''} (49). Such
   narratives construct a unified subject, a position adopted by several
   authors of the turn of the century, some of whom were also active
   members of the women's movement, such as Irma von Troll Borostydni in
   her novellas ``Hohenluft{''} (1907) and Stutzen der Moral{''} (1900),
   and Grete Meisel-Hess in her novel Fanny Roth (1902).(1) The
   construction of a strong and whole female subject in these narratives
   reflects a position that parallels the contemporaneous women's movement
   in its ``attempt to gain entry into the dominant discourses, be it in
   law, higher education, professional work, sexual autonomy, artistic
   achievement{''} (Wittman 52)all areas from which women had been excluded
   or in which they had been marginalized, at best, for centuries.
   However, there are narratives written by women in which we can also
   observe a deconstruction of the concept of the unified subject, a
   position that corresponds to the modernity paradigm of the crisis of the
   self. From the vast corpus of fin de siele women's literature (see
   Schmid-Bortenschlager and Bubenicek), three narratives in particular
   demonstrate this crisis of the female self. Eine fur viele: Aus dem
   Tagebuche eines Madchens, by Vera; ``Venus am Kreuz,{''} by Else
   Kotanyi; and Tagebuch-blatter einer Emanzipierten, by Elsa Asenijeff In
   the latter, Brigitte Spreitzer recognizes as part of the crisis of the
   self elements such as hypersensitivity, cultural pessimism, and a desire
   for death, and links these elements to the mainstream style of
   turn-of-the-century Viennese modernity, in particular that of Jung-Wien
   (Texturen 74-75). I will argue that these very same elements are just as
   present in Kotanyi and Vera. Moreover, all three narratives use the same
   literary form, the (fictional) diary, which allows the inclusion of a
   more subjective element in which ``spontaneity and reflection do not
   exclude each other{''} (Weigel 66). In all three narratives the
   splitting of the self is thus told by a first-person narrator.
   There is an important difference between the crisis of the female self
   in these narratives and the crisis of the male self in contemporaneous
   canonical texts. The male protagonists, such as Hofmannsthal's Lord
   Chandos, Schnitzler's Gustl, or, somewhat later, Musil's Ulrich,
   experience a loss of unity as the consequence of their estrangement from
   social values and concepts that, for them, have lost their validity
   (such as, for Chandos, the power of linguistic referentiality or, for
   Gustl, the codes of ethical conduct). Moreover, particularly in the case
   of Musil's Ulrich and his ``Urlaub von seinem Leben{''} (47), such
   estrangement implies a conscious choice to distance himself from roles
   defined by a society that he cannot identify with anymore and that he
   can only partake in as an observer. In addition, Ulrich can rely on the
   appropriation and objectification of the feminine via the women in his
   life, particularly his sister Agathe.(2) In the three selected texts by
   Vera, Kotanyi, and Asenijeff, the female protagonists do not have such
   choices, nor can they count on any help from men to solve their identity
   crisis-if anything, quite the contrary. They struggle with the roles
   imposed upon them, roles that are directly connected to their
   femaleness. Their gradual fragmentation is a result of patriarchal
   constrictions imposed on female creativity, sexuality, and desire,
   and/or of male sexual violence. In these texts the crisis of the female
   self is thus defined in more specific, gendered terms than the crisis of
   the male self in the canonical texts.
   In my analysis I will be adopting theoretical concepts from Jessica
   Benjamin and Jacques Lacan, both of whom come from the field of
   psychoanalysis, which is particularly focused on questions of the self
   and identity formation. From Benjamin various prestigious literary
   papers and giving lectures. She also became involved in anti-war groups
   and experimented with texts for the cinema. Following her breakup with
   Klinger (who then married a much younger model), she entered into a long
   legal battle with him, interrupted by the war, for financial support. In
   1921 she was declared mentally unstable and deprived of her rights.
   Three years later, neglected and malnourished, she was forcibly
   hospitalized in the psychiatric clinic of the University of Leipzig. She
   was subsequently put into different institutions, always against her
   vehement protests. She died in 1941 in Braunsdorf near Freiberg.
   10. Viriphobia, the hatred of men, is a term created by David D. Gilmore
   in Misogyny: The Male Malady (2001). On viriphobia and its relationship
   to other fin de siecle discourses, see Schwartz, ``Austrian Fin de
   siecle Gender Heteroglossia.{''}
   11. Asenijeff makes such a connection in other narratives, such as her
   short story ``Daseinselend{''} (1896).
   12. I discuss this in more detail in the article mentioned in note 10.}},

Pages = {{30-38}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - In order to study its cure response and to understand its
   kinetic behaviour, this paper seeks to examine how a multifunctional

   N,4-bis(4-(bis(2-oxiranylmethyl)amino)-2-chlorobenzyl)-3-chloro-N-(2-oxi
   ranylmethyl)benzenamine (BCCOMB), synthesised from amine functional
   chloroaniline formaldehyde condensate (AFCFC) and epichlorohydrine, is
   cured with AFCFC as curing agent.
   Design/methodology/approach - For effective curing, AFCFC (12.5 phr,
   part per 100 resin) was added to BCCOMB resin and mixed thoroughly for
   15 minutes. The clear viscous solution was then subjected to DSC
   analyses for kinetics study of the curing reaction.
   Findings - The AFCFC was successfully utilised as curing agents for
   BCCOMB as the DSC curves show complete curing exotherm. The presence of
   oxirane group in the BCCOMB was able to react with active hydrogen atoms
   of amine. This led to conversion of liquid monomers of thermoset resin
   into three-dimensional network.
   Research limitations/implications - in the present discussion, the
   curing study of BCCOMB had been done using AFCFC as a curing agent.
   However, other curing agents, synthesised from other amine and aldehyde,
   could also be used to see whether they would be effective for curing
   study of BCCOMB.
   Originality/value - The method for curing study of multifunctional epoxy
   resin (BCCOMB) was novel and the cured epoxy network could find numerous
   applications as surface coating and adhesive on to an intricate
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{Animals can find food using information from the food itself or from
   conspecifics that are also looking for food. Social information can be
   actively communicated or based on unavoidable by-products of feeding
   activities. We present three experiments that explore the relative
   importance of odour gradients and social information as Bufo americanus
   tadpoles locate food sources. In the first experiment, tadpoles rapidly
   aggregated at food patches and discriminated between the qualities of
   two food patches spaced 15 cm apart in the field. In a second
   experiment, the initial presence of tadpoles at one food patch enhanced
   aggregation for 1 h, compared to an identical food patch without
   tadpoles spaced 114 cm apart. In a third experiment, the time required
   to initial contact with a single food patch did not change over a
   16-fold range of food concentration, suggesting that B. americanus
   tadpoles have a limited ability to locate food from a distance using
   information from the food itself. Finding food and discriminating food
   patch quality from a distance is probably a major adaptive advantage of
   sociality in B. americanus tadpoles, although the presence or absence of
   active signalling remains to be determined. (c) 2006 The Association for

Abstract = {{Food chain length is an important property of ecosystems, but the

   abandonment of the energy-flow hypothesis is premature. For a simple
   tritrophic rocky intertidal food chain, we show that the efficiency of
   energy transfer is strongly influenced by predation risk and consumer
   density. Effects tied to predation risk were particularly strong,
   explaining 32\% of the variation in growth efficiency ( compared to 15\%
   for density effects) and reducing it by 44-76\%. Hence, the stress (

Abstract = {{modulating learning and memory. However, little is known about the
   production of corticoids during early development in free-living
   animals, particularly during sensitive periods of acquisition of
   important behaviors. In a four-year study of Belding's ground squirrels,
   Spermophilus beldingi, a non-invasive assay of glucocorticoids was used
   to quantify age and population differences among juveniles from three
   California locations. Fecal-cortisol metabolites are elevated during a
   short period when juveniles first emerge aboveground from their natal
   burrows at about 4 weeks of age. This period of cortisol elevation
   coincides with when young are learning survival behaviors such as
   anti-predator responses and foraging strategies. Population differences
   in juvenile cortisol levels, which may reflect local variation in
   habitat quality and predator environments, were not evident until 2
   weeks after emergence. Elevated cortisol at the age of emergence was
   also observed in juveniles born and reared in captivity without exposure
   to typical stressors that occur around the age of emergence. These
   results indicate that corticoids are regulated during early development,
   and the possible functions of age-related corticoid levels are
   discussed, including mobilization of glucose for natal emergence and
   later facilitation of growth and energy storage during the short summer
   before hibernation. In some species, elevated corticoids can also
   facilitate learning and memory, and current work is exploring whether
   the higher cortisol observed in all three S. beldingi populations just
   after emergence function to promote rapid acquisition of survival
   behaviors. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   effects include reduced nephron number and compensatory adaptations,
   which might lead to hypertension, and perhaps accelerate the decline in
   renal function that accompanies aging. These processes might be
   exacerbated by programmed changes in vascular structure and function,

   effects might be initiated as early as the periconceptual phase of

Abstract = {{Carotenoids are important for various functions during chick
   development. Since these pigments cannot be synthesized, they can be
   considered limited resources that the mother optimally allocates between
   herself and her offspring (maternal effect). Some studies have examined
   the effects of carotenoids on growth and immune function but little is
   known about their role in behaviour. In this study of the grey
   partridge, we conducted two supplementation experiments: (1) laying
   females were fed with beta-carotene enriched or impoverished diets; (2)
   chicks were fed directly with P-carotene enriched or impoverished diets.
   We then evaluated the effects of this carotenoid on chick growth,
   immunocompetence and anti-predator behaviour (reactions to a raptor
   model). In the first experiment, the P-carotene enriched diet given to
   mothers did not cause any difference in chick physiology. In the second
   experiment, beta-carotene supplementation of chicks had a significant
   beneficial effect on their growth and immune response, although their
   behavioural reactions did not differ in relation to the diet. Therefore,
   P-carotene supplementation had beneficial effects on growth and
   immunocompetence only when directly supplied to chicks. The beneficial
   effect reported in other species for begging or pecking behaviours was
   not confirmed for the anti-predator behaviour of grey partridge chicks.

Abstract = {{The use of tool or tool-like food processing behaviours can render
   animals vulnerable to theft (kleptoparasitism) because (1) large,
   nutritious items are usually involved, (2) value is added to the food
   due to long and/or complex handling, and (3) physical control of items
   is often temporarily lost during handling. In Barbados, Carib grackles
   (Quiscalus lugubris) immersing items in water before consumption (a
   behaviour known as food dunking) lose a larger proportion of items to
   conspecific food thieves than grackles that do not dunk. In this paper,
   we first show that dunking in Carib grackles functions as a proto-tool
   food-processing technique that speeds up ingestion. We then examine five
   potential predictors of kleptoparasitism: only conspecific density and
   loss of physical control on food were found to influence the probability
   that birds would be attacked and successfully robbed of food by
   conspecifics. Grackles could reduce the probability of kleptoparasitism,
   by holding items in the bill while dunking and engaging in head-up
   displays. These behaviours were used flexibly depending on variation in
   the risk of kleptoparasitism. We suggest that costs like the ones
   incurred from theft might limit the profitability and frequency of tool
   and proto-tool food processing behaviours, creating a context where
   counter-strategies might be selected. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{To develop a conceptual understanding of the interaction between

   (Ursus arctos) to experimentally introduced tourism at Douglas River in

   of behavioral changes were measured. GPS collars were deployed to track
   temporal and spatial resource use and scan and focal observations were
   used to quantify foraging efficiency, Vigilance behavior, and bear use
   of various food resources. Total food intake was quantified by combining
   data on food resource use based on GPS locations and foraging efficiency
   was measured using spotting scopes from long distances. Seasonal food
   availability and quality were monitored and utilized as co-variates in
   comparisons between pre-treatment and treatment years. Though the bear
   population exhibited significant behavioral differences between the
   presence and absence of humans, changes in behavior generally mediated
   effects on total food intake. Adult males at a salt marsh viewing area

   intake did not differ between pre-treatment and treatment years despite
   a 10\% decline in time spent fishing when viewers were present. The

Abstract = {{Feeding behavior of carnivorous and herbivorous organisms is commonly
   explained in terms of nutritional requirements. However, feeding
   behavior of omnivorous organisms is difficult to predict and may not be
   based on nutritional requirements alone. To assess the plasticity of
   feeding behaviors exhibited by an omnivore, we conducted a feeding
   experiment using juvenile signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniuscidus
   (Dana, 1852)), both alone and in the presence of conspecifics and
   predators. Crayfish were presented with three types of food
   (chironomids, mayflies, and woody debris) in experimental enclosures,
   and the food type consumed and time to consumption were recorded.
   Although the same overall food choice (chironomid larvae) was made in
   all trials, the time it took for the juvenile crayfish to make a food
   selection was longer in the presence of adult conspecifics (both male
   and female) and adult cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii (Richardson,
   1836)). Food selection also took longer, although not significantly, in
   the presence of conspecific juvenile crayfish, and no changes in
   behavior were noted in the presence of young-of-the-year (YOY) cutthroat
   trout. The altered behavior of the juvenile crayfish observed in the

   effects of this omnivore on its community. Ecologists must be

Abstract = {{Larvae of the California newt (Taricha torosa) exhibit striking
   predator-avoidance behavior, escaping to refuges in response to a
   chemical cue from cannibalistic adults. In laboratory flow-tank
   experiments, stream water collected near free-ranging adults induced
   hiding responses in 100\% of the larvae tested. Solutions prepared by
   bathing adults (in field and laboratory) also evoked strong hiding
   behaviors. Insensitive to adult feeding status (fed or starved), and
   clearly not an excretory product, the chemical cue was released from
   adult skin (i.e., in swabs of adult backs, sides, and bellies).
   Tetrodotoxin (TTX) was found in skin swabs of adults and in bathwater at
   1 x 10(-7) mol/L using reversed-phase high-pressure liquid
   chromatography (HPLC). Concentrations of 1 x 10(-7) to 1 x 10(-9) mol/L
   TTX standard, and equivalent dilutions of bathwater, triggered hiding
   behaviors in larvae, with no subsequent sublethal toxicity. The presence
   of TTX-sensitive cells within larval olfactory epithelium was confirmed
   by behavioral experiments and electrophysiological recordings. In
   contrast, larvae did not hide in response to two other, structurally
   mimetic compounds (saxitoxin and mu-conotoxin GIIIB). Ontogenetically,
   larval behavioral responses to TTX and bathwater were strongest during
   weeks 3-5, diminishing to nil during week 7. No longer susceptible to
   adult cannibalism, larval indifference to the cue coincided with their
   ability to climb out of water and onto land.
   Thus, newt larvae escape cannibalism by detecting a poison (TTX) well
   known as a chemical defense for conspecific adults. Eliciting a
   behavioral response in one case and inhibiting neural activity in the
   other, this compound results in opposing physiological effects, with
   avoiding predation as the common goal. Accordingly, TTX joins a select
   group of keystone molecules, each having critical, but different,
   ecological consequences at multiple trophic levels. The unique
   combination of bioactive properties makes a compelling case for
   asymmetrical selection as a force driving the evolution of adult-larval
   trophic interactions.}},

Title = {{Laparoscopic castration of pony-stallions}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Stallion castration is one of the most common surgical procedures
   performed on horses. The opening of the abdominal cavity and the work
   with finger thick blood-vessels make this operation liable to frequent
   complications. Regularly, castrations have serious, often deadly
   complications such as: haemorrhage; prolapse of intestine or omentum;
   wound infection; funiculitis and peritonitis. Laparoscopic castration
   leaving the testicles in situ is a less invasive alternative to more
   conventional techniques of castration. However, with large horses and in
   individual cases the laparoscopic method leaves remnants of active
   testicular tissue and has the disadvantage of not completely eliminating
   stallion behaviour. The aim of this study was to evaluate a laparoscopic
   castration technique for smaller stallion breeds with regard to its
   practicability, advantages and disadvantages, complications and
   postoperative behaviour of the stallions. The study involved 15 two year
   old Icelandic stallions and 5 one-year-old stallions of a small horse
   breed. For better visualization within the abdomen the animals were
   starved for a period of 36 hours prior to the operation. All stallions
   were sedated and laparoscopically castrated standing in the stocks. The
   operation was preceded by the establishment of a capnoperitoneum and of
   two transabdominal ports under local anaesthesia: one for the
   laparoscope and one for the instruments. The plica vasculosa including
   the deferent duct was ligated as close as possible to the anulus
   vaginalis by a double Roeder knot. The testicles remained in situ. The
   operated horses underwent a daily check-up within the first week post
   surgery. A final examination took place 6 months after the operation.
   The following parameters were measured: Body temperature before and
   within the first 8 days after the operation; testosterone levels before
   and 8 days after the operation; the size of the testicles before and 6
   months after the operation. Additionally an HCG stimulation test was
   carried out 6 months post surgery in order to identify possible remnants
   of active testicular tissue. There were no major or life threatening
   complications during the castration. Difficulties occurred owing to poor
   visualization because of bleeding from small vessels of the plica
   vasculosa; an insufficient overview because of a full bladder or
   intestines; or through an unintentional loosening of the ligature after
   the ends of the suture were trimmed. In one case a one sided lameness of
   the hind limb was observed but disappeared the following day. All
   incisions healed by primary intention. With practice by the surgeon a
   decrease in average operation time from 153 minutes in the beginning
   down to 50 minutes was observed after 20 operations. The day after the
   operation all patients showed an average increase of body temperature of
   0.63 degrees C. The procedure did not always result in complete
   resorption of testicular tissue. Six months after the castration eight
   cases still had one testicle. In three cases two testicles remained. In
   6 of 18 cases (33\%) the HCG simulation test was positive 6 months after
   the operation indicating incomplete castration With regard to
   complications in wound healing, haemorrhage or intestinal prolapse this
   method of castration appears very safe. A further risk is minimized by
   avoiding general anaesthesia. Furthermore there is a relatively short
   convalescence because there are only small incisions in the abdominal
   wall.
   Disadvantages to this procedure include: the requirement of considerable
   staff and equipment; considerable surgical expetise; the need of an HCG
   simulation test to check the result of the castration. The contractual
   duties accepted with the undertaking of a castration of a healthy
   stallion are firstly to eliminate reproductive ability and secondly to
   prevent reproductive instinct and stallion behaviour. In this regard it
   is critical to note that 4 of the 20 laparoscopically castrated
   stallions still exhibited stallion behaviour and that 6 animals showed a
   positive HCG stimulation test. The described method is to be used only
   after a thorough explanation to the owner. In most cases a castration
   through orchidectomy under general anaesthesia with suturing of the
   processus vaginalis and suturing of the wound will be the better
   alternative in spite of the anaesthetic risk. The result of routine
   surgery is more certain, faster and forensically less contestable.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory animals, when subjected to behavioural tests, are often
   motivationally primed by a period of prior water or food restriction. To
   date, it is still debatable which restriction protocol (water versus
   food) is more appropriate for different species. In general, a protocol
   is considered appropriate if animal discomfort is kept to a minimum
   whilst motivation for the task is maximised. Here we present a
   comparison study of the effects of water versus food restriction
   protocols in mice. The characterisation of the physiological and
   behavioural effects of food and water restriction in mice is beneficial
   for both institutional animal care centres and the scientific community.
   We have investigated body weight fluctuations in three groups of
   C57BL/6J female mice (water-restricted, food-restricted and control) in
   two different protocols (20 h versus 22 h of restriction per day) over 2
   consecutive weeks. Subsequently, a selected number of mice from each
   group were subjected to a battery of behavioural tests to investigate
   exploratory, emotional and dominance behaviours, in addition to learning
   and memory processes. Body weight fluctuations suggested that mice
   tolerate a water restriction regimen better than a comparable food
   restriction regimen. Furthermore, behavioural performances demonstrated
   that food-restricted mice show a reduction in the exploration of a new
   environment and particular aspects of their timing memories are
   distorted. Finally, both water- and food-restricted mice tended to be
   more offensive than control mice when paired with an opponent in a

Abstract = {{Background: In an exploratory positron emission tomography study of
   postprandial regional cerebral blood flow, which is a marker of neuronal
   activity. obese men differed from lean men in several brain regions,
   including the prefrontal cortex. The subjects received a meal
   proportional to their body size; therefore, the meal volume was
   different for each person.
   Objective: We investigated whether differences in the brain responses of
   obese and lean men to a meal represent satiety or feelings of gastric
   distension.
   Design: We studied 9 lean ((x) over bar +/- SD body fat: 15 +/- 5\%;
   age: 33 +/- 10 y) and 9 obese (body fat: 31 +/- 4\%; age: 32 +/- 10 y)
   men given a fixed amount (400 mL) of a liquid meal. We compared their
   results with those in 11 lean (body fat: 16 +/- 5\%; age: 35 +/- 8 y)
   and 11 obese (body fat: 33 +/- 5\%; age: 28 +/- 5 y) previously studied
   men given a meal proportional to their body size. We performed analyses
   by using a two-level, random-effects approach in the STATISTICAL
   PARAMETRIC MAPPING software package and a significance level of P <=
   0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons.
   Results: Compared with lean men, obese men had consistently less
   postprandial activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
   irrespective of meal size.
   Conclusion: Because the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been
   implicated in the inhibition of inappropriate behavior, satiety, and
   meal termination, differential responses of neuronal activity to food
   intake in this area may contribute to a propensity for obesity or to the
   difficulty in losing weight experienced by obese men.}},

Abstract = {{Food and predators are thought to have independent effects on avian
   reproductive success. Several studies have now shown that extra food can
   reduce nest predation rates. Most hypotheses suggest that this is due to
   changes in adult and/or nestling behaviour. A critical test as to
   whether behaviour is key, is to examine when predation events occur for
   birds with and without extra food. If behaviour is important, extra food
   should lead to fewer nest predation events during the day, when birds
   are active, but have no effect at night. We conducted a food
   supplementation experiment on song sparrows and tested for food effects
   on timing of nest predation events, adult antipredator behaviour and
   nestling begging behaviour. Food supplementation significantly reduced
   the relative frequency of daytime nest predation especially during
   incubation. During incubation, fed females had shorter foraging bouts
   and longer bouts on the nest, and these behaviours were associated with
   a reduced probability of being preyed upon. During brooding, we found
   trends (P < 0.1) towards lower daytime predation and greater adult nest
   attendance for fed birds than for unfed birds, but nestling begging did
   not differ with food treatment. Our results show that food availability
   does influence nest predation through its effect on antipredator
   behaviour. We highlight the importance of examining adult behaviour and
   vulnerability to predation at both stages of the nesting period because
   behavioural changes with extra food were extreme at the egg stage and
   were more effective at reducing nest predation than were behavioural
   changes at the nestling stage. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Purpose of review Childhood externalizing behavior (aggression,
   hyperactivity, and conduct disorder) has been increasingly viewed as a
   public health problem because of its etiology and outcome. The
   association between malnutrition and externalizing behavior has begun to
   receive attention. This review summarizes recent empirical findings on
   malnutrition as a risk factor for the development of externalizing
   behavior, with an emphasis on micronutrient deficiency, and explores
   brain dysfunction as a possible mechanism.
   Recent findings Externalizing behavior is associated with both
   macromalnutrition (e.g. protein) and micromalnutrition (e.g. iron and
   zinc). Both prenatal and postnatal malnutrition is implicated. The
   long-term effects of malnutrition on behavior could be reversible. The
   effects of docosahexaenoic acid/omega-3 long-chain essential fatty acid
   on externalizing behavior are more mixed. From animal and human
   findings, it is hypothesized that malnutrition impairs neurocognitive
   functioning by reducing neurons, alternating neurotransmitter
   functioning, and increasing neurotoxicity, and that such neurocognitive
   impairments predispose to externalizing behavior.
   Summary Different lines of evidence support the view that poor nutrition
   contributes to the development of child behavior problems. More
   randomized, controlled trials that manipulate nutritional intake and
   evaluate behavior in children are needed to evaluate the etiological

Abstract = {{Using experimental methods, body size, nutritional state (hunger) and
   light level were investigated as possible determinants of the extent to
   which juvenile lingcod Ophiodon elongatus used structural refuges. In
   the laboratory, older, larger individuals (134-162 mm total length, L-T)
   exhibited a higher propensity for structure use than did smaller
   juvenile fish (78-103 mm L-T). In fish of both body sizes, increasing
   hunger levels caused fish to emerge more readily from refuges than
   satiated individuals, with this effect most prominent for smaller fish.
   Diel patterns of ambient illumination were simulated in the laboratory,
   and refuge use by large individuals decreased significantly in response
   to lower nocturnal light levels, a pattern that was not observed in the
   smaller size class. These results indicate an ontogenetic shift in
   refuge use. During the summer, as post-settlement fish grew larger, they
   tended to increase affinity for structurally complex habitat, and also
   showed divergent patterns of behaviour in relation to hunger and light
   level. Journal compilation (c) 2006 The Fisheries Society of the British

Abstract = {{Insufficient availability of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
   during pre- and neonatal development decreases accretion of
   docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) in the developing brain and is
   associated with sub-optimal sensory and cognitive function in humans,
   altered behavior in animals, and may contribute to neurodevelopmental
   disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and
   schizophrenia. This study examined the effects,of variation in dietary
   availability of n-3 PLTFAs on brain fatty acid composition and the
   consequent effects on locomotor activity in male and female Long-Evans
   rats. Rats were raised from conception using purified diets and breeding
   protocols designed to produce four groups with distinct brain
   phospholipid compositions varying in DHA content and/or the proportion
   of n-3 and n-6 PUFAs. Locomotor behavior was measured for a 2-h period
   on postnatal days 28, 42, 56, and 70. In males, decreased brain DHA
   produced alterations in activity that were most pronounced
   post-adolescence and with the greatest decrease in DHA. However, the
   behavioral effects in males were not linearly related to brain DHA
   level. In contrast, no significant effects of variation in brain fatty
   acid composition were observed in females. This suggests that variation
   in brain DRA content produces sex-specific alterations in locomotor
   activity and that the neurochemical alterations underlying the observed
   behavioral changes vary depending on the degree of DHA depletion. (c)

Abstract = {{Imperiled species that have been translocated or established in
   captivity can show rapid alterations in morphology and behavior, but the
   proximate mechanisms of such phenotypic changes are rarely known. Devils
   Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis) are endemic to a single desert pool
   and are characterized by a small body, large head and eyes, and lack of
   pelvic fins. To lessen the risk of extinction, additional populations of
   C. diabolis were established in artificial refuges. Yet, pupfish in
   these refuges rapidly shifted to a larger body, smaller head and eyes,
   and greater body depth. Here we examined how food availability and
   temperature, which differ between these habitats, influence
   morphological development in closely related Amargosa River pupfish
   (Cyprinodon nevadensis amargosae). We were interested in knowing whether
   these environmental factors could developmentally shift Amargosa River
   pupfish toward the morphology typical of pupfish in Devil's Hole. By
   regulating food ration, we created groups of pupfish with low, medium
   and high growth rates. Pupfish with low growth showed proportionally
   larger head and eyes, smaller body depth, and reduction in pelvic fin
   development. Elevated temperature further inhibited pelvic fin
   development in all treatments. Pupfish in the low growth group also
   showed reduced levels of thyroid hormone, suggesting a possible
   physiological mechanism underlying these morphological changes. To test
   this mechanism further, pupfish were reared with goitrogens to
   pharmacologically inhibit endogenous thyroid hormone production. Pupfish
   given goitrogens developed larger heads and eyes, shallower bodies, and
   reduced pelvic fins. Taken together, our results suggest that changes in
   environmental factors affecting the growth and thyroid hormone status of
   juvenile pupfish may play a developmental role in generating the
   morphological differences between C. diabolis in Devil's Hole and the
   refuges. These findings illustrate the need to incorporate a mechanistic
   understanding of phenotypic plasticity into conservation strategies to
   preserve imperiled fishes.}},

Abstract = {{Small birds show the greatest rates of body mass gain at dawn and before
   dusk. Some environmental and internal factors may change the intensity
   and duration of the first period of body mass gain relative to the
   second one, and thus may change the shape of daily fattening
   trajectories. A frequent problem for researchers is setting the periods
   of the day when each of the main environmental factors operates, because
   its effects usually decay or increase smoothly from dawn to dusk. We
   solved this problem by fitting the body mass to time of day with a model
   generated with a differential approach. This model shows the typical
   bimodal pattern of daily fattening routines in small birds and allows
   calculation of the inflexion point, that is, the time of day when the
   trajectory ends the decelerated period of body mass gain and. starts the
   accelerated increase in body weight. A delay or advance in the
   inflexion, point can be related to environmental stress that may
   otherwise pass unnoticed. We calculated a mean delay of 10\% in the
   inflexion point in a sample of studies with limited food availability,
   and a mean advance of 6\% in a sample of studies with increased
   predation risk. The change in the shape of daily trajectories of body
   mass between stressful and nonstressful conditions was inversely

Abstract = {{Theoretical models predict that small birds should adjust daily patterns
   of body mass gain in response to environmental and internal factors. In
   a companion paper, we described a model on daily fattening that allows
   the analysis of precise changes in the shape of hourly patterns of body
   mass. In this study, we tested one of the main predictions of the model:
   the inflexion point of the body mass trajectory should be delayed in
   response to a decrease in food availability increasing body mass as soon
   as possible when food is scarce. This effect might be stronger in
   subordinate than in dominant birds. We tested both predictions with four
   pairs of coal tits, Periparus ater, kept in cages where food was
   delivered at high and low rates. Daytime increase in body mass was I g
   in both treatments. As predicted by the model, the tits increased body
   mass as soon as possible when food was delivered at a low rate, and the
   inflexion point of the body mass trajectory was 16.7\% delayed compared
   to the high food delivery rate. However, dominance rank had no

   and nonlateralized fish, obtained through selective breeding, in a
   situation requiring the sharing of attention between two simultaneous
   tasks, prey capture and predator vigilance. Food-deprived individual
   Girardinus falcatus had to enter a compartment adjacent to the home tank

Abstract = {{In birds, sibling competition encompasses several activities, one of
   which is jostling for position, that is, competing for the location in
   the nest where parents predictably deliver food items. We hypothesized
   that nestlings that compete by jostling for position may fall out of the
   nest either accidentally or because siblings push each other to reduce
   brood size. This hypothesis predicts that in a competitive environment
   needy nestlings trade-off the benefit of being fed against the cost of
   falling out of the nest. As a first attempt to evaluate this hypothesis,
   we experimentally manipulated the number of young per brood in the
   colonial Alpine swift, Apus melba. Nestlings fell out of their colony
   more frequently when reared in enlarged than in reduced broods. Because
   brood size manipulation affects not only the number of young per nest
   but also their body condition, we analysed an extended data set to
   disentangle these two factors. This analysis showed that, independently
   of brood size, nestlings in poor condition and those reared in broods
   where sibling differed markedly in weight were more likely to disappear
   from the colony. Nestling disappearance also occurred predominantly in
   nests close to the colony entrances. Although nestling swifts can wander
   in the colony and become adopted in neighbouring nests, we found no
   evidence that wandering per se increased the risk of falling out of the
   colony. Our study therefore highlights a novel cost of scramble
   competition. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Theoretical and experimental evidence suggests that an increase in
   flight costs will decrease flight performance, and that birds should
   trade-off the benefits of body reserves to minimize these costs.
   Alternatively, birds could avoid starvation by increasing food intake,
   thereby maintaining body reserves, and/or decreasing flight activity to
   compensate for the greater per unit flight costs. To test the effect of
   increased flight costs on body mass regulation and on flying and feeding
   activity, we experimentally manipulated wing area in a free-ranging
   wintering population of coal tits, Periparus ater, and in captive birds
   living in a less restrictive environment (large outdoor aviaries). In
   the field, body mass decreased when wing area was reduced, but heavier
   birds lost more weight than lighter birds as a consequence of an
   allometric increase in flying costs. However, wing area reduction had no
   effect on body mass in the aviaries. Birds also flew less when wing area
   was reduced and those with higher wing loadings decreased flying
   frequency more markedly. We suggest that the goal of small resident

Abstract = {{Although previous studies of individual differences in preferences for

   Adaptation to either masculine or feminine faces increases preferences
   for novel faces that are similar to those that were recently seen. Here,
   we replicate this effect and demonstrate that adaptation to masculine or
   feminine faces also influences the extent to which masculine faces are
   perceived as trustworthy. These adaptation effects may reflect a
   proximate mechanism that contributes to the development of face
   preferences within individuals, underpins phenomena such as
   imprinting-like effects and condition-dependent face preferences, and
   shapes personality attributions to faces that play an important role in

Abstract = {{Birds may react to the presence of humans with an immediate primary
   behavioural reaction and with physiological responses, such as the
   activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. This study
   investigates the suite of behavioural and adrenocortical responses to
   the presence of humans and to handling in two subspecies of blue tits
   Parus caeruleus, a small hole-nesting passerine, during the period of
   feeding their nestlings. The first aim was to investigate whether the
   presence of humans near their nests elicits an adrenocortical response
   and whether the increase in circulating corticosterone is correlated
   with the behavioural reaction of the birds. The second aim was to
   determine the time-lag between the onset of capture and handling stress
   and the increase in circulating corticosterone levels. The third aim was
   to try to explain individual variation in the adrenocortical response to
   handling with 9 intrinsic and extrinsic factors (sex, age, body size,
   measures of body condition, time of day, and date). One half of the
   parents showed a behavioural reaction to our presence near the nest,
   such as alarming, and hesitating to enter the nestbox. However, the
   degree of behavioural reaction before handling was not related to
   circulating corticosterone levels which remained low. The results
   confirm that primary behavioural and adrenocortical reactions to the
   presence of predators are independent of each other. A comparison with
   published findings supports the hypothesis that birds react to predators
   with an adrenocortical response only in a situation that is imminently
   life-threatening. Hence, the primary behavioural response of the bird to
   a predator may determine whether or not an adrenocortical response is
   elicited. An adrenocortical response to handling started 3 min after
   capture in the nest box. Individual variation in baseline corticosterone
   levels could be explained by subspecies and body condition (fat stores),
   variation in handling-induced corticosterone levels by subspecies, body
   condition, body size, and time of day. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   genotypes. Interactions between birth size and insulin VNTR genotype in
   relation to fasting glucose (p for interaction =0.08 for birth weight,
   p=0.05 for birth length) and 2-hour insulin (p for interaction =0.04)
   were ob-served.
   Conclusions: These interactions between body size at birth and genotype
   reflect interactions between the insulin VNTR gene and the intrauterine
   environment. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis of
   developmental plasticity, where one genotype can give rise to different
   phenotypes dependent on the early environment.}},

Title = {{Wistar rats with high versus low rearing activity differ in radial maze
   performance}},

Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{Substantial work has shown that rats although identical in stock, sex,
   age, and housing conditions can differ considerably in terms of behavior
   and physiology. Such individual differences, which can be detected by
   specific behavioral screening tests, are rather stable, that is, they
   probably reflect a behavioral disposition or trait. Here, we asked
   whether and how such differences might affect performance in a task of
   spatial learning and memory, the radial maze. As in our previous work,
   we used the degree of rearing activity in a novel open field to assign
   male adult outbred Wistar rats into those with high versus low rearing
   activity (HRA/LRA rats). They were then tested in a plus-maze for
   possible differences in anxiety-related behavior. Finally, and most
   importantly, they were food deprived and underwent maze training using
   an 8-arm radial maze with four non-baited and four baited arms. One of
   these arms consistently contained a larger bait size than the other
   three. In the open field, HRA rats not only showed more rearing
   behavior, but also more locomotor activity than LRA rats. In the
   plus-maze, HRA rats again showed more locomotion, but did not differ in
   open arm time or percentage of open arm entries, that is, conventional
   measures of anxiety-related behavior. In the radial maze, HRA rats
   consistently needed less time to consume all pellets than LRA rats,
   which was due to faster locomotion on the arms and less time spent at
   the food pits (especially in baited arms) of HRA rats. During the
   initial days of training, they were also more efficient in obtaining all
   food pellets available. Furthermore, HRA rats visited more arms and made
   relatively less reference memory errors than LRA rats. This allowed them
   to forage food quickly, but was paralleled by more working memory errors
   than in LRA rats. In general, working memory errors were more frequent
   in the arm with the large bait size, but there were no indications that
   HRA and LRA rats responded differently dependent on reward size.
   Finally, LRA rats lost slightly more weight than HRA rats during the
   period of food deprivation. These results are discussed with respect to
   the role of cognitive and motivational mechanisms, which as
   subject-inherent factors can contribute substantially to
   inter-individual variability in the radial maze. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Intraguild predation (IGP) is common among generalist predators and an
   important issue in food web theory, because IGP may destabilise
   communities by increasing extinction of species. Also, IGP may interfere
   with the effectiveness of generalist predators as biological control
   agents. In general, occurrence of IGP in laboratory or field studies is
   inferred from abundance data or direct observations only. We
   investigated if tracing stable isotopes allows distinction between
   different types of predation and confirmation of IGP. Wolf spiders were
   chosen as model organisms for generalist predators; IGP of third instar
   A. cuneata on second instar P. palustris was investigated in a
   laboratory experiment. The availability of alternative prey and the
   complexity of the microhabitat were manipulated, since both factors are
   thought to facilitate coexistence of predators.
   Stable isotope analysis documented predation of A. cuneata on P.
   palustris and predation on alternative prey by both juveniles. Both the
   presence of alternative prey and the availability of shelter reduced
   mortality of juvenile P. palustris during the first week. During the
   second week mortality increased in complex structure without alternative
   prey presumably due to enhanced activity and cannibalism among starving
   P. palustris. Thus, microhabitat complexity and prey abundance may
   foster coexistence of wolf spiders in the field.
   In conclusion, stable isotope analysis was proven a powerful tool to
   investigate animal behaviour without direct observation. The method
   allowed disentangling predator feeding behaviour when more than one type
   of prey was present.}},

Abstract = {{Poor fetal environments are thought to produce adaptive changes in human
   developmental trajectories according to the Predictive Adaptive Response
   hypothesis. Although many studies have demonstrated correlations between
   indicators of fetal environment and negative adult health outcomes, the
   adaptive significance of these outcomes is unclear. Our study explicitly
   tests the adaptive nature of fetal programming in humans. We show that
   differences in nutritional status at birth are associated with adaptive
   differences in the sensitivity of adult ovarian function to energetic
   stress. Women who were born as relatively fat babies do not exhibit
   ovarian suppression in response to moderate levels of physical activity
   at adulthood, in contrast to women who were born as skinnier babies. The
   levels of estradiol in women born in the highest tertile of ponderal
   index (an indicator of neonatal nutritional status) were 37\% and 46\%
   higher, respectively, than levels of estradiol in women born in the low
   and middle ponderal index tertiles. These findings suggest that fetal
   programming of reproductive function results in developmentally plastic,
   but essentially adaptive, shifts in set points of ovarian response to
   energetic stress, such that women who were gestated under conditions of
   energetic constraint show greater sensitivity to energetic stress in
   adulthood. Our results have practical implications in terms of
   behavioral strategies for reducing the risk of breast cancer. We suggest
   that the amount of activity necessary to reduce levels of estrogen,
   which may in turn reduce cancer risk, can depend on a woman's
   nutritional status at birth.}},

Abstract = {{With rare exceptions, avian offspring are continuously attended by one
   parent for at least the first few days after hatching. The duration of
   this phase of the nesting cycle is regulated by a trade-off between the
   benefits of brooding/guarding and those of foraging. We manipulated
   offspring age in grey-headed albatrosses, Thalassarche chrysostoma, by
   swapping chicks between nests. Parents given chicks 6 days older than
   their own shortened brooding by only 1.2 days, and parents given chicks
   6 days younger than their own extended brooding by 1.4 days. Despite
   being relatively unresponsive to chick age, parents adjusted brooding in
   relation to calendar date and to chick condition. The results suggest
   that adults do not use chick age per se as a cue, but instead probably
   use an internal timer, and fine-tune the decision to end brooding
   according to date and chick mass. The duration of brood guarding did not
   correlate with adult body condition, suggesting that adults had a
   sufficient safety margin to allow them to respond to chick needs without
   compromising their own residual reproductive value. Chick survival at
   the end of brood guarding was strongly dependent on calendar date (early
   and late chicks suffered higher mortality), which suggests that
   grey-headed albatrosses benefit from breeding synchronously. We conclude
   that the length of the brood-guarding period is dependent on chick
   condition and seasonal variation in chick predation risk. (c) 2006 The

Abstract = {{Amphibians are known to exhibit phenotypic plasticity in response to

   changes can be induced by embryonic exposures to predator non-contact
   cues. However, the possible consequences of such exposures on larval

   have remained unexplored. These laboratory experiments examine the
   effects of predation cues experienced during embryonic development on
   some morphological and behavioural traits in hatchlings and tadpoles of
   the common frog (Rana temporaria). Eggs were raised until hatching in
   the nonlethal presence of either a sympatric predator (larval spotted
   salamander, Salamandra salamandra), or an allopatric predator Ouvenile
   Turkish crayfish, Astacus leptodactylus), or crushed conspecific
   tadpoles. Predators were kept either starved, or fed with R. temporaria
   tadpoles. Embryonic treatments had significant consequences on weight
   and total length of hatchlings, as well as on the general activity of
   tadpoles. Olfactometric tests showed that the behavioural responses of
   tadpoles to chemical cues from the two predators tested were not
   significantly affected by embryonic treatments. In contrast, embryonic
   experience showed a significant influence on the behavioural response of
   tadpoles to chemical cues from crushed conspecifics. These results
   indicate that the morphology of hatchlings depends on the species and

   demonstrate for the first time that the subsequent activity and
   chemically mediated antipredator behaviour of tadpoles can be influenced
   by embryonic experience of the predation risk.}},

Abstract = {{Nature-based tourism has experienced a greater increase, and, even
   although it might have deleterious effects for many wildlife species,
   its consequences remains little explored. Many lizard species are
   endangered and tourism has been proposed as a potential factor
   responsible of the decline of several lizards' populations, but no study
   has examined the effect of tourism on lizards' behaviour, body condition
   and health state. Many lizards respond to people as if they were
   predators, by readily escaping to refuges. However, an increase in the
   frequency of these antipredatory strategies can lead to a loss of body
   condition, which may have important consequences for short and long term
   fitness. We analysed the effects of tourism on escape behaviour of
   common wall lizards, Podarcis muralis, as well as on their body
   condition and health state (ectoparasites, blood parasites, and cell
   mediated immune response). Results showed that lizards did not modify
   their escape behaviour in response to tourism. Lizards had similar
   approach and flight distances, and escape strategies regardless of the
   level of tourism pressure. However, lizards inhabiting areas with high
   tourism levels, where they presumably needed to perform antipredatory
   behaviours more often, showed higher intensity of infection by ticks and
   lower body condition at the end of the breeding period. Moreover,
   lizards with poorer body condition had lower cell mediated immune
   responses. Therefore, tourism seems to have deleterious effects on body
   condition and on host-parasite relationships in this lizard species.
   These effects should be taking into account when designing walking paths
   in protected areas. Our study reports evidence that regardless lizards
   showed similar escape behaviour in tourist than in natural areas, their
   body condition and health state should be also examined to accurately
   assess the actual effects of tourism on lizards' populations. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{Small size at birth is linked with an increased risk of chronic diseases
   in later life. Poor maternal nutrition during gestation may contribute
   to restricted fetal growth, leading to increased disease susceptibility
   in later Life. Animal studies have shown that undernutrition during
   gestation is associated with reduced life span and increased disease
   susceptibility. The Dutch famine is a unique counterpart for animal
   models that study the effects of restricted maternal nutrition during
   different stages of gestation.
   This paper describes the findings from a cohort study of 2414 people
   born around the time of the Dutch famine. Exposure to famine during any
   stage of gestation was associated with glucose intolerance. We found
   more coronary heart disease, a more atherogenic lipid profile, disturbed
   blood coagulation, increased stress responsiveness and more obesity
   among those exposed to famine in early gestation. Women exposed to
   famine in early gestation also had an increased risk of breast cancer.
   People exposed to famine in mid gestation had more microalbuminuria and
   obstructive airways disease.
   These findings show that maternal undernutrition during gestation has
   important effects on health in later life, but that the effects on
   health depend on its timing during gestation. Especially early gestation
   seems to be a vulnerable period. Adequate dietary advice to women before
   and during pregnancy seems a promising strategy in preventing chronic

Abstract = {{Optimality theory rests on the assumptions that short-term foraging
   decisions are driven by variation in environmental quality, and that
   these decisions have important implications for long-term fitness. These
   assumptions, however, are rarely tested in a field setting. We linked
   behavioral foraging decisions in food patches with measures of
   environmental quality covering larger spatial (resource density) or
   temporal (growth parameters) scales. In 10 lakes, we measured the food
   density at which benthic fish give up foraging in experimental food
   patches (giving-up density, GUD), quantified the biomass of benthic
   invertebrates, and calculated the maximum individual size (L-infinity)
   of bream (Abramis brama L.), a typical benthivore in these lakes. We
   found positive relationships between resource density and both GUD and
   L-infinity, and a positive relationship between L-infinity and GUD. Prey
   characterized as vulnerable to predation contributed most to the
   relationships between resource density and either GUD or L-infinity. A
   path analysis showed that resource density and L-infinity directly
   explained 54\% and 28\%, respectively, of the variation in GUD, whereas
   86\% of the variation in L-infinity was explained by resource density,

Title = {{Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of
   the active substance diazinon}},
Journal = {{EFSA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Diazinon is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review
   programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended
   by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires
   the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of
   the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided
   by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year
   a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission.
   Portugal being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR
   on diazinon in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the
   amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 8
   July 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was
   initiated on 9 September 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of
   the Member States and the sole applicant Makhteshim Agan. Subsequently,
   the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member
   State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation
   meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made
   available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of
   scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took
   place with representatives from the Member States on 6-7 June 2006
   leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the
   representative uses in Southern Europe as an insecticide and acaricide
   as proposed by the applicant with application via orchard air blast
   sprayers and tractor mounted hydraulic sprayers. Application is made to
   apples and pears with a maximum total dose of 2.7 kg diazinon per
   hectare and to sugar beet with a maximum total dose of 0.72 kg diazinon
   per hectare. It should be noted that the use in apples and pears were
   withdrawn during the EU peer review process. The representative
   formulated product for the evaluation was Diazol 60 EC, an emulsifiable
   concentrate (EC).
   Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the
   respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination
   of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German
   S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the
   residues. However, it should be noted that full validation of the method
   of analysis for food commodities is not available as no independent
   laboratory validation data are available. As well as this further
   validation data are required for the method of analysis for air.
   Some analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to
   physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that
   quality control measurements of the plant protection product are
   possible. There are still some outstanding data gaps for the relevant
   impurities.
   Acute toxicity during oral exposure is higher than by dermal application
   or inhalation. Therefore the proposed classification is Xn; R22
   ``Harmful if swallowed{''}. The main effect observed during short term
   or long term exposure is the inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase
   activity. Based on this, the relevant oral short term NOAEL is 0.02
   mg/kg bw/day in the dog studies.
   There is no genotoxic potential for diazinon, no carcinogenic effect in
   rats and mice, and no reproductive or developmental toxicity in rats and
   rabbits. No delayed neurotoxicity was observed in hens, and the NOAEL in
   the subchronic neurotoxicity study with rats is the same as the short
   term NOAEL, based on acetyl cholinesterase inhibition. The groundwater
   metabolites G 27550(3) and GS 31144(4) are not considered
   toxicologically significant, having no phosphate group susceptible to
   produce acetyl cholinesterase inhibition. They were concluded not
   relevant. The three impurities TEPP5, O, S-TEP6 and S, S-TEPP7 were very
   toxic in acute oral studies and considered of toxicological concern.
   Acute and subchronic human studies were submitted, but were either not
   acceptable, or had scientific deficiencies.
   The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and Acceptable Operator Exposure Level
   (AOEL) are 0.0002 mg/kg bw/day and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is
   0.025 mg/kg bw, with the use of the safety factor 100. For the supported
   use on sugar beets, the estimated operator exposure according to the
   German or the UK models is largely above the AOEL, with or without the
   use of personal protective equipment (PPE) (2700\% of the AOEL with the
   use of PPE and respiratory protective equipment (RPE) according to the
   German model).
   The metabolism of diazinon in plants is clearly elucidated. The
   degradation pathway proceeds first through hydrolysis of the
   phosphorothioate ester link, leading to metabolite G 27550, which given
   its chemical structure has no cholinesterase activity. This compound is
   further hydroxylated and conjugated to glucose. Diazoxon is not
   observed. The amount of metabolites in comparison to the parent level is
   variable from crop to crop, but the residue definition can be restricted
   to parent compound only for monitoring and risk assessment as no other
   compound expected to add a contribution to the toxicological effects of
   diazinon was identified. Supervised residue trials were conducted
   suggesting the setting of a MRL at 0.5 mg/kg in pome fruits, and
   indicating that residues in sugar beet roots are below 0.01 mg/kg. No
   residues are expected in following crops and no plant- back restriction
   is needed.
   Processing of apples leads to a clear reduction of the diazinon levels
   in juice and sauce. However, the formation of a degradation product
   (desethyl diazinon), identified under specific hydrolysis conditions,
   was not investigated in practical conditions. This compound is
   recommended for inclusion in the residue definition for risk assessment
   in processed commodities.
   The metabolism of diazinon in livestock has been investigated and parent
   compound was found to be the major compound of toxicological relevance
   in animal tissues. Diazinon exhibits a lipophilic behaviour. Two
   metabolites, diazoxon and a hydroxylated form of diazinon were also
   present. The residue definition in animal commodities can be restricted
   to diazinon on the basis of the representative uses considered in this
   peer-review, leading to a low livestock dietary exposure and non
   significant transfer of residues to animal tissues, as demonstrated by
   feeding studies.
   The short and long term exposure assessments were conducted and
   indicated potential exceedences of the ADI and ARfD, which in some cases
   appear to be severe, in particular for infants and toddlers, with high
   consumption levels of pome fruits.
   In soil diazinon exhibited low to moderate persistence. Significant
   sinks for the pyridine ring-C-14-radiolabel used in the aerobic
   laboratory studies were residue not extracted by acetonitrile: water or
   methanol/water (9-38\% of applied radioactivity (AR) after 76-119 days)
   and mineralisation to CO2 5.8-86\% AR at 76-119 days. The major (>10\%
   AR) metabolite in soil extracts was G 27550 accounting for up to 82\% AR
   which exhibited high soil persistence. This metabolite may have the
   potential to accumulate in soil if applications are made to the same
   field in successive years. Diazinon exhibited medium to low soil
   mobility and G 27550 exhibited very high mobility based on the results
   of guideline batch laboratory adsorption experiments. The minor soil
   degradation product (max. 4.7\% AR) GS 31144 was also characterised as
   exhibiting very high soil mobility on the basis of quantitative
   structure activity relationships (QSAR) computer modelling.
   In aerobic laboratory natural sediment water system experiments,
   diazinon exhibited low persistence (dissipation DT50 in water 3.9-4.7
   days) as a consequence of a combination of partitioning to sediment
   (accounting for up to 77\%AR at 0 days) and biodegradation. In the water
   phase the metabolite G 27550 accounted for a maximum of 47\%AR 30 days
   after application, levels subsequently declined (DT50 in water estimated
   at 87 days). G 27550 was also present in sediment (maximum 22.7\%AR).
   Residues not extracted from sediment by acetonitrile and acetonitrile:
   water represented 22-49\%AR at study end (100 days). Mineralisation to
   CO2 of the pyridine ring-C-14-radiolabel used accounted for only 4.7-5.1
   \% AR by 100 days. The available surface water exposure assessment just
   considered the spray drift route of entry to surface water. The
   potential exposure of surface water with parent diazinon and the soil
   metabolite G 27550 via the drainage and runoff routes of entry has not
   been assessed in the available EU level exposure assessment. Member
   States should therefore carry out a surface water exposure and
   consequent aquatic risk assessment for diazinon and G 27550 from the
   runoff and drainage routes of exposure at the national level, should
   diazinon be included in Annex 1.
   Appropriate FOCUS groundwater modelling is not available. This is
   required. Based on the available FOCUS PEARL modelling that utilised too
   favourable input parameters, annual average recharge concentrations
   leaving the top 1m soil column >0.75 mu g/L are already indicated for G
   27550. For GS 31144 these concentrations are indicated to be >0.1 mu
   g/L. Based on current information it cannot be excluded that these
   concentrations for GS 31144 may be shown by appropriate modelling to be
   >0.75 mu g/L. Non relevance assessments are therefore required for both
   these potential groundwater contaminants. A significant dissipation
   route of diazinon from plants and soil will be volatilisation to the
   atmosphere. However calculated relatively rapid photooxidation through
   reaction with the hydroxyl radicals present in the upper atmosphere,
   indicate that diazinon is unlikely to be subject to long range
   atmospheric transport.
   A high acute, short and long term risk for insectivorous birds was
   identified in the first tier assessment for both evaluated uses. Based
   on actual measured concentrations of diazinon and degradation of
   residues in orchards the short and long term risk in apples/pears is
   considered low. However, the high acute risk remains. For sugar beet no
   valid residue data are available to refine the assessment. A high long
   term risk to insectivorous mammals was identified in both sugar beet and
   orchards. A risk for secondary poisoning was identified for
   earthworm-and fish-eating birds and mammals for the use in orchards and
   for earthworm-eating mammals for the use in sugar beet. Diazinon is very
   toxic to aquatic organisms. Risk mitigation measures comparable to 30 m
   buffer zones are required in orchards, and to 5 m in sugar beet. The
   toxicity to bees is high. Sugar beet is however not attractive to bees
   and application in orchards is late in the season after flowering. The
   risk to bees is therefore considered to be low. Non-target arthropods
   outside the field would be affected from the treatment in orchards. A
   potential for recolonisation has been shown in an aged residue study.
   However, a prerequisite for recolonisation from off-field non-target
   arthropod populations is that off-field populations are not affected.
   Therefore the risk to off-field non-target arthropods needs to be
   further addressed for the use in orchards. The acute risk to earthworms
   from diazinon and the soil metabolites is low and long term studies are
   not considered necessary. However, the risk to earthworms and other soil
   macro-organisms from the more persistent metabolite G 27550 needs to be
   addressed for a full conclusion. The risk to soil micro-organisms,
   non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is
   considered to be low.}},

Abstract = {{1. An organism's ability to adjust its physiological traits to changes
   in environmental conditions is central for its ecological success.
   However, the effect of ecological interactions on physiological
   flexibility has rarely been investigated. Here we carry out a factorial
   experiment to analyse how food limitation (a potential result of
   competition) and tail loss (a potential result of sub-lethal predation)
   affect anatomical and physiological traits of the South American lizard
   Liolaemus nitidus.
   2. The size of several internal organs was affected by food
   availability. Small intestine mass increased with food consumption,
   allowing animals to keep constant digestibility at greater levels of
   digesta, which in turn permitted higher rates of food assimilation.
   Organs related to energy storage reached larger sizes in autotomized
   animals with high food availability, but tail regeneration rate after 3
   weeks did not change with food availability.
   3. Metabolic rate was affected by tail loss, and animals regenerating
   their tail showed higher metabolic rates than tailed ones. Because this
   increase in metabolic rate was independent of internal organ mass, a
   local effect of tail regeneration process (e.g. cell proliferation) on
   metabolic rate is suggested.
   4. When anatomical and metabolic data are jointly considered it follows
   that lizards adopt different physiological strategies, changing both
   energetic inputs and expenditures. This fact illustrates the complex
   interplay between ecological factors and physiological flexibility,
   which ultimately determine an organism's fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Ability to store resources that will be used for reproduction represents
   a potential life history adaptation because storage permits feeding and
   reproduction to be decoupled spatially and/or temporally. The two ends
   of a continuum involve acquiring all resources prior to reproduction
   (capital breeding) or acquiring all resources during the reproductive
   period (income breeding). Traditional life history theory examines
   tradeoffs between costs and benefits of such strategies, but this theory
   has not been integrated into life history studies of ants, even though
   founding queens have the analogous strategies of fully claustral
   (capital breeding) and semi-claustral (income breeding). This study
   demonstrates that facultatively semi-claustral queens of the
   seed-harvester ant Pogonomyrmex desertorum exhibit phenotypic plasticity
   during colony founding because unfed queens produced few, small minims,
   whereas ad libitum fed queens produced larger, heavier minims and
   additional brood. Fed queens also lost less mass than unfed queens
   despite their producing more brood. Overall, foraging provides queens
   with a suite of benefits that likely offset potential negative effects
   of foraging risk.
   Life history studies across a diverse array of taxa show that capital
   breeding is consistently associated with low availability and/or
   unpredictability of food, i.e., environmental conditions that favor
   prepackaging of reproductive resources. Such a broad and consistent
   pattern suggests that similar factors favored the evolution of fully
   claustral (capital breeding) colony founding in ants. Overall, these
   data suggest that ant researchers should revise their conventional view
   that fully claustral colony founding evolved because it eliminated the
   need for queens to leave the nest to forage. Instead, colony founding
   strategies should be examined from the perspective of environmental
   variation, i.e., availability and predictability of food. I also provide
   a functional scenario that could explain the evolution of colony
   founding strategies in ants.}},

Abstract = {{There has been considerable discussion of the factors that influence the
   hunting behaviour of male chimpanzees. Explanations invoking social
   benefits hinge upon the potential for males to share meat with sexually
   receptive females in exchange for mating ('meat for sex'), or to share
   meat with other males in exchange for social support ('male social
   bonding'). Ecological factors may also affect hunting: chimpanzees may
   hunt more frequently (1) in response to food shortages ('nutrient
   shortfall'); (2) when energy reserves are high ('nutrient surplus'); (3)
   in habitat types with good visibility and increased prey vulnerability;
   and/or (4) when ecological factors favour cooperative hunting. We used
   25 years of data on chimpanzees in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, to
   examine the relative importance of social and ecological factors in the
   decision to hunt red colobus monkeys, Colobus badius. The presence of
   sexually receptive females was associated with a significant decrease in
   hunting probability, suggesting that males face a trade-off between
   hunting and mating ('meat or sex' rather than `meat for sex'). Hunting
   by specific males did not vary with adult male party size, providing
   evidence against the male social-bonding hypothesis. After controlling
   for the effects of party size, diet quality was not associated with the
   probability of hunting or hunting successfully. Hunts were more likely
   to occur and to succeed in woodland and semideciduous forest than in
   evergreen forest, emphasizing the importance of visibility and prey
   mobility. Finally, per capita meat availability decreased with adult
   male party size, suggesting that hunting was not cooperative. These
   results provide evidence against social explanations for hunting in
   favour of more simple ecological alternatives. (c) 2006 The Association

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{649-656}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Current foraging models limit the decision-making process of animals to
   the food searching and consuming phase. The post-consummatory phase of
   feeding may influence optimal meal size for some species as a
   morphologic change often results from feeding. In snakes, a single prey
   item can lead to abrupt increases in body mass, thus influencing
   locomotor performance. Identifying factors affecting locomotor
   performance can help predict behaviors that should maximize an animal's
   chance of evading predators. Although many snakes ingest large
   percentages of their body mass, not much work has examined the
   post-consummatory effects of ingesting bulky prey differing in relative
   mass. I examined the locomotor performance and antipredator tactics of
   hatchling trinket snakes (Elaphe helena) after subjecting snakes to mice
   prey varying by relative mass differences of 20-35\%, 50-59\% or 70-79\%
   of an individual hatchling's body mass. Snakes in treatment groups were
   compared with snakes in a control group (0\%). Meal size-affected
   locomotor parameters such as burst speed, endurance, and endurance times
   for hatchlings that ingested 50-59\% and 70-79\% of their body mass (p <
   0.001). Recent feeding also affected the types of antipredator modes
   employed. Hatchlings in the 0\% and 20-35\% treatments exhibited
   behaviors that were categorized as active and threatening, while
   hatchlings in the 50-59\% and 70-79\% treatments exhibited stationary,
   neutral, and cryptic behaviors. Although snakes may become more
   reclusive following a meal, this study demonstrates that relative prey
   mass affects the ability of hatchling trinket snakes to flee from a
   predator. In turn, these results suggest that the post-consummatory
   effects of foraging should be considered in optimal foraging models for
   organisms that consume a substantial portion of their body mass during a
   single feeding.}},

   A high-energy diet entailed growth advantages only if predation risk did

   primarily the extension of the larval period. Predation risk influenced
   juvenile shape, most likely via the effects on growth and
   differentiation rates. Juvenile frogs emerging from predator
   environments had shorter legs and longer bodies than those from the
   nonpredator tanks. However, these morphological changes did not
   translate into differences in relative jumping performance. Neither

   average current velocity, and changes in the location of flow-induced
   vortices. In free-swimming individuals, this likely results in

   copepods. In comparison to seawater controls, DMS injections
   significantly increased the average number of tail-flaps per copepod

Abstract = {{Individuals with night eating syndrome (NES) display a time-delayed

   prevalence estimates have been reported among bariatric surgery
   candidates, and some evidence suggests that NES is positively associated

   follows a chronic course. In order to evaluate current NES theory, and
   the association between NES and bariatric surgery, literature searches
   were conducted to identify relevant literature published in English up
   to 2005. Because of inconsistencies in NES characterization, and
   significant heterogeneity in study design and methods, a qualitative
   assessment of NES and its relation to bariatric surgery was then
   undertaken. Within the literature, variable NES definitions highlight
   the distinct lack of clarity as to which behavioral features constitute
   a clinically meaningful entity. Prevalence estimates appear high among
   persons seeking bariatric surgery; however, no consistent pre- or
   postoperative demographic, clinical, or psychological factors reliably
   differentiate NES from non-NES. Further examination of the clinical
   significance, correlates, and course of NES in general and surgical
   samples is important, given the link with obesity. The ways in which NES
   departs from ``normal{''} eating behavior must be clarified. Behavioral

Abstract = {{Animals make economic decisions on where to feed based on balancing
   intake rates with the risk of starvation, When foraging, they must also
   manage time allocation to feeding, antipredator behaviour and resource
   guarding. These behaviours are usually believed to be mutually
   exclusive. The most intense foraging effort is predicted to occur in
   low-risk situations, while more antipredator behaviour is seen in
   high-risk situations. We studied the time allocation of individual
   light-bellied brent geese, Branta bermicla hrota, and the proportion of
   the flock engaged in foraging and vigilance behaviour in high- and
   low-risk habitats. Geese faced with a depleted resource in a low-risk
   intertidal situation responded by foraging in a higher-risk terrestrial
   habitat. Individual intake rates and levels of agonistic interactions
   were higher during terrestrial feeding, but group vigilance was
   maintained, with certain flock positions showing disproportionate levels
   of vigilance. In contrast to previous studies, agonistic interactions
   were more frequent when the geese were feeding on a nonpatchy resource,
   suggesting that different mechanisms drive agonistic encounters in
   different habitats. We discuss these results in the context of a growing
   population with limited resources. By remaining behaviourally plastic,
   the geese are able to adapt novel trade-off strategies to use

   expenditure. Copulation duration and number of ejaculations reliably
   predicted the amount of sperm transferred and both these behavioural
   measures positively covaried with female body size. These results
   indicate that male freshwater crayfish can modulate their sperm
   expenditure in accordance with cues that indicate female fecundity. In
   addition, a novel finding that emerged from this study is the decrease
   in sperm expenditure with male body size, which may either suggest that
   large, old male crayfish are better able than small males to economise
   sperm at a given mating to perform multiple matings during a
   reproductive season, or that they experience senescence of their
   reproductive performance.}},

Abstract = {{Low birthweight in relation to the length of gestation, is now known to

   plasticity during development, by which its structure and function can
   be permanently changed by the intra uterine and early post natal
   environment. Slow growth during infancy and rapid weight gain after the

   the beginning of the working day on the farm, during the feeding of the

Abstract = {{Yoldia hyperborea (Loven) is a protobranch bivalve of circumboreal
   distribution and an important bioturbator of muddy sediments of
   cold-water embayments in Newfoundland, Canada, where it is exposed to a
   strong seasonal input of sinking phytoplankton during spring, sporadic
   events of sediment resuspension, and sediment of low nutritional value
   during winter. To explain field-observed patterns of population
   dynamics, we quantified the behavioural response of Y. hyperborea to
   pulses of settling algae and sediment resuspension events, and
   hypothesised that Y. hyperborea behaviour is modified during settling of
   nutrient-rich organic matter. Yoldia hyperborea responded rapidly to the
   arrival of settling microalgae by extending its siphons into the water
   column. Once the pulse of algal material reached the sediment the
   animals partially emerged, extended the palp proboscides over the
   sediment surface and maintained close contact with the area of highest
   algal concentration. In contrast, the activity of animals not exposed to
   settling algae or to resuspended sediment was primarily restricted to
   strata below the sediment surface. Thus the predominant subsurface
   feeding behaviour of Yoldia hyperborea is switched to surface
   deposit-feeding as a response to cues contained in microalgae. Results
   suggest active suspension-feeding during algal sedimentation events,
   although deposit-feeding resumes once the algae are no longer in
   suspension, and suspension-feeding is probably of little nutritional
   significance. The rapid behavioural response of Y hyperborea to the
   influx of high quality food, such as fresh microalgae, is probably an
   adaptive foraging strategy to a food-limited environment and suggests
   higher bioturbation rates of surface sediments during spring, a key role
   being played by the protobranch in redistribution of labile
   phytodetritus within the benthos. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In cooperatively breeding species, parents may be assisted by other
   individuals to feed the young. How breeding parents react when they
   receive help is poorly understood. Evidence suggests that parents
   usually maintain their feeding effort when starvation of chicks is
   common, and reduce it when other risks such as predation are more
   important for chick survival, although some recent examples do not fit
   this pattern. In no case, however, have parents been found to increase
   their effort when they have helpers. We investigated this issue in a
   rarely studied cooperative breeder, the azure-winged magpie, Cyanopica
   cyanus. Breeders increased their provisioning rate when aided by
   helpers. However, chick starvation was rare and it was equally so in
   nests with and without helpers. The incidence of predation, conversely,
   was significantly lower in the presence of helpers. Helpers provisioned
   at a lower rate than parents but buffered the effect of adverse
   conditions in bad years in the nests they assisted. To our knowledge,
   these findings show for the first time that parents can increase their
   investment in the current brood in the presence of helpers, a result
   that does not seem to have been covered by current theory of cooperative
   breeding. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{In animals such as birds that are capable of adjusting energy reserves
   behaviourally in response to starvation risk and predation risk, mass is
   a measure of an individual's perception of the risks in its environment.
   Although it is often necessary to capture and handle animals to allow
   the scientific study of animal behaviour, little is known about how this
   affects the individual's perception of the risks in its environment or
   how this changes subsequent behaviour. In this study we remotely
   monitored the mass of individual wild great tits, Pants major, for 10
   days after capture, handling and release and then used
   starvation-predation risk trade-off theory to investigate how
   individuals perceived the risks in their environment. Mass increased
   significantly after capture and remained higher for 7 days before
   returning to precapture levels. We conclude that the capture and
   handling event was perceived as an interruption to foraging induced by
   an encounter with a predator which heightened starvation risk. Although
   this forced interruption to foraging was a relatively small proportion
   of available foraging time (< 6\%), the subsequent response produced a
   large (66\% of normal diurnal mass gain) and sustained change in mass.
   The results highlight the key role that foraging interruptions play in
   an individual's assessment of risks when trading off starvation against
   predation. They may also help to explain why some investigations of the
   effect of perceived predation risk on body mass in captive birds have
   produced inconsistent results. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of

Title = {{Behaviourally mediated indirect effects: interference competition
   increases predation mortality in foraging redshanks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{713-723}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The effect of competition for a limiting resource on the population
   dynamics of competitors is usually assumed to operate directly through
   starvation, yet may also affect survival indirectly through
   behaviourally mediated effects that affect risk of predation. Thus,
   competition can affect more than two trophic levels, and we aim here to
   provide an example of this.
   We show that the foraging success of redshanks Tringa totanus (L.)
   foraging on active prey was highest in the front of flocks, whereas this
   was not the case for redshanks foraging on inactive prey. Also, when
   foraging on active prey, foraging success in a flock decreased as more
   birds passed through a patch, while overall foraging success was not
   lower on subsequent visits to the same patch. Thus, redshanks foraging
   on active prey suffered from interference competition, whereas this was
   not the case for redshanks foraging on inactive prey.
   This interference competition led to differences in activity: redshanks
   attaining a lower foraging success had a higher walking rate. Greater
   activity was associated with wider flock spacing and shorter distances
   to cover, which has previously been shown to increase predation risk and
   mortality from sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus (L.).
   We conclude that behavioural adaptations of prey species can lead to
   interference competition in foraging redshanks, and thus can affect
   their predation risk and mortality through increased activity. This
   study is one of the first to show how interference competition can be a
   mechanism for behaviourally mediated indirect effects, and provides
   further evidence for the suggestion that a single species occupying an
   intermediate trophic level may be simultaneously top-down controlled by
   a predator and bottom-up controlled by a behavioural response of its
   prey.}},

Abstract = {{Food insecurity is a daily reality for hundreds of millions of people
   around the world. Although its most extreme manifestations are often
   obvious, many other households facing constraints in their access to
   food are less identifiable. Operational agencies lack a method for
   differentiating households at varying degrees of food insecurity in
   order to target and evaluate their interventions. This chapter provides
   an overview of a set of papers associated with a research initiative
   that seeks to identify more precise, yet simple, measures of household
   food insecurity. The overview highlights three main conceptual
   developments associated with practical approaches to measuring
   constraints in access to food: 1) a shift from using measures of food
   availability and utilization to measuring ``inadequate access{''}; 2) a
   shift from a focus on objective to subjective measures; and 3) a growing
   emphasis on fundamental measurement as opposed to reliance on distal,
   proxy measures. Further research is needed regarding 1) how well
   measures of household food insecurity designed for chronically
   food-insecure contexts capture the processes leading to, and experience
   of, acute food insecurity, 2) the impact of short-term shocks, such as
   major floods or earthquake, on household behaviors that determine
   responses to food security questions, 3) better measurement of the
   interaction between severity and frequency of household food insecurity
   behaviors, and 4) the determination of whether an individual's response
   to survey questions can be representative of the food insecurity
   experiences of all members of the household.}},

Abstract = {{A central issue in predator-prey interactions is how predator associated
   chemical cues affect the behaviour and life history of prey. In this
   study, we investigated how growth and behaviour during ontogeny of a
   damselfly larva (Coenagrion hastulatum) in high and low food
   environments was affected by the diet of a predator (Aeshna juncea). We
   reared larvae in three different predator treatments; no predator,
   predator feeding on conspecifics and predator feeding on
   heterospecifics. We found that, independent of food availability, larvae
   displayed the strongest anti-predator behaviours where predators
   consumed prey conspecifics. Interestingly, the effect of predator diet
   on prey activity was only present early in ontogeny, whereas late in
   ontogeny no difference in prey activity between treatments could be
   found. In contrast, the significant effect of predator diet on prey
   spatial distribution was unaffected by time. Larval size was affected by
   both food availability and predator diet. Larvae reared in the high food
   treatment grew larger than larvae in the low food treatment. Mean larval
   size was smallest in the treatment where predators consumed prey
   conspecifics, intermediate where predators consumed heterospecifics and
   largest in the treatment without predators. The difference in mean
   larval size between treatments is probably an effect of reduced larval
   feeding, due to behavioural responses to chemical cues associated with
   predator diet. Our study suggests that anti-predator responses can be
   specific for certain stages in ontogeny. This finding shows the
   importance of considering where in its ontogeny a study organism is
   before results are interpreted and generalisations are made.
   Furthermore, this finding accentuates the importance of long-term
   studies and may have implications for how results generated by
   short-term studies can be used.}},

Abstract = {{The memory deficits induced by cannabinoid agonists have been found in
   several behavioral paradigms. Nevertheless, there is evidence that not
   all types of memory are impaired after cannabinoid administration. The
   aim of this study was to investigate whether the cannabinoid agonist WIN
   55212-2 (WIN) is able to influence the acquisition of fear conditioning
   using tone and contextual versions. For tone-fear conditioning, male
   Wistar rats were placed in the conditioning chamber and after 3 min, a
   sound (CS) was presented for 10s that terminated with a 1-s electric
   footshock (1.5 mA). For contextual-fear conditioning, a similar
   procedure was used but no sound was presented. Twenty-four hours after,
   the animals were re-exposed to the respective CS (tone or conditioning
   chamber) and the freezing behavior was registered. A subsequent
   experiment investigated a possible state-dependent effect of WIN by
   administering WIN or control solution 30 min before conditioning and
   before testing. WIN (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg) administered i.p. 30 min before
   impaired contextual fear conditioning but did not modify the freezing
   behavior elicited by tone presentation. These animals did not show any
   state-dependent effects of WIN. Further, the impaired contextual
   conditioning was prevented by preadministration of SRI41716A (1.0 mg/kg,
   i.p.) or SRI47778 (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.), selective cannabinoid CB I receptor
   antagonists. The present findings highlight that cannabinoid agonists
   effects are selective for the hippocampus-dependent aversive memories in
   rats. This effect appears to be related to the activation of CB1
   cannabinoid receptors and confirms that cannabinoids might provide a
   novel approach for the treatment of unpleasant memories. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{Wild-caught animals are often given a settling in period before
   experimental trials are initiated. We used wild-caught chaffinches
   (Fringilla coelebs) to investigate (a) the effect of settling in period
   duration on the likelihood that chaffinches foraged during experimental
   trials and (b) whether settling in period duration influenced measures
   of foraging and vigilance behaviour recorded from those experiments. The
   probability of collecting foraging data from an individual's first trial
   fell below 50\% if it had been in captivity for more than 12 days prior
   to that trial, whereas the probability was > 75\% if trials were
   completed within two days of capture. The successful collection of
   foraging data from subsequent trials was also dependent on the number of
   days an individual spent in captivity prior to its first trial and on
   whether that individual foraged in its first trial, suggesting that some
   individuals were more inclined to forage in captivity. Individuals that
   foraged in their first trial had a 94\% higher success rate in
   subsequent trials than those that did not. However, settling in period
   duration did not significantly influence the peck rate, mean search
   period or mean vigilance period of individuals that did forage. Our
   results show that allowing a settling in period actually reduced the
   likelihood of collecting foraging data from chaffinches and that
   commencing experiments shortly after capture increased data collection
   efficiency. We discuss the possibility that the inability to collect
   data from certain birds following a settling in period could lead to
   potentially important biases in results. particularly if propensity to
   forage is linked to an individual's coping strategy or personality. We
   conclude that it may not always be beneficial to allow wild-caught
   animals to habituate to captivity before commencing experiments. In some
   cases, testing animals soon after capture may increase the likelihood of
   data collection, reducing both the number of study animals required and
   the length of time they spend in captivity.}},

   movements to minimize contact with predators and exhibit fidelity to
   seasonal ranges. We examined fidelity behaviour within season and among
   years of woodland caribou based on locations of 65 radio-collared
   individuals in British Columbia, Canada. We used average linear
   distances between all possible pairs of radiolocations of individuals to
   assess fidelity. Among-year interlocation distances were similar to
   within-season interlocation distances during summer, indicating that
   caribou did not shift their distribution during seasons when they were
   most vulnerable to predation. Among-year interlocation distances were
   significantly greater than within-season interlocation distances during
   both early winter and late winter, indicating that individual caribou
   shifted their distribution among winters. The amount that an
   individual's distribution shifted among winters varied among and within
   individuals over different years. During early winter this behavioural
   plasticity was correlated with snow accumulation, with individuals
   having greater interlocation distances in years with high snow
   accumulation. Our results indicate that site fidelity outside the

Abstract = {{Nematodes represent a very abundant group of soil organisms and

   overview and critically assess methods and approaches for researching
   soil nematode ecotoxicology. In natural ecosystems, nematode abundance
   and community structure analyses were proved to be sensitive indicators
   of stress caused by soil pollutants and ecological disturbance.
   Community structure analyses may be approached from a functional or
   ecological point of view; species are divided into groups according to
   their feeding habits or alternatively the maturity index is calculated
   according to their ecological strategy. Many environmental factors have
   the potential to affect nematode community, which consequently results
   in high space and time variability. This variance is major handicap in
   field ecotoxicological studies because pollutant-nematode relationships
   are obscured. For prospective risk assessment of chemicals, several
   toxicity tests with nematodes were developed and are increasingly used.
   Sensitivity of these tests is comparable to tests with other soil
   species (e.g. enchytraeids, earthworms and springtails) while tests are
   less demanding to space and time. Most studies have focused on metal
   toxicity but organic compounds are almost overlooked. Endpoints used in
   tests were often mortality, reproduction or movement, but more sublethal
   endpoints such as feeding or biomarkers have been used recently too.
   Although there is an increasing amount of knowledge in soil nematode
   ecotoxicology, there is still a lot of various issues in this topic to
   research. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It is becoming increasingly clear that conditions experienced during
   embryonic development can be of major importance for traits subsequent
   to parturition or hatching. For example, in mammals, offspring from
   stressed mothers show a variety of changes in behavioural,
   morphological, and life-history traits. The effects of maternal stress
   on trait development are believed to be mediated via transfer of
   glucocorticoids, the main hormones released during the stress response,
   from mother to offspring. However, also other physiological maternal
   responses during stress could be responsible for changes in offspring
   phenotype. We investigated the direct effects of corticosterone on
   offspring development, without other confounding factors related to
   increased maternal stress, by injection of corticosterone in eggs of the
   ovoviviparous lizard Lacerta vivipara. Corticosterone-manipulated
   offspring did not show impaired development, reduced body size or body
   condition at parturition. However, corticosterone-treated offspring
   showed altered anti-predator behaviour, as measured by the time required
   to emerge from shelter after a simulated predator attack. Differential
   steroid exposure during development, possibly mediated by maternal
   stress response, may explain some of the variation in behaviour among
   individuals in natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. Little is known about how physical activity (PA), sedentary
   behavior, and various adolescent health risk behaviors are associated.
   The objective of this study was to examine relationships between PA and
   sedentary behavior patterns and an array of risk behaviors, including
   leading causes of adolescent morbidity/ mortality.
   METHODS. Nationally representative self-reported data were collected (
   National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health; wave I: 1994 - 1995;
   II: 1996; N = 11 957). Previously developed and validated cluster
   analyses identified 7 homogeneous groups of adolescents sharing PA and
   sedentary behaviors. Poisson regression predicted the relative risk of
   health risk behaviors, other weekly activities, and self-esteem across
   the 7 PA/sedentary behavior clusters controlling for demographics and
   socioeconomic status. Main outcome measures were adolescent risk
   behaviors (eg, truancy, cigarette smoking, sexual intercourse,
   delinquency), other weekly activities ( eg, work, academic performance,
   sleep), self-esteem.
   RESULTS. Relative to high television ( TV) and video viewers,
   adolescents in clusters characterized by skating and video gaming, high
   overall sports and sports participation with parents, using neighborhood
   recreation center, strict parental control of TV, reporting few
   activities overall, and being active in school were less likely to
   participate in a range of risky behaviors, ranging from an adjusted risk
   ratio (ARR) of 0.42 ( outcome: illegal drug use, cluster: strict
   parental control of TV) to 0.88 ( outcome: violence, cluster: sports
   with parents). Active teens were less likely to have low self-esteem (
   eg, adolescents engaging in sports with parents, ARR: 0.73) and more
   likely to have higher grades ( eg, active in school, ARR: 1.20).
   CONCLUSIONS. Participation in a range of PA-related behaviors,
   particularly those characterized by high parental sports/exercise
   involvement, was associated with favorable adolescent risk profiles.
   Adolescents with high TV/video viewership were less likely to have
   positive risk behavior outcomes. Enhancing opportunities for PA and
   sport may have a beneficial effect on leading adolescent risk behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Trait anger has been shown to predict coronary heart disease;
   however, there are no prior studies evaluating anger as a risk factor
   for type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study was to determine if
   anger proneness predicted type 2 diabetes using prospective analyses.
   Methods: We analyzed data on trait anger, assessed by questionnaire, in
   a longitudinal, bi-racial cohort study of 11,615 initially non-diabetic
   adults aged 48-67, who were subsequently followed for 6 years for the
   development of type 2 diabetes.
   Results: There was no relation between overall trait anger and the
   subsequent risk of diabetes; however, individuals in the highest tertile
   of trait anger temperament scores had a 34\% increased risk of
   developing diabetes compared to those in the lowest tertile (Relative
   hazard {[}RH]=1.34; 95\% confidence interval: 1.10, 1.62), following
   adjustment for age, race, gender, and education. The relation between
   anger temperament and diabetes remained significant following adjustment
   for behavioral factors (smoking, physical activity, and caloric intake)
   (RH = 1.31; 95\% Cl: 1.08, 1.60) but was non-significant after
   additional adjustment for waist-to-hip ratio and body-mass index (RH =
   1.18; 95\% Cl: 0.97, 1.44).
   Conclusions: While we found no relation between overall trait anger and
   incident diabetes, persons who had higher anger temperament subscale
   scores had a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes, which was
   largely explained by adiposity. Anger temperament may deserve further
   attention as a potential risk factor for type 2 diabetes. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{There is a large body of evidence indicating that predator behavior may
   strongly influence patterns and processes at the population and

   sit-and-wait predators, especially when relocation is rare. Although
   several review articles dealt with these issues in web-building spiders,

   owing to a variety of constraints such as physiological constraints or
   difficulties in assessing site quality, site selection and relocation
   are not necessarily optimal and thus food intake rate is not maximized.
   We call for a multi-factorial study on a single species in order to
   pinpoint the dominant factors and to assess to what extent they

Abstract = {{Plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) offer plants chemical defences

   investigate feeding patterns of a marsupial folivore, the common
   ringtail possum, Pseudocheirus peregrinus (Boddaert 1785). Foliage,

   Results demonstrate important behavioural changes in foraging patterns

Abstract = {{Measuring patch use of a forager can reveal not only its cost and

   affected by the availability of water and (4) determined the nutritional
   relationship between food resources and water. Nubian ibex had lower
   GUDs and used resources patches more intensively where water was
   available, the food quality was higher and the location was closer to
   the escape terrain. Nubian ibex showed an expanding specialist diet
   selection when exploiting resource patches with a mix of items that

Abstract = {{Sexual conflict occurs when individuals of one sex express traits that
   reduce the fitness of individuals of the other sex. In many poeciliid
   fish, males harass females for copulations, which is thought to reduce
   female fitness by lowering foraging efficiency and increasing predation
   risk, energetic expenditure and the likelihood of disease transmission.
   Mating may also be costly for males, who often engage in aggressive
   interactions with other males in addition to expending energy pursuing
   females. We examined the effects of three operational sex ratios on male
   behaviour, female fitness and male body condition in the western
   mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, during a 10-week experiment. Despite a
   significant reduction in male harassment, female growth and reproductive
   success decreased as the proportion of females increased. Results
   suggest that increases in female density had a strong, negative effect
   on female fitness, overwhelming any potential costs of male harassment.
   Aggressive behaviour between males increased and male copulation rate
   decreased as the proportion of males increased, suggesting that
   operational sex ratio influences the number of copulations that a male
   attempts by altering the frequency of agonistic interactions with other
   males and the number of females available to mate. We did not detect a
   difference in male body condition between treatments. Sources of female

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{332-372}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Human beings may affect the welfare of fish through fisheries,
   aquaculture and a number of other activities. There is no agreement on
   just how to weigh the concern for welfare of fish against the human
   interests involved, but ethical frameworks exist that suggest how this
   might be approached.
   Different definitions of animal welfare focus on an animal's condition,
   on its subjective experience of that condition and/or on whether it can
   lead a natural life. These provide different, legitimate, perspectives,
   but the approach taken in this paper is to focus on welfare as the
   absence of suffering.
   An unresolved and controversial issue in discussions about animal
   welfare is whether non-human animals exposed to adverse experiences such
   as physical injury or confinement experience what humans would call
   suffering. The neocortex, which in humans is an important part of the
   neural mechanism that generates the subjective experience of suffering,
   is lacking in fish and non-mammalian animals, and it has been argued
   that its absence in fish indicates that fish cannot suffer. A strong
   alternative view, however, is that complex animals with sophisticated
   behaviour, such as fish, probably have the capacity for suffering,
   though this may be different in degree and kind from the human
   experience of this state.
   Recent empirical studies support this view and show that painful stimuli
   are, at least, strongly aversive to fish. Consequently, injury or
   experience of other harmful conditions is a cause for concern in terms
   of welfare of individual fish. There is also growing evidence that fish
   can experience fear-like states and that they avoid situations in which
   they have experienced adverse conditions.
   Human activities that potentially compromise fish welfare include
   anthropogenic changes to the environment, commercial fisheries,
   recreational angling, aquaculture, ornamental fish keeping and
   scientific research. The resulting harm to fish welfare is a cost that
   must be minimized and weighed against the benefits of the activity
   concerned.
   Wild fish naturally experience a variety of adverse conditions, from
   attack by predators or conspecifics to starvation or exposure to poor
   environmental conditions. This does not make it acceptable for humans to
   impose such conditions on fish, but it does suggest that fish will have
   mechanisms to cope with these conditions and reminds us that pain
   responses are in some cases adaptive (for example, suppressing feeding
   when injured).
   In common with all vertebrates, fish respond to environmental challenges
   with a series of adaptive neuro-endocrine adjustments that are
   collectively termed the stress response. These in turn induce reversible
   metabolic and behavioural changes that make the fish better able to
   overcome or avoid the challenge and are undoubtedly beneficial, in the
   short-term at least.
   In contrast, prolonged activation of the stress response is damaging and
   leads to immuno-suppression, reduced growth and reproductive
   dysfunction. Indicators associated with the response to chronic stress
   (physiological endpoints, disease status and behaviour) provide a
   potential source of information on the welfare status of a fish. The
   most reliable assessment of well-being will be obtained by examining a
   range of informative measures and statistical techniques are available
   that enable several such measures to be combined objectively.
   A growing body of evidence tells us that many human activities can harm
   fish welfare, but that the effects depend on the species and
   life-history stage concerned and are also context-dependent. For
   example, in aquaculture, adverse effects related to stocking density may
   be eliminated if good water quality is maintained. At low densities, bad
   water quality may be less likely to arise whereas social interactions
   may cause greater welfare problems.
   A number of key differences between fish and birds and mammals have
   important implications for their welfare. Fish do not need to fuel a
   high body temperature, so the effects of food deprivation on welfare are
   not so marked. For species that live naturally in large shoals, low
   rather than high densities may be harmful. On the other hand, fish are
   in intimate contact with their environment through the huge surface area
   of their gills, so they are vulnerable to poor water quality and water
   borne pollutants.
   Extrapolation between taxa is dangerous and general frameworks for
   ensuring welfare in other vertebrate animals need to be modified before
   they can be usefully applied to fish.
   The scientific study of fish welfare is at an early stage compared with
   work on other vertebrates and a great deal of what we need to know is
   yet to be discovered. It is clearly the case that fish, though different
   from birds and mammals, however, are sophisticated animals, far removed
   from unfeeling creatures with a 15 s memory of popular misconception. A
   heightened appreciation of these points in those who exploit fish and in
   those who seek to protect them would go a long way towards improving
   fish welfare.}},

Abstract = {{Bayesian decision theory can be used to model animal behaviour. In this
   paper we give an overview of the theoretical concepts in such models. We
   also review the biological contexts in which Bayesian models have been
   applied, and outline some directions where future studies would be
   useful. Bayesian decision theory, when applied to animal behaviour, is
   based on the assumption that the individual has some sort of ``prior
   opinion{''} of the possible states of the world. This may, for example,
   be a previously experienced distribution of qualities of food patches,
   or qualities of potential mates. The animal is then assumed to be able
   use sampling information to arrive at a ``posterior opinion{''},
   concerning e.g. the quality of a given food patch, or the average
   qualities of mates in a year. A correctly formulated Bayesian model
   predicts how animals may combine previous experience with sampling
   information to make optimal decisions. We argue that the assumption that
   animals may have ``prior opinions{''} is reasonable. Their priors may
   come from one or both of two sources: either from their own individual
   experience, gained while sampling the environment, or from an adaptation
   to the environment experienced by previous generations. This means that
   we should often expect to see ``Bayesian-like{''} decision-making in

Abstract = {{Inter-individual variation in levels of sex hormones results from
   differences in genetic, developmental, and environmental factors. We
   tested a hypothesis that programming of the fetal neuroendocrine axis
   may predispose some women to produce higher levels of steroid hormones
   during their menstrual cycles as adults. One hundred forty-five
   regularly menstruating 24- to 36-year-old women collected daily saliva
   samples for one menstrual cycle. Data on women's birth weights and birth
   lengths were obtained from medical records. A positive relationship was
   observed between ponderal index at birth (an indicator of nutritional
   status, calculated as birth weight/(birth length)(3)) and levels of
   estradiol (E2) in menstrual cycles, after controlling for potential
   confounding factors. Mean E2 was 16.4 pmol/l in the low ponderal index
   tertile, 17.3 pmol/l in the moderate ponderal index tertile, and 19.6
   pmol/l in the high ponderal index tertile (the high ponderal index group
   had significantly higher E2 than both low and moderate ponderal index
   groups, P = 0.0001). This study shows a positive association between
   ponderal index recorded for women at birth and levels of E2 measured
   during their menstrual cycles as adults. This suggests that conditions
   during fetal life influence adult production of reproductive hormones
   and may contribute to inter-individual variation in reproductive
   function. In addition, because large size at birth is one of the factors
   linked with an increased risk of breast cancer, our findings provide a
   physiological link for the observed positive relationship between
   indicators of energetic conditions during fetal growth and breast cancer
   in women.}},

   Vuillefroy fed three diets (tadpoles, Odonata nymphs, and

   marginally significant in mid-femur length, showing developmental
   patterns of these traits varied among food types. None of the
   interactions were significant in angle of the claw. A predation

   one-claw nymphs (adult type) as a treatment. Double-claw nymphs
   successfully caught both large and small tadpoles, whereas one-claw
   nymphs caught small tadpoles more frequently than large tadpoles. Our

   Without grazers and with a sufficient substrate supply, bacteria grew
   mainly in the form of medium-sized rods (4 to 7 mu m), with a smaller

   bacterivorous flagellate Ochromonas sp. showed that freely suspended

   cells were resistant to grazing and became enriched during predation. A
   comparison of long-term growth in carbon-limited chemostats with and
   without grazers revealed that strikingly different bacterial populations
   developed: treatments with flagellates were composed of > 80\%
   filamentous cells. These attained a biomass comparable to that of

Abstract = {{In temperate regions, winter presents animals with a number of
   challenges including depressed food abundance, increased daily energy
   requirements, higher frequency of extreme weather events and shortened
   day length. Overcoming these constraints is critical for overwintering
   survival and scheduling of future breeding of long-lived species and is
   likely to be state dependent, associated with intrinsic abilities such
   as food acquisition rates. We examined the relationship between
   environmental and intrinsic factors on overwintering foraging and
   subsequent breeding phenology of the European shag Phalacrocorax
   aristotelis, a diurnal marine predator. We tested a range of hypotheses
   relating to overwintering foraging time and location. We found that
   individuals greatly increased their foraging time in winter to a peak of
   more than 90\% of available daylight at the winter solstice. The
   seasonal patterns of foraging time appear to be driven by a combination
   of light levels and weather conditions and may be linked to the
   availability of the shag's principal prey, the lesser sandeel Ammodytes
   marinus. There was no evidence that shags dispersed south in winter to
   increase potential foraging time. Foraging time decreased after the
   winter solstice and, crucially, was correlated with subsequent breeding
   phenology, such that individuals that spent less time foraging in
   February bred earlier. The relationship was much stronger in females
   than males, in line with their more direct control of timing of
   breeding. Our results demonstrate that pre-breeding intrinsic foraging
   ability is critical in determining breeding phenology.}},

Abstract = {{Most species reproduce seasonally, even in the tropics where activity
   occurs year-round. Squamate reptiles provide ideal model organisms to
   clarify the ultimate (adaptive) reasons for the restriction of
   reproduction to specific times of year. Females of almost all
   temperate-zone reptile species produce their eggs or offspring in the
   warmest time of the year, thereby synchronizing embryogenesis with high
   ambient temperatures. However, although tropical reptiles are freed from
   this thermal constraint, most do not reproduce year-round. Seasonal
   reproduction in tropical reptiles might be driven by biotic factors
   (e.g., peak periods of predation on eggs or hatchlings, or food for
   hatchlings) or abiotic factors (e.g., seasonal availability of suitably
   moist incubation conditions). Keelback snakes (Tropidonophis mairii,
   Colubridae) in tropical Australia reproduce from April to November, but
   with a major peak in May-June. Our field studies falsify hypotheses that
   invoke biotic factors as explanations for this pattern: the timing of
   nesting does not minimize predation on eggs, nor maximize food
   availability or survival rates for hatchlings. Instead, our data
   implicate abiotic factors: female keelbacks nest most intensely soon
   after the cessation of monsoonal rains when soils are moist enough to
   sustain optimal embryogenesis (wetter nests produce larger hatchlings,
   that are more likely to survive) but are unlikely to become waterlogged
   (which is lethal to eggs). Thus, abiotic factors may favor seasonal
   reproduction in tropical as well as temperate-zone. animals.}},

Abstract = {{Female sand tilefish (Malacanthus plumieri) inhabiting a deep channel in
   the fringing reef at Glover's Atoll, Belize (channel females) spawned
   planktonic eggs more frequently than those occupying the shallow
   sand-rubble slopes adjacent to patch coral reefs inside the atoll lagoon
   (reef-slope females). We tested five non-exclusive hypotheses to explain
   habitat differences in female spawning frequency. We found no evidence
   that spawning frequency variation was a consequence of differences in
   food availability, variation in male fertility, or the intensity of
   predation on spawned eggs. On reef slopes, barracuda stalked tilefish
   near their benthic burrows, whereas these piscivores attacked channel
   tilefish by diving suddenly from higher in the water column. Differences
   in the hunting behavior of barracuda suggested that the behavior of
   tilefish females might be influenced by temporal variation in predation
   risk (risk allocation hypothesis). Consistent with this hypothesis,
   reef-slope females had a much higher frequency of retreats to burrows in
   response to barracuda, spent more time burrowing and ventured less far
   from these refugia in response to a simulated predatory threat. As
   predicted by the risk allocation hypothesis, reef-slope females also had
   lower and more variable frequencies of foraging bites, and shorter and
   more variable travel distances to forage than channel females. Estimated
   mortality from predation was over nine times higher in channel tilefish.
   Consistent with the hypothesis that investment in current vs. future
   reproduction is influenced by rates of adult mortality (mortality risk
   hypothesis), channel females invested more supplemental energy in egg
   production whereas reef-slope females invested more in growth. Our
   results indicate that behavioral and life-history traits of female
   tilefish show phenotypic plasticity depending upon the nature and

Journal = {{MAMMAL REVIEW}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-16}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Trade-off theory has been extensively used to further our
   understanding of animal behaviour. In mammalian herbivores, it has been
   used to advance our understanding of their reproductive, parental care
   and foraging strategies. Here, we detail how trade-off theory can be
   applied to herbivore-parasite interactions, especially in foraging
   environments.
   2. Foraging is a common mode of uptake of parasites that represent the
   most pervasive challenge to mammalian fitness and survival. Hosts are
   hypothesized to alter their foraging behaviour in the presence of
   parasites in three ways: (i) hosts avoid foraging in areas that are
   contaminated with parasites; (ii) hosts select diets that increase their
   resistance and resilience to parasites; and (iii) hosts select for foods
   with direct anti-parasitic properties (self-medication). We concentrate
   on the mammalian herbivore literature to detail the recent advances made
   using trade-off frameworks to understand the mechanisms behind
   host-parasite interactions in relation to these three hypotheses.
   3. In natural systems, animals often face complex foraging decisions
   including nutrient intake vs. predation risk, nutrient intake vs.
   sheltering and nutrient intake vs. parasite risk trade-offs. A trade-off
   framework is detailed that can be used to interpret mammal behaviour in
   complex environments, and may be used to advance the self-medication
   hypothesis.
   4. The use of trade-off theory has advanced our understanding of the
   contact process between grazing mammalian hosts and their parasites
   transmitted via the faecal-oral route. Experimental manipulation of the
   costs and benefits of a nutrient intake vs. parasite risk trade-off has
   shown that environmental conditions (forage quality and quantity) and
   the physiological state (parasitic and immune status) of a mammalian
   host can both affect the behavioural decisions of foraging animals.
   5. Naturally occurring trade-offs and the potential to manipulate their
   costs and benefits enables us to identify the abilities and behavioural
   rules used by mammals when making decisions in complex environments and
   thus predict animal behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{For newly settled coral reef fishes, survival advantages may be

   bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum recruits were collected
   immediately after settlement from reefs in the upper Florida Keys, USA,
   and transported to the laboratory for experimental analysis.
   Quantification of swimming capabilities was coupled with otolith
   analysis to identify early life history traits associated with swimming
   performance, Fish with the highest critical swimming speeds were those
   that grew faster as larvae, had shorter pelagic larval durations, and
   were smaller at settlement, although these individuals represented only
   10\% of the total sample. To further investigate condition-associated
   behaviors, a feeding treatment established fish of 2 different condition
   levels for comparison. Recruits fed for 1 wk at higher levels grew
   faster, had greater standardized weight (Fulton's condition factor), and
   swam faster than food-deprived recruits. In additional behavioral
   trials, high condition recruits evaded a simulated predator threat at
   faster speeds than the low condition recruits. High condition fish also
   exhibited less risk-taking behavior by sheltering more in the presence
   of a predator threat and consuming less food. For both high and low
   condition recruits, the number that sought shelter increased and food
   consumption rates decreased in the presence of a predator threat. These
   results link early life history traits and physiology with associated

Abstract = {{The large temporal and spatial variability in marine productivity
   encountered by marine predators may negatively influence breeding
   success. The Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella (AFS), a marine
   predator in the Southern Ocean (SO) ecosystem with a circumpolar
   distribution, exhibits a short, 4 mo lactation coinciding with increased
   summer marine productivity. The diet of AFS, and the distance to
   significant and productive oceanographic features, such as the Antarctic
   Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ), varies considerably between populations. We
   studied the foraging activity, foraging efficiency and the pup
   provisioning strategies of lactating AFS at a key breeding site in the
   southern Indian Ocean, the Kerguelen Archipelago. Foraging parameters
   were examined in relation to interannual variability in oceanographic
   conditions and prey availability in the PFZ over 3 consecutive breeding
   seasons (1998 to 2000). The location of foraging zones, diving activity,
   diet and foraging efficiency varied significantly between years,
   concurrently with annual changes in sea-surface temperature (SST) and
   prey availability. The strongest recorded El Nino Southern Oscillation
   event in 1997-1998 coincided with anomalously warm waters in the
   vicinity of the Archipelago. Deeper diving by females, reduced maternal
   and pup body condition, and minimal pup growth rates and low catch per
   unit effort of the primary prey species, lanternfishes (Myctophidae)
   were all recorded in this period. Maternal size was positively related
   to the growth performance of pups only in this period, indicating the
   importance of age/size and/or experience in mediating environmental
   fluctuations. Foraging efficiency over a foraging cycle and variability

   increasing frequency of anomalously warm SST events in sectors of the
   SO, however, may elicit specific behavioural responses from `central
   place foragers' (i.e. species that return to breeding sites to feed
   their young) to avoid sustained poor body condition of females and their

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2006}},

Pages = {{165-172}},
Abstract = {{Wildlife feeding has become an integral part of the range of activities
   offered to protected area visitors. In marine protected areas (MPAs),
   fish feeding may cause changes in the behavior, and thus the density and
   distribution, of coastal fish species. We evaluated spatial variability
   in human-positive fish behavior around the Ustica Island MPA (Italy) and
   the potential indirect effects of behavioral change on other species.
   Two mensurative experiments demonstrated that ca. 1/3 of the species
   present in fish-feeding areas exhibited human-positive behavior, losing
   instinctive fear in the presence of humans and encircling people in the
   water even when food was not provided. A manipulative experiment
   demonstrated that this behavioral response was learned rapidly.
   Damselfishes were negatively affected by the unnatural aggregation of a
   labrid species, as these aggregations frequently attacked and destroyed
   the benthic nests of the damselfish. Thus, fish feeding can have both
   direct and indirect effects. Therefore the MPA management goals need to
   be explicitly stated on a case-by-case basis. If the aim of a reserve is
   only to promote awareness of marine life and the benefits of
   conservation to the public, activities such as fish feeding may be
   regarded as desirable, since the human-positive behavior brought about
   by this activity guarantees a visual spectacle for visitors.
   Fish-feeding locations, however, cannot be regarded as natural and may
   reduce the effectiveness of a reserve for scientific research.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Eating in the absence of hunger (EAH) may be a behavioral
   trait through which obesity-promoting genes promote positive energy
   balance. The primary aim of this study was to compare children born at
   high vs. low risk for obesity with respect to EAH at 5 years of age.
   Research Methods and Procedures: This was an observational investigation
   of families enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania and The
   Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Infant Growth Study. Five-year-old
   children born at high (N = 28) or low (N = 25) risk for obesity on the
   basis of maternal prepregnancy body weight were evaluated at a
   hospital-based laboratory. Children consumed 11 snack foods ad libitum
   after consuming an ad libitum dinner and reporting fullness. Parents
   reported on snack foods at home and their own eating styles. Nutritive
   sucking at 3 months of age was evaluated by computerized apparatus.
   Results: EAH in high-risk boys (mean +/- standard error = 326 +/- 66 kJ]
   was more than twice that of low-risk boys (mean +/- standard error = 151
   +/- 39 kJ), p = 0.03. Among girls, there was a trend for EAH to be
   associated with increased parental limitations on daughter snack food
   consumption at home (p = 0.06). EAH was unrelated to 3-month sucking
   behavior.
   Discussion: Genes that promote childhood obesity may partially exert
   their influence through EAH, an effect that was limited to boys born at
   risk for obesity. The unique influences of genes and home environment on
   this trait should be disaggregated in subsequent studies.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the many features that the behaviour of the standard particle
   swarm algorithm shares with grouping behaviour in animals (e.g. social
   attraction and communication between individuals), this biologically
   inspired technique has been mainly used in classical optimisation
   problems (i.e. finding the optimal value in a fitness landscape). We
   present here a novel application for particle swarms: the simulation of
   group-foraging in animals. Animals looking for food sources are modelled
   as particles in a swarm moving over an abstract food landscape. The
   particles are guided to the food by a smell (or aura), which surrounds
   it and whose intensity is proportional to the amount of food available.
   The results show that this new extended version of the algorithm
   produces qualitatively realistic behaviour. For example, the simulation
   shows the emergence of group-foraging behaviour among particles.}},

Abstract = {{While prisoner's dilemma has frequently been used in studies of animal
   behavior, past work in the area fails to address the question of
   differential utility. As animals' needs change, their behavior also
   changes. A hungry animal may be less likely to cooperate than a full
   one. In this study an abstract species is modelled using an energy
   balance computation that assigns a state of hungry, full, or neither to
   a given animal together with a modified finite state representation for
   a prisoner's dilemma strategy that implements distinct but linked
   strategies for each possible state. The strategy used is conditioned on
   the animal's current hunger state. An evolutionary algorithm is used to
   generate effective strategies for this deterministic form of
   differential utility prisoner's dilemma. A tool called fingerprinting is
   used to document the strategies that arise. It is shown that the
   strategies that arise for the three possible hunger states have
   different distributions in a catalog of strategies found in other
   prisoner's dilemma runs and also differ from a baseline experiment in
   which agents are evolved to play prisoner's dilemma without any form of
   differential utility.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Primary alexithymia has been proposed as a trait-like risk
   factor for various psychiatric disorders. Alternatively, secondary
   alexithymia has been conceptualized as an inadequate coping reaction to
   a stressful situation. This study investigated the level and the type of
   alexithymia associated with occupational stress. Method. On 2 occasions,
   69 patients with work-related stress and 62 healthy participants
   completed self-report instruments to measure alexithymia (20-item
   Toronto Alexithymia Scale), burnout complaints (Maslach Burnout
   Inventory) and general distress complaints (Depression Anxiety Stress
   Scales, Checklist Individual Strength). Group differences in alexithymia
   were analyzed using ANOVAs. The type of alexithymia was investigated by
   (a) determining absolute and relative stability, (b) exploring state
   dependence by adjusting alexithymia for burnout and distress complaints
   and (c) associating recovery of complaints with change in alexithymia.
   Results: Alexithymia was significantly elevated among patients. In the
   patient group, absolute stability of two alexithymia dimensions
   (identifying feelings, describing feelings) and relative stability of
   one alexithymia dimension (identifying feelings) was lower than in the
   healthy group. Cross-sectional group differences became small and
   nonsignificant after adjustment for distress complaints. Among patients,
   change in alexithymia was moderately associated with symptom recovery.
   Conclusion: Elevated alexithymia among patients with occupational stress
   is highly state dependent, which indicates the presence of secondary
   alexithymia. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental enrichment falls into four general categories: foraging
   opportunities, structural complexity, sensory stimulation/novelty, and
   social companionship. Each may have distinct behavioural effects. We
   examined the use of these four enrichment types, and their effects on
   activity budgets (foraging, general activity, pacing), social proximity
   preference (time spent observing companions through a window), and fear
   (flight distance in a predator surprise test, consumption of novel food)
   in adult Japanese quail. Foraging and structural enrichments were used
   extensively (29 and 26\% of scans, respectively), as were the dustbaths
   available in all pens (16\%). Use of enrichments and the dustbath was
   consistent over 24 h and over 17 d (partial r > 0.42, p < 0.00 1).
   Foraging enrichment increased foraging (F-3,F-89 = 5.66, p < 0.01) and
   general activity (F-3,F-89 = 4.75, p < 0.01). Foraging and structural
   enrichment decreased pacing (F-3,F-89 = 6.33, p = 0.001). Novelty
   enrichment had no significant effects. Social housing reduced use of
   enrichments (enrichment treatment x hous-housing type F-3,F-89 = 3.30, p
   < 0.05) and dustbaths (F-1,F-89 = 4.59, p < 0.05), suggesting resource
   monopolisation. Male birds ate more novel food (F-1,F-45 = 5.43, p <
   0.05) and spent more time observing social companions (F-1,F-45 = 7.88,
   p < 0.01) than females, who used enrichments (F-1,F-89 = 13.35, p <
   0.01) and foraged more (F-1,F-89 = 38.18, p < 0.001) and were more
   active than males (F-1,F-89 = 34.83,p < 0.001). Results indicate that
   the use and behavioural effects of enrichment vary by enrichment type in
   caged quail. Foraging enrichment had the most positive behavioural
   effects while social housing had some negative effects. Furthermore,
   male and female quail may not benefit equally from enrichment. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The effects of diet on horse behaviour have not previously been
   quantified in detail. In this study, we examined the behaviour of 17
   foals from the age of 2 to 40 weeks. Each foal received either a starch
   and sugar (SS) diet or a fat and fibre (FF) diet. The two diets
   contained similar digestible energy, crude protein and micronutrients,
   but differed in the fat and non-structural carbohydrate balance. The
   baseline behaviour of the foals was observed every 2 weeks by focal
   animal sampling. Additional behavioural observations were conducted when
   the foals were weaned by one of two methods. Approximately 2 months
   after weaning, the temperament and tractability of the young horses was
   assessed using standardised tests. Responses to a novel object, to a
   novel person, and during a handling test were observed and quantified.
   Horses grew well on both diets with no apparent effects of diet on
   growth rate or baseline behaviour. Immediately after weaning, horses
   receiving the FF diet cantered less frequently (F = 5.10; p < 0.05), for
   a shorter duration (F = 7.23; p < 0.05) and appeared to be more settled.
   Foals that were barn-weaned appeared more stressed than foals that were
   paddock-weaned. In the temperament tests, horses receiving the FF diet
   spent significantly more time investigating (F = 6.78; p < 0.05), and
   less time looking at (F = 7.93; p < 0.05), the novel object than horses
   receiving the SS diet. They also spent less time walking away from the
   novel person (F = 5.16; p < 0.05) and their time taken to complete the
   handling test was significantly lower (F = 8.72; p = 0.01). Overall, the

Abstract = {{Cover provides shelter, food, nesting opportunities and protection from
   predators. The behavioural response of small mammals to reduced cover
   has been well documented. However, very little is known about the effect
   of cover on community and population dynamics. Australian small mammals
   generally inhabit extremely dynamic ecosystems, where cover and food
   supplies are greatly affected by fire. Species are described as early or
   late seral specialists, generally returning to a disturbed area once
   their habitat requirements are met. Habitat requirements have loosely
   been interpreted as cover and food supply, however, these factors are
   not mutually exclusive and few studies have attempted to determine the
   driving factors behind small mammal succession. In this study, we
   manipulated specific aspects of cover in the eucalypt forests of Fraser
   Island and show that the behaviour and population dynamics of small
   mammals were greatly affected. A reduction of cover from grass-trees
   (Xanthorrhoea johnsonii) did not affect small mammal species
   composition, however, the abundance and size structure distribution of
   the dominant species (Rattus fuscipes) decreased. Patch use by rodents
   also decreased after cover was reduced. Rattus fuscipes must trade-off
   remaining in an environment with increased risk of predation, or
   disperse to an area with greater cover but increased competition.
   Juveniles dominated (> 60\%) populations of R. fuscipes after cover was
   reduced, however, size distributions of control sites were relatively
   more even (< 25\% juvenile). While adult R. fuscipes are either killed
   by predators or disperse to other areas, juveniles that remained or
   immigrated to an area of reduced cover gained a selective advantage over
   those in control sites, because reduced competition with adults
   increased body condition of juvenile R. fuscipes.}},

Abstract = {{EFSA was invited by the EU Commission to produce a scientific opinion
   concerning the ``Revision of the Directive 86/609/EEC on the protection
   of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes{''}.
   This scientific opinion was adopted by written procedure on the 14th
   November 2005, by the Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare
   (AHAW) after its Plenary Meeting held on the 12th and 13th of October.
   According to the mandate of EFSA, ethical, socio-economic, cultural and
   religious aspects are outside the scope of this opinion.
   Summary of the Scientific Opinion for each of the three parts of the
   Mandate from the Commission:
   1. Summary of the need for protection for invertebrates and fetuses and
   the criteria used (Questions 1 \& 2)
   The Panel was asked to consider the scientific evidence for the
   sentience and capacity of all invertebrate species used for experimental
   purposes and of fetal and embryonic forms to ``experience pain,
   suffering, distress or lasting harm{''}. Indicators of an animal's
   capacity to experience suffering include long-term memory, plasticity of
   behaviour, complex learning and the possibility of experiencing pain.
   Some invertebrate species: (i) possess short and long term memory, (ii)
   exhibit complex learning such as social learning, conditioned
   suppression, discrimination and generalisation, reversal learning, (iii)
   show spatial awareness and form cognitive maps, (iv) show deception, (v)
   perform appropriately in operant studies to gain reinforcement or avoid
   punishment, (vi) possess receptors sensitive to noxious stimuli
   connected by nervous pathways to a central nervous system and brain
   centres, (vii) possess receptors for opioid substances, (viii) modify
   their responses to stimuli that would be painful for a human after
   having had analgesics, (ix) respond to stimuli that would be painful for
   a human in a manner so as to avoid or minimise damage to the body, (x)
   show an unwillingness to resubmit themselves to a painful procedure
   indicating that they can learn to associate apparently non-painful with
   apparently painful events. At a certain stage of development within an
   egg or the mother, the characteristics listed above may appear. Such
   information has been used in coming to conclusions about sentience.
   Cyclostomes (lampreys and hagfish) have a pain system similar to that of
   other fish and brains that do not differ much from those of some other
   fish. There is evidence that cephalopods have adrenal and pain systems,
   a relatively complex brain similar to many vertebrates, significant
   cognitive ability including good learning ability and memory retention
   especially in octopuses, individual temperaments, elaborate signalling
   and communication systems, especially in cuttlefish and squid that can
   show rapid emotional colour changes, may live in social groups and have
   complex social relationships. Nautiloids have many characters similar to
   those of other cephalopods, they can track other individuals, live for a
   long time and are active pelagic animals. The largest of decapod
   crustaceans are complex in behaviour and appear to have some degree of
   awareness. They have a pain system and considerable learning ability. As
   a consequence of this evidence, it is concluded that cyclostomes, all
   Cephalopoda and decapod crustaceans fall into the same category of
   animals as those that are at present protected. Using similar arguments,
   the dramatic evidence of the sensory processing, analytical and
   prediction ability of salticid spiders provides evidence for awareness
   greater than in any other invertebrates except cephalopods but we have
   little evidence of a pain system so do not at present put these spiders
   in that same category. Free-swimming tunicates are also in this
   borderline area and social insects and amphioxus are close to it.
   Whenever there is a significant risk that a mammalian fetus, or the
   fetus or embryo of an oviparous animal such as a bird, reptile,
   amphibian, fish or cephalopod, is for any length of time sufficiently
   aware that it will suffer or otherwise have poor welfare when a
   procedure is carried out on it within the uterus or egg, or after
   removal therefrom, such animals should be included in the list of
   protected animals. The stage of development at which this risk is
   sufficient for protection to be necessary is that at which the normal
   locomotion and sensory functioning of an individual independent of the
   egg or mother can occur. For air-breathing animals this time will not
   generally be later than that at which the fetus could survive unassisted
   outside the uterus or egg. For most vertebrate animals, the stage of
   development at which there is a risk of poor welfare when a procedure is
   carried out on them is the beginning of the last third of development
   within the egg or mother. For a fish, amphibian, cephalopod, or decapod
   it is when it is capable of feeding independently rather than being
   dependent on the food supply from the egg.
   Precocial oviparous species, some of which are breathing at the time of
   hatching present much evidence of being aware before hatching and during
   the last days before hatching,
   Even though the mammalian fetus can show physical responses to external
   stimuli, in some species perhaps for as much as the last third of their
   development, the weight of present evidence suggests that consciousness
   is inhibited in the fetus until it starts to breathe air. It is possible
   that in a mammalian fetus there might be transient episodes of increased
   oxygenation above the threshold required to support some aspects of
   consciousness. It is clear that there is a risk, perhaps a small risk,
   that any mammalian fetus may on occasion be affected by some
   experimental procedures in such a way that their welfare is poor,
   sometimes because they are suffering pain. If a mammalian fetus is
   removed from the mother and starts to breathe, its level of awareness
   will change to that typical of such animals after parturition. In
   addition, protection may need to be given against emotional states in
   pregnant mothers to safeguard subsequent behavioural modification and
   welfare of the offspring.
   When a procedure is performed on a fetus that is likely to produce pain
   in the newborn or newly-hatched of that species, adequate anaesthesia
   and analgesia should be given provided that the agents used do not
   significantly increase the likelihood of fetal mortality. In the
   circumstance where no suitable anaesthetic or analgesic agents are
   available, procedures should not be carried out on such fetuses. When
   the procedure might cause a lasting inflammatory response that persists
   post-natally, protection should be given against pain and suffering. A
   schedule of anaesthetics and analgesics that are suitable for use in
   pregnant animals, and fetuses should be prepared.
   2. Summary of the need for purpose breeding of animals and the criteria
   used (Question 3)
   Species listed in Annex I to Directive 86/609/EEC are those that must be
   `purpose bred' when used in experiments (unless a specific exemption has
   been obtained). The criteria for inclusion of species in Annex I have
   not been clearly defined and hence no information is available on why
   they were originally included. Therefore, the Commission has asked the
   EFSA to issue a scientific opinion on the scientific criteria that could
   be used to determine in which cases animals to be used in experiments
   should be purpose-bred and, based on these criteria, determine which
   species currently used in experiments meet these criteria.
   It is the opinion of the AHAW panel that including a species as
   ``purpose-bred{''} within Annex I will confer a considerable degree of
   assurance that animals of that species will be provided with suitable
   accommodation, welfare and care practices. As a consequence of health
   and colony management within breeding establishments, there can be
   improved confidence in the quality of the animal, resulting in improved
   science and a reduction in animal numbers required. Taking these factors
   in isolation, for the great majority of scientific investigations, there
   would be welfare and scientific merit in recommending that all animals
   used in scientific procedures be purpose-bred. However, before making
   such a recommendation, there are a number of other important factors
   that have to be considered. The consequences of inclusion of all species
   could, for example, result in loss of genetic diversity, the generation
   of large numbers of surplus animals and significant delays in scientific
   progress. A risk assessment approach has therefore been taken to this
   issue, with the group analysing the potential benefits for and the
   adverse consequences of the inclusion of each species in Annex I. Two
   issues have been considered: animal welfare and scientific quality. For
   each, three steps have been followed: identification of the hazards,
   exposure assessment and consequence assessment.
   The criteria suggested by the Technical Expert Working Group (TEWG)
   organised by DG ENV (2003) have been considered and incorporated into an
   assessment process against which the inclusion of each of the commonly
   used laboratory species was reviewed. The criteria considered by the
   AHAW panel have been whether legislation already exists to protect
   animal welfare, genetically altered animals, health and genetic quality
   of animals, demand, extrapolation of results to farming or to wild
   populations and capture from the wild.
   It is recommended that, wherever possible, animals used should be of a
   uniform standard so that there is good and effective control over the
   animals' genetic fidelity, microbial status, nutrition, socialisation to
   humans and other animals (e.g. ferrets, dogs and even rodents) and
   environment. Ideally all animals should be purpose bred but, in
   practice, some exceptions will be necessary. Exceptions should be made
   to purpose breeding when it is necessary for the research that a
   particular strain or breed is used, or that scientific progress would be
   unduly delayed providing that the scientific data resulting from such
   research were considered likely to be of good quality, i.e. the
   competent authorities should consider the potential adverse consequences
   for research should an exemption for the use of non-purpose bred animals
   be refused (86/609/EEC: Article 19(4)). Genetically altered animals (of
   all species) should be added to Annex I. The review of all the commonly
   used laboratory species has concluded that with the exception of quail
   (Coturnix coturnix) all the other species listed should continue to be
   purpose-bred and some further species should be added, namely: Chinese
   hamster (Cricetus griseus), Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus),
   two Xenopus species (X. laevis and X. tropicalis) and two species of
   Rana (R. temporaria and R. pipiens).
   3. Summary of humane methods of killing animals (Question 4)
   Nearly all animals are killed at the end of a research project and it is
   important that this is done humanely i.e. causing as little suffering as
   possible for the animals concerned. The majority (85-90\%) of animals
   used in research are small rodents however, of necessity (as we are
   trying to cover all methods for all animals), much of the Report deals
   with the methods for large animals. The Opinion of the scientific panel
   on AHAW is based on the Report annexed to this Opinion that presented
   recent data building on the three earlier authoritative reports on the
   humane killing of animals i.e.: 1) the Scientific Report related to
   welfare aspects of animal stunning and killing methods of the main
   commercial species of animals (EFSA, 2004, http://www.efsa.eu.int); 2)
   Close et al. 1996/1997 (endorsed by the EU for the humane killing of
   laboratory animals); and 3) the AVMA Report (2000) dealing with methods
   for all animals. The Opinion does not repeat what is already dealt with
   in detail in those reports but we have included a section dealing with
   new data for each method where applicable, and some conclusions and
   recommendations are retained. The Scientific Report and Opinion deal
   with the various technical ways of killing animals starting with
   electrical and mechanical methods, followed by gaseous and then
   injectable methods. The section on the use of gaseous agents is in some
   considerable detail as it is the subject of much new data, with more
   than 20 new papers in the past 10 years, many of them dealing with the
   commonest laboratory animals. The interpretation of this data has been
   varied. The recommended methods for each species are given in Tables 1
   to 8 at the end of this section but, in general, we have adopted the
   recommendations given in the existing EU Guidance (Close et al.,
   1996/97) except where stated. The AHAW panel suggested that these
   methods could be varied but only with a scientific justification and
   appropriate authority, i.e. the recommended methods represent the
   default position. We also address more general issues including ensuring
   death, training of personnel, killing animals for their tissues and
   oversight, the choice of method and when this might affect the
   scientific outcomes, and gathering information on methods used as well
   as their efficiency and effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Serum cholesterol is reported to be associated with
   suicidality, but studies conducted among general healthy population are
   rare. We examined the association between serum cholesterol and
   suicidality in a national sample of the general population of US.
   Methods: We used the data of 3237 adults aged 17 to 39 years, who
   completed a mental disorder diagnostic interview and had blood specimens
   collected after a 12-h fast, as a part of the Third National Health and
   Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994. The serum concentrations of
   total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and
   low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were dichotomized according
   to the recommended levels of the National Cholesterol Education Program.
   A polytomous logistic regression was employed to control for covariates.
   Results: Independent of socio-demographic variables, health risks and
   nutrition status, and a history of medical and psychiatric illness
   (including depression), a significant association between low HDL-C (<=
   40 mg/dl) and increased prevalence of suicide attempts was observed in
   women (OR=2.93, 95\% CI=1.07-8.00). No significant evidence was found to
   support an association between cholesterol and suicide ideation in
   women. Serum cholesterol was unrelated with either suicide ideation or
   attempts in men.
   Limitation: The inherent limitation of cross-sectional design prevented
   the authors from investigating causality.
   Conclusions: Low HDL-C is significantly associated with suicide attempts
   in women. Further studies are necessary to explore the clinical
   application of serum cholesterol as an indicator for suicide attempts
   among high risk population. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Mature ghrelin has been shown to stimulate eating and to
   participate in the regulation of insulin signaling and glucose
   homeostasis. Its gene, GHRL, is located on chromosome 3 in a region
   where we have shown linkage to eating behavior, percentage body fat, and
   total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in subjects of the
   Amish Family Diabetes Study.
   Objective: Our objective was to determine whether mutations in GHRL
   might influence eating behavior and risk for metabolic syndrome,
   obesity, diabetes, and related traits.
   Design: We genotyped 856 Amish samples for three missense polymorphisms
   in GHRL, Arg51Gln, Leu72Met ( rs696217), and Gln90Leu ( rs4684677) and
   performed association analyses with eating behavior traits and metabolic
   syndrome as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult
   Treatment Panel III guidelines.
   Subjects: Our subjects were adult participants in the Amish Family
   Diabetes Study.
   Results: The allele frequencies of these variants were 0.03, 0.04, and
   0.03, respectively. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was lower among
   those carrying the 51Gln allele ( 3.8 vs. 15.8\%; age- and sex-adjusted
   odds ratio = 0.22; P = 0.031). Hunger scores tended to be lower among
   51Gln allele carriers but did not reach statistical significance ( P =
   0.07). The Leu72Met variant was also associated with increased
   prevalence of metabolic syndrome ( 23.2 vs. 13.4\%; age- and
   sex-adjusted odds ratio = 2.57; P = 0.02) as well as higher fasting
   glucose, lower high-density lipoprotein, and higher triglyceride levels
   ( P = 0.02, P = 0.007, and P = 0.04, respectively). The two variants
   were not in linkage disequilibrium with each other, suggesting
   independent effects. We conclude that mutations in GHRL may confer risk
   for the metabolic syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{Predators influence the distribution of prey directly if predation
   reduces local population density, or indirectly if the presence of
   predators induces behavioral or physiological responses to predation
   risk. We analyzed whether the foraging behavior of wood mice (Apodemus
   sylvaticus) was affected by the presence and activity of small-spotted
   genets (Genetta genetta) at ``risky{''} baiting stations monitored with
   automatic cameras. Sampling stations in 6 x 6 grids spaced at 250 m were
   arranged in 3 habitat types (shrubland, pine woodland, and holm oak
   woodland). Grids were sampled systematically by means of groups of 2-9
   cameras monitoring sampling stations during a week. We obtained 377
   independent contacts of wood mice and 35 independent contacts of at
   least 8 different genets. Patterns of habitat use by genets and wood
   mice were spatially discordant, because only 2 cameras detected both.
   Wood mice visited baits more often and during longer periods in groups
   of sampling stations where genets were not detected than in groups where
   genets were detected within the same week. Mean time spent foraging by
   genets negatively influenced both the number of foraging bouts per night
   and the mean duration of such bouts by mice using nearby baits. Finally,
   temporal patterns of activity of mice along the night were different
   depending on whether genets were foraging nearby. Temporal patterns of
   mice when and where genets were absent were positively correlated with
   patterns of genet activity, whereas mice patterns were negatively
   correlated with genet patterns when and where genets were present.
   Sampling dates, habitat types, and moonlight levels did not seem to have
   influenced these results. Wood mice showed spatial and temporal changes
   in foraging behavior in response to the presence of genets, and
   decisions about how often and how long to forage were affected by
   foraging activity of genets. Results obtained provided direct evidence
   of a foraging game of stealth and fear between mice and their predator
   that could help to explain mice distribution in Mediterranean postfire
   habitats.}},

   tool to investigate these neural substrates in humans, because it
   provides a measurement of state-dependent brain regional activity,
   bridging the gap between neural events and behavioral responses. Using

Abstract = {{The ``cost-benefit{''} hypothesis states that specific body organs show
   mass changes consistent with a trade-off between the importance of their
   function and cost of their maintenance. We tested four predictions from
   this hypothesis using data on non-breeding greylag geese Anser anser
   during the course of remigial moult: namely that (i) pectoral muscles
   and heart would atrophy followed by hypertrophy, (ii) leg muscles would
   hypertrophy followed by atrophy, (iii) that digestive organs and liver
   would atrophy followed by hypertrophy and (iv) fat depots be depleted.
   Dissection of geese captured on three different dates during wing moult
   on the Danish island of Saltholm provided data on locomotory muscles and
   digestive organ size that confirmed these predictions. Locomotory organs
   associated with flight showed initial atrophy (a maximum loss of 23\% of
   the initial pectoral muscle mass and 37\% heart tissue) followed by
   hypertrophy as birds regained the powers of flight. Locomotory organs
   associated with running (leg muscles, since geese habitually run to the
   safety of water from predator-type stimuli) showed initial hypertrophy
   (a maximum gain of 37\% over initial mass) followed by atrophy. The
   intestines and liver showed initial atrophy (41\% and 37\%
   respectively), consistent with observed reductions in daily time spent
   feeding during moult, followed by hypertrophy The majority of the 22\%
   loss in overall body mass (mean 760 g) during the flightless period
   involved fat utilisation, apparently consumed to meet shortfalls between
   daily energetic needs and observed rates of exogenous intake. The
   results support the hypothesis that such phenotypic plasticity in size
   of fat stores, locomotor and digestive organs can be interpreted as an
   evolutionary adaptation to meet the conflicting needs of the wing moult.}},

Abstract = {{The biology and behavior of the longhorned beetle Dectes texanus LeConte
   (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) was studied on two host plants that suffer
   economic losses from this pest; sunflower, Helianthus annuus, and
   soybean, Glycines max. Reciprocal crosses of D. texanus collected from
   the two plants all produced viable progeny, indicating that conspecific
   insects attack both crops. Pupae from soybean stalks weighed about 40\%
   less than those from sunflower, and adults fed on soybean lived a mean
   Of 23 days, compared to a mean Of 53 days (males) and 76 days (females)
   for those fed sunflower. A female's larval host plant had no effect on
   her tendency to ovipuncture plants of either type in a greenhouse trial.
   A field-tested population collected exclusively from sunflower contained
   three types of females in similar proportions: those that laid eggs only
   on sunflower, those that laid only on soybean, and those that laid
   equally on both host plants. Females in field trials fed more on the
   plant they had fed on in the laboratory, but soybean-fed females fed
   more on soybean than did sunflower-fed females. Females fed soybean also
   made more ovipunctures on soybean plants in field trials than
   sunflower-fed females, but their responses to sunflower plants were
   similar. Females displayed higher total ovipositional activity when they
   encountered sunflower first in the field, and lower total activity when
   they encountered soybean first. Feeding scores were significantly
   correlated with ovipunctures and eggs on both plant types. We conclude
   that sunflower is the preferred host plant, although females will accept
   soybean when it is the only available food. The results suggest that D.
   texanus is still in the initial stages of a host range expansion with
   female host selection behavior demonstrating both genetic influences and
   phenotypic flexibility. Sunflower represents a nutritionally superior,
   ancestral host plant and relatively high fitness costs are still
   associated with utilization of the novel host plant, soybean, costs that
   may be offset by benefits such as reduced intraspecific competition.
   These potential benefits and their consequent implications for D.
   texanus host range evolution are hypothesized and discussed.}},

   low-phosphorus (LP) and high phosphorus (HP) conditions, in the presence
   of Chaoborus kairomones to examine how food quality (P-availability)
   might impact life-history responses and vulnerability to predation.
   Overall, clone 1 grew faster, and was larger at maturity. Under HP, both
   clones responded to kairomones by increasing growth, age and size at
   maturity, and decreasing fecundity. Under LP, both clones suffered
   reduced growth, and fecundity. However, the magnitude of response to
   kairomones depended on a clone by P-availability interaction. Chaoborus
   presented a 1 : 1 clonal mixture under HP or LP, consumed more
   individuals under LP. Moreover, fewer clone 1 individuals were consumed.
   Studying the effects of P-availability on life histories, and
   predator-prey interactions may help us understand the mechanisms
   generating and maintaining plasticity, as well as influencing genotypic
   diversity and microevolutionary processes in natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{In the clinic, obesity and anorexia constitute prevalent problems whose
   manifestations are encountered in virtually every field of medicine.
   However, as the command centre for regulating food intake and energy
   metabolism is located in the brain, the basic neuroscientist sees in the
   same disorders malfunctions of a model network for how integration of
   diverse sensory inputs leads to a coordinated behavioural, endocrine and
   autonomic response. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive;
   rather, much can be gained by combining both perspectives to understand
   the pathophysiology of over- and underweight. The present review
   summarizes recent advances in this field including the characterization
   of peripheral metabolic signals to the brain such as leptin, insulin,
   peptide YY, ghrelin and lipid mediators as well as the vagus nerve;
   signalling of the metabolic sensors in the brainstem and hypothalamus
   via, e.g. neuropeptide Y and melanocortin peptides; integration and
   coordination of brain-mediated responses to nutritional challenges; the
   organization of food intake in simple model organisms; the mechanisms
   underlying food reward and processing of the sensory and metabolic
   properties of food in the cerebral cortex; and the development of the
   central metabolic system, as well as its pathological regulation in
   cancer and infections. Finally, recent findings on the genetics of human

Abstract = {{The present work investigates how a fallow deer (Dama dama) population
   in central Italy might have been affected from 1984 to 2003 by the
   increase of human access to the study site, where humans were the main
   deer predators. By using deer census data, possible correlations were
   analyzed between the increase in human presence and the response of.
   each age and sex class. The numbers of different age and sex classes of
   deer recorded inside and outside the sector affected by human presence
   throughout the 20-year period of study were compared. A differential
   response was recorded among classes. Adult females and juveniles left
   this area (reducing their presence from 37\% of all deer observed to
   11\% for adult females and from 19\% to 3\% for juveniles) when human
   pressure became higher, whereas the opposite result was true for males
   older than 24 months (adult males) that remained inside the disturbed
   sector (from 27\% to 50\% of deer observed). Intermediate values were
   recorded for yearling males, because they can be associated with both
   groups of females and groups of males. Results Of this long-term study
   are best explained with the reproductive strategy hypothesis, because
   the increase of predation risk evoked a marked spatial Sexual
   segregation in the fallow deer population. Females and juveniles used
   relatively predator-safe habitats, whereas males used habitats with
   higher predation risk but better food quality. Furthermore, as females
   increased their presence outside the disturbed sector, males gradually
   abandoned the undisturbed area, increased use of the disturbed sector,
   and maximized foraging opportunities by going to areas where indirect
   competition with females was probably reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Omnivores, including humans, have an inborn tendency to avoid noxious or
   unfamiliar foods. Such defensive foraging behaviors are modifiable,
   however, in response to physiological needs. Here we describe a method
   for assessing risk-sensitive food acquisition in Drosophila
   melanogaster. Food-deprived fly larvae become more likely to feed on
   noxious foods ( adulterated with quinine) as the duration of deprivation
   increases. The neuropeptide F receptor NPFR1, a mammalian neuropeptide Y
   (NPY) receptor homolog, centrally regulates the response to noxious food
   in D. melanogaster. Overexpression of NPFR1 was sufficient to cause
   nondeprived larvae to more readily take in noxious food, whereas loss of
   NPFR1 signaling led to the opposite phenotype. Moreover, NPFR1 neuronal
   activity may be directly regulated by the insulin-like signaling
   pathway. Upregulation of insulin-like receptor signaling in NPFR1 cells
   suppressed the feeding response to noxious food. Our results suggest
   that the coordinated activities of the conserved NPY- and insulin-like
   receptor signaling systems are essential for the dynamic regulation of
   noxious food intake according to the animal's energy state.}},

Abstract = {{Food intake is normally influenced by a multitude of complex endogenous
   neurochemical systems, in addition to numerous external environmental
   stimuli, including olfaction. Since most olfactory neurons process
   odorant exposures through Ca2+-mediated mechanisms via Ca2+ channels, a
   novel approach at influencing the ingestive behaviors of animals might
   therefore involve altering olfactory acuity via Ca2+ channel blockade.
   We tested the ability of a Ca2+ channel blocker, diltiazem, to alter
   food intake in hyperphagic rats when administered using the intranasal
   (i.n.), intraperitoneal (i.p.), oral (p.o.) or intracerebroventricular
   (i.c.v.) routes of administration. Male Sprague Dawley rats, which had
   been food-deprived for 4 h at the beginning of the dark cycle, were
   administered different doses of diltiazem (0 - 8 mg/animal or 0-40
   mg/kg) and the amounts of food consumed were measured. While food intake
   at 1, 2 and 4 h post drug administration was significantly decreased in
   a dose-dependent manner after i.n. administration, the i.p., p.o., and
   i.c.v. routes did not affect food intake. In another experiment, rats
   trained to eat their daily meal during the first 4 h at the onset of the
   dark cycle and treated daily with i.n. diltiazem (0 - 8 mg/ animal)
   prior to food introduction exhibited a significantly decreased rate of
   weight gain in a dose-dependent manner over a 14-day period. Both i.n.
   and i.p. diltiazem significantly increased the plasma drug concentration
   at 1 h, however there was no significant difference between these routes
   of administration. Additional studies failed to demonstrate any
   detrimental effects of i.n. diltiazem (0- 8 mg/ animal) on conditioned
   taste aversion, locomotion or gross neurological/behavioral competence
   using the rota-rod test. While a local action on the nasal odorant
   receptors is most likely the site of diltiazem's action, further studies
   are needed to determine the exact mechanism of action of i.n. diltiazem.

Abstract = {{Red drum larvae (Sciaenops ocellatus) were exposed to environmentally
   realistic and sublethal levels of the herbicide atrazine
   (2-chloro-4-ethylamin-6-isopropylamino-S-triazine) to evaluate its
   effects on ecologically critical traits: growth, behavior, survival
   potential, and resting respiration rate. Settlement size larvae (7 turn
   total length) were given an acute exposure of atrazine at 0, 40, and 80
   mu g l(-1) for 4 days. Tests of 96 h survival confirmed that these
   naturally occurring concentrations were sublethal for red drum larvae.
   Growth, routine swimming, antipredator responses to artificial and
   actual predators, and resting respiration rate were monitored I and 3
   days after onset of exposure. Atrazine exposure significantly reduced
   growth rate. Atrazine-exposed larvae also exhibited significantly higher
   routine swimming speeds, swam in more convoluted paths, and were
   hyperactive. Responses to artificial and actual predators were not
   affected by atrazine exposure nor were resting respiration rates. The
   higher rate of travel (86\% higher in atrazine-treated larvae) resulted
   in higher predicted encounter rates with prey (up to 71\%) and slow
   moving predators (up to 63\%). However, hyperactivity and faster active
   swimming speeds of exposed larvae indicated that naturally occurring
   sublethal levels of atrazine will result in an elevated rate of energy
   utilization (doubling the total metabolic rate), which is likely to
   increase the risk of death by starvation. Moreover, atrazine effects on
   growth will prolong the larval period, which could reduce the juvenile
   population by as much as 24\%. We conclude that environmentally
   realistic levels of atrazine induce behavioral and physiological effects
   on fish larvae that would compromise their survival expectations. (c)

Abstract = {{In a laboratory experiment, we investigated the role played by

   We kept the caged crayfish under three conditions: i) starved, ii)
   starved in combination with cues from crushed tadpoles, or iii) fed with

Abstract = {{Any animal whose form or behavior facilitates the avoidance of predators
   or escape when attacked by predators will have a greater probability of
   surviving to breed and therefore greater probability of producing
   offspring (i.e., fitness). Although in theory the fitness consequences
   of any antipredation behavior can simply be measured by the resultant
   probability of survival or death, determining the functional
   significance of antipredation behavior presents a surprising problem. In
   this review we draw attention to the problem that fitness consequences
   of antipredation behaviors cannot be determined without considering the
   potential for reduction of predation risk, or increased reproductive
   output, through other compensatory behaviors than the behaviors under
   study. We believe we have reached the limits of what we can ever
   understand about the ecological effects of antipredation behavior from
   empirical studies that simply correlate a single behavior with an
   apparent fitness consequence. Future empirical studies must involve many
   behaviors to consider the range of potential compensation to predation
   risk. This is because antipredation behaviors are a composite of many
   behaviors that an animal can adjust to accomplish its ends. We show that
   observed variation in antipredation behavior does not have to reflect
   fitness and we demonstrate that few studies can draw unambiguous
   conclusions about the fitness consequences of antipredation behavior.
   Lastly, we provide suggestions of how future research should best be
   targeted so that, even in the absence of death rates or changes in
   reproductive output, reasonable inferences of the fitness consequences
   of antipredation behaviors can be made.}},

Abstract = {{The relative contribution of genetic and non-genetic factors in shaping
   personality traits is of fundamental relevance to biologists and social
   scientists. Individual animals vary in the way they cope with challenges
   in their environment, comparable with variation in human personalities.
   This variation has a substantial genetic basis. Here we describe
   experiments showing the strength of environmental factors (food
   availability and sibling competition) in shaping personality traits in a
   passerine bird (Parus major). We manipulated the early rearing condition
   in two lines (F4) bidirectionally selected for different personalities
   (fast line: high exploration speed and high aggression; slow line: low
   exploration speed and low aggression) with a food rationing protocol
   inducing an impairment in growth rate and an enhancement in levels of
   offspring solicitation (begging behaviour). Growth impairment was more
   marked in the slow line. In a first experiment each nest contained
   experimental and control siblings of the same line (within-nests
   design). Slow chicks became much faster than their parents in the
   exploration tests regardless of the treatment, whereas fast chicks had
   scores similar to their parents and showed no treatment effect. As it
   consequence, the line difference in exploration behaviour of the
   offspring was not apparent in the juvenile phase. Six months later the
   offspring of the slow line was still relatively fast, but lines differed
   in exploration, since the fast line became even more fast. Food-rationed
   birds of the fast line were more aggressive than both controls and their
   fathers, while treatment did not affect the slow line. In a second
   experiment, carried out only in the slow line, each nest contained
   either control or experimental siblings (between-nests design). Now,
   only the food-rationed chicks became faster in exploration. We suggest
   that the shift in the controls in the within-nests design wits due to
   enhanced sibling competition, forced by the experimental chick. Indeed,
   the control chicks in the first experiment begged more persistently and
   had higher exploration scores than the control chicks in the
   between-nests design. Environmental factors during ontogeny modulate the
   expression of phenotypic traits against the background of the reaction
   norm allowed by the genome even in selected lines of animals resulting
   in profound and reliable differences in behaviour.}},

   diet composition and, in general, the kestrels were feeding on what was
   locally more abundant. However, we detected consistent differences in
   the diet composition between neighbouring breeding pairs which were also
   maintained in subsequent years. Since the neighbouring birds were
   sharing the same hunting grounds, the differences observed were likely
   to reflect individual preferences or capabilities in catching some prey
   type regardless of their actual availability. The presence of
   differences in diet composition between neighbouring pairs and their

Abstract = {{Although studies on sperm competition examined a wide range of taxa,

   Here, we experimentally studied how the risk of sperm competition
   affects male copulatory behavior in the sexually cannibalistic praying
   mantis Mantis religiosa. We recorded the onset and duration of
   copulations following the introduction of virgin, adult praying mantises
   into mating arenas with three different sex ratio treatments:
   polyandrous, monogamous, and polygynous. We did not detect any female
   phenotypic trait predicting cannibalism. The chance of male survival was
   related to his condition, with males in better condition being
   cannibalized significantly less often. In contrast, we did not identify
   any male trait that would favor some males to obtain copulations. Our
   results on copulation duration support sperm competition theory in that
   the copulations in the male-biased treatment, where the perceived risk
   of sperm competition was greatest, were significantly longer than those
   in single-male treatments. Importantly, males in better condition
   copulated significantly longer regardless of sex ratio. Overall, our

Abstract = {{Many nestlings respond to alarm calls with anti-predator behavior, but
   their physiological responses to much calls are poorly understood. Alarm
   calls could stimulate increased secretion of corticosterone to mobilize

   However, elevated corticosterone levels can be costly to nestlings
   because they induce catabolic reactions at a time when the birds are
   engaged in anabolic processes. Thus, there may be constraints oil the
   secretion of corticosterone if the catabolic costs outweigh the
   behavioral benefits. Furthermore, many studies use baseline
   corticosterone levels as a correlate of body condition, and if nestlings
   respond hormonally when they hear abrin calls rather than when they are

   of baseline hormone levels would be difficult. To investigate this
   phenomenon, we broadcast taped calls of either adult conspecific alarm
   calls or songs of hererospecifics to 15-20 d old American Kestrel (Falco
   sparverius) nestlings. Playbacks were started when adults were absent,
   but adults returned and produced alarm calls at two control and three
   experimental nests. Blood was collected from randomly selected nesdings
   at each nest 13 min after the onset of a playback and within 2 min of
   opening the nest box, and the plasma was assayed for corticosterone.
   There was no difference in corcicosterone values between nestlings that
   heard alarm calls and those that heard control vocalizations. Hearing
   natural kestrel alarm calls did not affect the results, although our
   small sample sizes resulted in low power to detect differences. These
   data indicate chat 1520 d old Kestrels do not increase corticosterone
   secretion in response to adult conspecific alarm calls, and suggest chat
   studies of corticostcrone secretion in nestling kestrels will not be
   affected by the occurrence of adult alarm-calling.}},

Abstract = {{A number of standard behavioral tasks in animal research utilize food
   rewards for positive reinforcement. In order to enhance the motivation
   to participate in these tasks, animals are usually placed on a
   restricted diet. While dietary restriction (DR) has been shown to have
   beneficial effects on recovery after brain injury, life span and aging
   processes, it might also represent a stressor. Since stress can
   influence a broad range of behaviors, the purpose of this study was to
   assess whether DR may have similar effects on skilled movement. Adult
   male Long-Evans rats were trained and tested in a skilled reaching task
   both prior to and during a mild food restriction regimen that maintained
   their body weights at 90-95\% of baseline weight for eight days. The
   observations revealed that DR decreased reaching success and increased
   the number of attempts to grasp a single food pellet. The animals
   appeared to be more frantic when attempting to reach for food pellets,
   and the time taken to reach for 20 pellets decreased following the onset
   of DR. A second experiment investigating behaviors that do not require
   food rewards, including a ladder rung walking task and an open field
   test, confirmed that rats on DR display deficits in skilled movements
   and are hyperactive. These findings suggest that results obtained in
   motor tasks using food rewards need to be interpreted with caution. The
   findings are discussed with respect to stress associated with DR. (c)

Abstract = {{Dairy cows experience a high incidence of disease and metabolic
   disorders in the weeks immediately following calving, but early and
   accurate diagnosis remains a challenge. Cows suffering from metritis,
   one common disease following calving, exhibit reduced milk yield and
   reproductive performance. However, afflicted cows show few overt signs
   of illness and frequently go unnoticed in the absence of veterinary
   examination. To determine whether changes in feeding behavior could be
   used to identify animals at risk for metritis, attendance at the feed
   alley was monitored continuously for 26 Holstein cows during the
   transition period, beginning 2 wk before and ending 3 wk after calving.
   Every 3 +/- 1 d, cows were examined for metritis based on rectal body
   temperature and condition of vaginal discharge. Over the 3 wk of
   observations after calving, 69\% of cows showed some signs of metritis.
   These cows spent on average 22 min/d less time at the feed alley during
   the transition period than did non-metritic cows. For every 10-min
   decrease in average daily feeding time, cows were twice as likely to be
   diagnosed with metritis. A threshold of 75 min of average daily feeding
   time was 89\% sensitive and 62\% specific for detection of acute
   metritis. In conclusion, reduced time at the feeder can be used to
   identify dairy cows at risk for metritis. More research is required to
   determine how soon before calving at-risk cows can be identified and
   whether these behavioral differences can also be used in the early
   diagnosis of other diseases or metabolic disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial hermit crabs use mollusc shells to protect their soft bodies
   from predation and desiccation, but their use is costly. The energetic
   short-term cost of using shells has been demonstrated, yet this could
   theoretically be overcome by increasing feeding rate or food quality. In
   the long term, shells have the potential to constrain growth, which may
   in turn have a negative effect on fitness. Thus crabs should choose the
   lightest (least expensive to carry) shell amongst those of a size that
   permit growth. Since in nature lighter shells are also thinner-walled,
   these may provide insufficient protection from predation or desiccation,
   facing the crabs with a trade-off between protection and growth. This
   potential trade-off was investigated in the terrestrial hermit crab
   Coenobita compressus. Crabs were individually maintained in captivity
   for a variable period of between I and 7 months, during which light or
   heavy replicates of the preferred shell were available. In a second
   experiment, crabs were given a choice between a thick (and heavy) or a
   thin (and light) shell. In addition, the resistance and water retention
   capacity of thin and thick shells was compared. As predicted, crab
   growth was negatively correlated with the weight of the shell used, but
   crabs rejected the thin (light) shells. Thin shells were more likely to
   break when crabs used the normal `rolling' behaviour in response to
   perceived threats. In addition, thin shells lost water at a faster rate
   than thick ones. Since two putative functions of shell use in
   terrestrial hermit crabs are protection against predation and against
   desiccation, it is inferred that the preference for shells of
   intermediate weight in C. compressus results from a balance between the
   need to grow and the cost of carrying a brittle shell that is not
   sufficiently water tight.}},

Abstract = {{Rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss stocked into Flaming Gorge Reservoir,
   Utah-Wyoming, are thought to be in poor condition and to rarely
   overwinter. In 2001-2002, we evaluated factors that affect the growth
   and abundance of rainbow trout, both temporally and spatially, based on
   a series of field measurements and growth experiments. Based on our
   field measurements, the growth and condition of rainbow trout in Flaming
   Gorge Reservoir actually parallel those of rainbow trout of various
   strains in other systems, and some rainbow trout overwinter as many as 3
   years in the reservoir. Overall, rainbow trout appear to be spatially
   limited by physical factors (e.g., temperature) during only a few
   isolated times of the year and not in all areas of the reservoir.
   Although zooplankton were abundant throughout the reservoir, primary and
   secondary production vary spatially with concordant effects on fish
   growth and condition. Diet analysis indicated that rainbow trout consume
   primarily aquatic macroinvertebrates along with some zooplankton and
   demonstrate an extremely limited switch to piscivory at larger sizes.
   Rainbow trout reared in net-pens and limited to a diet of zooplankton
   lost weight in all three areas of the reservoir. In addition, the
   reservoir supports a large population of trophy lake trout Salvelinus
   namaycush, which probably affects the abundance of rainbow trout
   directly through consumption and the growth potential of rainbow trout
   indirectly through risk-averse behavior. The combination of spatial
   variation in reservoir productivity and habitat type, differing stocking
   strategies, and behavioral responses caused by predators appears to
   determine the varying success of stocked rainbow trout in the different
   areas of the reservoir. Our study suggests that stocking strategies may
   be most effective when specific characteristics of the prey and predator
   base, the suitability of different habitats, and the genetic strain are
   explicitly evaluated within the context of the targeted angler
   population.}},

   allocation in populations of age-0 trout to determine if greater

   nearly all of their acquired energy to somatic growth when small in
   early summer. However, trout in low-food lakes took greater risks to
   achieve this maximal growth, and therefore incurred high mortality. By
   late summer, age-0 trout allocated considerable energy to lipids and
   used previously risky habitats in all lakes. These results indicate
   that: (i) the size-dependent risk of predation (which is independent of
   behaviour) promotes risk-taking behaviour of age-0 trout to increase
   growth and minimize time spent in vulnerable sizes; and (ii) the
   physiology of energy allocation and behaviour interact to mediate

Abstract = {{Working animals provide an essential transport resource in developing
   countries worldwide. Many of these animals are owned by poor people and
   work in harsh environments, so their welfare is a cause for concern. A
   protocol was developed to assess the welfare of working horses, mules
   and donkeys in urban and peri-urban areas, using direct observation of
   health and behaviour parameters. In this study, 4903 animals used for
   draught, pack and ridden work in Afghanistan, Egypt, India, Jordan and
   Pakistan were assessed between December 2002 and April 2003. The data
   showed that donkeys were more likely than mules or horses to demonstrate
   avoidance or aggressive behaviour towards an observer, while horses were
   most likely to make a friendly approach. Fewer than 8\% of working
   equines had abnormal mucous membranes, ectoparasites or poor coat
   condition. Body lesions occurred predominantly in the areas of the
   breast/shoulder, withers and girth in all three species, with mules
   having the highest prevalence of lesions in these areas (22.5, 21.3 and
   28.4\%, respectively). Among horses and donkeys, the prevalence of these
   lesions was influenced by the type of work carried out. Lesions on the
   head, neck, ribs, flank and tail base were seen in less than 10\% of
   animals. Across all three species approximately 70\% of animals were
   thin, having a body condition score (BCS) of 2 or less on a scale of 1-5
   (1, very thin; 5, very fat) and more horses were in very thin condition
   (BCS 1) than mules or donkeys. Over 75\% of animals demonstrated limb
   deformities and abnormalities of gait. The results of this study are
   being used as the initial stage of a long-term strategy to inform
   priorities for welfare interventions in working equines and to establish
   a welfare benchmark. Subsequent stages will rank the welfare concerns
   identified, assess the contributing risk factors and implement specific
   interventions to address these risks. Following intervention, success in
   improving welfare will be measured by repetition of this protocol and

Abstract = {{Fish assemblages of small temperate streams are strongly influenced by
   harsh winter conditions, which are tolerated by year-round resident
   species and avoided by seasonal migrants. We tested effects of season
   and longitudinal position on total biomass, species abundances and body
   condition of fish in two neighboring streams (Plum Run, Brintons Run) in
   southeast Pennsylvania, USA. In each stream we sampled four pools in a
   downstream reach in close proximity to a larger (6(th) order) stream and
   four pools in a more isolated upstream reach during fall, winter and
   spring. Total biomass depended strongly on pool volume, with which other
   habitat variables (area, maximum depth, extent of undercut bank) were
   also correlated. Downstream pools of Plum Run (mean volume 18.1 m(3),
   link magnitude 5) had 21 fish species, including 6 species of
   Centrarchidae that largely vacated the pools in winter. The assemblage
   in upstream pools of Plum Run and in both upstream and downstream pools
   of Brintons Run (mean volumes 5.6 m(3) 5.7 m(3) and 4.4 m(3),
   respectively; all link magnitude 2), consisted of 7 to I I species.
   These pools were dominated by Cyprinidae, generally lacked centrarchids

   cyprinids {[}Semotilus atromaculatus (Creek chub), Rhinichthys atratulus
   (Blacknose dace) and Clinostomus funduloides (Rosyside dace)] and the
   winter emigrant Catastomus commersonii (White sucker) were the most
   abundant species in the two streams. Body condition of all four species
   declined substantially in winter; effects of longitudinal position
   (upstream vs. downstream) on body condition were less pronounced and
   varied among species. Abundances of the three resident cyprinids were
   all negatively correlated with the abundances of large, potentially
   predatory, centrarchids. Occupation of downstream pools in the larger
   stream by the centrarchids during fall and spring, but emigration from
   the study area during winter, further modified the effects of winter on

Abstract = {{The timing of twilight transition behaviour of diurnal reef fish is
   likely to be determined by the trade-off between food intake and risk of
   predation. However, the correspondence between fish behaviour and
   light-dependent feeding is poorly documented. We used flume measurements
   of prey detection and consumption by small reef-dwelling
   zooplanktivorous fish to examine the effects of light and prey flux on
   the fish's in situ behaviour during twilight. Feeding rates increased
   from nearly nil to saturation as light level increased, corresponding to
   about 45 min of the morning twilight. Changes in feeding rates were
   mostly due to light-dependent changes in reactive distance. In the reef,
   fish emerged from their nocturnal shelter at lower light intensities
   than those at which they retreated at dusk. These light intensities at
   which the fish emerged and retreated in the field greatly exceeded the
   level required to detect prey. We examined whether the approach of
   measuring relative ratio of mortality risk to food gained can be applied
   to predict the observed patterns in the twilight transition behaviour of
   the fish studied. We suggest that both the times of emergence and
   retreat and the dawn-dusk asymmetry are the result of a direct response
   to temporal and spatial variations in predation risk; no evidence for
   fine-tuned adjustments to diel fluctuations in food availability by
   changes in the time of emergence and retreat was found. (c) 2005 The

Abstract = {{Chemical-mediated effects of predatory fish on chironomid larvae
   behaviour have been ignored so far. Sediment-dwelling chironomid larvae
   inhabit protective burrows from which they extend their bodies only to
   feed on deposited detritus and microalgae from the surrounding sediment.
   Here, we performed factorial laboratory experiments to study whether
   fish-borne chemical cues (kairomones) are responsible for behavioural
   trait changes of chironomid larvae, and whether chironomid larvae are
   able to assess the densities of fish predators and food resources and
   the trade-off between them. We exposed naive Chironomus riparius larvae
   to the chemical presence of zero, one, and ten predator fish ( Rutilus
   rutilus) and offered two resource levels ( low food, high food) for each
   treatment. Kairomones induced significant inherent behavioural trait
   changes in chironomid larvae. During the first 120 min after exposing
   chironomids to fish-conditioned water, we found a significant increase
   in digging activity with increasing predator density. After 3 days of
   exposure, the deepest chironomid burrows were found in treatments with
   the highest predator density. Chironomid larvae were significantly able
   to adjust their foraging behaviour to different predator densities and
   food concentrations and trade off between them; that is, when fish
   predators were more abundant or when more food resources were available,

   from ED, while taking into account certain variables which may be
   related to depression {[}subjects' age, ED duration, prior incidents of

   nutritional state (as measured by Body Mass Index or BMI)]. Our
   secondary objective is to evaluate the relative chronology of the onset
   of anxiety disorders and depressive disorders in anorexic and bulimic
   subjects. Method - We evaluated the frequency of depressive disorders in
   271 subjects presenting with a diagnosis of either anorexia nervosa or
   bulimia, using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI),
   DSM IV version. Results - While univariate analyses show that nearly all
   anxiety disorders are related to major depressive episode (MDE), a
   separate analysis of each anxiety disorder reveals that they do not all
   have the same influence in terms of risk of onset of MDE in anorexics
   and bulimics, when adjusted for univariate variables related to MDE
   (subjects' age, ED duration, prior incidents of anorexia nervosa in BN
   subjects, inpatient or outpatient status, nutritional state). Current
   generalized anxiety is significantly related to lifetime presence of MDE
   in AN subjects, and to current MDE in AN and BN subjects. Generalized
   anxiety is the most frequent disorder in AN and BN subjects to according
   our study; it also appears to be one of the principal predictive factors
   for MDE, which is 2.4 to 4.2 times more frequent when GAD is present
   Diagnosis of OCD has its own particular effect on lifetime risk for MDE
   in AN subjects, regardless of GAD: it increases the risk of depression
   by 3.5. It is one of the most frequent anxiety disorders among AN
   subjects, present in nearly a quarter of them. In bulimics, when GAD is
   excluded, two factors are related to current diagnosis of MDE: panic
   disorder and subjects' inpatient or outpatient status. Hospitalized
   bulimics are diagnosed with current MDE 4.4 times more often than those

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{755-761}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Megaplanktivores such as filter-feeding sharks and baleen whales are
   at the apex of a short food chain (phytoplankton-zooplankton-vertebrate)
   and are sensitive indicators of sea-surface plankton availability. Even
   though they spend the majority of their time below the surface it is
   still not known how most of these species utilize vertical habitat and
   adapt to short-term changes in food availability.
   2. A key factor likely to control vertical habitat selection by
   planktivorous sharks is the diel vertical migration (DVM) of
   zooplankton; however, no study has determined whether specific
   ocean-habitat type influences their behavioural strategy. Based on the
   first high-resolution dive data collected for a plankton-feeding fish
   species we show that DVM patterns of the basking shark Cetorhinus
   maximus reflect habitat type and zooplankton behaviour.
   3. In deep, well-stratified waters sharks exhibited normal DVM (dusk
   ascent-dawn descent) by tracking migrating sound-scattering layers
   characterized by Calanus and euphausiids. Sharks occupying shallow,
   inner-shelf areas near thermal fronts conducted reverse DVM (dusk
   descent-dawn ascent) possibly due to zooplankton predator-prey
   interactions that resulted in reverse DVM of Calanus.
   4. These opposite DVM patterns resulted in the probability of
   daytime-surface sighting differing between these habitats by as much as
   two orders of magnitude. Ship-borne surveys undertaken at the same time
   as trackings reflected these behavioural differences.
   5. The tendency of basking sharks to feed or rest for long periods at
   the surface has made them vulnerable to harpoon fisheries. Ship-borne
   and aerial surveys also use surface occurrence to assess distribution
   and abundance for conservation purposes. Our study indicates that
   without bias reduction for habitat-specific DVM patterns, current
   surveys could under- or overestimate shark abundance by at least
   10-fold.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiological and clinical observations have led to the hypothesis
   that the risk of developing some chronic diseases in adulthood is
   influenced not only by genetic and adult lifestyle factors, but also by
   environmental factors acting in early life. These factors act through
   the processes of developmental plasticity and possibly epigenetic
   modification, and can be distinguished from developmental disruption.
   The concept of predictive adaptation has been developed to explain the
   relationship between early life events and the risk of later disease. At
   its base, the model suggests that a mismatch between fetal expectation
   of its postnatal environment and actual postnatal environment contribute
   to later adult disease risk. This mismatch is exacerbated, in part, by
   the phenomenon of `maternal constraint' on fetal growth, which
   implicitly provides an upper limit of postnatal nutritional environment
   that humans have adapted for and is now frequently exceeded. These
   experimental, clinical and conceptual considerations have important
   implications for prevention and intervention in the current epidemic of

   presence and low food density decreased activity in both sexes.
   Additionally, individuals with less food grew more slowly, emerged
   later, remained smaller and had a higher mortality. At low food
   densities, however, and in contrast to former investigations,
   individuals from treatments with predator presence were the same size or
   larger than individuals without predators. Gender had a strong impact on
   larval activity and life-history traits and sexes differed in

Abstract = {{In hermit crabs, Clibanarius vittatus, activities associated with
   foraging for food and searching for a different gastropod shell are
   incompatible with mating activities. We hypothesized that due to the
   short mating season that mating would have priority over feeding or
   shell seeking. We compared the mating activities of groups of crabs in
   the absence of food and shell cues to mating activities of groups of
   crabs presented with food cues, shell cues, or a combination of food and
   shell cues. We measured the number of minutes of precopulatory behaviors
   executed and the number of pairs formed in these groups during 60
   minutes periods. Comparison of mating activity in the presence and
   absence of shell availability cues supported our hypothesis. Shell
   availability cues had no effect on the number of pairs formed or the
   number of minutes of precopulatory behaviors. However, responses to food
   cues did not support the hypothesis. Food cues from high quality food
   very significantly decreased both the number of pairs formed and the
   number of minutes of precopulatory behavior executed. This was true for
   both food cues alone or in combination with shell-availability cues. The
   dominance of food-related activities over reproductive activities was

Abstract = {{The neuroendocrine protein secretogranin II is the precursor of several
   neuropeptides, including secretoneurin and a novel 66-amino acid
   peptide, EM66, the sequence of which has been highly conserved across
   the vertebrae phylum. The presence of EM66 has been detected in the
   adult and fetal human adrenal gland, as well as the rat pituitary and
   adrenal glands. The present study aimed to explore a possible
   neuroendocrine role of EM66 by analysing its occurrence and distribution
   within the jerboa hypothalamus, and its potential implication in the
   control of feeding behaviour. High-performance liquid chromatography
   analysis of jerboa hypothalamic extracts combined with a
   radioimmunoassay of EM66 revealed a single peak of immunoreactive
   material exhibiting the same retention time as recombinant EM66.
   Immunocytochemical labelling showed that EM66-producing neurones are
   widely distributed in several hypothalamic regions, including the
   preoptic area, the suprachiasmatic, supraoptic, parvocellular
   paraventricular and arcuate nuclei, and the lateral hypothalamus. Food
   deprivation for 5 days induced a significant increase in the number of
   EM66-containing neurones within the arcuate nucleus (105\% increase) and
   the parvocellular aspect of the paraventricular nucleus (115\%
   increase), suggesting that EM66 could be involved in the control of
   feeding behaviour and/or the response to stress associated with fasting.
   Altogether, these data reveal the physiological plasticity of the EM66
   system in the hypothalamus and implicate this novel peptide in the
   regulation of neuroendocrine functions.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Examine a model that encourages health at every size as

   homeostatic regulation and eating intuitively (ie, in response to
   internal cues of hunger, satiety, and appetite).
   Design Six-month, randomized clinical trial; 2-year follow-up.
   Subjects White, obese, female chronic dieters, aged 30 to 45 years
   (N=78).
   Setting Free-living, general community.
   Interventions Six months of weekly group intervention (health at every
   size program or diet program), followed by 6 months of monthly aftercare
   group support.
   Main outcome measures Anthropometry (weight, body mass index), metabolic
   fitness (blood pressure, blood lipids), energy expenditure, eating
   behavior (restraint, eating disorder pathology), and psychology
   (self-esteem, depression, body image). Attrition, attendance, and
   participant evaluations of treatment helpfulness were also monitored.
   Statistical analysis performed Analysis of variance.
   Results Cognitive restraint decreased in the health at every size group
   and increased in the diet group, indicating that both groups implemented
   their programs. Attrition (6 months) was high in the diet group (41\%),
   compared with 8\% in the health at every size group. Fifty percent of
   both groups returned for 2-year evaluation. Health at every size group
   members maintained weight, improved in all out-come variables, and
   sustained improvements. Diet group participants lost weight and showed
   initial improvement in many variables at 1 year; weight was regained and
   little improvement was sustained.
   Conclusions The health at every size approach enabled participants to
   maintain long-term behavior change; the diet approach did not.
   Encouraging size acceptance, reduction in dieting behavior, and

Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{1-2, SI}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Stress reactions to the slaughter procedure influence ante- and
   post-mortem muscle metabolism and, consequently, the rate and extent of
   glycogen breakdown and pH decline, colour and drip loss. Effects are
   principally due to variations in ATPase activity and muscle glycogen
   reserves. Behavioural, physiological and metabolic responses to aversive
   situations depend on genetic background and prior experience of the
   animals. For example, reactivity to humans depends on breed; compared to
   Large White pigs, Durocs approach humans more. The effect of slaughter
   conditions on peri-mortem muscle metabolism depends also on breed;
   muscles of Durocs were relatively insensitive to slaughter conditions.
   Prior experience, such as repeated handling, modifies reactivity to
   familiar and unfamiliar humans. Repeated positive handling during
   rearing did not modify meat quality of Large Whites. Mild negative
   handling during rearing changed pre-slaughter muscle metabolism only if
   the negative handler was present at slaughter. Literature indicates that
   severe negative handling during rearing may influence peri-mortem muscle
   metabolism in the absence of the negative handler. Reactivity to humans
   measured in pigs with no handling experience, weeks or months before
   slaughter, may predict pre- or post-slaughter muscle metabolism. Thus,
   physical and visual contacts with the human, established by the pig,
   were negatively correlated with post-bleeding muscle temperature and
   ultimate pH. Fighting during mixing was positively correlated with
   ultimate pH and colour. Up to 42\% of variability in ultimate pH in pigs
   of similar genetic and rearing background could be explained by fighting
   during mixing and reactivity to humans. Fighting during mixing could be
   predicted by fighting during a food competition test and levels of
   exploration of an unfamiliar object. Overall, results show that the
   technological meat quality indicators studied were little influenced by
   positive or mildly negative handling experience during rearing. In
   contrast, genetic background, slaughter conditions and behavioural
   characteristics of the pig, established early in life, explained a large
   part of variability in a number of technological meat quality
   parameters. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Variation in the perception of bitter tastes has been
   associated with eating behavior, body composition, and cardiovascular
   disease. Recent observations have implicated 2 common haplotypes of
   TAS2R38 in the determination of bitter compound-tasting ability.
   Objective: The objectives of the study were to examine, in the British
   Women's Heart and Health Study cohort, any association between TAS2R38
   haplotypes, coronary heart disease (CHD), CHD risk factors, and eating
   behavior and to examine whether the associations allow for estimation of
   the effects of variation in diet on the etiology of common disease.
   Design: We conducted a cross-sectional study of relations between
   TAS2R38 haplotypes and CHD, CHD risk factors, and eating behavior in
   3383 women from 23 British towns.
   Results: Genotyping at P49A and V262A in TAS2R38 (rs713598 and
   rsl726866) allowed construction of all 4 possible haplotypes. The 2 most
   common haplotypes corresponded with previously identified haplotypes
   related to bitter compound-tasting ability. No substantial evidence of
   association was found between these haplotypes and CHD (odds ratio for
   taste-defining haplotypes: 0.97; 95\% Cl: 0.78, 1.2), body mass index
   (difference between means of taste-defining haplotypes: -0.084; 95\% Cl:
   -0.45, 0.29), or a series of physiologic and dietary characteristics. A
   marginally lower risk of diabetes was observed among those with the
   nontaster haplotype than among those with the taster haplotype (odds
   ratio: 0.69; 95\%Cl: 0.48, 1.00).
   Conclusion: TAS2R38 status was not an important determinant of CHD,
   related risk factors, or eating behavior in the British Women's Heart

Abstract = {{Eggs of vertebrates contain steroid hormones of maternal origin that may
   influence offspring performance. Recently, it has been shown that
   glucocorticoids, which are the main hormones mediating the stress
   response in vertebrates, are transmitted from the mother to the egg in
   birds. In addition, mothers with experimentally elevated corticosterone
   levels lay eggs with larger concentrations of the hormone, which produce
   slow growing offspring with high activity of the hypothalamo-adrenal
   axis under acute stress. However, the effects and function of transfer
   of maternal corticosterone to the eggs are largely unknown. In the
   present study, we injected corticosterone in freshly laid eggs of
   yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis), thus increasing the
   concentration of the hormone within its natural range of variation, and
   analyzed the effect of manipulation on behavioral, morphological, and
   immune traits of the offspring in the wild. Eggs injected with
   corticosterone had similar hatching success to controls, but hatched
   later. Mass loss during incubation was greater for
   corticosterone-treated eggs, except for the last laid ones.
   Corticosterone injection reduced rate and loudness of late embryonic
   vocalizations and the intensity of chick begging display. Tonic
   immobility response, reflecting innate fearfulness, was unaffected by
   hormone treatment. Elevated egg corticosterone concentrations depressed
   T-cell-mediated immunity but had no detectable effects on humoral immune
   response to a novel antigen, viability at day 10, or growth. Present
   results suggest that egg corticosterone can affect the behavior and
   immunity of offspring in birds and disclose a mechanism mediating early
   maternal effects whereby stress experienced by females may negatively
   translate to offspring phenotypic quality.}},

   systems. Both downward and upward movements of zooplankton were examined
   in cylindrical acrylic columns that either transmitted full sunlight or

   displaying a somewhat greater UV avoidance than cyclopoids. In the

   be altered in individuals who have had bulimia nervosa (BN), even after
   substantial remission of symptoms. Such findings could reflect
   persistent sequelae due to BN, or a vulnerability `trait' that exists
   independently of active eating-disorder manifestations, We compared
   women with full-blown BN (BN; n = 22), BN in remission (BN-R; n = 11),
   and no eating or psychiatric disturbances (n=22) on measures of platelet
   {[}H-3]paroxetine binding, eating symptoms and psychopathology, The BN-R
   group showed normal-range scores on eating and psychopathological
   symptoms, but reductions in density (B-max) of binding sites for
   paroxetine similar to those obtained in the actively ill women. Both BN
   groups had substantially lower B-max than did healthy controls. Our
   results corroborate other findings indicating recovered BN patients to
   have anomalous 5-HT functioning. While such effects could represent a
   lasting `injury' to the system, reported covariations between
   personality traits and 5-HT indices in BN encourage us to favor the
   argument that some alterations of 5-HT activity (in this case,
   consistent with reduced transporter activity) represent a `trait'
   associated with the risk of developing BN and/or associated
   psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We evaluated the behavior of serum albumin concentrations in
   response to metabolic stress that is associated with cardiac surgery and
   the role of this protein as a predictor of clinical outcome in children
   at high surgical risk who undergo operative correction of congenital
   heart defects.
   Methods: Serum albumin concentrations were measured in 30 children who
   had heart disease and were at high surgical risk. Analyses were
   performed before surgery, on the second postoperative day, and on
   discharge from the intensive care unit. Preoperative serum
   concentrations of albumin were compared with those of a control group
   that consisted of 20 healthy and well-nourished children.
   Results: Preoperative albumin concentrations of patients were lower than
   those of the control group (3.4 0.25 g/dL versus 4.0 0.18 g/dL, P <
   0.05). Serum levels decreased on the second postoperative day and at
   discharge from the intensive care unit (3.1 0.65 g/dL and 3.2 0.44 g/dL,
   P < 0.05) compared with preoperative concentrations. Preoperative
   concentrations lower than 3.0 g/dL were associated with increased
   postsurgical infection (P = 0.0026) and with increased mortality (P =
   0.0138). Patients whose postoperative levels were lower than 3.0 g/dL
   had longer hospital stays compared with those whose concentrations were
   higher than 3.0 g/dL (14.5 1.3 d versus 10 2.2 d, P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: The results suggest that hypoalbuminemia is common among
   children who have heart disease and are at high surgical risk, and serum
   albumin concentrations lower than 3 g/dL may be related to outcome in
   the period after cardiac surgery. 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The prevalence of obesity is rising throughout the world. Indeed,
   obesity has reached epidemic proportions in many developed and

   origin, which in many cases appears as a polygenic condition affected by
   environmental factors. Treatment or prevention of obesity is necessary
   to reverse or avoid the onset of type 2 diabetes and other
   obesity-related diseases. Weight loss is a complex trait that depends on
   many environmental, behavioural and genetic influences. An effective
   programme for the management of overweight and obesity must take into
   account all of these factors. Individual responses to weight loss
   interventions vary widely and reliable predictors of successful slimming
   are poorly understood. The individual genetic make-up participating in
   energy expenditure regulation, appetite control, lipid metabolism and
   adipogenesis, have been reported to affect the risk of treatment failure
   in some subjects. In addition, the genotype could also help to predict
   the changes in lipid profile, cardiovascular risk factors and insulin
   sensitivity in response to weight loss. Herein, the current evidence

Abstract = {{Background: Recent literature reviews have questioned hostility as a
   risk factor for heart disease. However, controversy persists due to the
   rarity of large-scale prospective cohort studies of initially healthy
   populations.
   Methods: We prospectively investigated the association between hostility
   and cardiovascular (and all-cause) mortality among 20,550 men and women,
   41-80 years of age, participating in the European Prospective
   Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition in Norfolk (EPIC-Norfolk),
   United Kingdom study. Participants were recruited by post from general
   practice age-sex registers and subsequently attended health checks that
   included the assessment of coronary disease risk factors. Hostility
   assessment was completed by postal questionnaire.
   Results: During mean follow-up of 6 years, 1284 deaths were recorded
   including 481 from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hostility was not
   associated with CVD mortality, after adjustment for age and prevalent
   disease, in either men (rate ratio for a 1 SD decrease in hostility
   score, representing increased hostility, 1.09; 95\% confidence interval
   0.98-1.22) or in women (rate ratio 1.00; 95\% confidence interval

   CVD mortality (independent of age, prevalent disease and cigarette
   smoking) for participants reporting very high hostility and for those
   aged less than 60 years.
   Conclusions: Hostility was not associated with an increased risk of
   cardiovascular mortality in this population study of older adults. (c)

   organism. A further set of processes, those of developmental plasticity,
   may induce a phenotype that is adapted to the adult environment

Abstract = {{Since David Lack first proposed that birds rear as many young as they
   can nourish, food limitation has been accepted as the primary
   explanation for variation in clutch size and other life-history traits
   in birds. The importance of food limitation in life-history variation,
   however, was recently questioned on theoretical grounds. Here, we show
   that clutch size differences between two populations of a neotropical
   thrush were contrary to expectations under Lack's food limitation
   hypothesis. Larger clutch sizes were found in a population with higher
   nestling starvation rate (i.e. greater food limitation). We
   experimentally equalized clutches between populations to verify this
   difference in food limitation. Our experiment confirmed greater food
   limitation in the population with larger mean clutch size. In addition,
   incubation bout length and nestling growth rate were also contrary to
   predictions of food limitation theory. Our results demonstrate the
   inability of food limitation to explain differences in several
   life-history traits: clutch size, incubation behaviour, parental feeding
   rate and nestling growth rate. These life-history traits were better
   explained by inter-population differences in nest predation rates. Food
   limitation may be less important to life history evolution in birds than
   suggested by traditional theory.}},

Abstract = {{Many carnivorous arthropods can use chemical information from plants to
   locate their herbivorous prey. The composition of blends of
   herbivore-induced plant volatiles can vary with plant and herbivore
   species and thus carnivores are confronted with variable information
   about the presence of their prey. Such environmental variation is
   expected to favour learning. We investigated the learning ability of the
   predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis, a specialized natural enemy of
   polyphagous spider mites. We reared mites on different plant species,
   and subsequently tested their preference for volatiles from lima bean
   plants infested with either the prey herbivore Tetranychus urticae or
   the nonprey caterpillar Spodoptera exigua in a Y-tube olfactometer.
   Predators reared on lima bean preferred the volatiles induced by T
   urticae, whereas predators reared on cucumber did not. We also
   investigated the foraging behaviour of mites after a nonrewarding
   experience during the adult phase (i.e. food deprivation in the presence
   of S. exigua-induced volatiles from lima bean) or after a rewarding
   experience (i.e. feeding in the presence of T urticae-induced
   volatiles). The rewarding experience had a much larger impact on the
   foraging responses. Predatory mites with multiple experiences (i.e. a
   nonrewarding experience followed by a rewarding experience) had the
   strongest preference for T. urticae-induced versus S. exigua-induced
   volatiles. We conclude that these learning abilities enable the
   predatory mites to forage in an environment where their prey can feed on
   a different plant species than the one on which the predator developed,
   and where nonprey caterpillars are also present. (c) 2004 The

Abstract = {{For many animals, selecting whether to fora e during day or night is a
   critical fitness problem: at night, predation risks are lower but
   feeding is less efficient. Habitat selection is a closely related
   problem: the best location for nocturnal foraging could be too risky
   during daytime, and habitat that is safe and profitable in daytime may
   be unprofitable at night. We pose a theory that assumes animals select
   the combination of daytime and night activity (feeding vs. hiding), and
   habitat, that maximizes expected future fitness. Expected fitness is
   approximated as the predicted probability of surviving starvation and
   predation over a future time horizon, multiplied by a function
   representing the fitness benefits of growth. The theory ` s usefulness
   and generality were tested using pattern-oriented analysis of an
   individual-based model (IBM) of stream salmonoids and the extensive
   literature on observed diel behavior patterns of these animals.
   Simulation experiments showed that the IBM reproduces eight diverse
   patterns observed in real populations. (1) Diet activity (whether
   foraging occurs during day and/or night) varies among a population ` s
   individuals, and from day to day for each individual. (2) Salmonids feed
   in shallower and slower water at night. (3) Individuals pack more
   tightly into the best habitat when feeding at night. (4) Salmonids feed
   relatively more at night if temperatures (and, therefore, metabolic
   demands) are low. (5) Daytime feeding is more common for life stages in
   which potential fitness increases more rapidly with growth. (6)
   Competition for feeding or hiding sites can shift foraging between day
   and night. (7) Daytime feeding is more common when food availability is
   low. (8) Diet activity patterns are affected by the availability of good
   habitat for feeding or hiding, We can explain many patterns of variation
   in diel foraging behavior without assuming that populations or
   individuals vary in how inherently nocturnal or diurnal they are.
   Instead, these patterns can emerge from the search by individuals for
   good trade-offs between growth and survival under different habitat and
   competitive conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although there have been numerous reports in personality of
   mood disorders, there have been few reports in regard with personality
   of winter seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Furthermore, no reports
   have been published concerning summer SAD personality characteristics.
   Thus, this study was conducted to assess the personality of winter and
   summer SAD using Tri-dimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) that
   have been used in a variety of mental disorders.
   Methods: A total of 6135 Japanese were evaluated with TPQ, the Seasonal
   Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ) and the Self-rating Depression
   Scale (SDS). Winter, summer and non-SAD groups were classified by SPAQ.
   We compared the difference of personality trait among these three groups
   in consideration of gender, age and SDS score influence.
   Results: Winter SAD demonstrated higher ``Novelty Seeking{''} and ``Harm
   Avoidance{''}; summer SAD showed higher ``Harm Avoidance{''} than the
   non-SAD group. ``Harm Avoidance{''} in both SAD groups was re-analyzed
   using SDS score as a covariate, and ``Novelty Seeking{''} in winter SAD
   using age as a covariate. As a result, the significance of high
   ``Novelty Seeking{''} and high ``Harm Avoidance{''} in winter SAD was
   excluded. However, ``Harm Avoidance{''} remained the significant
   difference between summer and non-SAD.
   Limitation: SAD was diagnosed only by SPAQ and not by interview. The
   state-dependency of ``Harm Avoidance{''} was not confirmed in identical
   patients over lapse of time.
   Conclusion: Patients with winter SAD have high ``Hann Avoidance{''}
   dependent on the depressive state that is in accordance with
   non-seasonal depression. Patients with summer SAD have high ``Hann
   Avoidance{''} possibly independent from the depressive state. (c) 2004

   seeds in larder and scatter patterns, they more frequently exhibited
   larder hoarding. Liadong oak acorns were generally consumed near the
   feeder, whereas apricot seeds were more frequently transported to the

Abstract = {{In theory, for any communication system, receivers cannot increase their
   responsiveness to signals without simultaneously increasing their risk
   of responding to inappropriate stimuli. This inevitable tradeoff may be
   an important selective pressure on signalling systems, but has rarely
   been studied. Nestling tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor, produce a
   begging display when their parents arrive at the nest with food, but
   they also beg to apparently inappropriate stimuli in the absence of
   parents, such as movements of the nest or broodmates. To explore the
   implications of these errors for begging, we experimentally determined
   how begging errors vary with nestling hunger and age, two factors that
   affect begging rate and intensity in response to parents. Specifically,
   we examined how begging rate and intensity varied in response to
   recordings of (1) a tree swallow adult landing on a nestbox and calling
   and (2) a common grackle, Quiscalis quiscala, a nest predator, landing
   on a nestbox, during a 1-h period of food deprivation and also across
   two ages (5-6 and 7-9 days posthatch). Nestlings increased the rate and
   intensity of their begging responses to both swallow and grackle
   stimulus sounds as time without food increased, although responses to
   the grackle sounds were always less than to the swallow sounds. Begging
   rate, but not intensity, increased with age for both swallow and grackle
   sounds; both measures of response were lower for the grackle sound at
   both ages. Thus, as nestlings become more responsive to parents, they
   also risk committing more errors. This trade-off supports theoretical
   predictions and may be an important selective force shaping
   parent-offspring signalling. (c) 2004 The Association for the Study of

   For our study, we used the predator-prey model system fish-waterflea
   Daphnia magna Straus (Cladocera, Daphniidae). Adult Daphnia use
   fish-derived infochemicals, so-called kairomones, as indicators of

   whether models derived using small-scale laboratory observations are
   valid for juvenile Atlantic salmon in more natural conditions.
   4. Contrary to predictions, we found no differences in behaviour between
   the control fish (which experienced consistently rich feeding patches)
   and the experimental fish (which experienced unpredictable 10-fold
   changes in patch quality).
   5. Also contrary to predictions, in the variable condition, salmon used
   high quality patches (which were an order of magnitude better than low
   quality patches) only marginally (5\%) more than would be expected if
   they were to forage at random. There was significant variation in
   foraging strategies between individual fish, with 28\% of the population
   making non-random use of foraging patches.
   6. The only apparent systematic relationship between social rank and use
   of foraging patches was that fish that were both dominant and made many
   moves between feeding locations tended to leave rich patches less
   frequently than they left poor patches.
   7. Despite the low correlation between patch quality and movement, there
   was substantial movement of fish among patches. Forty-four per cent of
   moves followed aggressive interactions and most others were spontaneous,
   with no obvious motivating factor apparent.
   8. The study exposes a discrepancy between expectations derived from the
   basic concepts of patch choice theory and the behaviour of Atlantic
   salmon in the conditions pertaining in the present study.
   9. It is suggested that this discrepancy may arise both from the fact
   that applicability of patch choice models may be very sensitive to the
   stability of differences in patch quality and from uncertainties about
   the costs of habitat sampling.}},

Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{25-36}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Thermal constraints on the time available for activity have been
   proposed as a proximate mechanism to explain variation in suites of life
   history traits. The longer that an ectotherm can maintain activity, the
   more time it has to forage and the greater chance that it will encounter
   a predator and be eaten. Thus, the thermal environment may produce a
   trade off between growth and survival when variation in the environment
   favors increased activity. I used mark-recapture data from a demographic
   study of three natural populations of the sagebrush lizard (Sceloporus
   graciosus) and estimates of thermal opportunity for each population to
   evaluate whether variation in the thermal environment can explain
   patterns of growth and survival that occur over an elevational gradient.
   Lizards from the highest elevation population exhibited higher
   individual growth rates than those of lizards from lower elevation,
   while mortality rates increased with elevation for these populations.
   The covariation of fast growth and high mortality with increased thermal
   opportunity is the opposite trend expected if the thermal environment
   alone is to explain patterns of life history in these lizards.
   Additional factors including thermal heterogeneity in the distribution
   of microhabitats of lizards, adaptation to local environmental
   conditions, and a potential trade-off between resource acquisition and
   predation risk need to be addressed to obtain a satisfactory explanation
   of the causative mechanisms producing life history variation.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{275-293}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Vitamin A (all-trans-retinol) is the parent compound of a family of
   natural and synthetic compounds, the retinoids. Retinoids regulate gene
   transcription in numerous cells and tissues by binding to nuclear
   retinoid receptor proteins, which act as transcription factors. Much of
   the research conducted on retinoid signalling in the nervous system has
   focussed on developmental effects in the embryonic or early postnatal
   brain. Here, we review the increasing body of evidence indicating that
   retinoid signalling plays an important role in the function of the
   mature brain. Components of the metabolic pathway for retinoids have
   been identified in adult brain tissues, suggesting that
   all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) can be synthesized in discrete regions of
   the brain. The distribution of retinoid receptor proteins in the adult
   nervous system is different from that seen during development; and
   suggests that retinoid signalling is likely to have a physiological role
   in adult cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum and
   associated brain regions. A number of neuronal specific genes contain
   recognition sequences for the retinoid receptor proteins and can be
   directly regulated by retinoids. Disruption of retinoid signalling
   pathways in rodent models indicates their involvement in regulating
   synaptic plasticity and associated learning and memory behaviours.
   Retinoid signalling pathways have also been implicated in the
   pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and depression.
   Overall, the data underscore the likely importance of adequate
   nutritional Vitamin A status for adult brain function and highlight
   retinoid signalling pathways as potential novel therapeutic targets for
   neurological diseases. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many grazing-management challenges stem from poor livestock distribution
   resulting in overuse of some areas and low utilization of others.
   Managing livestock-distribution patterns requires knowledge of pasture
   characteristics and animal behavior patterns. Behavioral patterns result
   from recognizable processes that include inherited attributes,
   individual and social learning systems, cue-consequence specificity,
   predispositions toward novel stimuli, and spatial memory. Through these
   behavioral mechanisms, animals form and revise preferences and aversions
   for specific locations in their foraging landscape. To accomplish
   habitat selection, domestic herbivores use sight and sound cues to seek
   and return to high-quality foraging locations. Nested within habitat
   selection are learned diet preferences and aversions by which ungulate
   herbivores associate taste with positive or negative postingestive
   feedback. The deliberate and careful modification of animal attributes
   and habitat characteristics could yield options for adaptive rangeland
   management. In this article, we describe the basic principles that
   underlie how animals make decisions about where to forage and how long
   to stay in a particular habitat. We also suggest management practices

Abstract = {{Recent theoretical and empirical work argues that growth rate can evolve
   and be optimized, rather than always being maximized. Chronically low
   resource availability is predicted to favour the evolution of slow
   growth, whereas attaining a size-refuge from mortality risk is predicted
   to favour the evolution of rapid growth. Guppies (Poecilia reticulata)
   evolve differences in behaviour, morphology and life-history traits in
   response to predation, thus demonstrating that predators are potent
   agents of selection. Predators in low-predation environments prey
   preferentially on small guppies, but those in high-predation
   environments appear to be non-selective. Because guppies can outgrow
   their main predator in low- but not high-predation localities, we
   predict that predation will select for higher growth rates in the
   low-predation environments. However, low-predation localities also tend
   to have lower productivity than high-predation localities, yielding the
   prediction that guppies from these sites should have slower growth
   rates. Here we compare the growth rates of the second laboratory-born
   generation of guppies from paired high- and low-predation localities
   from four different drainages. In, two out of four comparisons, guppies
   from high-predation sites grew significantly faster than their
   low-predation counterparts. We also compare laboratory born descendants
   from a field introduction experiment land show that guppies introduced
   to a low-predation environment evolved slower growth rates after 13
   years, although this was evident only at the high food level. The weight
   of the evidence suggests that resource availability plays a more
   important role than predation in shaping the evolution of growth rates.}},

Abstract = {{Many species use refugia to avoid predators, but remaining in a refuge
   is costly because foraging and engaging in other beneficial activities
   are curtailed while in a refuge. Thus, we expect that the duration of
   refuge use will be optimized. We tested a key prediction of this
   optimization hypothesis in yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris
   (Audubon and Bachman, 1841), by providing supplemental food next to
   their burrows to manipulate the costs of remaining in a refuge. We then
   systematically walked towards a subject that was foraging on
   supplementary food or a subject that was not foraging on supplementary
   food until the individual disappeared into its burrow. We found a
   significant effect of our feeding treatment; subjects with supplementary
   food emerged from their burrows sooner than those without it. We also
   found a complex interaction between our feeding treatment and immergence
   distance (i.e., the distance subjects were at when they disappeared into
   their burrows). Individuals that tolerated close approaches emerged
   sooner when food was present, while those that were intolerant of
   approaching humans took longer to emerge and emerged sooner when food
   was not present. Juveniles emerged significantly sooner than adults,
   while there was no detectable difference between emergence times for
   adults and yearlings. This is the first demonstration in a mammal that
   hiding time is sensitive to the cost of remaining in the burrow. A
   number of previous studies on hiding times have focused on ectothermic

Abstract = {{Foraging behavior often reflects food availability in predictable ways.
   For example, in habitats where food availability is high, predators
   should attack prey more often and move more slowly than in habitats
   where food availability is low. To assess relative food availability and
   habitat quality, I studied the foraging behavior of breeding
   Prothonotary Warblers (Protonotaria citrea) in two forest habitat types,
   cypress-gum swamp forest and coastal-plain levee forest. I quantified
   foraging behavior with focal animal sampling and continuous recording
   during foraging bouts. I measured two aspects of foraging behavior: 1)
   prey attack rate (attacks per minute), using four attack maneuvers
   (glean, sally, hover, strike), and 2) foraging speed (movements per
   minute), using three types of movement (hop, short flight {[}less than
   or equal to1 m], long flight {[}>1 m]). Warblers attacked prey more
   often in cypress-gum swamp forest than in coastal-plain levee forest.
   Foraging speed, however, was not different between habitats. I also
   measured foraging effort (\% time spent foraging) and relative frequency
   of attack maneuvers employed in each habitat; neither of these variables
   was influenced by forest type. I conclude that Prothonotary Warblers
   encounter more prey when foraging in cypress-gum swamps than in

   in higher density and greater reproductive success for birds breeding in

   Organism: Sperm depletion and laying of unfertilized oocytes occurs in

   nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. This phenomenon has been much
   discussed as a possible contradiction to the usual expectation of

   Methods: Caenorhabditis elegans were maintained in a variety of food
   regimes. not just the ad libitum Escherichia coli typical of laboratory
   cultures. Sperm production, oocyte production and body size were
   measured for nematodes cultured on agar with feeding treatments of
   serially diluted bacteria suspensions. before and during gamete

   Results: Reproduction was sperm-limited only for nematodes in the

   treatments produced smaller worms with considerable excess sperm.
   Caenorhabditis elegans grown ill natural soil or compost microcosms
   achieved the same sizes as those in treatments that showed oocyte
   limitation, not the large sizes of those typical of C elegans in
   treatments that exhibited sperm limitation. Enriching soil or compost by

   review, successful weight maintenance is associated with more initial
   weight loss, reaching a self-determined goal weight, having a physically
   active lifestyle, a regular meal rhythm including breakfast and
   healthier eating, control of over-eating and self-monitoring of

   motivation to lose weight, social support, better coping strategies and
   ability to handle life stress, self-efficacy, autonomy, assuming
   responsibility in life, and overall more psychological strength and
   stability. Factors that may pose a risk for weight regain include a

Abstract = {{Evidence that fetal nutrition triggers permanent adjustments in a wide
   range of systems and health outcomes is stimulating interest in the
   evolutionary significance of these responses. This review evaluates the
   postnatal adaptive significance of fetal developmental plasticity from
   the perspective of life history theory and evolutionary models of energy
   partitioning. Birthweight is positively related to multiple
   metabolically costly postnatal functions, suggesting that the fetus has
   the capacity to distribute the burden of energy insufficiency when faced
   with a nutritionally challenging environment. Lowering total
   requirements may reduce the risk of negative energy balance, which
   disproportionately impacts functions that are not essential for survival
   but that are crucial for reproductive success. The long-term benefit of
   these metabolic adjustments is contingent upon the fetus having access
   to a cue that is predictive of its future nutritional environment, a
   problem complicated in a long-lived species by short-term ecologic
   fluctuations like seasonality. Evidence is reviewed suggesting that the
   flow of nutrients reaching the fetus provides an integrated signal of
   nutrition as experienced by recent matrilineal ancestors, which
   effectively limits the responsiveness to short-term ecologic
   fluctuations during any given pregnancy. This capacity for fetal
   nutrition to minimize the growth response to transient ecologic
   fluctuations is defined here as intergenerational ``phenotypic
   inertia,{''} and is hypothesized to allow the fetus to cut through the
   ``noise{''} of seasonal or other stochastic influences to read the
   ``signal{''} of longer-term ecologic trends. As a mode of adaptation,
   phenotypic inertia may help the organism cope with ecologic trends too
   gradual to be tracked by conventional developmental plasticity, but too
   rapid to be tracked by natural selection. From an applied perspective,
   if a trait like fetal growth is designed to minimize the effects of
   short-term fluctuations by integrating information across generations,
   public health interventions may be most effective if focused not on the
   individual but on the matriline. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Individual animals from the same population, sex, age and reproductive
   status often respond differently and consistently to predators. One
   important dimension of this behavioural variation is the shy-bold
   continuum. Innate differences in boldness might explain why individuals

   examined the sources of individual variation in antipredator behaviour
   of adult male lizards Lacerta monticola. We simulated in the laboratory
   repeated predatory attacks of low or high risk and analysed activity
   levels and refuge use in both situations. Multivariate analyses
   suggested the existence of two consistent and independent shy-bold
   continua. The first described a gradient from bold lizards that spent
   shorter times in the refuge after predatory approaches to shy lizards
   with longer emergence times, whereas the other described a gradient from
   bold lizards with a low propensity to hide when the predator was close
   but risk was low to shy lizards that hid more often. We analysed whether
   morphological characteristics, body condition and health (estimated from
   their T cell immunocompetence) of individuals might account for the
   differences observed. Bold individuals had smaller absolute body size,
   but relatively larger heads, better body condition and better health.
   Bold individuals with a low propensity to hide when risk was low had
   larger absolute body sizes, whereas relative head size, and body
   condition and health were not important. We suggest that the position of

Abstract = {{Wintering birds face a trade-off between starvation and predation risk.
   In Eurasian woodcocks, Scolopax rusticola, habitat use may reflect this
   trade-off because meadows, where most birds spend the night, are
   characterized by a higher risk of predation and a higher biomass of food
   (earthworms) than the woods, used by day. We monitored activity of 34
   woodcocks fitted with tiltswitch radiotags Young birds were more active
   than adults, probably because they were less efficient at foraging. In
   general, nocturnal activity was inversely correlated with air
   temperature and with daylight foraging activity, suggesting some
   compensatory mechanism, modulated by thermoregulatory constraints.
   Individual activity patterns differed, and we classified woodcocks
   according to three main wintering strategies: `always', `sometimes' or
   `never' visiting fields at night. The decision to fly to fields at night
   seemed to be taken every evening according to the amount of daylight
   foraging activity in woods and the air temperature. After feeding in a
   rich patch of food on a mild day, woodcocks did not have to risk going
   to meadows. Conversely, in patches of fewer food resources or at lower
   temperatures or both, woodcocks could not meet all their energy
   requirements without going to fields at night (where there was always
   sufficient food) and eventually, changing their diurnal sites.
   Therefore, the trade-off between feeding and predation risk depends on
   how efficiently birds find a rich patch of food in the forest and
   exploit it optimally during the day. (C) 2004 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Bird nestlings may be at risk not only from starvation but also from
   predators attracted to the nest by parental feeding visits. Hence,
   parents could trade reduced visitation rates for a lower predation risk.
   Here, through field data and an experiment, we show plasticity in daily
   patterns of nest visitation in the Siberian jay, Perisoreus infaustus,
   in response to predator activity. In high-risk territories, jay parents
   avoided going to the nest at certain times of the day and compensated by
   allocating more feeding effort to periods when predators were less
   active. Such modifications in provisioning routines allowed parents in
   high-risk habitat to significantly lower the risk of providing
   visitation cues to visually oriented corvid nest predators. These
   results indicate that some birds modify their daily nest visitation
   patterns as a fourth mechanism to reduce predator-attracting nest visits
   in addition to the clutch size reduction, maximization of food
   load-sizes, and prevention of allofeeding suggested by Skutch.}},

Abstract = {{A clear relationship between intrauterine development and later life
   predisposition to long-term disease is well established. Weight at birth
   provides a surrogate measure for fetal development and low birth weight
   predicts changes in most endocrine axes in adulthood. The exposure of
   the fetus to elevated levels of either endogenous or synthetic
   glucocorticoids, pre and periconceptional nutritional status and
   immediate postnatal development including catch-up growth all contribute
   substantially to the development of adult onset disease. Fetal exposure
   to high levels of glucocorticoids has direct clinical relevance.
   Synthetic glucocorticoids (betamethasone/ dexamethasone) are
   administered to women at risk of preterm delivery to advance fetal
   maturation and reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality. However, in
   human pregnancy, evidence suggests that fetal exposure to synthetic
   glucocorticoids has detrimental effects on birth outcome, childhood
   cognition and long-term behavior. Studies in animals have established a
   link between prenatal exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids and
   alterations in fetal development as well as changes in placental
   function. These developmental alterations appear to be permanent.
   Whether this is the case in humans awaits long-term follow-up of
   children enrolled in randomized controlled trials of prenatal
   glucocorticoid therapy. The research challenges in this field are now
   centered on uncovering the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids are
   involved in programming the fetus for its future life, and discovering
   ways in which the effectiveness and safety of antenatal glucocorticoids
   can be enhanced. The purpose of this mini-review is to provide a
   background into the use of antenatal synthetic corticosteroids and to

Abstract = {{Neuroadaptations occurring in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway following
   recurrent exposure to drugs of abuse have been correlated with a
   behavioral phenomenon known as behavioral sensitization. We have
   developed an animal model of prenatal cocaine exposure and, using a
   postnatal sensitization protocol, have examined the subsequent
   sensitivity of offspring to cocaine. Pregnant Swiss Webster dams were
   injected twice daily from embryonic day 8 to 17, inclusive, with cocaine
   (COC40: administered cocaine HCl at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day, and COC20:
   administered cocaine HCl at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day), or saline ( SAL).
   The SPF40 group ( saline pair-fed), a nutritional control group, was
   `pair-fed' with COC40 dams. Activity was recorded for 30 min during a
   3-day saline habituation, a 14-day `initiation' phase, when animals
   received cocaine ( 15 mg/kg) or saline every other day, and following a
   21-day `withdrawal' period when all mice were challenged with cocaine.
   COC40 offspring, as compared with SAL controls, did not habituate to a
   novel environment, demonstrated increased cocaine-induced stereotypy on
   Coc 1 (first cocaine injection), and blunted locomotor sensitization on
   challenge as measured by the percentage of each animal's baseline
   locomotion. Tissue samples of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and striatum
   (Str) of all four prenatal treatment groups were examined to determine
   whether alterations in the transcription factor CREB or glutamate
   receptor subunit, GluR1, induced by prenatal cocaine treatment may have
   contributed to the altered behavioral responses. Immunoblot quantitation
   revealed significantly increased constitutive CREB expression in the NAc

   constitutive CREB levels may contribute to some of the behavioral
   differences reported in adult mice exposed to cocaine in utero.

Abstract = {{Several empirical studies have demonstrated the existence of
   intraspecific variation in age and size at reproductive maturity for
   organisms experiencing different food environments and predation risk.
   For some species, these changes have been shown to arise primarily
   through changes in foraging activity. Theoretically, changes in age and
   size at maturity can arise through either behavioural or physiological
   responses. Here we analyse two models. The first is a conventional
   life-history model with no explicit recognition of the physiology of
   energy utilization by the organism - growth (i.e. weight gain) is simply
   the difference between assimilation and respiration, and there are no
   physiological restrictions on the timing of maturation. The changes in
   age and size at maturity in response to food availability and predation
   risk predicted by this model are consistent with published experimental
   data for one particular species, the midge Chironomus tentans. Numerical
   calculations with parameters appropriate to this species suggest that
   the optimal response is purely behavioural. The second model is a
   general, dynamic energy budget model that takes account of the energetic
   costs associated with development to reproductive maturity. With that
   model, we prove that the optimum partitioning of energy between growth
   and development is independent of predation risk and food availability,
   thereby demonstrating the generality of the previous finding with the
   life-history model. On the basis of the combined insight from the two
   models, we propose that fixed allocation to growth and development.
   despite variation in food availability and predation risk, is optimal
   for a broad class of life histories. Consequently, the absence of an
   allocation response to experimental manipulation of food or predators
   should not necessarily be taken as evidence for physiological or other
   constraints on life-history adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Until recently, the principal causes of degenerative disease were
   thought to act in adult life and to accelerate destructive processes,
   such as the formation of atheroma and rise in blood pressure. Recent
   observations that people who develop coronary heart disease grow
   differently to other people during fetal life and childhood have,
   however, led to a new `developmental' model for the disease. Low
   birthweight has been shown to be associated with increased rates of
   coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and altered glucose
   tolerance. These associations with low birthweight extend across the
   normal range of birthweight and reflect slow fetal growth rather than
   premature birth. The associations are thought to be consequences of
   developmental plasticity, the phenomenon by which one genotype can give
   rise to a range of different physiological or morphological states in
   response to different environmental conditions during development.
   Recent observations suggest that low birthweight, thinness at 2 years of
   age and an increase in body mass index (BMI) after the age of 2 years
   are each associated with the development of insulin resistance in later
   life. The prevention of a substantial proportion of type 2 diabetes and
   other disorders linked to insulin resistance may, therefore, depend on
   interventions during development. These include protecting the growth of
   babies during the first 2 years after birth by good infant feeding
   practices and preventing a rapid increase in BMI after the age of 2
   years. Improving fetal nutrition remains an important long-term goal.

   (genotype-environment interaction). To do this, we measured genetic
   variation and covariation under two environmental conditions -
   relatively low and relatively high food availability. We found high
   levels of genetic variation for most traits, but we only found a
   significant G x E interaction across food levels for one trait (body
   size) for one population. The across-environment correlations for size
   were large and positive, indicating that the reaction norms for size did
   not cross. We also found that male colour pattern elements had nearly an
   order of magnitude more genetic variation than did male size.
   Heritability estimates indicated that Y-linked genes are responsible for
   some of the genetic variation in male size and colour traits. We discuss

Abstract = {{Intertidal invertebrates are model organisms for examining the
   environmental control of life-history traits because of the sharp
   gradients in biological and physical factors found in their habitat,
   including wave action, temperature, food availability, and predation.
   However, the effect of a particular factor on ecological and
   evolutionary processes is difficult to separate when multiple factors
   vary simultaneously. We examined shifts in life-history traits in the
   intertidal gastropod Littorina saxatilis Olivi across an intertidal
   shoreline where predation appears to have little influence. We
   determined the density, size, fecundity, and size at maturity of snails
   in 4 distinct zones across the shoreline and estimated growth rates in
   each zone. Size, fecundity, median size at maturity, and growth rate all
   exhibited pronounced clines across the shoreline with higher values in
   the lower zones, where food abundance was highest. Snail density,
   however, peaked in the mid-zones. The clines in life-history traits
   corresponded with food availability and environmental stress (wave
   forces and desiccation stress), and these factors were the likely
   determinants of the patterns observed. We also conducted a reciprocal
   transplant experiment between the extreme zones to assess if any
   differences in growth rate might have a genetic basis. Snails
   transplanted from the high zone to the low zone grew 7 times faster than
   snails that remained in the high zone and, more unexpectedly, 1.6 times
   greater than local snails from the low zone. Snails transplanted from
   the low zone to the high zone did not grow at all while local snails
   from the high zone had slow, although measurable, growth. These
   divergent responses of transplanted snails (i.e. counter-gradient
   variation) suggest that there may be differential size-dependent
   selection between the extreme zones with the greater wave forces of the
   low shore selecting against fast growth which would otherwise be
   supported by the abundance of food found there.}},

   reduced growth. We examined the growth, behavior and energy storage
   responses of juvenile Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis exposed to
   a thermally induced reduction in growth. Halibut reared for 12 wk at 2
   degrees C then acclimated to and grown at 10 degrees C (delayed

   (controls). Growth rates at 2 degrees C were 25\% of those at 10 degrees
   C, resulting in a 2.4-fold difference in mass after 12 wk. Following
   acclimation to 10 degrees C, specific growth rates of delayed fish were
   20\% higher than controls. Complete compensation would have required 35
   wk, assuming maintenance of observed growth rate differences between
   treatments. Rapid growth during the compensation phase was probably due
   in part to a reduction in the allocation of energy to lipid storage:
   length-corrected lipid levels of delayed fish were 14\% lower than
   levels among control fish. Behavioral observations indicated that growth
   compensating fish were more active than control fish; this is assumed to
   reflect increased foraging activity. However, when presented with food,
   growth-compensating halibut did not initiate feeding more rapidly than
   control fish. The predation and starvation risks associated with
   increased activity and decreased energy storage appear to represent
   trade-offs with rapid compensatory growth in juvenile halibut.}},

Abstract = {{Periods of poor nutrition during early development may have negative

   likely to affect size and timing of maturity, which in turn may lead to
   reduced reproductive success or survivorship. In light of these costs,
   individuals may achieve compensatory growth via behavioural or

   examined the effects of a temporary period of food restriction on
   subsequent growth and age and size at maturity in the larval damselfly
   Ischnura verticalis (Odonata: Coenagrionidae). We also asked whether
   this temporary period of reduced nutrition affected subsequent foraging
   behaviour under predation risk. I. verticalis larvae exposed to a
   temporary food shortage suffered from a reduced growth rate during this
   period relative to a control group that was fed ad libitum. However,
   increased growth rates later in development ensured that adult body size
   measurements ( head and pronotum widths) did not differ between the
   treatments upon emergence. In contrast, adult dry mass did not catch up
   to that of the controls, indicating that the increased growth rates for

Abstract = {{Reports of postpartum parental care in squamate reptiles (lizards and
   snakes) are rare and generally anecdotal. We investigated parental care
   in black rock skinks, Egernia saxatilis, from southeastern Australia.
   These lizards live in small family groups, with adults defending
   territories against conspecifics. juvenile lizards live within their
   parents' territory and may thus be protected from infanticide. In staged
   encounters in the laboratory, adults frequently attacked unrelated
   juveniles but not their own offspring, and the parent's presence
   significantly reduced the incidence of this infanticidal aggression.
   This protection arose not through specific `parental' behaviours, but
   because adults tended to ignore juveniles when another (potentially
   threatening) adult was present. When two family groups were placed in
   the same enclosure, one family rapidly became dominant over the other.
   juveniles of the dominant family derived thermoregulatory and foraging
   benefits from their parents' status. Thus, some lizards do show
   postpartum parental care, and may thereby significantly benefit their
   progeny via reduced risk of infanticide and better access to thermal and
   nutritional resources. (C) 2004 Die Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Food preferences were investigated in cuttlefish during the first 3
   months' posthatching, using choice tests between crabs, shrimps, and
   young fish. The results showed that without previous feeding experience,
   cuttlefish preferred shrimps on Day 3. This suggests an innate food
   preference; however, it was possible to induce a preference for an
   originally nonpreferred prey item in 3-day-old and naive cuttlefish,
   demonstrating the flexibility of this initial behavioral preference in
   response to previous individual experience. This preference suggests a
   learning process involving a form of long-term memory, demonstrated for
   the first time in juvenile cuttlefish. Until Day 30, juvenile cuttlefish
   fed exclusively shrimps chose shrimps. This preference probably depends
   on their previous feeding experience. Finally, it appears that from Day
   60, cuttlefish reared on the same restricted diet have a tendency to
   switch their preference to novel prey items, which diversify their diet.

Abstract = {{There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that iron chelation may
   be a useful therapy in the treatment of Parkinson's Disease (PD).
   Experiments were designed to test the impact of dietary iron
   availability on the pathogenic process and functional outcome in a mouse
   model of PD. Mice were fed diets containing low (4 ppm) or adequate (48
   ppm) amounts of iron for 6 weeks before the administration of MPTP, a
   mitochondrial toxin that damages nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and
   induces Parkinson-like symptoms. Low dietary iron increased serum total
   iron binding capacity (P<0.001). Consistent with neuronal protection,
   iron restriction increased sphingomyelin C16:0 and decreased ceramide
   C16:0. However, there was a 35\% decrease in striatal dopamine (DA) in
   iron-restricted mice. Motor behavior was also impaired in these animals.
   In vitro studies suggested that severe iron restriction could lead to
   p53-mediated neuronal apoptosis. Administration of MPTP reduced striatal
   DA (P<0.01) and impaired motor behavior in iron-adequate mice. However,
   in iron-restricted mice, striatal dopamine levels and motor behavior
   were unchanged compared to saline-treated mice. Thus, while reduced iron
   may provide protection against PD-inducing insults such as MPTP, the
   role of iron in the synthesis of DA and neuronal survival should be
   considered, particularly in the development of iron-chelating agents to
   be used chronically in the clinical setting. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{We describe the social organization, mating system, and social structure
   of a group of hybrid baboons (Papio anubis x P. hamadryas) in Ethiopia's
   Awash National Park. The group contained elements of both hamadryas and

   that lacked cohesion and frequently formed subgroups. Subgroup formation
   was more strongly associated with predation risk than food availability.
   Although there were several hamadryas-like one-male units OMUs within
   the group, there was no evidence of a hamadryas multilevel society. Male
   and female members of OMUs were phenotypically more hamadryas-like than
   non-OMU individuals. The group contained substantial variation in the
   strength of inter- and intrasexual bonds: some females primarily groomed
   males while other females primarily groomed females, and the patterns
   were consistent with the OMU substructure. Despite some promiscuous
   mating, mating was biased towards the hamadryas condition for all group
   members. Additionally, rates of immigration and emigration were very
   low, and mean pairwise relatedness within the group is rising. For
   measures of intersexual bonding, all members of the group were
   intermediate between anubis and hamadryas individuals in less hybridized

   experiments, we observed that domestic trout (selected for high growth
   rates) took greater risks while foraging and grew faster than a wild

   upon the predation environment. Domestic trout experienced greater
   survival when risk was low, but lower survival when risk was high. This
   suggests that animals with high intrinsic growth rates are selected

Abstract = {{The strength of an animal's behavioural response to human presence has
   often been used as an index of an animal's susceptibility to
   disturbance. However, if behavioural responsiveness is positively
   related to the animal's condition, this may be an inappropriate index,
   as individuals showing little or no response may in fact be those with
   most to lose from changing their behaviour. We tested the link between
   individual state and responsiveness by manipulating condition via the
   provision of supplementary food for turnstones, Arenaria interpres, on
   rocky shores. Birds at one site were fed 450 g of mealworms at low tide
   every day for 3 days while birds at another site acted as a control. On
   the fourth day, using a standardized disturbance protocol, we recorded
   flush distances, flight lengths and the amount of time between predator
   scans for birds in both flocks. After a break of 3 days, the treatments
   were then swapped between sites and the procedure repeated for a total
   of six trials. Birds whose condition had been enhanced showed greater
   responsiveness to standardized human disturbance, flying away at greater
   distances from the observer, scanning more frequently for predators and
   flying further when flushed. These findings suggest that our current
   management of the impact of human disturbance may be based on inaccurate
   assessments of vulnerability, and we discuss the implications of this
   for refuge provision. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Increasing substrate structural complexity has been linked to higher
   densities of various refuge-seeking aquatic macroinvertebrates, many of
   which constitute major prey species in a variety of freshwater
   communities. We investigated (1) whether the three-spined stickleback,
   Gasterosteus aculeatus, a predator of such macroinvertebrates and an
   established model organism in studies of animal behaviour, is capable of
   discriminating between structurally complex and simple substrates, and
   (2) whether they show a substrate preference when foraging.
   Hunger-motivated sticklebacks presented with a choice of simple and
   complex substrate types preferentially foraged over complex substrates.
   This was seen when the prey density was equal on both substrate types,
   and when it was greater on the complex substrate. Where prey density was
   greater on the simple substrate, fish showed no preference for either.
   The preference for complex substrates existed in both the allocation of
   time spent foraging and in the direction and frequency of feeding
   strikes. No substrate preferences were seen in fish that were satiated,
   or when prey were absent from both substrates. This ruled out refuge as
   an explanation for the observed preference. We discuss the results in

Abstract = {{In group-living animals, competition for a scarce resource often results
   in the formation of dominance hierarchies. Dominant individuals garner
   more of that resource for themselves through the use of aggression,
   forcing subordinates to rely on nonaggressive strategies to secure it.
   Stealing from dominants is common, but subordinate thieves can risk
   attack if caught. How, then, do subordinates decide when and where to
   steal? We explored whether the opportunity to learn about the location
   and availability of food might facilitate food-stealing attempts by male
   blue gouramis, Trichogaster trichopterus, a freshwater tropical fish.
   Our results show that subordinates were able to use learned cues to
   mount highly effective `sneaky' tactics. By anticipating food location
   and availability, subordinates reduced the number of attacks they
   received as well as the amount of time they spent fleeing from
   dominants. More importantly, however, our results revealed unexpected
   plasticity in the cognitive mechanisms underlying this learning: like
   privately trained dominants, privately trained subordinates learned to
   approach food cues directly; however, on the very first occasion that
   subordinates were tested with a dominant present, they dramatically
   altered their previously learned direct approach to food cues,
   immediately adopting a different, sneaky tactic instead. Thus,
   subordinates were able to combine information about previous learning,
   namely an `expectancy' of food, with the probability of future attack
   and adjust their food-getting strategy accordingly. (C) 2004 The

Abstract = {{One hundred and twenty-eight pigs were reared in barren or enriched

   as litter-mate groups until 8 weeks of age when they were mixed into
   groups of eight animals. These groups were balanced for gender and
   weight and contained two pigs from each of four different litters. Each
   pig was assigned high or low social status on the basis of relative
   success in aggressive interactions at mixing. Injury levels were
   assessed on a weekly basis from 8 to 2 1 weeks of age. Pigs were exposed
   to two group food competition tests after a period of food restriction
   at 10 weeks of age, and to an individual novel pen test at 11 weeks of
   age. Behavioural and plasma cortisol responses to both types of test
   were recorded. Low social status was associated with increased injuries
   to the head, neck and ears, and therefore reduced welfare. Pigs with low
   social status showed reduced resource-holding ability in the food
   competition test, and greater avoidance of a novel object during the
   novel pen test. It is suggested that avoidance of the novel object
   reflected `learned' fearfulness in these individuals. Environmental
   enrichment did not negate the effect of low social status on injury
   levels, but did appear to reduce the negative influence of low social
   status on stress during food restriction, and led to a reduction in
   fearfulness in response to the novel pen test. These results suggest
   that environmental enrichment may improve the we/fare of growing pigs
   with low social status.}},

Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{The development in organic livestock production can be attributed to an
   increased consumer interest in organic products while, at the same time,
   increased fanners' interest in converting to organic production
   methods-often stimulated by governmental support or subsidies. It is
   important that organic production systems can fulfil the expectations of
   each of these stakeholders if organic livestock production is to
   increase further. This is of particular importance if organic pig and
   poultry production (other than egg) is to move from the present
   niche-production to a significant place in the food market, as in the
   case of beef and milk.
   It can be argued that the limited organic pork and poultry production is
   related to the fact that it is far more difficult for farmers to change
   the existing production systems for pig and poultry compared to
   production systems for cattle and other ruminants in a way that gives a
   harmonious balance between the different aims of organic fanning.
   Conflicts may occur as to the most appropriate rearing practice in
   considerating the basic aspects of the innate behaviour of animals on
   one hand, the risk of pollution from the production on the other and, in
   addition, the aim of producing in sufficient quantities. These possible
   conflicts are reflected in the compromises made in national or EU
   regulations on organic fanning. In the regulations for organic farming,
   the aspect of allowing a high degree of natural behaviour of the
   livestock is, among others, translated in the requirement that
   livestock, in certain periods of their life or of the year, should be
   allowed to graze or have access to an outdoor area. The most common
   outdoor systems for pig and poultry used in intensively managed organic
   production have some significant drawbacks in relation to environmental
   impact (risk of N-leaching and ammonia volatilisation), animal welfare
   (nose-ringed sows), high mortality in poultry and workload and
   management constraints.
   From recent experience of such systems, it is argued that there is a
   need for a radical development of the systems. There is a need for
   outdoor/free range systems (for the sake of the livestock), which are
   constructed and managed in such a way that the livestock, at the same
   time, exert a positive influence on other parts of the fanning system.
   There is evidence that pregnant sows can fulfil their nutritional needs
   to a large extent by grazing, that co-grazing sows with heifers can
   diminish the parasite burden of the heifers, and that the pig
   inclination for rooting can be managed in a way that makes ploughing and
   other heavy land cultivation more or less superfluous. As regard
   poultry, there is an indication that quite big flocks can be managed
   efficiently in a way where the flock act as weeders in other crops or
   fight pests in orchards. These elements need to be further explored as a
   basis for future system development. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Productivity of meat-type chicken dramatically improved, thanks to
   concomitant progress of the rearing methods, nutrition, genetics and
   veterinary medecine. The whole resulted in a strong reduction of
   slaughter age. As the latter is the main factor of sensory meat quality,
   it was the principal criterion of the qualitative segmentation of
   chicken production. Begun in the sixties, it resulted in differentiation
   between standard chickens, chickens with so-called `appellation
   d'origine controlee', `Label' chickens and certified chickens.
   More recently a second axis, related to the level of elaboration of
   products (whole carcass, jointed products or transformed products) has
   been developed. The productivity of the standard products is high but
   not so much higher than that of certified chicken. The difference could
   be compensated by the guarantees of traceability and production brought
   by certification. In term of quality also, part of the differences are
   vanishing, because the consumer's choices evolve and the difference in
   taste is especially marked for the thighs that are economically less
   important. However, the differences in transformation rate are in favour
   of faster-growing chickens. While the animal can express their natural
   behavior more when reared outside, they run an increased risk of
   microbial contaminations. With reference to all these results, it seems
   difficult to predict how the chicken production will evolve. But it
   appears clearly that the certified chicken. intermediary between
   standard chicken and Label chicken will develop.}},

   Results: The overall mean (+/-s.d.) BMI was 26.6 (+/-5.7); 79 (37\%)
   reported infrequent (<weekly) reflux and 16 (8\%) reported frequent
   (greater than or equal toweekly) reflux. The median caloric intake was

Abstract = {{Pathogens can alter host behavior and affect the outcome of
   predator-prey interactions. Acute phase responses of hosts (e.g., a
   change in activity level or behavioral fever) often signal an infection,
   but the ecological consequences of host behavioral changes largely are
   unexplored, particularly for directly transmitted (i.e., single-host)
   pathogens. We performed three experiments to test the hypothesis that a
   pathogen, Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV), alters host behavior of
   Sonoran tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum stebbinsi Lowe, 1954) and
   enhances predation. In the first experiment, salamander larvae exposed
   to ATV experienced 48\% lower mortality from dragonfly Anax junius
   (Drury, 1773) larvae than those in controls. Second, uninfected and
   infected larvae exposed to the nonlethal (caged) presence of predators
   did not significantly differ in their distance from the predator.
   Infected salamanders significantly increased their activity level
   relative to those in controls in predator-free conditions. Finally,
   ATV-infected larvae preferred significantly warmer temperatures than
   uninfected larvae, but larvae reared at the thermal maximum for the
   virus all died. High host activity level yet retention of effective
   antipredator responses likely benefits ATV because this single-host
   pathogen relies on host survival for transmission. Preference for warmer
   temperatures may be associated with the host response to pathogens and
   may help fight infection.}},

Abstract = {{Aggregations of zooplankton, micronekton and fish are frequently
   observed above seamounts, canyons and shelf breaks. The aggregations are
   produced by five different mechanisms, all driven by ocean currents.
   Upwelling is frequently generated when ambient currents impinge on
   abrupt topographies. Nevertheless, upwelling enhances local production
   of zooplankton and fish only over large topographies such as shelf
   breaks, where the residence time of the upwelled water is sufficiently
   long to allow enrichment in primary production to propagate up the food
   web and augment the growth of resident animals. Daily accumulations
   occur over topographies at shallow and intermediate depths when the
   topography blocks the morning descent of migrating zooplankton. This
   mechanism is common over seamounts. Two other mechanisms are driven by
   behavioural response to vertical currents when zooplankton swims
   vertically in order to maintain depth: accumulations by depth retention
   against upwelling are common at depths to which migrating zooplankton
   descend during the day, while depth retention against downwelling seems
   to operate only in the upper water column (e.g., along topographically
   generated fronts). The fifth mechanism is driven by the amplification of
   currents over abrupt topographies. Strong currents enhance population
   growth of resident animals by augmenting fluxes of suspended food. A
   feed-rest hypothesis is proposed to explain how site-attached
   planktivorous fish can benefit from strong currents at sites with ample
   quiescence shelters in which the fish rest during nonfeeding, intervals.
   Four of the above mechanisms generate ``trophic focusing{''}, a process
   by which prey from immense volumes of flowing water is accumulated (or
   trapped) in a relatively small confined area. The ensuing subsidy of
   prey propagates up the food web, supporting aggregations of higher
   predators, such as fish, marine mammals and fishermen. Abrupt
   topographies can have an important role in determining trophic
   interactions in the marine realm. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights

Abstract = {{There is increasing awareness that combinations of biotic and time
   stress interact in shaping life history plasticity. Despite being
   widespread and abundant, the role of cannibalism in linking both types
   of constraints to life history plasticity has been largely neglected.
   Moreover, no studies disentangled direct (due to the extra meal) and
   indirect (due to the elimination of the competitor) life history effects
   of cannibalism, and little is known about their differential dependency
   on these constraints. We studied effects of cannibalism on the life
   history of the damselfly Lestes viridis under combinations of time
   stress (by manipulating the perceived time available in the growth
   season) and food stress. We reared larvae per two and disentangled
   direct and indirect effects of cannibalism by preventing cannibalism in
   half of the cups and by manipulating the per capita food increase after
   cannibalism. Cannibalism was more frequent under both time stress and
   food stress and our results show it may help cannibals to compensate for
   the negative effects of these constraints imposed on life history. Both
   direct and indirect benefits of cannibalism (increased development and
   growth rates, larger mass at emergence) were dependent on the timing of
   cannibalism, being more pronounced or only present when cannibalism
   occurred early. Moreover, we found that the ecological constraints (time
   stress and food stress) also differentially shaped some of the direct
   and indirect effects. Given the differential context-dependency of
   direct and indirect effects and the fact that direct and indirect life
   history effects may be both important in shaping life history,
   disentangling these effects is critical to mechanistically understand
   under which conditions cannibalism is expected to be adaptive or not.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Vertigo is one of the most frequent complaints in general
   medical practice and is often linked to psychiatric disorders. A
   longitudinal study of 67 patients with an acute vestibular disorder was
   undertaken to clarify if, after experiencing acute vestibular vertigo,
   certain patients have a higher likelihood of developing chronic,
   debilitating dizziness despite no evidence of a damaged peripheral
   vestibular system. Method: The severity of dizziness was determined in
   67 patients with vestibular neuronitis, 6 months after their release
   from hospital, using the Vertigo Symptom Scale from Yardley et al. The
   intensity of anxiety directly after vertigo was experienced,
   body-related cognitions, illness coping, personality structure, and the
   recovery of the organ of equilibrium were recorded in order to explain
   the severity of vertigo that occurred after 6 months. The function of
   the organ of equilibrium was assessed by using a caloric test. Results:
   Over a period of 6 months, 13 of the 67 patients (19.4\%) reported
   continuing dizziness after neuropathia vestibularis. Eleven of the 13
   patients showed high scores on a scale for measuring vertigo-related
   symptoms, which can be interpreted as being equivalent to anxiety. The
   variables of gender, catastrophic thoughts and a dependent personality
   accounted for 35\% of why vertigo became chronic. Conclusion:
   Neuropathia vestibularis represents a risk factor for the development of
   chronic vertigo. Chronic vertigo after neuropathia vestibularis appears
   to be equivalent to anxiety and is partly conditional on catastrophic
   thoughts at the beginning.}},

Abstract = {{Life history theory predicts that reproductive effort should increase as
   life expectancy decreases. Empirical evidence in support of this
   hypothesis is still fragmentary. We measured the effects of different
   potential indexes of mortality risk on oviposition in a geometrid moth
   Scotopteryx chenopodiata L. We conducted two experiments: in one we
   manipulated mortality risk by clipping wings or depriving the moths of
   food; in the other we studied the effect of incidental injuries, and
   varied host quality and food availability. Physical injuries led to a
   higher oviposition rate and shorter latency (i.e. a shorter
   discrimination period before oviposition) on both a high-ranked and a
   low-ranked host. High mortality risk was associated with a shorter
   latency to oviposit on the low-ranked, but not on the high-ranked host.
   These effects remained significant when we controlled for the influences
   of estimated adult age and eggload. Insects deprived of food as adults
   increased oviposition activity in the first experiment but not in the
   second. Our results suggest that certain cues of an adverse environment,

Abstract = {{In this study we identify the size-dependent risk of winter starvation
   mortality as a strong selective pressure on age-0 rainbow trout
   (Oncorhynchus mykiss) that could promote the risk-taking behaviour and
   allocation of energy to lipids previously observed in young trout
   cohorts. Age-0 trout subjected to simulated winter starvation conditions
   gradually depleted lipid reserves to a critical minimum lipid content
   below which death occurred. Small fish with lower lipid content
   exhausted lipid reserves earlier, and experienced high mortality rates
   sooner, than larger fish with greater lipid content. Consequently,
   winter starvation endurance was dependent upon size-dependent lipid
   reserves and winter duration. To validate the laboratory findings in the
   field, we stocked several size classes of hatchery-raised trout with
   known lipid content at the start of winter into two experimental lakes,
   and estimated survival and lipid depletion at winter's end. Larger age-0
   trout had greater initial lipid reserves than smaller trout. Individuals
   depleted most of their lipid reserves over the winter, and experienced

Abstract = {{Freshwater fairy shrimp that live in episodically filled rainpools are
   obligate bisexual animals that produce drought-resistant, encapsulated
   embryos called cysts. A fraction of these hatches upon each inundation,
   a bet-hedging strategy, and the resulting larvae grow in a concerted
   manner, forming a cohort. Here, we show that in the Sudan fairy shrimp,
   Streptocephalus proboscideus, about one-third of the cysts hatches
   shortly after being released from the brood-sac, without intervening
   period of drought. However, as long as the adult population overshoots a
   density of about one specimen per litre, the emerging nauplii are
   cannibalized by their parents. At such a density and above it, fairy
   shrimp filter the whole pond volume in less than 24 h and since it takes
   about the same amount of time for first-instar nauplii to moult to an
   immune size, they are all consumed. In addition to being
   auto-regulatory, this behaviour is adaptive: animals fed their own
   nauplii on top of an algal diet showed a 30\% increase in reproductive
   output, and an increase in somatic growth rate. This allocation almost
   quantitatively recouped the loss of inclusive fitness to cannibalism. In
   contrast, hatching percentages of cysts obtained from animals fed this

   their bet-hedging strategy remains intact and is carried forward to the

Abstract = {{1. For many species, human-induced disturbances can severely influence
   an individual's pay-off; however, energy-cost variations from different
   disturbance types have rarely been reported.
   2. We evaluated the dynamic behavioural responses of staging greater
   snow geese Anser caerulescens atlanticus to different types of
   disturbance in southern Quebec, Canada, between 1997 and 2000. We
   specifically considered the impact of a unique measure, a spring
   conservation hunt implemented in agricultural habitats in 1999.
   3. We tracked 237 radio-tagged females for 2764 h and recorded 697
   take-offs following fortuitous disturbance, scaring and hunting in three
   regions characterized by different habitats. Geese used cornfields in
   south-western Quebec, Scirpus marshes and hayfields in the upper St
   Lawrence estuary, and Spartina marshes and hayfields in the lower
   estuary.
   4. Overall, disturbance levels increased in the upper and lower estuary
   during years with hunting, mostly through an increase in hunting and
   scaring activities.
   5. The probability of geese returning to a refuge after disturbance in
   agricultural habitats increased in years with hunting except in the
   corn-growing region. The short-term energy gain of geese resuming
   feeding after disturbance was less than before disturbance, and this
   difference was greater in years with hunting. Distances flown after
   disturbance decreased with flock size and were longer after scaring and
   hunting than after fortuitous disturbances in the Scirpus region.
   6. Overall, habitat use varied among years and associated estimated
   energy gain decreased markedly in both years with hunting in the
   Spartina and corn-growing region, but did not change in the Scirpus
   region. Changes in behaviour due to disturbance, and especially those
   associated with hunting, probably contributed to the reduced body
   condition of staging greater snow geese during years with hunting.
   7. Synthesis and applications. From a methodological viewpoint, we
   highlight the importance of tracking the behaviour of individual animals
   after disturbance to properly evaluate its impact. From a conservation
   perspective, we provide empirical arguments to limit the hunting of
   breeding waterfowl during their prenuptial migration in order to
   facilitate their fattening and forthcoming reproduction. From a
   management standpoint, we suggest that a side-effect of disturbance
   induced by spring hunting to control overabundant populations may be
   reduced fattening and breeding output among birds that survive.
   Together, these data emphasize further the importance of measuring the
   direct and indirect effects of disturbance rather than assuming effects
   from the incidence of the disturbance alone.}},

Abstract = {{To examine the role of individual variation in the dynamics of group
   information, I conducted a mark-recapture study and a series of
   laboratory and field experiments with Holocnemus pluchei spiders
   (Araneae: Pholcidae). These spiders can either share webs or live alone,
   and individuals shift frequently between these strategies. Spiders'
   decisions were influenced by size and recent feeding success. In the
   laboratory, small hungry spiders introduced into a web that held a
   larger conspecific resident were more likely than small well-fed spiders
   to abandon the web and build their own web. This behaviour pattern
   gradually reversed as spiders grew: large hungry spiders were more
   likely than large well-fed spiders to stay in the shared web. When I
   introduced spiders into empty webs,they were more likely to stay
   compared with spiders tested with conspecifics. However, hunger level
   also influenced behaviour even when conspecifics were not present.
   Food-deprived spiders were more likely to abandon webs and build their
   own, consistent with the idea that spiders were following a win-stay
   lose-shift strategy. In the field, spiders were more likely to stay in
   webs overnight when they were given supplemental food. In another
   experiment, spiders that we re found building webs in cleared areas were
   smaller and thinner than average. Finally, I tested whether the size of
   the intruder or the resident affected whether spiders joined webs. Large
   intruders were more successful if remaining,in webs than smaller
   intruders, although spiders of all sizes had some success in joining
   groups. Additional synthetic theoretical work is needed to integrate the
   complex processes underlying the formation and persistence of groups.

   immobilization and housing conditions on the behavior of malnourished
   rats. Pups (6 males and 2 females) were fed by Wistar lactating dams
   receiving a 6\% (undernourished) or 16\% (well-nourished) protein diet.
   After weaning, the animals continued to receive the same diets ad
   libitum until 49 days of age when they started to receive a regular lab
   chow diet. From weaning to the end of the tests on day 70, the animals
   were housed under two different conditions, i.e., individual or in
   groups of three. On the 69th day, half of the animals were submitted to
   immobilization for 2 h, while the other half were undisturbed, and both
   groups were tested 24 h later for 5 min in the EPM. Independent of other
   factors, protein malnutrition increased, while immobilization and social
   isolation per se decreased, EPM exploration. Analysis of the interaction
   of diet vs immobilization vs housing conditions showed that the
   increased EPM exploration presented by the malnourished group was
   reversed by acute immobilization in animals reared in groups but not in
   animals reared individually. The interaction between immobilization and
   housing conditions suggests that living for a long time in social
   isolation is sufficiently stressful to reduce the responses to another
   anxiogenic procedure (immobilization), while living in groups prompts
   the animals to react to acute stress. Thus, it is suggested that housing
   condition can modulate the effects of an anxiogenic procedure on
   behavioral responses of malnourished rats in the EPM.}},

Abstract = {{In standardized ecotoxicological testing chemicals are investigated
   under optimal conditions for the test organisms despite the fact that
   environmental factors such as predation pressure and food availability
   are important parameters regulating natural populations. Food limitation
   and predator presence can induce shifts in life-history traits in
   various Daphnia species, especially trade-offs in reproductive biomass
   allocation. These adaptive responses are thought to ensure survival of
   the population in a highly variable environment. A xenobiotic dispersant
   (used in textile dyeing processes) also shifted the biomass allocation
   of Daphnia magna. To assess whether the dispersant could hinder D. magna
   adaptation to varying environmental conditions, we conducted experiments
   with food level and presence of Chaoborus larvae as environmental
   factors and simultaneous exposure to the dispersant. At low food level
   and in presence of the predator, D. magna produced fewer but larger
   sized neonates, regardless of dispersant exposure. The dispersant
   shifted biomass allocation towards more but smaller sized offspring in
   all experiments. However, the adaptive response to the environmental
   factors and the dispersant effect cancelled each other out in that they
   induced independently from each other opposite shifts in biomass
   allocation. In summary, the dispersant exposure resulted not in an
   inhibition of the adaptive response but in a reduction of the value of
   the response. Our study with this model substance demonstrates that
   xenobiotics can affect the adaptation of organisms to environmental
   stress which can result in effects likely to be overlooked in
   standardized testing. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Social phobia (also known as social anxiety disorder) is still not
   clearly understood. It was not established as an authentic psychiatric
   entity until the diagnostic nomenclature of the American Psychiatric
   Association DSM III in 1980. In recent years, increasing attention among
   researchers has contributed to provide important information about the
   genetic, familial and temperamental bases of social phobia and its
   neurochemical, neuroendocrinological and neuroanatomical substrates,
   which remain to be further investigated. Up to date, there have been
   several findings about the possible influence of variables, including
   particularly genetic, socio-familial and early temperamental (eg
   behavioral inhibition) factors that represent risk for the later
   development of social phobia. Clinical neurobiological studies, based on
   the use of exogenous compounds such as lactate, CO2, caffeine,
   epinephrine, flumazenil or cholecystokinin/pentagastrin to reproduce
   naturally occurring phobic anxiety, have shown that patients with social
   phobia appear to exhibit an intermediate sensitivity between patients
   with panic disorder and control subjects. No difference in the rate of
   panic attacks in response to lactate, low concentrations of CO2 (5 \%),
   epinephrine or flumazenil was observed between patients with social
   phobia and normal healthy subjects, both being less reactive compared to
   patients with panic disorder. However, patients with social phobia had
   similar anxiety reactions to high concentrations of CO2 (35 \%),
   caffeine or cholecystokinin/pentagastrin than those seen in patients
   with panic disorder, both being more intensive than in controls. Several
   lines of evidence suggest specific neurotransmitter system alterations
   in social phobia, especially with regard to the serotoninergic,
   noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems. Although no abnormality in
   platelet serotonin transporter density has been found, patients with
   social phobia appear to show an enhanced sensitivity of both
   post-synaptic 5HT(1A) and 5HT(2) serotonin receptor subtypes, as
   reflected by increased anxiety and hormonal responses to serotoninergic
   probes. Platelet 5HT2 receptor density has also been reported to be
   positively correlated to symptom severity in patients with social
   phobia. During anticipation of public speaking, heart rate was elevated
   inpatients with social phobia compared to controls. Norepinephrine
   response to the orthostatic challenge test or to the Valsalva maneuver
   was also greater in patients with social phobia. While normal
   beta-adrenergic receptor number was observed in lymphocytes, a blunted
   response of growth hormone to clonidine, an alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist,
   was reported. This suggests reduced post-synaptic alpha(2)-adrenergic
   receptor functioning related to norepinephrine overactivity in social
   phobia. Decreased cerebrospinal fluid levels of the dopamine metabolite
   homovanillic acid have also been observed. There are relatively few
   reports of involvement of the adrenal and thyroid functions in social
   phobia, and all that has been noted is that patients with social phobia
   show an exaggerated adrenocortical response to a psychological stressor.
   Recent advances in neuro-imaging have contributed to find low striatal
   dopamine D-2 receptor binding or low dopamine transporter site density
   in patients with social phobia. They have also demonstrated the
   involvement of the cortico-limbic pathways, including the prefrontal
   cortex, hippocampus and amygdala, which show an increased activity in
   different experimental conditions.
   These brain regions have extensively been reported to play an important
   role in the cognitive appraisal in determining the significance of
   environmental stimuli, in the emotional and mnemonic integration of
   information, and in the expression of contextual fear-conditioned
   behaviors, which might be disrupted in the light of the phenomelogical
   aspects of social phobia. A substantial body of literature based on case
   reports, open and placebo-controlled trials, has now clearly examined
   the efficacy of major classes of psychotropic agents including monoamine
   oxidase inhibitors, beta-blockers, selective serotonin reuptake
   inhibitors and benzodiazepines in social phobia. Until recently,
   irreversible non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors, of which
   phenelzine was the most extensively evaluated, were considered as the
   most efficacious treatment in reducing the symptomatology associated
   with social phobia in 50-70 \% of cases after 4 to 6 weeks. However,
   side effects and dietary restrictions limit their use. This led to the
   development of reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A, for which
   careful dietary monitoring is not required. Moclobemide has been the
   most widely studied but produced unconvincingly therapeutic effects on
   social phobic symptoms. To date, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
   may be considered as a reasonable first- line pharmacotherapy for social
   phobia. There is growing evidence for the efficacy of the selective
   serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, citalopram,
   paroxetine and sertraline. They have beneficial effects with response
   rates ranging from 50 to 80 \% in social phobia. It has been recommended
   that the treatment period should be extended at least 6 months beyond
   the early improvement achieved within the first 4 to 6 weeks. The
   overall advantages include tolerability with a low risk of adverse
   events. The benzodiazepines clonazepam and alprazolam have also been
   proposed for the treatment of social phobia. Symptomatic relief occurred
   in 40 to 80 \% of the cases with a relatively rapid onset of action
   within the first two weeks. Untoward effects, discontinuation-related
   withdrawal symptoms and abuse or dependence liability constitute major
   concerns about the use of benzodiazepines, so they should be reserved
   for cases unresponsive to the safer medications cited above.
   beta-blockers such as atenolol and propanolol have commonly been
   employed in performance anxiety, decreasing autonomic symptoms (eg,
   tachycardia, sweating and dry mouth). However, they are not effective in
   the generalized form of social phobia. Other pharmacologic alternatives
   seem helpful for the management of social phobia, including venlafaxine,
   gabapentin, bupropion, nefazodone or augmentation with buspirone.
   Preliminary studies point to promising effects of these agents. Larger
   controlled clinical trials are now needed to confirm their potential
   role in the treatment of social phobia.}},

Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{7}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Assessment of canine palatability is important for both the pet food and
   pharmaceutical industries; however, the current palatability assessment
   protocols are limited in their utility. The most common technique, the
   two-pan test, does not control for the satiating effects of food and may
   not be useful for long-term palatability analysis because nutritional or
   caloric characteristics of the diets may interfere with the results.
   Furthermore, the large quantities of foods consumed may be detrimental
   to the health of animals that do not self-limit their food intake. The
   purpose of this study was to determine whether a cognitive protocol
   could be used to determine food palatability in dogs. Five beagle dogs
   were trained on a three-choice object-discrimination learning task.
   After establishing object preferences, the preferred object was
   associated with no reward, a second object was associated with the dog's
   normal laboratory diet (Purina Agribrands Canine Lab Chow No. 5006;
   Agribrands Purina Canada, Inc., Woodstock, ON, Canada), and the third
   object was associated with a commercial (Hill's P/D; Hill's Pet
   Nutrition Inc., Topeka, KS) diet. In the discrimination-training phase,
   dogs were trained until they learned to avoid the no-reward object. They
   were subsequently given an additional 20 test sessions, which were used
   to determine food preference. In the reversal phase, which involved
   reversal learning, the object-food associations were modified, such that
   the object that was previously associated with Hill's P/D diet was now
   associated with the normal laboratory diet and vice versa. Once the dogs
   learned to avoid the no-reward object, they were tested for an
   additional 20 sessions. All subjects learned to avoid the no-reward
   object during the initial learning, and the number of choices to the
   object associated with the Hill's P/D diet was greater than the number
   of choices to the objects associated with the dry laboratory diet (P <
   0.05) and no reward (P < 0.05), indicating a strong preference for the
   Hill's P/D diet. The object preferences were reversed in only three of
   five dogs when the food-choice associations were reversed, although the
   two phases did not differ significantly from one another. The protocol
   in the present study provides a robust measure of food palatability and
   circumvents many of the limitations associated with other palatability
   assessment techniques. The present protocol should be useful as a
   replacement or adjunct to other tests of palatability, but requires
   further validation by comparing the assessment of more similar and novel
   foods directly with other palatability tests.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{One of the major objective of domestication is the selection of lines
   with low aggressiveness and a high growth potential. Analyses of
   domesticated animals traits often illustrate numerous changes in
   behaviour due to rearing environment. However there are few reports of
   these changes in fish. In the present paper, we first describe how
   behaviour is affected by rearing and then discuss how sensory organs and
   behavioural abilities are modified during development under breeding
   conditions.
   Rearing conditions modify feeding behaviour particularly because food
   distribution do not necessary follow biological rhythm and food is often
   available in larger amount compared to wild-type situations. In
   particular food distribution mode may favour aggressiveness. Rearing
   conditions (stream, fish density...) are also susceptible to modify
   spatial distribution of fish and relationship between fish in their
   closed environment. In particular, fish often reduce their
   inter-individual distances which may also have detrimental influences on
   their aggressiveness.
   Several behavioural abilities seem to be affected by development in
   breeding conditions and this appears to be related to modification of
   sensory organs. This includes modification of the lateral line system,
   eye and smell. These modifications are often associated to a lowering of
   watchfulness threshold which in turn modifies behaviour and particularly
   escape responses from potential predators. A modification of chromatic
   adaptation has also been shown for flat fishes.
   In conclusion, the analysis of behavioural modifications is of utmost
   importance to identify indicators of domestication progress which must
   be taken into account to guarantee cultured fish welfare and thus
   rearing sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{Dietary restraint is defined as the cognitive tendency to restrict
   intake and is often accompanied by the breakdown of restraint, referred
   to as disinhibition, leading to overeating and overweight in adults.
   Given recent evidence suggesting that dietary restraint and
   disinhibition are emerging as early as middle childhood, this study
   examined the validity of the restraint construct as measured in girls
   between the ages of 5 and 9. Dietary restraint was assessed
   longitudinally by questionnaire and validity was established by
   correlating restraint with measures previously reported to be related to
   restraint including weight concerns, body esteem, self-reported dieting,
   and measures of dietary intake when girls were ages 5, 7, and 9.
   Participants were 153 girls from predominately middle class, and
   exclusively non-Hispanic white families living in central Pennsylvania.
   Correlational data were used to assess relationships between dietary
   restraint and weight concerns, body esteem, dietary intake, and dieting.
   Results from this study indicate that there is evidence for the validity
   of the dietary restraint construct among girls by age 9. Specifically,
   dietary restraint was highly and positively associated with body mass

Abstract = {{Behavioural observations were performed in an olfactometer to examine

   showed a slight but non significant reduction in swimming behaviour when
   confronted to chemical cues from starved sympatric predators (larval
   spotted salamander, Salamandra salamandra; larval dragonfly, Anax

   leptodactylus, a recently introduced predator, produced no change at all

   chemical signals resulting from the preying activity of the predator are
   mainly used for the chemical assessment of predation risk by tadpoles.
   Swimming activity of R. temporaria and B. bufo tadpoles was also found
   to be significantly decreased in response to chemical cues released by

Pages = {{204-212}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background. Substance abuse is present in most patients with bipolar
   disorder and associated with poor treatment outcome and increased risk
   Of Suicide. Increased impulsivity may be a link between bipolar disorder
   and substance abuse.
   Methods: First, we compared impulsivity as a stable trait (Barratt
   Impulsiveness Scale, BIS) and as state-dependent behavioral laboratory
   performance (immediate Memory-Delayed Memory task, derived from the
   Continuous Performance Task) in interepisode bipolar and nonbipolar
   subjects with and without substance abuse. Secondly, we compared
   impulsivity in interepisode and manic bipolar Subjects with and without
   substance abuse.
   Results: The BIS scores were increased in interepisode bipolar disorder
   and in subjects with histories of substance abuse, and were increased
   further in interepisode bipolar Subjects with substance abuse.
   Performance impulsivity was increased in subjects with substance abuse,
   regardless of whether they had bipolar disorder. Among Subjects with
   bipolar disorder, after correction for age, BIS scores were increased in
   those with substance abuse. Performance impulsivity was increased in
   manic compared with interepisode subjects, regardless Of Substance abuse
   history, and was increased in interepisode subjects with Substance abuse
   similarly to manic Subjects without substance abuse. These differences
   could not be accounted for by age., gender, or course of illness.
   Conclusions: Trait impulsivity is increased additively in bipolar
   disorder and substance abuse. Performance impulsivity is increased in
   interepisode bipolar disorder only if a history of substance abuse is
   present. This increased predisposition to impulsivity when not manic may
   contribute to the decrement in treatment outcome and compliance, and
   increased risk for suicide and aggression, in bipolar disorder with
   substance abuse.}},

   random from the total clinical sample, and paired with a control group,
   were given two self-reporting instruments for the evaluation of their
   psychological symptom status: the Eating Attitude Test and the Symptom
   Checklist-90-Revised, as well as two instruments for the evaluation of
   the infant temperament and emotional/behavioral functioning: the Baby
   and Toddler Behavior Questionnaires (from 1 to 18 months) and the Child
   Behavior Checklist 11/2-5 (from 18 to 36 months).
   Results: Analysis of variance showed that the FD-group present
   interactional dysfunctional patterns during feeding and raise higher
   scores in symptomatic characteristics both of the mother and of the
   child, compared to ND-group. A set of correlation analyses (Pearson
   coefficients) showed an association among specific symptomatic
   characteristics of the mothers (dysfunctional eating attitudes, anxiety,
   depression, hostility), of their children (in particular,
   anxiety/depression, somatic complaints and aggressive behavior) and of
   their dysfunctional relational modes during feeding (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Our study confirms that analysis of the individual
   characteristics of the child, of the mother and of their relationship
   during the development of feeding patterns in the first three years of
   the child's life is extremely important in the clinical assessment of
   early feeding disorders, in order to establish a valid diagnostic
   methodology and formulate strategies for targeted and effective
   intervention. Furthermore, the results emphasize the clinical utility of
   our research in early identification of infants and toddlers at risk for
   feeding problems.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The Well-Integrated Screening and Evaluation for Women
   Across the Nation (WISEWOMAN) program aims to remove racial and ethnic
   disparities in health by addressing the screening and intervention needs
   of midlife uninsured women. This paper describes the WISEWOMAN program
   requirements, the design of the 12 projects funded in 2002, the use of a
   standardized data reporting and analysis system, risk factors among
   participants, effective behavioral strategies, and plans for the future.
   Methods: The WISEWOMAN demonstration projects are examining the
   feasibility and effectiveness of adding a cardiovascular disease (CVD)
   prevention component to the early detection of breast and cervical
   cancer. Women aged 40-64 are eligible if they are enrolled in the
   National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) in
   selected U. S. states and are financially disadvantaged and lack health
   insurance. The primary outcome measures are blood pressure, lipid
   levels, and tobacco use. Intermediate measures include self-reported
   diet and physical activity, measures of readiness for change, and
   barriers to behavior change.
   Results: During 2002, the 10 projects that were fully operational
   screened 8164 financially disadvantaged women and developed culturally
   and regionally appropriate nutrition and physical activity interventions
   for a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds. Twenty-three percent of
   the women screened had high total cholesterol, with 48\% of these being
   newly diagnosed. Thirty-eight percent of the women had high blood
   pressure, with 24\% being newly diagnosed. Approximately, 75\% of
   participants were either overweight or obese, and in some sites up to
   42\% were smokers.
   Conclusions: The WISEWOMAN demonstration projects have been successful
   at reaching financially disadvantaged and minority women who are at high
   risk for chronic diseases. These projects face challenges because they
   are generally implemented by safety net providers who have limited
   resources and staff to conduct research and evaluation. On the other
   hand, the findings from these projects will be especially informative in
   reducing health disparities because they are conducted in those settings
   where the most socially and medically vulnerable women receive care.}},

Abstract = {{In order to assess the significance of local adaptation relative to
   environmental plasticity on the evolution of life history traits, we
   analysed the possible genetic basis of differences between pond- and
   stream-breeding fire salamanders (Salamandra salamandra) in Germany.
   These salamanders typically deposit their larvae in small streams, where
   they grow until they are sufficiently large to metamorphose. However,
   some populations in Western Germany use ponds as larval habitat. Because
   habitat quality of streams differs from that of ponds one expects life
   history differences in the pond animals, which may result either from a
   plastic response or through genetic differentiation (i.e. local
   adaptation). Using a phylogeographical analysis of mitochondrial D-loop
   sequences, we show that both stream and pond populations in Western
   Germany are derived from a single lineage that recolonized following the
   last glaciation. This finding suggests that pond breeding originated
   very recently. Our studies of habitat quality and metamorphic behaviour
   of larvae in natural ponds and streams disclosed that pond larvae
   experience a significantly reduced food supply and greater risk of
   drying than do stream larvae. Pond larvae metamorphose earlier at the
   cost of reduced mass. Common-environment experiments with pond and
   stream larvae show that metamorphic behaviour of pond larvae under
   limited-food conditions is determined genetically and is not simply a
   plastic response to the differing habitat conditions. These results show
   that phenotypic plasticity is less important than local adaptation in
   explaining differences in ecological diversification within this species
   and suggests the possibility of rapid evolution of genetic adaptations
   when new habitats are exploited.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Previous research has shown significant associations between
   depression and substance use and eating disordered behaviors. However,
   no research to date has described associations between depressive
   symptoms and nutritional intake or physical activity among adolescents
   in a nonclinical, population-based sample.
   Methods. Classroom surveys were completed by 4,734 ethnically diverse,
   middle- and high school students. Based on their depressive symptom
   scores, males and females were categorized with low-, moderate-, or
   high-depressive symptom status. Linear models were used to examine
   eating and health behavior variables by depressive symptom groups.
   Results. Depressive symptoms were positively associated with
   health-compromising attitudes such as perceived barriers to healthy
   eating and weight concerns, and health-compromising behaviors such as
   unhealthy weight-control behaviors and substance use, including
   caffeine. Depressive symptoms were negatively associated with
   health-promoting behaviors such as eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
   However, most associations between depressive symptoms and dietary
   micronutrients were not statistically significant. Health-promoting
   moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was negatively associated with
   depressive symptoms among males.
   Conclusions. Adolescents who report depressive symptoms are at risk for
   other health-compromising attitudes and behaviors and are also less
   likely to engage in health-promoting behaviors. Depressive symptoms may
   be an underlying trait in the expression of health behaviors among
   adolescents. (C) 2004 The Institute For Cancer Prevention and Elsevier

Abstract = {{The experiment reported was designed to test two hypotheses: that
   prenatal undernutrition (a) increases emotional reactivity and (b)
   impairs cognitive flexibility in sheep. The mothers of one group were
   fed live weight maintenance requirements throughout pregnancy (control,
   Q while those of another group were fed 50\% of that amount from days 1
   to 95 of pregnancy and 100\% from then onwards (prenatal undernutrition,
   PU). At 18 months of age, PU sheep were more active during restraint (P
   < 0.05) and approached a novel stimulus more slowly (P = 0.02). In
   response to a sudden stimulus, PU males and C females showed a higher
   initial level of locomotion compared to C males, which only gradually
   declined, while PU females started at a high initial rate, changing
   rapidly to immobility.
   In a T-maze, PU resulted in a shift of side preferences (laterality)
   from a general right-bias to neutrality in males and to a left-bias in
   females (P < 0.05). In the two reversal tasks, C males and PU females
   had a preference for one side over the other, while PU males showed no
   preference. In contrast to C males, PU males failed to improve their
   learning speed from the first to the second reversal (P < 0.05).
   It is concluded that PU can lead to increased emotional reactivity and
   changes in side preference in both sexes and impaired cognitive
   flexibility in males. Undernutrition during pregnancy, therefore, not
   only affects the welfare of the dam, but also the personality of her

Abstract = {{Among damselflies in natural lakes, Ischnura species grow faster than

   under predation than Ischnura species. This growth/predation risk
   trade-off apparently allows these taxa to coexist in ponds and lakes
   across the Holarctic. However, laboratory studies presented here show
   that the mechanism assumed by most theoretical and empirical studies to
   mediate this trade-off, namely activity simultaneously modulating
   foraging returns and predation risk, does not operate in this system.
   Ischnura verticalis larvae were more active than larvae of Enallagma
   species in a short-term behavioral experiment, which explains why
   Ischnura experiences greater mortality from predation. However, this
   greater activity did not translate into higher feeding rates. Ischnura
   verticalis and Enallagma species ate comparable amounts of food in both
   the short-term behavioral experiment and a longer feeding and digestion
   experiment. In spite of no difference in the amount of food ingested or
   assimilated, I. verticalis larvae grew faster than Enallagma larvae
   because they were better able to physiologically convert assimilated
   food into their own biomass in the presence of mortality threats. From
   these studies we understand the phenotypic mechanisms determining the

   20 randomly selected ostrich chicks were housed in heated huts at one
   day of age (Day 1), and at Day 10 were allowed access to sand-covered
   areas (30 m(2)) that were either barren (control. n = 2 groups) or
   enriched with cabbage, coniferous cones and sticks (enriched. n = 2
   groups). Pecking behaviour was recorded by focal sampling the behaviour
   of five chicks per group for four 5 min periods per day on Day 10 and
   Day 13. All enriched chicks pecked at the cabbage, of which they
   consumed considerable amounts (26 +/- 3 g/chick/day). The enriched
   chicks did not have higher overall pecking frequencies but tended to
   peck less at fixtures in the pen, compared to control chicks.
   Additionally, the enriched chicks showed increased exploration in terms
   of the percentage of chicks observed outside the heated huts. In a novel
   object test enriched chicks stayed closer to and delivered more pecks at
   sorrel (Rumex acetosa) than did control chicks, whereas there was no
   difference between the treatment groups in their response to adult
   ostrich feathers. Enriched chicks consumed more food (79 +/- 0.4
   g/chick/day) than did control chicks (67 +/- 0.9 g/chick/day) during the

   the welfare of ostrich chicks in terms of increasing exploration and
   reducing pecking at fixtures in the pen, without compromising food
   consumption.}},

   Impact of zinc supplementation, birth weight, and caregiving practices}},

Volume = {{113}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Infants who are born small for gestational age (SGA) are at
   risk for developmental delays, which may be related to deficiencies in
   zinc, an essential trace metal, or to deficiencies in their ability to
   elicit caregiver responsiveness (functional isolation hypothesis). The
   objective of this study was to evaluate at 6 and 10 months of age the
   impact of a 9-month supplementation trial of 5 mg of zinc on the
   development and behavior of infants who were born SGA and to evaluate
   infants' ability to elicit responsive caregiver behavior.
   Methods. A randomized, controlled trial of zinc supplementation was
   conducted among 200 infants in a low-income, urban community in Delhi,
   India. Infants were recruited when they were full term (>36 weeks) and
   SGA (birth weight <10th percentile weight-for-gestational age). Infants
   were randomized to receive daily supplements of a micronutrient mix
   (folate, iron, calcium, phosphorus, and riboflavin) with or without 5 mg
   of zinc sulfate. The supplement was administered by field workers daily
   from 30 days to 9 months of age. At 6 and 10 months, infant development
   and behavior were measured in a clinical setting using the Bayley Scales
   of Infant Development II. Caregiver responsiveness, observed on an
   Indian version of the Home Observation for Measurement of the
   Environment scale, was measured during a home visit at 10 months. During
   both the clinic and home visits, caregivers reported on their infant's
   temperament.
   Results. There were no direct effects of zinc supplementation on the
   infants' development or behavior at either 6 or 10 months. In a subgroup
   analysis among the zinc-supplemented infants, lower birth weight infants
   were perceived to be more temperamentally difficult than higher weight
   infants; in the control group, birth weight was not associated with
   temperament. Heavier birth weight infants had better scores on all
   measures of development and behavior at 6 months and on changes in
   mental and motor development from 6 to 10 months, compared with lighter
   birth weight infants. Boys had better weight gain and higher scores on
   mental development and emotional regulation than girls. Infants who were
   from families of higher socioeconomic status (indexed by parental
   education, house size, and home ownership) had higher scores on mental
   development and orientation/engagement (exploratory behavior) than
   infants who were from families of lower socioeconomic status. In keeping
   with the functional isolation hypothesis, caregiver responsiveness was
   associated with infant irritability, controlling for socioeconomic
   status, gender, birth weight, and weight gain. Responsive mothers were
   more likely to perceive their infants to be temperamentally easy than
   less responsive mothers.
   Conclusion. Possible explanations for the lack of effects of zinc
   supplementation on infant development and behavior include 1) subtle
   effects of zinc supplementation that may not have been detected by the
   Bayley Scales, 2) interference with other nutritional deficiencies, or
   3) no impact of zinc deficiency on infants' development and behavior.
   The link between birth weight and irritability among infants in the zinc
   supplementation group suggests that the response to zinc supplementation
   may differ by birth weight, with irritability occurring among the most
   vulnerable infants. Longer term follow-up studies among
   zinc-supplemented infants are needed to examine whether early
   supplementation leads to developmental or behavioral changes that have
   an impact on school-age performance. The relationship between infant
   irritability and low maternal responsiveness lends support to the
   functional isolation hypothesis and the importance of asking caregivers
   about infant temperament.}},

Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Many animal species, from arthropods to apes, share food. This paper
   presents a new framework that categorizes nonkin food sharing according
   to two axes: (1) the interval between sharing and receiving the benefits
   of sharing, and (2) the currency units in which benefits accrue to the
   sharer (especially food versus nonfood). Sharers can obtain immediate
   benefits from increased foraging efficiency, predation avoidance, mate
   provisioning, or manipulative mutualism. Reciprocity trade, status
   enhancement and group augmentation can delay benefits. When benefits are
   delayed or when food is exchanged for nonfood benefits, maintaining
   sharing can become more difficult because animals face discounting and
   currency conversion problems. Explanations that involve delayed or
   nonfood benefits may require specialized adaptations to account for
   timing and currency-exchange problems. The immediate, selfish fitness
   benefits that a sharer may gain through by-product or manipulative
   mutualism, however, apply to various food-sharing situations across many
   species and may provide a simpler, more general explanation of sharing.

Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Male dispersal from the birth group is common in the majority of social
   mammals, and in many species, males also engage in secondary or breeding
   dispersal following natal emigration. However, the patterns and causes
   of secondary dispersal are poorly understood due to the difficulty in
   following emigrants. Here, we detail the patterns and causation of male
   secondary dispersal in several groups of white-faced capuchins observed
   between 1985 and 2000 in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica.
   Subsequent to natal emigration, which occurs between 2 and 8 years of
   age (median 4.5 years), male white-faced capuchins embark on a life of
   continual movement. Although males of all age classes engage in
   voluntary secondary dispersal, the ways by which males enter groups
   varies according to their age class. Adult males (greater than or equal
   to10 years old) are more likely to enter groups aggressively, and they
   display longer tenure than either subadult males (7-10 years of age) or
   juvenile males (1-7 years of age). Given our finding that adult males
   face the highest risks in terms of aggressive interactions with
   conspecifics, we examined several explanations as to why they continue
   to disperse throughout their lives. Our data best support the intragroup
   mating competition hypothesis for secondary dispersal, whereby males
   move frequently between groups as a means of increasing their
   reproductive opportunities. Males may also engage in frequent secondary
   dispersal to avoid mating with their maturing daughters, although this
   hypothesis was not strongly supported by the current data. Males of all
   age classes displayed very high levels of parallel dispersal, which
   probably serves to offset the high costs of dispersal (predation,
   starvation and/or aggression from conspecifics) and it may also serve as
   a means of retaining kinship among group males. (C) 2004 The Association

Abstract = {{Sensitivity to reward (STR)-a personality trait firmly rooted in the
   neurobiology of the mesolimbic dopamine system-has been strongly
   implicated in the risk for addiction. This construct describes the
   ability to derive pleasure or reward from natural reinforcers like food,
   and from pharmacologic rewards like addictive drugs. Recently experts in
   the field of addiction research have acknowledged that psychomotor
   stimulant drugs are no longer at the heart of all addictions, and that
   brain circuits can also be deranged with natural rewards like food. The
   present study tested a model in which STR was expected to relate
   positively to overeating, which in turn would be associated, with higher
   body weight in woman aged 25-45 years. As predicted, STR was correlated
   positively with measures of emotional overeating. Also, overweight woman
   were significantly more sensitive to reward than those of normal weight.
   Interestingly, however, the obese woman (Body Mass Index > 30) were more
   anhedonic than the overweight woman (Body Mass Index > 25 < 30). These
   findings are discussed in the context of neuroadaptations to
   overactivity of brain reward circuits. Results also indicate that STR
   may serve as a risk factor for overeating and overweight, especially in
   cultures such as ours where palatable, calorically-dense food is
   plentiful. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Apprehension is a behavioral response of a forager to risk of predation
   involving the allocation of the forager's attention away from
   foraging-related tasks and toward predator detection. It, along with
   time allocation, can be used by a forager to manage risk. Apprehension
   should increase, and time allocation should decrease with a forager's
   energetic state (marginal value of energy). We tested these predictions
   on Allenby's gerbils (Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi) by manipulating the
   energetic state of the gerbils through augmentations of millet seeds. We
   also manipulated two risk factors, the microhabitat of the foraging
   patch (bush or open) and the presence of barn owls (Tyto alba). We
   measured apprehension of gerbils using the selectivity of gerbils for
   trays that differed in the distribution of seeds that they contained and
   time allocation using the amount of seeds left behind in trays, the
   giving-up density (GUD). Gerbils harvested 4.6 times more seeds when
   supplemental seeds were available, 17.4\% fewer seeds when owls were
   present, 25.8\% fewer seeds from the open than the bush microhabitat,
   and 19.3\% fewer seeds from trays when seed augmentations were also
   present. With regard to time allocation, gerbils had higher GUDs
   (allocated less time) when risk was higher: in the open microhabitat and
   in the presence of owls. Also, the response of gerbils to owls was
   affected both by the seed augmentation and by microhabitat. With regard
   to apprehension, the gerbils were more apprehensive when extra seeds
   were added. Their level of apprehension changed little in the bush
   microhabitat but increased greatly in the open microhabitat when
   energetic state was manipulated. Thus, gerbils use both time allocation
   and apprehension in response to predators. Changes in the energetic
   state of a forager led to the predicted increase in apprehension
   accordance with Clark's asset protection principle.}},

Abstract = {{A behavioral technique was developed that allowed the onset and recovery
   of tinnitus to be measured in individual rats treated with different
   doses of salicylate. Food-restricted rats were self-trained to lick for
   water during the time between scheduled delivery of food pellets, i.e.,
   schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP). SIP-induced licking was placed under
   stimulus control by administering foot shock if licks occurred when
   sound (one of six stimuli, 40 dB SPL) was present; rats were allowed to
   lick during quiet. After the number of licks-in-quiet (correct response)
   exceeded 90\% of total licks, rats were treated with saline and four
   different doses of salicylate (50,.100, 150 and 350 mg/kg,
   intraperitoneally (i.p.); 2 days). Performance was assessed before,
   during and after treatment. Licks-in-sound remained extremely low with
   saline and all four salicylate doses indicating that the sounds were
   audible under all treatment conditions. Licks-in-quiet remained high
   during the saline control and 50 mg/kg dose of salicylate, behavior
   consistent with the absence of tinnitus. However, licks-in-quiet showed
   a statistically significant decline with the 150 and 350 mg/kg dose,
   behavior consistent with the presence of tinnitus. Licks-in-quiet
   gradually recovered to baseline level 2-3 days following high-dose
   salicylate treatments, behavior consistent with the gradual
   disappearance of tinnitus. The salicylate dose needed to induce tinnitus
   and the length of recovery are consistent with previous reports,
   providing support for the method. The ability to obtain sequential
   estimates of tinnitus-like behavior in an animal after administering a
   tinnitus-inducing agent could aid in understanding the underlying neural
   mechanisms and assessing potential treatments. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Although individuals differ substantially in their flavor and
   food preferences, the source of such differences remains a mystery. The
   present experimental study was motivated by clinical observations that
   early experience with formulas establishes subsequent preferences.
   Design. Infants whose parents had chosen to formula-feed them were
   randomized into 1 of 4 groups by the second week of life. One group was
   assigned to be fed a milk-based formula (Enfamil), whereas another was
   assigned to be fed (Nutramigen), a particularly unpleasant-tasting
   protein hydrolysate formula. The remaining groups were assigned to be
   fed Nutramigen for 3 months and Enfamil for 4 months; the timing of
   exposure differed between the groups. After 7 months of exposure,
   infants were videotaped on 3 separate days while feeding, in
   counterbalanced order, Enfamil, Nutramigen, and Alimentum, a novel
   hydrolysate formula.
   Results. For each of the 4 interrelated measures of behavior (intake,
   duration of formula feeding, facial expressions, and mothers' judgments
   of infant acceptance), previous exposure to Nutramigen significantly
   enhanced subsequent acceptance of both Nutramigen and Alimentum. Seven
   months of exposure led to greater acceptance than did 3 months.
   Conclusions. The bases for clinical difficulties in introducing
   hydrolysate formulas during older infancy are clarified in this study.
   More broadly, variation in formula flavor provided a useful model for
   demonstrating experimentally the effects of long-term exposure
   differences on later acceptance. Such early variation, under more
   species-typical circumstances (eg, via exposure to different flavors in
   amniotic fluid and mothers' milk), may underlie individual differences
   in food acceptability throughout the life span.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the contribution to fruit and vegetable eating in
   children of potential predictive variables within the domains of
   demographics, parental feeding practices and personality traits.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Setting: Questionnaires were distributed to parents through 22 London
   nursery schools.
   Subjects: Questionnaires were completed and returned by 564 parents or
   principal caregivers of 2-6-year-old children.
   Results: Significant predictors of children's fruit and vegetable intake
   emerged from all three domains examined. Demographic variables
   associated with child's vegetable consumption were mother's education
   and child's age and gender. Only ethnicity was significantly associated
   with fruit consumption. Parental consumption, breast-feeding and early
   introduction to fruit and vegetables were related to intake of both.
   Family mealtimes were associated with higher intake of vegetables, but
   not of fruit. Two characteristics of children themselves (food neophobia
   and enjoyment of food) were strongly related to the consumption of fruit
   and vegetables. Subsequent multivariate analyses revealed that parental
   intake and child food neophobia independently predicted intake of both
   foods. in the presence of these, fruit consumption was affected by
   breast-feeding and early introduction to fruit, whereas vegetable
   consumption was related only to child's gender and enjoyment of food.
   Conclusions: These findings may be used to inform future interventions
   aimed at increasing children's consumption of fruit and vegetables.
   Parents should be made aware of the possible impact of their own

Abstract = {{Winter is energetically challenging for small herbivores because of
   greater energy requirements for thermogenesis at a time when little
   energy is available. We formulated a model predicting optimal wintering
   body size, accounting for the scaling of both energy expenditure and
   assimilation to body size, and the trade-off between survival benefits
   of a large size and avoiding survival costs of foraging. The model
   predicts that if the energy cost of maintaining a given body mass
   differs between environments, animals should be smaller in the more
   demanding environments, and there should be a negative correlation
   between body mass and daily energy expenditure (DEE) across
   environments. In contrast, if animals adjust their energy intake
   according to variation in survival costs of foraging, there should be a
   positive correlation between body mass and DEE. Decreasing temperature
   always increases equilibrium DEE, but optimal body mass may either
   increase or decrease in colder climates depending on the exact effects
   of temperature on mass-specific survival and energy demands. Measuring
   DEE with doubly labeled water on wintering Microtus agrestis at four
   field sites, we found that DEE was highest at the sites where voles were
   smallest despite a positive correlation between DEE and body mass within
   sites. This suggests that variation in wintering body mass between sites
   was due to variation in food quality/availability and not adjustments in
   foraging activity to varying risks of predation.}},

Abstract = {{Predation risk may compromise the ability of animals to acquire and
   maintain body reserves by hindering 14 foraging efficiency and
   increasing physiological stress. Locomotor performance may depend on
   body mass, so losing mass under predation risk could be an adaptive
   response of prey to improve escape ability. We studied individual
   variation in antipredatory behaviour, feeding rate, body mass and escape
   performance in the lacertid lizard Psammodromus algirus. Individuals
   were experimentally exposed to different levels of food availability
   (limited or abundant) and predation risk, represented by reduced refuge
   availability and simulated predator attacks. Predation risk induced
   lizards to reduce conspicuousness behaviourally and to avoid feeding in
   the presence of predators. If food was abundant, alarmed lizards reduced
   feeding rate, losing mass. Lizards supplied with limited food fed at
   near-maximum rates independently of predation risk but lost more mass
   when alarmed; thus, mass losses experienced under predation risk were
   higher than those expected from feeding interruption alone. Although
   body mass of lizards varied between treatments, no component of escape
   performance measured during predator attacks (endurance, speed, escape
   strategy) was affected by treatments or by variations in body mass.
   Thus, the body mass changes were consistent with a trade-off between
   gaining resources and avoiding predators, mediated by hampered foraging
   efficiency and physiological stress. However, improved escape efficiency
   is not required to explain mass reduction upon predator encounters
   beyond that expected from feeding interruption or predation-related
   stress. Therefore, the idea that animals may regulate body reserves in
   relation to performance demands should be reconsidered. (C) 2004 The

Abstract = {{Group feeding animals experience a number of competitive foraging costs
   that may result in a lowered feeding rate. It is important to
   distinguish between reductions in feeding rates that are caused by
   reduced food availability and physical interactions among foragers from
   those caused by the mere presence of foraging companions that may be
   self-imposed in order to obtain some benefit of group membership.
   Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) reduce their feeding rates when in the
   company of simulated competitors located in an adjacent cage that cannot
   affect the food availability or interact with the forager. In the
   present study, we investigate whether the presence of simulated
   competitors in another species of passerine, nutmeg mannikins (Lonchura
   punctulata), can result in self-imposed reductions in feeding rates.
   When feeding in the company of simulated competitors, mannikins spent
   more non-foraging time near them, fed more slowly, reduced travel times
   between patches, reduced their scanning time and pecked more slowly.
   These results provide evidence that simulated competitors induce a
   reduction in pecking rate: behavioural interference. These self-imposed
   responses to competitors may have resulted from attempts to remain close
   to the non-feeding companions. Such self-imposed reductions in feeding
   rates may be a widespread yet generally unrecognised foraging cost to

Abstract = {{Birds selecting a nest site have to find the best compromise between the
   risk of encountering predation, the availability of food near to the
   nest and microclimatic requirements. As the optimal solution of this
   problem will vary with changes in predator abundance, we ask whether
   birds are capable of assessing such changes and of adjusting their
   nest-site choice accordingly. The reproductive success of dusky warblers
   Phylloscopus fuscatus, breeding in a mosaic of bushland and tundra
   habitat in the Russian Far East, varied greatly depending on the
   abundance of a nest predator, the Siberian chipmunk Tamias sibiricus.
   Using artificial nests we analysed which strategies dusky warblers
   should follow to avoid nest predation by chipmunks. We then compared the
   nest sites which dusky warblers actually had chosen in years with very
   high chipmunk densities (1998 and 1999) with those chosen in 1997, when
   chipmunks were almost absent from the study area. We found that safe
   nest-sites were preferred over those offering other advantages
   (microclimate, proximity to food) when the risk of predation was high,
   and we could not detect any confounding factor that might alternatively
   have caused these striking between-year differences. Our study suggests
   that even a short-lived passerine may be capable of choosing its nest
   site according to the actual predation risk. We show that such
   behavioural plasticity can lead to a paradoxical situation where
   better-protected nest-sites (selected in years and areas with high
   risk), on average, suffer greater predation than sites offering low
   safety. Thus, behavioural plasticity, if undetected, may result in
   serious misinterpretation of nest-predation patterns. A review of the
   literature suggests that adaptive plasticity in nest placement may be
   more widespread than is currently recognized.}},

   phenotypes related to amphetamine-induced place preference for strain
   differences (C57BL/6J vs DBA/2J) susceptible to be abolished by
   temporary food restriction. Methods. Mice of the two inbred strains were
   tested for: (1) conditioned taste aversion and place preference induced
   by amphetamine within the same dose-range; (2) preference for a novel
   compartment 24 h after a single exposure to only one of two
   compartments; (3) amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization and
   conditioned hyperactivity; and (4) locomotor activity during exploration
   of a novel environment. Results. The two strains showed consistent taste
   aversion at doses of amphetamine that promoted opposite strain-dependent
   place conditioning. Both strains spent more time exploring the novel
   rather than the known compartment of the place conditioning apparatus.
   Instead, only mice of the C57 strain showed amphetamine-induced
   behavioral sensitization and conditioned hyperactivity. However,
   temporary food restriction did not affect strain differences for these
   phenotypes. Finally, C57 mice were more active than DBA in a novel

Abstract = {{Birds are thought to choose nest sites that meet two main functions:

   nearly 70\% of the nests of Kentish plovers, Charadrius alexandrinus,

   incubating adults to suffer from heat stress. We tested the hypothesis
   that Kentish plovers nest mainly in exposed sites because this may allow

   reduce predation risk. When we occluded the view that incubating adults
   had from their nests, they took longer to detect approaching predators
   than when the view was unrestricted. Incubating adults were also more
   frequently killed by mammals in covered than in exposed nests. Females
   that nested in covered sites were in lower body condition than those

Abstract = {{This study investigated the degree to which the behavior of a predator
   in the marine environment can be used to indicate the availability of
   prey. It examined this in Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella)
   feeding on krill, with a view to understanding how behavioral choices
   could lead to a nonlinear functional response. The study showed how fur
   seals adjusted their time budgets to maximize the mean rate of energy
   intake in response to varying prey abundance. The behavioral indicator
   of prey abundance was the amount of time spent by fur seals at the
   bottom of dives after adjustment for dive depth. This indicator was well
   correlated with independent measures of prey abundance. The indicator
   was calibrated in terms of net rate of energy intake from information
   about energy expenditures in Antarctic fur seals and was used within the
   framework of optimal foraging theory to examine how female fur seals
   organized their foraging activity within and between bouts. Foraging in
   Antarctic fur seals conformed to many of the predictions from energy
   rate-maximizing behavior. For example, the apparent net rate of energy
   intake by fur seals declined with time spent in a patch, and the rate of
   energy intake on leaving a patch declined as apparent food availability
   in the environment declined. In addition, the time spent in patches
   increased as apparent food availability declined. Antarctic fur seals
   were able to adjust their behavior to track highly variable prey
   distributions and densities. The simple decision about when to leave a
   patch in relation to current environmental prey availability appears to
   be responsible for allowing fur seals to maintain saturation of the
   foraging rate as food density declines.}},

Abstract = {{Predator-induced defenses can result from non-contact cues associated
   with the presence of a feeding predator; however, the nature of the
   predator cue has not been determined. We tested the role of two
   non-contact cues, metabolites of digestion of conspecific prey released
   by the predator and alarm pheromones released by attacked conspecific
   prey, in the development of inducible defenses by exposing pinewoods
   tree frog (Hyla femoralis) tadpoles to non-lethal dragonfly (Anax
   junius) larvae fed either inside experimental bins or removed from the
   bins for feeding to eliminate alarm pheromones. The costs associated
   with the development of the induced morphology were also investigated by
   providing the tadpoles with two food levels intended to provide adequate
   or growth limiting resources. The generalized morphological response of
   H. femoralis tadpoles to predators included the development of bodies
   and tails that were both deeper and shorter, smaller overall body size,
   and increased orange tail fin coloration and black tail outline.
   Metabolites of digestion were sufficient to initiate development of
   inducible defenses; however, the combination of metabolites and alarm
   cue resulted in a greater response. Furthermore, growth and development
   were slowed in tadpoles that expressed the induced morphology; however,
   this growth cost was insufficient to preclude the development of the
   induced morphology when food resources were low. These results indicate
   that two aspects of the indirect predator cue work together to trigger a
   morphological anti-predator response.}},

Abstract = {{The costs and benefits of group membership vary with the size of groups,
   and individuals are expected to modify their choice of groups in
   response to ecological factors such as food availability and predation
   risk. We experimentally examined context-dependent group size choice in
   a shoaling fish, the banded killifish, Fundulus diaphanus, by using
   nondirectional odour cues to simulate a food source or a successful
   attack by a predator (food or alarm treatments) in the laboratory. Group
   sizes were significantly smaller in the food treatment and larger in the
   alarm treatment than in control trials. When presented with food and
   alarm cues together, fish formed groups that were larger than control
   groups but smaller than those seen with alarm cues alone. These results
   are consistent with theoretical predictions based on the known benefits
   and costs of grouping and with previous laboratory work examining the
   individual shoal choice behaviour of single fish. To examine possible
   mechanisms of group formation, we developed an individual-based model of
   shoaling behaviour in which simulated fish were allowed to modify the
   area over which they interacted with neighbouring individuals. Group
   size distributions produced by the model were a good approximation of
   our experimental data. We suggest that local behavioural interaction
   rules of this type are a potential mechanism by which fish may
   individually adjust grouping behaviour without requiring extensive
   information on the position and movement of all possible shoalmates. (C)

Abstract = {{Background : The prevalence of menstrual pain in Western societies is
   relatively high and has been shown to be related to many factors (e.g.
   age, menarche age, parity, menstrual cycle regularity, cigarette
   smoking, dietary habits). However, less data are available for
   traditional societies, within which there are, presumably, not as many
   potentially disturbing factors that could influence menstrual symptoms
   as in Western societies.
   Aim : The study seeks to determine the prevalence of dysmenorrhoea, and
   the factors related to menstrual pains in women with natural fertility
   (i.e. without hormonal forms of contraception).
   Subjects and methods : 177 non-smoking women between 18 and 45 years of
   age living in one Mayan village (Yaxcaba, Yucatan, Mexico) were the
   subjects of this study. The method of logistic regression was used with
   the dichotomous dependent variable being the presence or absence of
   menstrual pain together with such independent variables as age, age at
   menarche, number of pregnancies, age when giving birth to the first
   child, the weight at interview and BMI.
   Results : The general prevalence of the menstrual pains was 28\%. There
   was only one variable influencing dysmenorrhoea, namely the age at which
   women give birth to their first children. Those mothers who gave birth
   to their first child at an earlier age (at mean age of 19.4 vs 21.1
   years) had a lower prevalence of dysmenorrhoea.
   Conclusion : In the studied traditional society the main factor related
   to menstrual pain was the age at which woman first gave birth. It is
   hypothesized that an earlier start to reproductive life in some way
   decreases the sensitivity of the uterus to prostaglandins.}},

Abstract = {{Milk is a product of animal origin with a very long history of intensive
   quality examination. This history is partly based on the fact that milk
   samples can be rather easily obtained and processed. Quality examination
   regards the organoleptic features of milk as well as characteristics
   like somatic cell count, bacteria count, freezing point decrease,
   butyric acid content and antibiotic residues. Since the payment to the
   farmer of delivered milk is coupled to the levels of these features,
   dairy farmers have put a lot of effort into keeping these levels between
   acceptable standard ranges. Considered retrospectively, it has appeared
   much more difficult to convince farmers about the relationships between
   milk-quality features on the one hand and udder-health disorders or
   public-health risks on the other. In the field, emphasis still has to be
   put on proper treatment duration and procedures with appropriate drugs.
   Udder-health control programmes for the different predominant pathogen
   profiles have been introduced by veterinarians and others for improving
   udder health status by problem solving and preventive action at herd and
   cow level, although with variable success. For this purpose cow-related,
   management-related and cow environment-related risk conditions are
   screened and evaluated. Basically, these programmes address less milk as
   a product itself, but rather the production process where different risk
   conditions exert their effect at different process sites. Udder-health
   programmes focus predominantly on operational farm issues like reduction
   of disease rate, milk-yield increase, reduction of labour and costs,
   increasing productive lifespan of cows, much less on public-health
   issues.
   Yet, the current situation is that the general public and consumers have
   much more influence on quality issues in animal production than ever
   before. Food-safety calamities like BSE, dioxin, VTEC and food poisoning
   have been largely depicted in the media and have evoked a changing
   consumer behaviour towards animal production and products of animal
   origin. Animal-health and animal-welfare issues have become as important
   as public-health and food-safety issues; all come together in a triad
   under the heading of ``quality of animal production{''}. Quality should
   then not only be addressed in the product but also in the production
   process. The risks of a deviating product occur during the production
   process, like the risk of too high a cell count originates from, for
   example, less optimal hygiene, udder infections and management
   deficiencies during day-to-day dairy farming. In several countries
   so-called quality-control programmes are operational or under
   development addressing one or more elements of the triad by good farming
   practice codes, veterinary herd-health programmes, HACCP-based
   approaches or ISO. However, the programme of choice has not been
   developed, validated or published.
   Milk can be a vehicle for the transmission of pathogens from cow to cow
   (for example, during milking), but also from cow to humans (zoonotic
   microorganisms) through raw milk or dairy product. Among the zoonotic
   microorganisms can be named: Mycob. tuberculosis, Brucella abortus,
   Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia sp., VTEC (O157)
   and even possibly Mycob. paratuberculosis. Some of these zoonotic
   microorganisms do not cause signs of disease in the animal, while others
   do. The former agents are hence hard to detect at farm level and
   therefore difficult to treat beforehand. For example, they do not form
   part of a herd-health programme. It may be warranted to develop,
   validate and apply quality-control programmes specifically focusing on
   these microorganisms, not least because, for example at EU level, there
   are directives and regulations addressing areas like consumer
   protection, zoonoses, products of animal origin, hygiene around food
   processing and food products, animal health and welfare status at farm
   level, and the need for transparent farm-production processes with
   demonstrable health status and measures to optimize this status,
   veterinary monitoring and inspection of such status. At this level too
   there are requirements being developed which go beyond the current
   situation and which are linked to a ``license to produce{''}.
   This presentation addresses the different zoonotic agents which can be
   transferred through cows' milk to humans, and proposes an associated
   HACCP-based quality-control programme in support of farm management
   within the setting of developments mentioned, followed by discussion.
   Certain legislation points to the need to discard milk from cows that
   are affected by clinical diseases like gastro-intestinal disorders with
   fever, disorders of the genital tract with vaginal discharge, general
   disease signs and clinically detectable disorders of the udder skin. The
   latter are not addressed in this presentation.}},

Abstract = {{It is now well appreciated that most organisms can alter their
   phenotypes when faced with environmental variation. Decades of empirical
   investigations have documented hundreds of examples of phenotypic
   plasticity, yet most studies have focused on the presence-or absence of
   a single environmental factor. As a result, we know little about how
   organisms respond to-gradients of environmental factors (i.e., threshold
   responses vs. continuous responses), nor do we understand how organisms
   respond to combinations of environmental variables. I examined how
   larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) altered their behavior, morphology,
   and growth in response, to combined gradients of predation and
   competition. Increased predation risk induced lower activity, deeper
   tails, and shorter bodies, which collectively caused slower growth.
   Increased competition caused slower growth which induced higher
   activity, shallower tails, and longer bodies: For both environmental
   gradients, the responses were frequently continuous rather than
   threshold responses. Moreover, predation and competition had interactive
   effects. Responses to predators were always larger under low competition
   than under high competition. Responses to competition were larger under
   low predation risk when predation and competition induced traits in the
   same direction, but larger under high predation risk when predation and
   competition induced traits in opposite directions. The results
   demonstrate that responses to phenotypically plastic traits can be
   fine-tuned to a wide variety of environmental combinations.}},

Abstract = {{The avoidance of surface waters by crustacean zooplankton is a common
   phenomenon both in marine and freshwaters. The contemporary paradigm
   interprets such behavior as an antipredator strategy. However, the
   phenomenon has also been reported in predator-free environments, which
   suggests that other variables may contribute to this depth-selection
   behavior. We investigated the possibility that ultraviolet radiation
   (UVR) could influence the avoidance of surface waters in three
   interconnected lakes differing in their transparency. Each lake was
   sampled 17 or 18 times. In the two most transparent lakes, the
   percentage of the population occurring in the surface layer decreased
   during spring and summer, but this pattern was not observed in the less
   transparent lake. Such differences in the patterns of surface-water
   avoidance were unrelated to the abundance and vertical distribution of
   the dominant planktivores (early stages of galaxiid fishes) as well as
   to temperature and food availability. They were inversely related,
   however, to the average UVR levels within the surface layer. A UV
   avoidance strategy was predicted for the copepod Boeckella gracilipes,
   on account of its low UV tolerance and lack of photoprotective
   compounds. Our results support this prediction and strongly suggest that
   surface avoidance by freshwater Patagonian zooplankton is not just a
   byproduct benefit of an antipredator behavior but is a direct response
   to high UVR levels.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated differences in larval habitats and life history of three
   species of spadefoot toads, then compared their life histories in a
   common garden study. Our field work defined the selective regime
   encountered by each species. Our Great Basin spadefoot (Spea
   intermontana) bred asynchronously in permanent streams and springs where
   there was no risk of larval mortality due to drying. The water chemistry
   remained fairly stable throughout the larval period. The western
   spadefoot toad, Sp. hammondii, bred fairly synchronously following heavy
   spring rains in temporary pools that remained filled an average of 81 d.
   Fifteen \% of the breeding pools dried completely on or before the day
   the first larvae metamorphosed. The desert spadefoot toad, Scaphiopus
   couchii, bred synchronously after heavy summer showers in very short
   duration pools; 62\% of the breeding pools dried completely on or before
   the day the first larvae metamorphosed. The concentration of ammonium
   nitrogen and CaCO3 increased markedly as the Sp. hammondii and S.
   couchii pools dried. S. couchii attained metamorphosis at a much earlier
   age and smaller size than the other two species. S. couchii also showed
   little variation in the age at metamorphosis but considerable variation
   in the size at metamorphosis, while the other two species varied in both
   age and size. The results identify some variables that could serve as
   cues of pool drying and demonstrate an association between breeding pool
   duration, breeding synchrony, development rate, and larval development.
   Our laboratory study yields information about the genetic basis of the
   differences in development and controlled comparisons of phenotypic
   plasticity. We manipulated food supply to study the plastic response of
   age and size at metamorphosis and hence construct the reaction norm for
   these variables as a function of growth rate. The growth rates ranged
   from below to above those observed in natural populations. As in the
   field, in the lab S. couchii attained metamorphosis at an earlier age
   and smaller size than the other two species. All three species had a
   similarly shaped reaction norm for size(y-axis) and age (x-axis) at
   metamorphosis, which was a concave upward curve. A consequence of this
   shape is that age at metamorphosis changes more readily at low levels of
   food availability and size at metamorphosis changes more readily at high
   levels of food availability. If we restrict our observations to just
   those growth rates that are seen in nature, then S. couchii has almost
   no variation in the age at metamorphosis but considerable variation in
   size at metamorphosis, while the other two species vary in both age and
   size at metamorphosis. All three species increased in size at
   metamorphosis with increased food levels. Our comparative reaction norm
   approach thus demonstrates that S. couchii has adapted to ephemeral
   environments by shifting its growth rate reaction norm so that age at
   metamorphosis is uniformly fast and is not associated with growth rate.
   The realized variation is concentrated in size rather than age at
   metamorphosis.}},

   Results: We discovered a candidate NF-kappaB site in promoter 3 of bdnf
   and showned that activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) inotropic
   glutamate receptors increased bdnf expression through an
   NF-kappaB-dependent pathway and extended the finding to show that
   NF-kappaB was required for NMDA neuroprotection in vitro. In addition,
   sequence analysis of bdnf cDNAs from different brain regions predicted
   at least three pre-pro-BDNF protein isoforms, two of which were
   previously unknown. Each isoform differs at the amino terminus and may
   have functional importance.
   Conclusions: Given the central role that BDNF plays in the developing
   and adult nervous system, understanding how BDNF is regulated and how it
   functions will enhance our knowledge of its diverse effects, which may
   lead to more effective treatments for neurodegenerative disorders and
   reveal the role of BDNF in complex phenotypes related to behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
   (1988-1994) were used to examine the relation between obesity and
   depression. Past-month depression was defined using criteria from the
   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition,
   and was measured with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Obesity was
   defined as a body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) of 30 or
   higher. The authors compared risks of depression in obese and
   normal-weight (body mass index 18.5-24.9) persons. Obesity was
   associated with past-month depression in women (odds ratio (OR) = 1.82,
   95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 3.3) but was not significantly
   associated in men (OR = 1.73, 95\% CI: 0.56, 5.37). When obesity was
   stratified by severity, heterogeneity in the association with depression
   was observed. Class 3 (severe) obesity (body mass index greater than or
   equal to40) was associated with past-month depression in unadjusted
   analyses (OR = 4.98, 95\% CI: 2.07, 11.99); the association remained
   strong after results were controlled for age, education, marital status,
   physician's health rating, dieting for medical reasons, use of
   psychiatric medicines, cigarette smoking, and use of alcohol, marijuana,
   and cocaine. These findings suggest that obesity is associated with
   depression mainly among persons with severe obesity. Prospective studies
   will be necessary to clarify the obesity-depression relation but await
   the identification of potential risk factors for depression in the

Abstract = {{Oxidative stress has been implicated in mechanisms leading to neuronal
   cell injury in various pathological states of the brain. Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) is a progressive disorder with cognitive and memory
   decline, speech loss, personality changes and synapse loss. Many
   approaches have been undertaken to understand AD, but the heterogeneity
   of the etiologic factors makes it difficult to define the clinically
   most important factor determining the onset and progression of the
   disease. However, increasing evidence indicates that factors such as
   oxidative stress and disturbed protein metabolism and their interaction
   in a vicious cycle are central to AD pathogenesis.
   Brains of AD patients undergo many changes, such as disruption of
   protein synthesis and degradation, classically associated with the heat
   shock response, which is one form of stress response. Heat shock
   proteins are proteins serving as molecular chaperones involved in the
   protection of cells from various forms of stress.
   Recently, the involvement of the heme oxygenase (HO) pathway in
   anti-degenerative mechanisms operating in AD has received considerable
   attention, as it has been demonstrated that the expression of HO is
   closely related to that of amyloid precursor protein (APP). HO induction
   occurs together with the induction of other HSPs during various
   physiopathological conditions. The vasoactive molecule carbon monoxide
   and the potent antioxidant bilirubin, products of HO-catalyzed reaction,
   represent a protective system potentially active against brain oxidative
   injury. Given the broad cytoprotective properties of the heat shock
   response there is now strong interest in discovering and developing
   pharmacological agents capable of inducing the heat shock response.
   Increasing interest has been focused on identifying dietary compounds
   that can inhibit, retard or reverse the multi-stage pathophysiological
   events underlying AD pathology. Alzheimer's disease, in fact, involves a
   chronic inflammatory response associated with both brain injury and
   beta-amyloid associated pathology. All of the above evidence suggests
   that stimulation of various repair pathways by mild stress has
   significant effects on delaying the onset of various age-associated
   alterations in cells, tissues and organisms. Spice and herbs contain
   phenolic substances with potent antioxidative and chemopreventive
   properties, and it is generally assumed that the phenol moiety is
   responsible for the antioxidant activity. In particular, curcumin, a
   powerful antioxidant derived from the curry spice turmeric, has emerged
   as a strong inducer of the heat shock response. In light of this
   finding, curcumin supplementation has been recently considered as an
   alternative, nutritional approach to reduce oxidative damage and amyloid
   pathology associated with AD. Here we review the importance of the heme
   oxygenase pathway in brain stress tolerance and its significance as an
   antidegenerative mechanism potentially important in AD pathogenesis.
   These findings have offered new perspectives in medicine and
   pharmacology, as molecules inducing this defense mechanism appear to be
   possible candidates for novel cytoprotective strategies. In particular,
   manipulation of endogenous cellular defense mechanisms such as the heat
   shock response, through nutritional antioxidants or pharmacological
   compounds, represents an innovative approach to therapeutic intervention
   in diseases causing tissue damage, such as neurodegeneration. Consistent
   with this notion, maintenance or recovery of the activity of vitagenes,
   such as the HO gene, conceivably may delay the aging process and
   decrease the occurrence of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial position of young animals within a brood affects their
   survival, so that marginal individuals are at greater risk of predation.
   Spatial brood structuring may be caused by differences in offspring
   size, age, hunger, or active parental manipulation through aggression.
   Nepotistic manipulation of brood structure would confer fitness benefits
   for parents accepting nondescendant young. However, insufficient kin
   recognition has often been considered to preclude such nepotism in
   birds, particularly in precocial waterfowl. We explored the spatial
   structure of ducklings within broods of eiders, Somateria mollissima, a
   seaduck with frequent brood amalgamation. We compared the distribution
   of ducklings of different origin relative to reference females whose
   kinship to the ducklings was known. We also observed female aggression
   towards ducklings, to evaluate the role of parental manipulation of
   brood structure. We found a nonrandom distribution of ducklings within
   broods; a female's own young were on average closer to her than
   unrelated young were. We also found evidence for parental nepotism:
   whether the brood contained unrelated young was the strongest predictor
   of female aggression towards ducklings. The spatial position, hatch
   weight and relative size of ducklings showed no significant correlations
   with each other, suggesting that active parental manipulation may be
   needed to explain the observed spatial structure. Our study conflicts
   with previous anecdotal evidence suggesting that brood amalgamation in
   eiders results in the disintegration of parent-offspring bonds,
   preventing parental exploitation of nondescendant young. It also opens
   up the possibility that the spatial position of ducklings depends on
   their mother's status in the female dominance hierarchy. (C) 2003 The

Abstract = {{1. Agricultural developments over recent decades have had significant
   negative effects on wildlife. Modern European agriculture faces many
   further developments in technology, finances and climate. A framework
   for predicting the consequences of these developments and for informing
   management that mitigates previous depredation of wildlife is essential.
   2. Field trials, monitoring and experimental approaches are all
   invaluable tools for predicting the consequences of proposed
   agricultural practices. However, such trials are time-consuming and
   expensive, with limited spatial and temporal scope. Increasingly, it is
   recognized that predictive modelling using computer simulations is
   essential for assessing the likely impacts of novel management
   practices.
   3. Many agricultural developments are likely to have impacts on the
   availability of food for farmland wildlife. In this paper, we review
   modelling techniques that are available for predicting the consequences
   of changing food supplies for farmland birds, a group already shown to
   be sensitive to agricultural management.
   4. We focus on two broad types of simulation modelling: phenomenological
   approaches (using aggregative responses or full population models), and
   behavioural depletion models (including daily ration and functional
   response approaches). We assess the strengths and weaknesses of each,
   particularly with regard to available data.
   5. We conclude that given the constraints on current information, daily
   ration models probably represent the most useful form of simulation
   modelling for farmland birds. Few phenomenological population models
   link demography explicitly to food supply and collecting data on these
   links should be a priority of autecological studies. More empirical data
   on aggregative and functional responses is needed to identify the
   generality of these functions, and to confront uncertainties in their
   use.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Modelling techniques available for
   predicting the consequences of changing food supply for farmland birds
   have largely outstripped the availability of data required to
   parameterize them. We recommend the best available techniques given
   current constraints on data. Predictive models of biodiversity response
   should be more widely used when considering proposals for agricultural
   developments or agri-environment schemes. Models will provide a basis
   for selecting between competing proposals, whilst their widespread usage
   will both permit more frequent model validation and aid in model
   development.}},

   Patients suffering from problems influencing dietary intake and those
   with malnutrition were excluded. The variances accounted for
   self-efficacy for health-related behavior and avoidance-oriented coping
   (AOC) with stress were assessed by hierarchical multiple regression
   analyses. Results: BUN and SPO4 levels were not significantly (P<.05)

   significantly (P<.05) associated with self-efficacy and/or AOC. The
   variances of SK levels and IWG accounted for self-efficacy and/or AOC,

Abstract = {{In addition to seasonal changes in morphology, physiology and behaviour
   that occur in predictable annual cycles, there are facultative responses
   to unpredictable events known as labile (i.e. short-lived) perturbation
   factors. These rapid behavioural and physiological changes have been
   termed the `emergency life-history stage' and serve to enhance lifetime
   fitness. There are four major components: (1) proactive/reactive coping
   styles for responding to psychosocial stress, predation, and so forth;
   (2) fight-or-flight responses to rapid emergencies such as an attack by
   a predator or sudden severe storm; (3) `take-it-or-leave-it' behavioural
   and physiological responses to longer-term perturbations of the physical
   environment; and (4) sickness behaviour and fever designed to respond to
   infection. Glucocorticosteroids interact with cytokines and with other
   hormones in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal cascade and in the
   autonomic nervous system to initiate and orchestrate the emergency
   life-history stage within minutes to hours. Some traits of the emergency
   life-history stage include: redirection of behaviour from a normal
   life-history stage to increased foraging, irruptive-type migration
   during the day, enhanced restfulness at night, elevated gluconeogenesis,
   and recovery once the perturbation passes. These physiological and
   behavioural changes allow an individual to avoid potential deleterious
   effects of stress that may result from chronically elevated levels of
   circulating glucocorticosteroids over days and weeks. Thus, acute rises
   in glucocorticosteroids following perturbations of the environment may
   serve primarily as `antistress' hormones, potentially allowing
   individuals to avoid chronic stress. Several field studies in diverse
   habitats indicate that individuals in free-living populations show
   elevated circulating levels of corticosteroids when they are in an
   emergency life-history stage. Some simple models based on food
   availability, body condition, social status and life-history stage, may
   allow predictions of sensitivity of the hypothalamopituitary-adrenal
   axis to labile perturbation factors. Although there is now extensive
   evidence for behavioural components of the emergency life-history stage
   in birds, there remains much to be learned about how other vertebrate
   groups, especially fish, cope with perturbations of the environment.
   Because of the unpredictable nature of these perturbations, systematic
   study of behavioural responses to them is not possible and investigators
   need to be `opportunistic'. There is also a growing need to expand our
   knowledge of these phenomena because human disturbance, global climate
   change and pollution are all major perturbations of the environment. How
   vertebrates respond to the unpredictable in general will thus have
   important conservation value for the future. (C) 2003 The Association

Abstract = {{The ability to discriminate between more dangerous and less dangerous
   predators can have serious fitness advantages for fish juveniles. This
   is especially true for hatchery-reared fish young used for stocking,
   because their post-release mortality is often much higher than that of
   wild-born conspecifics. We tested whether two coexisting fish predators
   and their different diets induce innate behavioral responses in
   predator-naive Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) young originating from
   an endangered hatchery-bred population used for re-introductions. We
   predicted the antipredator responses of charr to be stronger towards
   chemical cues of brown trout (Salmo trutta) and pikeperch (Stizostedion
   lucioperca) than towards odorless control water. More pronounced
   antipredator behavior was predicted in treatments with predators fed on
   charr than when their diet consisted of another sympatric salmonid,
   European grayling (Thymallus thymallus), or when they were
   food-deprived. The Arctic charr young showed strong antipredator
   responses in all brown trout treatments, whereas odors of the less
   likely predator pikeperch were avoided with conspecific diet only.
   Freezing was the most sensitive antipredator behavior, as it was
   completely absent in control treatments. We found considerable
   individual variation in the amount and strength of antipredator
   responses. Although almost half of the charr failed to show antipredator
   behavior towards the piscivores, those with the innate ability showed
   highly sensitive recognition of predator odors. Our results indicate
   that the innate antipredator behavior of the juvenile fish is already
   finely tuned to respond specifically to chemical cues from different
   fish predators and even their diets.}},

Abstract = {{In response to increased exposure to predators when searching for food,
   many prey increase the frequency of antipredator behaviors, potentially
   reducing foraging rate and food intake. Such direct, nonlethal
   interactions between predators and prey resulting in reduced food intake
   can indirectly influence lifecycle development through effects on
   growth, developmental rate, and survival. We investigated the general
   hypothesis that individual performance of a herbivorous insect can be
   negatively affected when exposed to nonlethal predation risk, and that
   the response can be mediated by food quality. This hypothesis was tested
   using the common rangeland grasshopper Ageneotettix deorum with and
   without exposure to common wolf spider predators (Lycosidae, Schizocosa
   spp.) on both untreated natural and fertilized vegetation. All spiders
   were rendered temporarily incapable of direct feeding by restricting
   function of the chelicerae with beeswax. Detectable responses by
   grasshoppers to spiders indicate indirect consequences for lifecycle
   development. Grasshopper performance was measured as hind femur growth,
   duration of nymphal lifecycle stages, and survivorship in a caged field
   experiment conducted over 2 years. Grasshoppers developed faster and
   grew 3-5\% larger when allowed to forage on fertilized vegetation in the
   absence of risk from a spider predator. Failure-time analysis
   illustrated enhanced survival probability in response to elevated food
   quality and the negative effects of grasshopper susceptibility to
   nonlethal predation risk. Performance on food of relatively low, ambient
   quality with no predation risk equaled that of grasshoppers caged with
   high quality vegetation in the presence of a modified spider. Increased
   resource quality can clearly moderate the negative life history
   responses caused by the behavioral modification of grasshoppers when
   exposed to spider predation risk, a compensatory response.}},

Abstract = {{Most social foragers must search for food while avoiding predators.
   Group-foraging nutmeg mannikins engaged in a producer-scrounger game
   search for their own food (play producer) by hopping with the head down
   and search for others' food discoveries (play scrounger) by hopping with
   the head up. If the scrounger tactic is compatible with antipredatory
   vigilance, then an increase in antipredatory vigilance should lead to
   the detection of more joining opportunities, and hence to more joining
   by foragers. We tested this prediction as well as the extent to which
   stationary birds use head up exclusively for antipredatory purposes and
   hopping birds use head up for foraging purposes only. We observed three
   flocks of nutmeg mannikins searching for hidden clumps of food in an
   indoor aviary. We used a 2 x 2 factorial design in which both the
   distance to a safe refuge and the food distribution were manipulated.
   The use of head up by stationary and eating birds increased
   significantly with increased distance to cover. Distance to cover,
   however, had no effect on the use of the scrounger tactic or on the
   level of joining. We found no evidence of compatibility between the
   scrounger tactic and antipredatory vigilance. Our results provide the
   first unambiguous evidence for the existence of two distinct and
   incompatible patterns of vigilance for predators and for conspecifics.

Abstract = {{I developed two versions of the twin threshold model (TTM) to assess
   risk-sensitive foraging decisions by rufous hummingbirds. The model
   incorporates energy thresholds for both starvation and reproduction and
   assesses how three reward distributions with a common mean but different
   levels of variance interact with these critical thresholds to determine
   fitness. Fitness, a combination of survival and reproduction, is
   influenced by both the amount of variance in the distributions and the
   relative position of the common mean between the thresholds. The model
   predicts that risk-intermediate foraging is often the optimal policy,
   and that risk aversion is favoured as the common mean of the
   distributions approaches the starvation threshold, whereas risk
   preference is favoured as the common mean approaches the reproduction
   threshold. Tests with free-living hummingbirds supported these
   predictions. Hummingbirds were presented with three distributions of
   nectar rewards that had a common mean but Nil, Moderate or High levels
   of variance. Birds preferred intermediate levels of variance (Moderate)
   when presented with all three rewards simultaneously, and became more
   risk-averse as the mean of the distributions was decreased but more
   risk-prone as the mean was increased. Birds preferred Nil when it was
   paired with Moderate or with High, but preferred Moderate in the
   presence of Nil and High together. This reversal of preference is a
   violation of regularity, conventionally interpreted as irrational choice
   behaviour. I provide an alternative version of the TTM demonstrating
   that violations of regularity can occur when relative instead of
   absolute evaluation mechanisms are used. (C) 2003 The Association for

Abstract = {{Organisms in nature are both proximate (operating by rules of thumb) and
   adapted (the rules influenced by natural selection). We introduce new
   methods that can be used to study in silico versions of organisms
   behaving according to proximate adapted rules. Our approach goes beyond
   neural networks and offers an alternative to optimization methods. It is
   based on the idea that organisms receive signals from the environment,
   that the signals are modified by internal (state-dependent) factors to
   create feelings (which we refer to as hedonic tones), and that
   behavioural processes (decisions) are a response to the hedonic tones.
   We illustrate these ideas through a model of a fish moving in a
   vertically structured environment, subject to predation and competition
   from conspecifics. The fish in our model responds to food, light,
   temperature and conspecifics, without any reference to current or future
   fitness. We use a combination of hedonic modelling to process the
   response, and genetic algorithms to modify the response via natural
   selection, according to internal needs and evolutionary history. We show
   that many different combinations of genes can lead to similar fitnesses,
   so that this approach generates genetic diversity. We compare our
   results with those of a variety of empirical studies and show that our
   approach can lead to new links between empirical and simulation studies.}},

   hostility were available from 11,367 participants and, after a mean

Abstract = {{The nucleus accumbens (NAc) subserves behaviors governed by natural

   control of prepulse inhibition (PPI), a measure of sensorimotor gating.
   The present study sought to determine whether a tonic stimulation of
   adenosine A(2A) receptors in the rat NAc is involved in control of
   spontaneous locomotor activity, feeding behavior, and PPI. To this end,
   bilateral microinfusions of a prodrug (MSX-3) (3 mug and 5 mug in 1 mul
   per side) of the selective A(2A) receptor antagonist MSX-2 or vehicle (1
   mul per side) were administered into the NAc. Results show that blockade
   of intra-NAc adenosine A(2A) receptors by a high (5 mug), but not by a
   low (3 mug), dose of MSX-3 increased locomotor activity in an open
   field, reduced food intake, and delayed intake onset in food-deprived
   rats examined in a test cage with standard laboratory chow. Furthermore,
   PPI was significantly disrupted after intra-NAc infusion of 5 mug, but
   not 3 mug, MSX-3. These findings suggest that locomotor activity as well
   as intact PPI and feeding behavior rely on tonic activation of intra-NAc

Abstract = {{While there are many examples of people who live for 100 years or more
   with little evidence of a decline in brain function, many others are not
   so fortunate and experience a neurodegenerative disorder, such as
   Alzheimer disease or Parkinson disease. Although an increasing number of
   genetic factors that may affect the risk for neurodegenerative disorders
   are being identified, emerging findings suggest that dietary factors
   play major roles in determining whether the brain ages successfully or
   experiences a neurodegenerative disorder. Dietary factors may interact
   with disease-causing or predisposing genes in molecular cascades that
   either promote or prevent the degeneration of neurons. Epidemiologic
   findings suggest that high-calorie diets and folic acid deficiency
   increase the risk for Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease; studies
   of animal models of these disorders have shown that dietary restriction
   (reduced calorie intake or intermittent fasting) and dietary
   supplementation with folic acid can reduce neuronal damage and improve
   behavioral outcome. Animal studies have shown that the beneficial
   effects of dietary restriction on the brain result in part from
   increased production of neurotrophic factors and cytoprotective protein
   chaperones in neurons. By keeping homocysteine levels low, folic acid
   can protect cerebral vessels and prevent the accumulation of DNA damage
   in neurons caused by oxidative stress and facilitated by homocysteine.
   Although additional studies are required in humans, the emerging data
   suggest that high-calorie diets and elevated homocysteine levels may
   render the brain vulnerable to age-related neurodegenerative disorders,

Abstract = {{During courtship and mating, males of some invertebrate predators risk
   being killed and consumed by females, who in turn can obtain a foraging
   benefit from feeding on males. In these invertebrates, the sex ratio at
   the end of the mating season is usually female biased, probably due to
   sexual cannibalism and other sources of male mortality. Thus, at the end
   of the mating season males can be a limited resource to females as both
   mates and prey. Because of the high risk incurred when approaching
   females, males should show mate choice. To date there are little data on
   the costs and benefits of sexual cannibalism in natural populations. For
   one month we followed the mating patterns of 60 late-maturing
   Mediterranean tarantula, Lycosa tarentula L., females in a desert
   grassland population. The later a female matured, the shorter was her
   cohabitation time with males and the lower her probability of cohabiting
   with a male at all, suggesting that late-maturing females may be limited
   in their access to males as mates. At the end of the mating season,
   nonsexually cannibalistic late-maturing females also had poorer body
   conditions than did both sexually cannibalistic late-maturing females
   and early-maturing females, suggesting that late-maturing females may be
   also limited in their access to males as food. Females had higher mating
   success if they were smaller or in better condition (better fed). This
   pattern may reflect either male choice, or the possibility that small,
   well-fed females have higher mating success because they are less
   aggressive towards males. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf

Abstract = {{Introduced species usually fail to establish, but when they succeed, may

   ecologically different dredgespoil islands in central Florida (forested
   and non-forested) and measured differences in population growth,
   individual growth, body size, and condition over four years. The
   population on the non-forested island expanded twice as fast as the
   forested island population and reached a density of ca. 12,000 lizards
   ha(-1) and a biomass of ca. 43.3 kg ha(-1), among the largest values
   recorded for non-aggregated terrestrial vertebrates. First-year progeny
   grew larger than their surviving parents on both islands, indicating
   character release occurred in early stages of both invasions. However,
   in subsequent years, lizards become larger on the forested island, but
   smaller on the non-forested island. Body condition declined over time on
   both islands, but the effect was most dramatic on the non-forested
   island. Lizards on the forested island had the lowest survival rates and
   highest tail autotomy frequencies. These results were attributed to
   differences in abiotic and biotic conditions on the two islands. Brown
   anoles are generally larger on islands where they have been introduced
   than on their native Caribbean islands, and are much larger on mainlands

Abstract = {{Effects of metabolic load and 12 h of food deprivation on the

   food deprivation were tested using dairy cows provided with 4 kg of
   carrots as novel food after 0 It versus 12 h of food deprivation (N =
   22). Food deprivation did not affect the approach-avoidance behaviour
   toward novel food but led to increased attempts to steal usual food from
   neighbours (P < 0.05) as well as decreased self-grooming (P = 0.05). In
   Experiment 11, effects of milking frequency and energy density in the
   food on behavioural and physiological responses toward novel food were
   examined in a 2 x 2 factorial experiment (N = 40). The two factors were:
   (a) milking frequency: milked twice daily (04:30 and 15:30 h) (2) versus
   three daily milkings (04:30, 12:45 and 21:30 h) (3); and (b) energy
   density in the food after calving: low (25\% concentrates) (L) versus
   high (75\% concentrates) (H). An extra daily milking affected the
   approach-avoidance behaviour of the cows-as shown by reduced time spend
   away from the novel food (P = 0.01) and reduced frequency of sniffing
   the novel food (P < 0.05). Low energy density in the food led to
   increased time spent away (P = 0.07), increased latency to eat novel
   food (P < 0.05), decreased food intake (P = 0.09) and a higher
   proportion of cows performing self grooming (P < 0.05). Provision of
   novel food did not affect the plasma concentration of cortisol sampled
   at I = 0, 10 and 20 min after food provision, and no differences were
   found between treatments. In conclusion, 12 h of food deprivation did
   not affect behavioural responses toward novel food in dairy cows,
   suggesting that this test of behavioural responses toward novelty is
   rather insensitive toward day-to-day changes in eating motivation. Low
   energy density in sthe daily ration and increased milking frequency
   affected the behavioural, but not the adrenocortical responses toward

Abstract = {{I Because of the large numbers within a colony and their aggressive
   nature, red wood ants (Formica rufa group) have a potential to greatly
   influence the cold-temperate forest ecosystem. Wood ants are omnivorous
   and hunt in trees as well as on the forest floor.
   2 A field experiment in a mixed forest in central Sweden was carried out
   to examine (i) the foraging behaviour of wood ants on the forest floor
   and (ii) the impact of increased numbers of wood ants on the soil fauna.
   The foraging behaviour of wood ants was manipulated by excluding the
   ants from their food resources in the tree canopy, with the intention to
   increase ant activity on the forest floor. To estimate this activity,
   the number of trees with foraging ants, the numbers of ants going to and
   from their nests and the prey carried by home-running wood ants were
   determined during the summer period. Pitfall traps were placed in the
   soil to determine effects on mobile soil invertebrates.
   3 When excluded from local trees, wood ants searched other trees further
   away from the nests rather than searching more intensively for prey on
   the forest floor. By contrast to the initial hypothesis, more
   soil-living prey were caught by ants in the control plots than in the
   plots where the local trees were not accessible to the wood ants. The
   proportion of soil-living to tree-living prey tended to be greater in
   the control plots.
   4 In the treated plots (no access to the trees), wood ants had a
   negative effect on the activity of Linyphiidae spiders. There was little
   effect of wood ants on other soil invertebrates.
   5 This study suggests that the role of wood ants as top predators in the
   forest soil food-web in central Sweden is limited.}},

Abstract = {{1. Although parasitoids are used widely as a biological models for
   understanding the evolution of animal behaviour, most studies have been
   constrained to the laboratory. The dearth of field studies has been
   compounded by the almost complete ignorance of the physiological
   parameters involved in foraging and dispersal, in particular of the
   energetic constraints imposed by resource limitation.
   2. We estimated the dynamics of carbohydrates and lipids reserves of
   Venturia canescen s (Gravenhorst) females by releasing individuals of
   known nutritional status in a natural environment and recapturing them
   using host-containing traps. The recapture rate was around 30\%. These
   results were compared with the reserves of caged animals kept under
   different experimental conditions (freshly emerged, starved to death,
   fed ad libitum and partially starved). Wild animals were also sampled in
   order to estimate the resource levels of the local population.
   3. The results show that: (i) wasps are able to maintain a nearly
   constant level of energy over an extended foraging period; (ii) V.
   canescens takes sugars in the field; and (iii) the lipid reserves
   accumulated during the larval life may be limiting as lipogenesis does
   not take place in adults even under conditions of high sugar
   availability.
   4. These results demonstrate that wasps can forage for hosts and food
   and disperse in this habitat for hours and days without running into a
   severe risk of energy limitation.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral adaptations and the underlying neural plasticity may not
   simply result from peripheral information conveyed by sensory inputs.
   Central neuronal networks often spontaneously generate neuronal activity
   patterns that may also contribute to sensorimotor integration and
   behavioral adaptations. The present study explored a novel form of
   sensory-induced plasticity by which the resulting changes in motor
   output depend essentially on the preexisting functional state of an
   identified neuron of an endogenously active central network. In the
   isolated lobster stomatogastric nervous system, electrical stimulation
   of a mechanosensory nerve transiently inactivated rhythmic spike
   bursting in the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the pyloric motor
   pattern-generating network. Repeated sensory nerve stimulation gradually
   and long-lastingly strengthened the bursting of the LP neuron to the
   detriment of sensory-elicited inactivation. This strengthening of
   pyloric-timed rhythmic activity was enhanced by experimental
   depolarization of the neuron. Conversely, when the LP neuron was
   hyperpolarized, the same sensory stimulation paradigm now gradually
   increased the susceptibility of the pyloric-timed bursting of the
   network neuron to sensory-elicited inactivation. Modulation of
   depolarization-activated and hyperpolarization-activated ionic
   conductances that underlie the intrinsic bursting properties of the LP
   neuron may contribute via differential voltage-dependent recruitment and
   effects to the respective adaptive processes. These data therefore
   suggest a novel state-dependent mechanism by which an endogenously
   active central network can decrease or increase its responsiveness to
   the same sensory input.}},

Abstract = {{Behaviours or traits associated with aggression and communication may
   increase an animal's conspicuousness to predators or parasitoids. Most
   examples of this come from instances of aggression or communication
   within a species. We tested whether interspecific encounters between
   ants enhance the host location success of a parasitoid (Diptera:
   Phoridae) that attacks ants in the genus Linepithema. At food resources
   recruited to by Linepithema, parasitoid discovery rates were lower when
   Linepithema was alone than when other ant species were present. In
   experimentally controlled encounters, parasitoid discovery rates were
   elevated when Linepithema confronted an ant species that elicited use of
   chemicals, but not when it confronted an ant species that primarily
   elicited physical aggression. These results indicate that phorid
   parasitoids of Linepithema use the ant's chemicals as host location
   cues. Because Linepithema is known to abandon food resources in the
   presence of its phorid parasitoids, its use of chemicals during
   interspecific encounters may diminish its competitive success when

Title = {{Eating disorders and personality.}},
Journal = {{SALUD MENTAL}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Eating disorders are characterized by severe disturbances in eating
   behavior. This section includes two specific diagnoses: anorexia nervosa
   (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). AN is characterized by the refusal to
   maintain a minimally normal body weight. There are two subtypes: the
   restricting type (RAN) and the binge-eating/purging type (BPAN).
   BN is characterized by repeated episodes of binge eating followed by
   inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting;
   misuse of laxatives, diuretics or other medications; fasting, or
   excessive exercise. Disturbances in body shape and weight perception are
   an essential feature of both diagnoses.
   Studies of AN among females in late adolescence and early adulthood have
   found a prevalence rate between 0.5\%-1.0\% in the general population.
   In recent decades, the incidence appears to increase.
   The prevalence of BN among adolescent and young adult females is
   approximately 1\%-3\%; the rate of occurrence of this disorder in males
   is approximately one-tenth of that in females.
   The argument for the study of the personality in the eating disorders is
   based in the observation of specific patterns of behaviors: in BN, a low
   tolerance for frustration and a peer impulse control; on AN,
   inflexibility and the need for having a severe control.
   Psychometric studies have consistently linked AN to a cluster of
   moderately heritable personality and temperamental traits, specifically:
   obsessionality, perfectionism, and harm avoidance.
   In this regard, it has been speculated that phenotype similarities
   between these traits of the anorexic's dietary restrain may be based
   upon shared genetic and environmental factors. While such traits may be
   exaggerated by starvation, their persistence after recovery supports the
   speculation that such traits may be risk factors for AN, rather than
   merely consequences of the disorder.
   Several analogies between eating disorders and depression, borderline
   personality, and obsessive-compulsive personality traits have been
   found. Nevertheless, it is very difficult to detect a single personality
   disturbance related to eating disorders.
   The presence of personality disorders in patients with eating disorders
   goes from 53\% to 93\%, and it has been observed that the presence of
   one or more personality disorders is more frequent in eating disorders
   than in the general population, but still more present in BN patients
   with a previous history of AN.
   Different studies in eating disorders patients had shown the presence of
   obsessive traits in approximately 27\% to 61\%, shy and dependence in
   21\% to 48\%, and anxiety in 51\% to 64\% of the cases. Several studies
   had concluded that the predominant personality traits in eating
   disorders (69\% to 87\%) are a combination of obsessive traits,
   inhibition, and conformism.
   It has been described that almost 30\% of the patients present obsessive
   personality traits and it has been demonstrated that the RAN presents a
   lower psychiatry comorbidity compared to any other eating disorder, even
   though these patients are more isolated and do not accept hunger
   sensations or distress.
   The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), Eysenck
   Personality Questionnaire (Eysenck) and Temperament and Character
   Inventory (TCI) had been used to rate personality traits of patients
   diagnosed with eating disorders.
   It has been found that social phobia disorder was more frequent in AN
   patients (14\%-16\%), followed by the dependent disorder (5\%-10\%), and
   finally, the obsessive-compulsive disorder (6\% to 7\%).
   It has been described that 30\% of the patients have an obsessive
   personality. In fact, there are clinical similitudes between obsessive
   personality and eating disorders with restrictive behaviors. It is more
   common to detect several personality disorders in patients with BPAN
   while patients with RAN suffer of more anxiety and isolation.
   Typically, individuals with BN are within the normal weight range,
   although some may be slightly under or overweight. The disorder is
   uncommon among moderately and morbidly obese individuals. There is an
   increased frequency of depressive symptoms or mood disorders (43.5\%),
   particularly dysthymic disorder and major depressive disorder. There may
   be also an increased frequency of anxiety symptoms or anxiety disorders
   (69\%). Substance abuse, or dependence (18.5\%), particularly involving
   alcohol and stimulants, occurs in about one-third of the individuals
   with BN. Probably between one-third and one-half of the individuals with
   BN also have personality features that meet the criteria for one or more
   personality disorders, specially the borderline personality disorder.
   Several clinical personality instruments agree to characterize BN
   patients as impulsive persons with a high sensibility toward
   interpersonal relationships with low self-esteem, unpredictable
   behaviors, aggressiveness, and poor impulse control.
   In conclusion, there are several personality risk factors for anorexia
   nervosa and bulimia nervosa, some of which are shared with other
   psychiatric disorders. Factors that increase the likelihood of
   impulsivity seem to have more influence for bulimia nervosa than for
   anorexia nervosa. perfectionism and negative self-evaluation appear to
   be particularly common and characteristic of both caring disorders.
   However, while anorexia nervosa patients might have a higher
   persistence, bulimia nervosa patients seem to have an impulsive
   temperament. According to the conceptual model proposed by Cloninger,
   both anorexia and bulimia present lower scores in the self-directness
   dimension.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate factors promoting monogamy, we studied the reproductive
   behaviour and ecology of the monogamous Caribbean cleaner goby at two
   sites near St Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. We assessed mate fidelity and
   the amount of time required to acquire a new mate in experimentally
   widowed males and females. We also measured behavioural responses of
   pair members and single females to experimentally introduced conspecific
   intruders of both sexes. Finally, we evaluated the distribution of
   suitable habitat relative to existing goby territories. We found that
   pairs often separated due to males abandoning females and moving to a
   new territory, that most widowed fish soon acquired a new mate, and that
   there was strong aggression towards large same-sex intruders. We also
   found an abundance of suitable, unoccupied habitat. We conclude that
   pairs are maintained by intrasexual aggression that is related to both
   mate availability and other resources, such as high-quality, food-rich
   cleaning stations. Combined with observations of frequent pair
   separation, interterritory male movement, and relatively rapid remating
   by both sexes, these results suggest a complex mating system that is

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1035-1044}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{As foraging becomes more unpredictable animals should increase their
   body reserves to reduce the risk of starvation. However, any increases
   in reserves may increase the risk of predation because extra mass
   probably compromises escape ability. Because of differences in foraging
   ability not all individuals will be affected in the same way by changes
   in foraging conditions. Relatively poor foragers will have more
   unpredictable foraging success for any given availability of food and
   therefore should carry larger body reserves. The mass-dependent
   predation hypothesis then predicts a negative correlation between levels
   of body reserves and foraging ability, although this may be modified by
   state-dependent compensation. I measured foraging rates and body masses
   of wintering European blackbirds, Turdus merula. Individuals with the
   lowest foraging rates had the largest gain in mass for the winter and
   had relatively high mass overall, independently of age and sex. That
   foraging rate determined mass rather than the reverse was demonstrated
   because foraging rate was independent of daily and seasonal mass change.
   Foraging rate within the experimental system was also independent of
   predation risk (as measured by distance from protective cover) and so
   the relation between mass and foraging rate was unlikely to have been
   confounded by any changes in vigilance to compensate for increased
   mass-dependent predation risk. The results suggest that blackbirds with
   high relative foraging rates have lower body reserves during the winter.
   Therefore there is probably a direct link between overwinter condition
   and fitness at least in blackbirds. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Nestling birds face a dilemma: they can increase parental provisioning
   by begging more intensively, but by doing so may also increase their
   risk of predation. Nestlings could deal with this dilemma by reducing
   begging intensity after parents have warned them of a nearby predator.
   We therefore tested experimentally whether nestling scrubwrens,
   Sericornis frontalis, increase begging intensity with hunger but reduce
   it after adult alarm calls. Single 5- and 8-day-old nestlings were
   temporarily taken into the laboratory for playback experiments. Over a
   90-min period of food deprivation we simulated parental visits every 10
   min by playing back adult feeding calls. Hungrier nestlings begged
   louder and longer to simulated parental visits, but contrary to
   expectation did not beg less if they had previously heard playback of
   alarm calls, and even begged to the alarm calls themselves. The results
   were similar for both `mobbing' and `flee' alarm calls. Nestlings also
   gave distinctive calls in the 10-min interval between simulated parental
   visits, and the number of these calls increased with hunger and after
   playback of alarm calls. We suggest that nestlings acquire the ability
   to respond appropriately to alarm calls late in the nestling period and
   that therefore parents might be selected to avoid alarm calling when
   defending young nestlings. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on

   Methods: Probands with depression and their nearest-aged siblings from
   Wales were compared with healthy control probands and their nearest-aged
   siblings on the TCI and measures of depressed mood.
   Results: All 7 scales of the TO were familial, and scores on 6 of the
   scales were similar to US population scores. However, the Welsh
   subjects' scores on the self-transcendence scale were markedly lower
   than the US mean, suggesting strong cultural or national influences on
   this measure. Harm avoidance scores were substantially influenced by
   current and past depression, but this scale also showed stable traitlike
   characteristics that are likely related to the genetic vulnerability to
   depression. Novelty seeking and self-directedness were also partly
   state-dependent and were negatively correlated with low mood; high
   scorers may be resilient to the development of depression. High reward
   dependence may also protect against the development of depression and is
   unrelated to mood state. The cooperativeness, persistence, and
   self-transcendence scales appear to have a limited relationship with the
   development of depression.
   Conclusions: Harm avoidance, reward dependence, novelty seeking, and

Abstract = {{Early in the co-evolution of plant-animal relationships, some arthropod
   species began to utilize the chemical defences of plants to protect
   themselves from their own predators and parasites. It is likely,
   therefore, that the origins of herbal medicine have their roots deep
   within the animal kingdom. From prehistoric times man has looked to wild
   and domestic animals for sources of herbal remedies. Both folklore and
   living examples provide accounts of how medicinal plants were obtained
   by observing the behaviour of animals. Animals too learn about the
   details of self-medication by watching each other. To date, perhaps the
   most striking scientific studies of animal self-medication have been
   made on the African great apes. The great ape diet is often rich in
   plants containing secondary compounds of non-nutritional, sometimes
   toxic, value that suggest medicinal benefit from their ingestion.
   Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), bonobos (Pan paniscus) and gorillas
   (Gorilla gorilla) are known to swallow whole and defecate intact leaves.
   The habit has been shown to be a physical means of purging intestinal
   parasites. Chimpanzees and man co-existing in sub-Saharan Africa are
   also known to ingest the bitter pith of Vernonia amygdalina for the
   control of intestinal nematode infections. Phytochemical studies have
   demonstrated a wide array of biologically-active properties in this
   medicinal plant species. In light of the growing resistance of parasites
   and pathogens to synthetic drugs, the study of animal self-medication

   many practical barriers exist to consumer uptake of these foods.
   Effective communication of the whole grain health message is an
   important strategy to increase awareness of the importance of whole
   grains in the diet. Increasing the variety and availability of
   acceptable wholegrain foods is also important. Whole grain consumption
   at breakfast can have an important impact on total daily nutrient
   intakes. This simple dietary modification is potentially relatively easy
   to achieve and could greatly contribute to increased whole grain intake
   for many individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Although group living can confer benefits to individuals in terms of
   reduced predation risk and enhanced foraging success, it may also be
   associated with costs, such as increased competition for food. The
   nutritional state of an individual could therefore affect its readiness
   to join or remain in groups. We investigated the shoaling behaviour of
   banded killifish by following marked individuals, whose nutritional
   state had been experimentally manipulated, and recording their shoaling
   behaviour in a field enclosure containing unmarked conspecifics.
   Overall, food-deprived fish spent more time alone, and therefore less
   time shoaling, than well-fed individuals. When shoaling, however,
   food-deprived fish were not found in smaller shoals than well-fed
   conspecifics. Furthermore, they did not show a greater latency to shoal
   initially. Having joined a shoal, however, food-deprived fish left
   shoals more frequently to be alone than fed fish. Rates of change in the
   membership size of shoals occupied by either well-fed or food-deprived
   fish did not differ. We conclude that nutritional state seems to affect
   an individual's decision to continue shoaling once an association has
   been made. This study is the first to investigate experimentally
   state-dependent changes in the size of social groups in fish under field
   conditions. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of The

Abstract = {{State dependence is thought to be an important factor in resource
   allocation decisions, particularly in those decisions relating to
   parental care. Incubation behaviour is a costly part of avian parental
   care, and therefore likely to depend on the parent's body condition. We
   manipulated the body condition of zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata,
   during incubation by using prelaying diets of different protein content,
   and induced birds to lay a similar number of eggs. We tested the
   hypothesis that birds in better body condition would invest more in
   incubation than birds in poorer condition when incubating on the same
   diet. Females that had received a high-protein prelaying diet lost more
   body mass than those that had received a low-protein diet. They also
   increased the length of their incubation bouts between early and middle
   incubation, whereas females that had received a low-protein prelaying
   diet increased bout length only between middle and late incubation.
   There were no differences between males from the two diet groups, and
   males were responsible for a lesser proportion of incubation than
   females. These results indicate that incubation behaviour is state
   dependent in female zebra finches, and that birds of different body
   condition adopt different incubation strategies. We found no differences
   in incubation duration and hatching success between the two incubation
   strategies in captivity, but the potential risk of nest predation in the
   wild may differ. We suggest that only females in good condition can
   afford to adopt a strategy of increasing bout length early in
   incubation; females in poorer condition first have to recover their body
   condition after having produced a clutch. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Predation risk affects relative strength of top-down and bottom-up
   impacts on insect herbivores}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Elucidating the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up forces in
   communities of phytophagus insects has been a major historical focus.
   Current consensus is that both forces play a role, but it is poorly
   known if these forces act differently on herbivores in the same
   assemblage and what factors underlie this variation. Using manipulative
   experiments with an assemblage of sap-feeding phytophagous insects (six
   species of plant-hoppers, leafhoppers, and heteropteran bugs) inhabiting
   intertidal Spartina marshes, we examined the association between
   herbivore behavior, risk of predation, and ultimately the relative
   impact of top-down (wolf spider predation) and bottom-up (host-plant
   nutrition) factors on the population density of each sap-feeding
   herbivore.
   A factorial experiment on open Spartina islets in the field (two levels
   of plant nutrition crossed with two levels of spider predation) showed
   that bottom-up and top-down manipulations differentially affected the
   various sap-feeders. Overall, bottom-up effects dominated in this
   sap-feeder community, whereby the density of all six sap-feeders
   increased when the nitrogen content of Spartina was elevated. By
   contrast, wolf-spider addition significantly suppressed populations of
   only the Prokelisia species and had little impact on the other four
   sap-feeder species in the community. Functional-response experiments and
   behavioral studies revealed that certain species (Prokelisia
   planthoppers) were at much higher risk of attack by wolf spiders than
   other sap-feeders in the assemblage and that risk of predation was
   associated with a species' particular ``escape/defensive behavior.{''}
   Moreover, risk of spider predation was roughly linked to the strength of
   top-down impacts in the field, because species with ineffective escape
   behaviors and a high risk of spider attack (Prokelisia planthoppers)
   were the only sap-feeders whose populations were suppressed by spider
   predation in the field. Thus, specific behavioral characteristics of the
   sap-feeders on Spartina influenced risk of predation and the relative
   strength of top-down and bottom-up impacts on their population dynamics.
   Notably, all herbivores in this system were positively influenced by
   elevated plant nutrition, only the common sap-feeder species (Prokelisia
   planthoppers) were adversely affected by spider predation, and it was
   the rarer sap-feeders in the assemblage that were least impacted by
   predation. These results call into question the overall pervasiveness of
   top-down forces and underscore the primacy of basal resources in
   structuring this community of phytophagous insects.}},

Abstract = {{Bisphenol A (BPA) is an environmental estrogen with potentially averse
   effects on public health. We studied the long-term effects of perinatal
   exposure to BPA on later behavior in adult rats of both sexes. BPA or
   vehicle was administered orally to mother rats from mating to pups'
   weaning, at a concentration (0.040 mg/kg) within the range of human
   exposure. The offspring of both sexes were tested at adolescence
   (postnatal days 35-45) for novelty preference (experiment 1). After a
   3-day familiarization to one side of a two-chamber apparatus, on day 4
   rats were allowed to freely explore the whole apparatus. BPA-exposed
   females spent significantly less time than did controls in. exploration
   of the novel side (i.e., increased neophobia), whereas no effect was
   found in the male group. At adulthood, the same animals were food
   deprived and tested for profiles of impulsive behavior (experiment 2),
   in operant chambers provided with two nose-poking holes (delivering
   either five or one food pellet). After the establishment of a baseline
   preference for the large reinforcer, a delay was introduced before the
   delivery of the five food pellets, which was progressively increased
   each day (10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 80, 100 sec). As expected, all animals
   exhibited a progressive shift toward the immediate but smaller
   reinforcer. A reduced level of impulsive behavior (i.e., a shift to the
   right in the intolerance-delay curve) was evidenced in BPA-treated rats.
   The frequency of inadequate responding (during the length of the delay)
   also provided a measure of restless behavior. Interestingly, the profile
   of BPA-treated males was feminized, strongly resembling that of control
   females. Animals were then tested (experiment 3) for the response to an
   amphetamine challenge (I mg/kg, subcutaneously). The drug-induced
   increment activity was significantly less marked in BPA-treated male
   rats compared with controls. These findings provide clear indirect
   evidence of long-term alterations in brain monoaminergic function after
   perinatal BPA exposure. This may be a cause for concern for public
   health, confirming that exposure to a weak environmental estrogen in the
   period of sexual differentiation of the brain can influence adult
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Perfectionism is a dimension which has been studied very little as a
   separate entity. It is not even considered as a nosological factor. No
   classification of the medical sciences underlines its importance other
   than to speak of a personality trait, of an aspect, or of a parameter.
   Nevertheless, perfectionism is related to multiple disorders such as
   depression (18, 20, 36), suicide (8, 16, 55), nutritional problems (11,
   28), anxiety (3), obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (53), social
   phobia (2), as well as insomnia (46). Certain authors stress the
   possible role of perfectionism in the development or the persistence of
   a substantial number of these disorders (7, 22, 38). Given these facts,
   it is all the easier to understand the interest shown by clinicians and
   researchers in the subject. Better detection and evaluation of its
   impact on behaviour is important in putting therapies in place (6,53).
   Relationships between perfectionism and fear of failure have been
   approached (21, 51, 54). Correlations between perfectionism and high
   levels of state and trait anxiety have been demonstrated (23). The
   evaluation of perfectionism has been dealt with very little. Some
   questionnaires devote a sub-category to it, such as the Eating Disorder
   Inventory and the Irrational Beliefs Test. However, recently, it has
   been recognized that perfectionism is a multidimensional construct. Two
   Multidimensional Perfectionism Scales have been developed and
   investigated in relative isolation. Frost, Marten, Lahart and Rosenblate
   defined perfectionism as the setting of excessively high standards for
   performance associated with critical self-evaluation. Six dimensions are
   described: concern over making mistakes, high personal standards,
   parental expectations, parental criticism, doubt about quality of
   performance and organization. Internal consistency and validity have
   been established (25, 26). Hewitt and Flett (30, 31, 33, 35) have
   developed another approach where three dimensions of perfectionism are
   described: SOP (Self Oriented Perfectionism) related to high standards
   and self criticism, SPP (Socially Prescribed Perfectionism) related to
   the need of approval from others and fear of negative evaluation, OOP
   (Other-Oriented Perfectionism) reflecting a tendency to set high
   expectations for others and to evaluate them in a demanding way; this
   component is related, especially for males, to self-esteem, hostility
   and authoritarianism. Validity and internal consistency have been
   established too (30, 31, 35). The Frost and al's Multidimensional
   Perfectionism Scale and the Hewitt and Flett's scales are closely
   associated, except concerning the OOP. Because this component could
   provide new information, we have chosen the second scale, referring to
   the French translation and validation of Labrecque (45). EMP is the
   French name of MPS; it is a self-report questionnaire of 45 questions,
   in fact three subscales of 15 items rated on a 7-point Likert-type
   scale. MPS was administered to 617 first year students at the university
   of Liege (table II). Differences are considered according to gender and
   experience of failure ie the fact of repeating an academic year. We
   realized a component analysis with promax rotation. Among the different
   possibilities offered by the scree-test the choice of a 4 factor
   solution stresses the original structure: SOP (14 items), SPP (12
   items), OOP (9 items) and anti OOP (10 items); the last one is
   additional but allows for respecting semantics and saturation of the
   items. The first aim of confirming validity and internal consistency is
   satisfactory.
   In other respects the multidimensional structure of the concept leads to
   consideration of a positive, adaptive perfectionism and a more negative
   perfectionism, facilitating psychopathology (59, 60, 61). So it seems
   interesting to compare the different components of MPS in order to find
   an eventual sex-failure effect. The evaluation of perfectionism is
   obvious, considering it as a personality trait, but it can be used also
   in taking into account stress and its impact, for instance that of
   academic performance (29, 37, 39, 58). Conferring on MPS more pertinence
   in gender differentiation and failure evaluation is an other goal of
   this research. Through the particular choice of statistical results, sex
   and sex-failure effects can be demonstrated: a MANOVA underlines sex
   effect (lambda de Wilks = 0.96, p = 0.001) and sex-failure effect ( de
   Wilks = 0.98, p = 0.05). Structure of MPS is different in four groups
   (FE: women with failure, FnE women without failure, ME: men with
   failure, MnE : men without failure). ANOVA show differences of MPS3,
   MPS1 and MPS2.Far more promising is the use of the LISREL method
   allowing for the construction of a coherent model of relationships
   between some dimensions of MPS and Test-Anxiety, approached here with
   THEE (test d'habilete aux etudes et a leur evaluation) French
   abbreviated version (49) of TASTE (Test for Ability to Study and
   Evaluation). In fact according to the literature of fear of failure,
   girls score higher on anxiety and procrastination but less on
   self-confidence. The structural model shows different pathways, more
   especially between SPP (socially prescribed perfectionism), T2 (sense of
   incompetence) and T1 (anxiety). SOP (self oriented perfectionism) and
   SPP (socially prescribed perfectionism) by girls are very much
   correlated; it seems that they are more subjected to society and its
   exigencies of studying but consequently they are more at risk of anxiety
   and a sense of incompetence. SOP (self oriented perfectionism) by boys
   functions more indiscriminately of SPP (socially prescribed
   perfectionism) and is negatively correlated with self-incompetence; boys
   are more self-confident but they usually procrastinate more probably
   because failure expectancies would be particularly harmful for their
   self-esteem; consequently, failure should be related to something else
   than their own capacity; this maybe an explanation of the high rate of
   male dropouts and failure in the first year at the university of Liege;
   also a factor explaining the female domination at the university. In the
   same way the first choice of studies is moving towards shorter and less
   difficult orientation (46). In case of failure the model is very similar
   according to gender: SOP (self oriented perfectionism) and T1 (anxiety)
   are directly connected; SOP and SPP are in this case better correlated
   by boys but the path between SPP, sense of incompetence and anxiety is
   less significant than in girls. In conclusion, providing some
   modifications according to semantics, the choice of a four factor
   solution allows for confirmation of the original structure of MPS and
   for internal consistency. The different components of MPS vary according
   to gender: SOP and more OOP discriminate men and women; SPP allows for
   differentiating women with failure. A structural model enhances the role
   of perfectionism in the cognitive and behavioural contexts; for instance
   it clarifies its action on fear of failure and success rates according
   to gender.}},

   Methods: Early-stage breast and prostate cancer cases (N = 530) will be
   identified within 9 months of diagnosis from hospital cancer registries
   and large oncologic practices throughout the United States. These
   individuals will be sent a letter of invitation and screened for
   eligibility. After a baseline telephone interview, participants will be
   randomized into one of two arms that receive materials aimed at
   increasing exercise and fruit and vegetable intake, and decreasing
   dietary fat: 1) an experimental arm that receives a workbook and a
   series of six 4-page newsletters delivered every 7 wk and personally
   tailored on type of cancer, cancer coping style, race, age,
   self-efficacy, stage of readiness, and barriers and/or progress toward
   goal behavior (i.e., greater than or equal to 30 min of exercise at
   least 5 d(.)wk(-1), greater than or equal to 5 servings of vegetables
   and fruit per day, and less than or equal to 30\% of calories from fat);
   or 2) a control arm that receives a series of nontailored health
   brochures. Follow-up interviews scheduled 1 and 2 yr postbaseline will
   determine short- and long-term efficacy and the effects of the
   interventions on other endpoints (quality of life, perceived health,
   etc.). Factors, such as gender, race, and social support, also will be
   explored to determine potential interactions with program efficacy.
   Conclusion: Given the growing number of cancer survivors,
   distance-medicine-based interventions addressing multiple behaviors and
   targeting this high-risk group have the potential to make a positive and

Abstract = {{Studies of phenotypic plasticity typically focus on traits in single
   ontogenetic stages. However, plastic responses can be induced in
   multiple ontogenetic stages and traits induced early in ontogeny may
   have lasting effects. We examined how gray treefrog larvae altered their
   morphology in four different larval environments and whether different
   larval environments affected the survival, growth, development, and
   morphology of juvenile frogs at metamorphosis. We then reared these
   juveniles in terrestrial environments under high and low intraspecific
   competition to determine whether the initial differences in traits at
   metamorphosis affected subsequent survival and growth, whether the
   initial phenotypic differences converged over time, and whether
   competition in the terrestrial environment induced further phenotypic
   changes. Larval and juvenile environments both affected treefrog traits.
   Larval predators induced relatively deep tail fins and short bodies, but
   there was no impact on larval development. In contrast, larval
   competitors induced relatively short tails and long bodies, reduced
   larval growth, and slowed larval development. At metamorphosis, larval
   predators had no effect on juvenile growth or relative morphology while
   larval competitors produced juveniles that were smaller and possessed
   relatively shorter limbs and shorter bodies. After 1 month of
   terrestrial competition among the juvenile frogs, the initial
   differences in juvenile morphology did not converge. There were no
   differences in growth due to larval treatment but there were differences
   in survival. Individuals that experienced low competition as tadpoles
   experienced near perfect survival as juvenile frogs but individuals that
   experienced high competition as tadpoles suffered an 18\% decrease in
   survival as juvenile frogs. There were also morphological responses to
   juvenile competition, but these changes appear to be due, at least in
   part, to allometric effects. Collectively, these results demonstrate
   that larval environments can have profound impacts on the traits and
   fitness of organisms later in ontogeny.}},

   several aspects of the biotic or abiotic environment are able to change

   extreme sour candies. The present study investigated whether the level
   of sourness most preferred in a food matrix and the ability to
   discriminate differences in sour intensity differed between 5- to
   9-year-old children and their mothers, by using a rank-by-elimination
   procedure embedded in the context of a game. Mothers also completed a
   variety of questionnaires and children were asked several questions to
   assess whether children's temperament and food preferences and habits
   related to sour preferences. The results indicated that, although every
   mother and all but two of the children (92\%) were able to rank the
   gelatins from most to least sour, more than one-third (35\%) of the
   children, but virtually none of the adults, preferred the high levels of
   sour taste (0.25 M citric acid) in gelatin. Those children who preferred
   the extreme sour tastes wore significantly less food neophobic (P <
   0.05) and tended to experience a greater variety of fruits when compared
   with the remaining children (P = 0.11). Moreover, the children's
   preference for sour tastes generalized to other foods, such as candies
   and lemons, as reported by both children and mothers. These findings are
   the first experimental evidence to demonstrate that sour taste
   preferences are heightened during childhood and that such preferences
   are related to children's food habits and preferences. Further research
   is needed to unfold the relationship between the level of sour taste
   preferred and the actual consumption of sour-tasting foods and flavors
   in children.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Decreased food intake is an important risk factor for
   malnutrition, which is highly prevalent among geriatric patients. The
   emotional nature of the hospitalization experience and the complex
   organizational setting involved in meal production and delivery services
   in institutions increase the risk for decreased food intake. Everyday
   emotions are known to have a particularly strong influence on
   decision-making and behavior in the elderly, and have also been shown,
   in younger populations, to influence food intake and its psychological
   antecedents, such as quality perception and satisfaction judgments. The
   objective of this paper is to study the direct impact of elderly
   patients' everyday emotions on food intake and their indirect effects
   mediated by quality perceptions and satisfaction judgments.
   Methods. Thirty patients (20 women, 10 men, 65-92 age range) in a
   geriatric rehabilitation unit were observed on repeated meal episodes
   (average of 46 care episodes per patient) where they provided
   self-reports for emotions (positive emotions, anger, anxiety, and mild
   depressed feelings), perceived meal quality, and satisfaction. Food
   intake was measured in terms of energy and protein content.
   Results. The impact on food intake was favorable, and both direct and
   indirect for positive emotions, direct and negative for anxiety, direct
   and positive for mild depressed feelings, and indirect and negative for
   anger. Indirect effects were mediated by quality perception judgments
   but not by satisfaction, which was not significantly related to food
   intake.
   Conclusion. Results suggest that, given their impact on food intake,
   measuring and monitoring patients' everyday emotions may be an important
   innovative strategy to improve food intake of elderly patients in
   institutions.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral responses of prey to their predators can critically alter
   community dynamics. Whether or not a prey responds, clearly depends on
   the effectiveness of that response. The effectiveness on the other hand
   is predicted to depend on predator behavior. Actively searching
   predators can render the behavioral responses in their prey ineffective.
   Nevertheless, most studies investigating the optimal reaction of prey
   treated predators as immobile elements of the environment. I
   experimentally manipulated activity of poolfrog (Rana lessonae) tadpoles
   by keeping them at low and high food levels, and exposed them to three
   species of invertebrate predators (Aeshna cyanea, Anax imperator, and
   Dytiscus marginalis), whose activity also was manipulated through
   different food levels. Satiated, less active predators were more likely
   to kill hungry, more active tadpoles, but hungry predators killed hungry
   and satiated tadpoles about equally often. This result suggests that
   reducing their activity is a more effective strategy for tadpoles if the
   predators themselves are less active. On the other hand, against hungry,
   highly motivated predators, the behavioral avoidance strategies were
   essentially ineffective. Antipredator behavior is generally thought to
   stabilize the dynamics of predator-prey systems. The results presented
   here, however, suggest that the community dynamical consequences of
   antipredator behavior also critically depend on decisions made by
   predators.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence of anorexia nervosa has increased significantly in the
   last century, particularly in rich, ``Westernized{''} cultures.
   Well-documented risk factors include sex, age, social circumstances, and
   personality. How can a syndrome that reduces fertility-- and sometimes
   leads to death-- spread so easily? and why is there heritable variance
   for some of the risk factors? Evolutionary models postulate that
   anorexia is a set of coordinated responses to stress that, for other
   mammals and in our own evolutionary past, led to increased survival and
   reproductive success. According to these models, the ``epidemic{''} of
   anorexia that we now see is a ``modern pathology{''}-- an adaptation
   that, due to changes in our environment, has ``gone awry{''} and become
   maladaptive. Changes in both the nutritional environment and the social
   environment of Western culture have led to increased triggering of this
   once-adaptive syndrome, with risk-factors mapping onto social and
   personality features that would have been relevant in our evolutionary
   past. In particular, the triggering role of social stressors related to
   female competition suggests that anorexia may be a symptom of social
   manipulation, and that the low fertility of anorectics may be the result
   of an adaptive strategy of more dominant women to decrease the success
   of their reproductive competitors.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To validate the concept of parent-reported picky eating
   using objective, laboratory-based measures and to identify both child
   and parental precursors and concomitants of picky eating. Method: One
   hundred thirty-five infants were monitored from birth to 5.5 years.
   Behavioral measures of picky eating were obtained from standardized
   feedings at ages 3-5 and 5,5 years in the laboratory and at home. Child
   precursors were measures of infant sucking behavior; parental precursors
   were disinhibition of eating, restrained eating, body dissatisfaction,
   and body mass index. Parentally reported attitudes and behaviors thought
   to be related to pickiness and parental concomitants were taken from the
   Stanford,Feeding Questionnaire. Child Temperament was assessed by the
   Children's Behavior Questionnaire. Results: Picky eaters ate fewer foods
   and were especially more likely to avoid vegetables. Picky girls
   decreased their caloric intake between ages 3.5 and 5-5, whereas all
   other children increased their caloric intake. None of the included
   parental precursors was significantly related to pickiness. Picky eaters
   demonstrated a different sucking pattern with fewer sucks per feeding

Abstract = {{Epidemiological research has emphasized that adolescence is associated
   with some temperamental and behavioral traits that are typical of this
   age and that might substantially contribute to both psychological and
   psychobiological vulnerability. The contribution of the important
   developmental rearrangements in neurobiological and
   neuroendocrinological processes has received surprisingly little
   investigation. The present review summarizes recent work in animal
   models, indicating that adolescent rodents exhibit marked peculiarities
   in their spontaneous behavioral repertoire. When compared to adults,
   adolescents show an unbalanced and `extremes-oriented' behavior,
   consisting of an increased novelty seeking, together with decreased
   novelty-induced stress and anxiety, an increased risk-taking behavior in
   the plus-maze, as well as elevated levels of impulsivity and
   restlessness. Age-related discontinuities in the function of
   monoaminergic systems, which are a main target of abused drugs, can
   perhaps account for such a profile. In particular, a peculiar function
   within reward-related dopaminergic brain pathways actually seems to
   underlie the search for novel and rewarding sensations, as well as
   changes in the magnitude of psychostimulant effects. The role played by
   early epigenetic factors in the shaping of novelty-seeking behavior of
   adolescent and adult rodents are also reviewed. Two examples are
   considered, namely, subtle variations in the hormonal milieu as a
   function of intrauterine position and precocious or delayed maturation
   of nutritional independence as a function of changes in time of weaning.
   As for spontaneous drug consumption, a prominent vulnerability to the
   oral intake of nicotine during early adolescence is reported. In
   conclusion, adolescence in rodents may represent a suitable animal model
   with enough face- and construct-validity. Actually, this model is able
   to show behavioral features that resemble those found in human
   adolescents, including vulnerability to the consumption of psychoactive
   drugs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One method proposed for moderating the negative effects of habitat
   isolation is the preservation or restoration of linear landscape
   elements that structurally link isolated habitat remnants. An
   understanding of how animals react to landscape elements and move
   through the landscape is vital for species management and theory
   development. To achieve this understanding, detailed information on
   movement rates and specific movement behavior of individual animals in
   different ecosystems is essential. In an experimental study, we
   investigated whether individuals of Roesel's bush-cricket ( Metrioptera
   roeseli) prefer to use corridors or move over the matrix when they leave
   a habitat patch. We examined whether movement rates and movement angles
   in corridors and matrix differed and whether individuals showed
   edge-avoidance behavior. Differences in these behaviors were analyzed in
   relation to the softness of habitat edges. We found that approximately
   30\% more individuals used the corridor than would be expected if
   dispersal behavior was random. All individuals using the corridor as a
   dispersal route moved to the end of the corridor and into the
   surrounding habitat, which is 1000\% more than would be expected if
   dispersal was random. The edge type ( hard or soft) did not influence
   whether individuals moved through corridors or the matrix. Individuals
   that moved through the corridor moved straighter but slower than
   individuals that moved over the matrix. A higher movement rate over the
   matrix than through corridors may be explained by an increased risk of
   predation, starvation, or dehydration in the open habitat causing
   individuals to move more quickly toward the higher vegetation. Our
   results suggest that individuals avoid the edge and the matrix and that
   the corridor is a preferred alternative for dispersal. We conclude that
   for this species, and probably other similar species of Orthoptera,
   linear elements in the form of corridors have a positive influence on
   the individual's dispersal through the landscape. This demonstrates the
   value of corridors in reducing the negative effect of habitat
   fragmentation on the persistence of local species.}},

Abstract = {{The response of foraging animals to human disturbance can be considered
   as a trade-off between the increased perceived predation risk of
   tolerating disturbance and the increased starvation risk of not feeding
   and avoiding disturbance. We show how the response of overwintering
   oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus to disturbance is related to their
   starvation risk of avoiding disturbance. As winter progresses,
   oystercatcher energy requirements increase and their feeding conditions
   deteriorate. To survive they spend longer feeding and so have less spare
   time in which to compensate for disturbance. Later in winter, birds
   approach a disturbance source more closely and return more quickly after
   a disturbance. Their behavioural response to disturbance is less when
   they are having more difficulty surviving and hence their starvation
   risk of avoiding disturbance is greater. These results have implications
   for studies which assume that a larger behavioural response means that a
   species is more vulnerable to disturbance. The opposite may be true. To
   more fully understand the impact of disturbance, studies should measure
   both behavioural responses and the ease with which animals are meeting
   their requirements. Conservation effort should be directed towards
   species which need to spend a high proportion of their time feeding, but

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{59-67}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article describes infant mental health from two perspectives: why
   it is relevant and how to implement interventions, including preventive
   ones. Topics covered are based on evidence available in scientific
   literature. The first section addresses areas that justify the
   importance assigned to infants and their emotional well-being. One of
   them deals with new information about brain development. Recent
   available information emphasizes the crucial role of
   sensory/experiential input for the development of the brain in terms of
   determining the formation of new synapses, influencing cell migration
   and the ``pruning{''} of refined and dedicated neuronal pathways.
   Experiences (exposure to language, contingent responses by the
   caregiver, motion in space) influence the development of the brain.
   Also, negative and anxiety provoking events as well as psychological
   trauma cause a negative outcome through this effect. Prolonged and/or
   severe trauma has been shown to influence negatively the functioning of
   the limbic system and the capacity of the child to feel empathy and/or
   compassion, to regulate emotions and to learn new information.
   New evidence is reviewed from longitudinal research. Several studies
   have demonstrated that it is possible to ``trace back{''} which elements
   are necessary during early childhood, to put a child at a high risk of
   becoming a criminal or severe offender. These include attributes in the
   child him or herself (restlessness, impulsiveness, lack of fear)
   together with a history of maltreatment and chronically adverse
   experiences. Excessive shyness is another fairly persistent trait from
   early infancy to adulthood. Since these ``risk factors{''} are known,
   particular children could he targeted for early intervention programs.
   A follow up study conducted by some of the authors with infants seen in
   a mental health clinic and followed up to age four, indicates that the
   strongest predictor of the outcome and functioning of the child at age
   four is not the severity or type of problems for which the child was
   originally evaluated. The strongest predictor was the quality of
   parenting and parenting behaviors of the caregivers as assessed during
   infancy. This finding suggests the importance of helping parents as
   early as possible to cope with infant problems in a benign and sensitive
   way, before negative circles of interaction are entrenched and spiral
   into an ongoing negative relationship.
   Together with the studies of risk, those focusing on resilience are
   summarized. Knowing which traits or experiences are protective against
   psychopathology is crucial, in order to promote their flourishing in
   early childhood. Studies with children at high psychosocial risk from
   Kauai, Hawaii as well as with children from other groups in the world
   converge in describing resilient traits in early childhood: an easy
   temperament, a ``social orientation{''}, sense of humor, attractiveness
   and the ability to communicate with others, as well as intelligence.
   Several experiences are protective, such as having few separations from
   the mother and having had a sibling when the index child was at least
   three years old. This knowledge can be used to promote resilient
   features in children and to develop interventions for those at most
   risk.
   Epidemiological evidence suggests that infancy disturbances are not
   rare, but frequent (15 to 20\% of the population). Studies of the
   prevalence of problems like feeding and sleeping disturbances, excessive
   crying and disruptive behavior in infancy point in this direction. This
   justifies the need for early recognition and identification,
   particularly when they are severe. Excessive crying increases the risk
   of the child being abused or shaken; likewise sleep disturbance is
   associated with irritability and hyperactive behavior in the infant.
   Parents who are deprived of sleep are prone to be more negative and to
   feel exhausted. Eating disturbances can be associated with failure to
   thrive. Early malnutrition has been associated with hypertension in
   middle age, as well as with a higher risk of coronary disease. Maternal
   depression and domestic violence are rampant in the perinatal period.
   Maternal depression is associated with more crying and sleeping problems
   in infancy, and hyperactivity and negative behavior in the school age
   child.
   The findings of a survey in a ``well-baby clinic{''} (health
   surveillance clinic) conducted by some of the authors concur in the
   finding that parents are worried about their baby's behavior in all
   these areas and that they readily identify the problems, when asked.
   Furthermore, their worries are justified. This is in sharp contrast with
   the tendency in most pediatric settings to ``wait and see{''} hoping
   that problems in the baby will be solved by themselves.
   The second part of the review focuses on two issues: techniques of
   clinical intervention and preventive strategies and their results. There
   is scant scientific evidence on the efficacy of parent infant
   psychotherapies. Techniques vary widely in their content and their focus
   or target population. Strategies like brief parent-infant psychotherapy
   and the therapeutic consultation are framed psychodynamically and focus
   on the transgenerational transmission of ``fantasmatic{''} interactions
   and projections placed on the infant. These appear more suitable for
   families that are relatively healthier and lacking massive stressors. On
   the other side of the spectrum, techniques such as interactive guidance
   and infant-parent psychotherapy are designed for families under more
   stress, and when the parent child relationship is very negative.
   These strategies are used with ``unreachable families{''}.
   Interactive guidance attempts to focus on what the parents are doing
   well through a videotaped feedback given to them, and gradually
   expanding their repertoire of sensitive and empathic behaviors towards
   the baby. Infant-parent psychotherapy is long term and involves
   interventions that are non traditional, like psychotherapy at home,
   practical help to the parents, and the promotion of a long term
   relationship of trust between the caregivers and the therapist. The
   focus is to achieve a ``corrective attachment experience{''} in the
   parents, which will in turn render them more sensitive and responsive
   towards their baby. Multimodal and flexible techniques are advocated in
   order to tailor the intervention to the particular needs and style of
   each family
   Finally, evidence on the effectiveness of various prevention programs is
   reviewed. These are grouped according to the timing of the intervention,
   from pregnancy to toddlerhood. Evidence suggests that improving marital
   communication and promoting conflict resolution before the baby is born
   may enhance maternal sensitivity and lead to a more secure attachment in
   the infant. There is research on interventions in the perinatal period.
   These include having psychosocial support during the delivery process.
   In addition, ``bonding{''} between newborn and mother (without undue
   intrusion by health care personnel) has positive effects. This involves
   skin to skin contact and early breast-feeding. These simple
   interventions have been shown to promote maternal sensitivity, more
   patience and less behavioral difficulties several months later. The mere
   demonstration of the abilities of the newborn, his or her uniqueness and
   preferences as well as an observation of the baby's perceptual
   abilities, is associated with long term positive behavioral effects. All
   this points to the importance of conducting an intervention during a
   ``sensitive period{''}. Several meta-analytic studies on home visitation
   conclude that these programs are most effective if the intervention has
   a clear focus, is brief and practical help and advice are given to the
   parents on site. 13 7 contrast, with families having a high risk of
   abusing their child, home visitations are the only hopeful strategy so
   far. In this case, home visitation should be long-term and also focused
   on specific problem solving with parents and suggestion of alternative
   strategies of behavior management with the child. In families under
   considerable stress home visitation, together with the opportunity to
   have positive experiences for the infant, in the form of a good day care
   setting, also have a lasting and beneficial effect several years later,
   in terms of better academic performance, reduced psychopathology and
   better parent child relationships.}},

   collecting information to reduce uncertainty, or insuring against it. We
   investigate the relative value of information and insurance (energy
   reserves) under starvation risk by offering model foragers a choice
   between constant and varying food sources over finite foraging bouts. We
   show that sampling the variable option (choosing it when it is not
   expected to be good) should decline both with lower reserves and late in
   foraging bouts; in order to be able to reap the reduction in uncertainty
   associated with exploiting a variable resource effectively, foragers
   must be able to afford and compensate for an initial increase in the
   risk of an energetic shortfall associated with choosing the option when
   it is bad. Consequently, expected exploitation of the varying option
   increases as it becomes less variable, and when the overall risk of
   energetic shortfall is reduced. In addition, little activity on the
   variable alternative is expected until reserves are built up early in a
   foraging bout. This indicates that gathering information is a luxury
   while insurance is a necessity, at least when foraging on stochastic and

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{677-683}},

Abstract = {{Under predation risk, prey may prioritize antipredator behaviours and
   sacrifice feeding. However, energetically constrained animals may choose
   to sacrifice or change antipredator responses and accept relatively
   greater risk in order to secure food. In this last case, the
   antipredator tactics chosen must balance safety and feeding in such a
   way that costs are minimized and benefits maximized. We studied the
   antipredator behaviour of pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris)
   (Hemiptera: Aphididae) subjected to different periods of food
   deprivation, against the parasitoid Aphidius ervi (Hymenoptera:
   Braconidae). As the energetic internal stress of aphids increased, the
   predominant antipredator response changed from walking away and dropping
   to kicking behaviour, and parasitization avoidance decreased.
   Parasitoids did not show preference between food-deprived and
   nonfood-deprived aphids. Dropping and walking away reduced
   parasitization from 50 to 33\%. These results support the hypothesis
   that the antipredator behaviour of an aphid changes as a function of
   internal stress. By performing less costly behaviour such as kicking
   under energetically constrained conditions, aphids seem to minimize
   their probability of energy shortfall. Given that aphid antipredator
   behaviour is a function of nutritional state, its occurrence under
   natural conditions may match host quality spatial distribution. (C) 2002

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{523-540}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Phenotypically plastic responses to environmental change are typically
   compartmentalized by the type of environmental cues that cause the
   induction (e.g., temperature, light), but different types of
   environmentally induced responses might very well be related to each
   other. I used a number of experiments to document competitor-induced
   behavior and morphology in wood frog tadpoles (Rana sylvatica), to
   quantify how competitor-induced changes affected subsequent competitive
   ability, and to investigate the cues responsible for the
   competitor-induced response. Competitors induced wood frogs to increase
   their activity and generally develop larger bodies and smaller tails.
   Further, wood frogs were able to discriminate between intraspecific and
   interspecific competitors. Whereas behavioral responses to competitors
   are well documented, the widespread morphological responses are a new
   discovery; these responses are particularly intriguing because they are
   in the opposite direction of predator-induced responses in tadpoles. The
   competitor-induced phenotypes are not simply an allometric effect, but
   appear to be adaptive responses to competitors; competitor-induced wood
   frogs experienced higher relative growth rates than noninduced wood
   frogs in subsequent performance trials, but past studies suggest that
   the competitor-induced phenotype should experience higher predation
   risk. When responding to competition, wood frogs were not responding
   only to reduced food. They were able to sense changes in both the per
   capita food levels and changes in density (per unit volume) that were
   independent of per capita food level. Thus, these animals have an
   amazing ability to sense changes in their environments and respond in
   very precise ways.
   When one considers competitor-induced responses in light of past studies
   on predator-induced phenotypes in larval anurans, one sees that
   predator-induced traits provide individuals with increased predator
   resistance but decreased competitive ability, whereas competitor-induced
   traits provide individuals with increased competitive ability but
   decreased predator resistance. This suggests that predator- and
   competitor-induced plasticity have evolved an intricate link that
   presents a trade-off between competitive ability and predator resistance
   ability. This trade-off is common across species and makes sense in
   light of the environments in which wood frogs live, ranging from ponds
   with high densities of predators and few tadpoles competing to ponds
   with few predators and extremely high densities of tadpoles competing.
   Further, there is evidence that this type of plasticity trade-off might
   be quite common in other phenotypically plastic taxa.}},

Abstract = {{1. Patch marks that allow the subsequent avoidance of marked areas may
   be used by small animals to increase foraging efficiency. This study is
   the first to demonstrate the presence of a patch-marking system in

   females, and factors such as hunger state and patch quality play a key
   role in determining whether a female will re-investigate a self-marked
   patch.
   2. Females of the insect predator Orius sauteri avoided areas where the
   female itself had searched previously but did not avoid areas searched
   by conspecific females when deprived of prey for 24 h. There was no
   evidence that males use such a patch-marking system, indicating the
   presence of a sex difference in patch-mark use.
   3. Females did not discriminate between patches visited previously and
   patches not visited when they were either well fed or when patches
   contained abundant prey.
   4. The patch mark used by females was effective for less than or equal
   to 1 h and may be a reliable indicator of a recently visited area in
   which prey have been depleted.

Abstract = {{Larvae of the salamander Hynobius retardatus have two distinct morphs:
   normal and broad-headed, cannibal morphs. We performed three experiments
   to differentiate among the following hypotheses: The broad-headed morph
   is induced to allow: (1) feeding on nutritious conspecifics; (2)
   exclusion of strong competitors for food or space; or (3) feeding on
   large, tough prey when smaller prey items are unavailable. When newly
   hatched larvae were reared with a heterospecific, Rana pirica (an anuran
   amphibian) tadpoles, the broad-headed morph was induced more frequently
   compared with those reared with conspecifics. The phenotype expressed
   depended on the size of the tadpoles: The broad-headed morph occurred
   more frequently with small and the normal morph with large tadpoles.
   Metamorphosis occurred sooner in larvae fed conspecifics compared with
   those fed heterospecific tadpoles, and the mean growth rate of larvae
   fed conspecifics was significantly faster than that of those fed
   tadpoles, suggesting that the heterospecific tadpoles were less
   nutritive than the conspecifics. These results do not support the
   hypotheses that the broad-headed morph evolved for consuming
   conspecifics because of their better balance of nutrients or for
   excluding strong competitors for food or space. We tentatively conclude
   that the morph evolved to eat large, tough prey, including both
   conspecifics and heterospecific tadpoles. Because H. retardatus usually
   spawns very early in the spring in small ponds partially covered with
   ice and snow, newly hatched larvae may starve from the lack of proper
   food owing to extremely low water temperatures. Thus, the broad-headed
   morph of H. retardatus may represent a cold-habitat adaptation to
   overcome the severe circumstance when the only food items available are
   relatively large conspecifics or heterospecific tadpoles.}},

   3. Temperature and diet had strong effects on the maximum size reached

   varied inversely with temperature. The effect of diet depended on
   temperature; larvae fed on a `carnivorous' diet (rich in protein and
   lipids) achieved a larger size than larvae offered an `herbivorous' diet
   (rich in carbohydrates) at 17 degreesC but not at 12 or 22 degreesC.
   4. Larval period was insensitive to diet composition, and varied only
   with temperature. Primarily the interacting effects of food quality and
   temperature affected size at metamorphosis. Size at metamorphosis varied
   inversely with temperature under the plant- and the animal-based diets.
   However, the carnivorous diet resulted in bigger metamorphs at 17 and 22

Abstract = {{We investigated the ability of the water flea, Daphnia, to adapt the

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{447-452}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Foraging decisions may reflect a trade-off between food intake and
   safety and can also be influenced by the animal's internal state.
   Foraging in the web-building spider Stegodyphus lineatus depends on a
   capture web associated with a retreat (the nest). The relocation of
   nests, including the take-over of conspecific nests, may be viewed as a
   foraing decision, which depends on risk of exposure, cost of silk
   production and hunger state. We investigated a possible state-dependent
   trade-off in nest site choice of S. lineatus spiderlings. The
   philopatric nature of S. lineatus implies a high risk of encounters with
   potentially cannibalistic conspecifics and a potential loss of inclusive
   fitness because encountered conspecifics are likely to be kin. To test
   for state dependence of foraging decisions, we compared preferences of
   well-fed and hungry spiders for their own nests and those of siblings
   and nonsiblings. We expected satiated spiders to prefer their own to
   conspecific nests and hungry spiders to choose the risky option of a
   conspecific nest. Since S. lineatus is less aggressive towards kin, we
   tested the ability of spiders to discriminate kin by silk-bound cues.
   Because of this reduced aggression, preference for kin nests should be
   safer than preference for nonkin nests. A strong preference for
   self-nests demonstrated self-recognition in well-fed spiders. However,
   neither well-fed nor hungry spiders discriminated between nests of
   siblings and nonsiblings. Well-fed spiders preferred self-nests to empty
   chambers, but showed no discrimination between nonself-nests and empty
   chambers. Hungry spiders showed a reduced preference for self-nests,
   suggesting that hunger elicits a more risky foraging strategy. A
   tendency of hungry spiders to adopt the nests of conspecific spiders may
   reflect a silk-saving strategy. We conclude that S. lineatus spiders
   show state-dependent decision making in nest site selection. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The interactions between humans and the ocean are significant, and
   necessitate more comprehensive study on an international scale. The
   world's oceans provide great health benefits to humans ranging from food
   and nutritional resources, to recreational opportunities and new
   treatments for human disease. However, recently, human health effects
   from exposure to substances present in the marine ecosystem such as
   synthetic organic chemicals (e.g., chlorobiphenyls, chlorinated dioxins

   metals (both introduced and anthropogenic), marine toxins, and pathogens

Abstract = {{Among the most important trade-offs in life history evolution is whether
   to grow larger at the cost of longer development time, or to develop
   more rapidly at the cost of reduced size. For insect herbivores,
   resolution of this trade-off is thought to be strongly influenced by
   feeding ecology and mortality risks. In contrast, how these factors
   might affect the developmental strategies of third trophic level
   organisms, like parasitoid wasps, is less understood. To address this
   question, we compared the development of larval endoparasitoids in the
   families Ichneumonidae and Braconidae that parasitize larval stage
   herbivores in the order Lepidoptera. The campoplegine ichneumonid
   Venturia canescens parasitized concealed hosts and exhibited a
   developmental strategy that favored progeny size over development time.
   In contrast, the closely related ichneumonid Campoletis sonorensis
   parasitized exposed hosts and exhibited the opposite strategy of
   favoring rapid development time over size. The microgastrine braconid
   Microplitis croceipes attacks partially concealed hosts and showed
   evidence of a trade-off between maximizing body size and minimizing
   development times. These results suggested that parasitoids attacking
   apparent, foliar-feeding hosts may favor rapid development time over
   size while parasitoids that attack concealed hosts favor size over
   development time. A broader survey of the literature supported the
   trends found in our experimental studies. The braconids and ichneumonids
   examined in this study also exhibit distinct differences in larval
   feeding and pupation behavior. These developmental traits did not appear
   to affect the size-development time continuum. However, these traits may
   affect the size range of hosts that larval endoparasitoids can
   successfully exploit.}},

Abstract = {{The processes of food and fluid acquisition are necessary for the
   preservation of the animal's integrity. This review describes behavioral
   investigations concerning the role of one experiential factor in early
   infancy, that of, prior diet and its effect on the development of solid

   investigative context, which includes behavioral data obtained both on
   precocial and altricial species. The emphasis of this review is on the
   two tendencies established by prior dietary experiences with
   nutritionally complete foods on later food preferences: the primacy
   effect and the novelty effect. The primacy effect is a preference of
   adult animals for their rearing diet, while the novelty effect is a
   preference for a novel diet. The latest attempt to explain these
   apparently contradictory effects is described. That is, if the taste
   environment is rich in many tastes of food in early life, the potential
   palatability of some foods may be masked or overshadowed; in contrast,
   if that environment is restricted to one specific food, the potential
   palatability of some foods may be revealed.}},

Abstract = {{Shared parental care resulting from brood amalgamation is often
   considered beneficial to parents. However, the benefit of grouping (a
   decline in individual vigilance despite an increase in collective
   vigilance, with a concomitant increase in individual feeding time) has
   not been evoked as a factor promoting shared care. Eider females,
   Somateria mollissima, are subject to substantial energetic costs during
   breeding, and sometimes share brood-rearing duties. We compared the
   activity budgets and feeding behaviour of lone tenders and multifemale
   tenders. We also measured the collective vigilance of multifemale
   tenders and examined whether the coordination of feeding activity among
   females changes with time. As expected, the proportion of time spent
   feeding increased, and the proportion of time spent vigilant decreased,
   as the number of females attending the brood increased. None the less,
   the collective vigilance of multifemale tenders was at least 20\% higher
   than the vigilance of lone tenders. Furthermore, multifemale tending
   allowed females to feed more optimally, as dive duration increased with
   the number of females tending the brood. The level of parental
   investment by individual females after hatching of the eggs is therefore
   related to the number of tending females and, based on previous work, a
   female's body condition when the eggs hatch is also logically connected
   with the number of tending females. Whether females sharing brood care
   on a permanent basis coordinate their feeding activity, so as to
   increase the potential protection of ducklings against predation,
   remains equivocal. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{72}},

Abstract = {{We artificially invaded a set of small islands with the large lizard
   Leiocephalus carinatus to determine effects on food-web elements
   including an intermediate predator, the lizard Anolis sagrei; the latter
   was previously found to have major, mostly direct effects on web
   spiders, as well as detectable indirect effects on aerial arthropods
   (including parasitoids) and leaf damage. In addition to these food-web
   elements, we monitored ground-surface arthropods; they are expected to
   be affected directly; as well as indirectly via A. sagrei, by L.
   carinatus. Five islands were randomly selected for invasion while six
   others served as controls. In addition, four islands without A. sagrei
   were monitored to determine the natural state of the sagrei-free food
   web. We also monitored a variety of A. sagrei's traits, from behavioral
   through physiological and demographic to morphological, to elucidate the
   mechanisms whereby L. carinatus might affect the smaller lizard and to
   evaluate trait-mediated as well as density-mediated effects.
   Comparison of unmanipulated islands with and without A. sagrei showed
   that A. sagrei appeared to be affecting web-spider density and
   diversity, numbers of small aerial arthropods, number of large
   ground-surface arthropods, and two types of leaf damage, scars and
   mines. All effects were negative save one: Small aerial arthropods were
   more abundant with A. sagrei; this variable and parasitoid abundance
   were negatively related to web-spider density, implicating an indirect
   effect pathway from A. sagrei via web spiders.
   Introduction of L. carinatus had major and immediate effects on A.
   sagrei density and perch height; effects on perch diameter, percentage
   hatchlings, and the width of the body,size distribution followed over
   time. Behavioral shifts in habitat use continued to the end of the
   experiment, after changes in population density had mostly leveled off.
   Adult-male body condition became poorer after introduction of L.
   carinatus. Among islands, percentage use of the ground was correlated
   negatively with percentage vegetated area of the island and positively
   with premanipulation relative hindlimb length. We hypothesize that
   longer-legged individuals do better on the ground because they are
   faster there. Conditional evidence for an increase in adult-male
   relative hindlimb length suggested that, when the ground-inhabiting L.
   carinatus was introduced, such individuals were differentially able to
   escape predation.
   Introduction of L. carinatus significantly reversed A. sagrei's effect
   on number of species and density of web, spiders but had no other major
   effects on lower level food-web elements. Thus, a relatively
   short-chained (two links) effect, with a relatively strong second link
   (A. sagrei on spiders), showed the greatest indirect effect of the
   manipulation. Another potentially strong indirect effect, that on large
   ground-surface arthropods, did not occur, possibly because of
   compensatory (direct) predation by L. carinatus. Thus presence of
   omnivory may also be relevant to whether reversal of effects occurs.
   Although most A. sagrei effects were not reversed in the time available
   for the experiment, this may be typical, as natural L. carinatus
   colonizations can dwindle away to extinction over about the same time
   span, producing at best only short-term indirect effects.
   Population-density estimates from other sites and comparisons to other
   experimental studies suggest that, in general, predators on Anolis may
   have erratic effects in space and time.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Eating when exposed to large portions of palatable foods in
   the absence of hunger has been suggested to contribute to overweight.
   Objective: This research evaluated whether young girls' eating in the
   absence of hunger was stable across a 2-y period in middle childhood,
   was associated with an increased risk of overweight, and could be
   predicted by parents' use of restriction in child feeding.
   Design: The participants were 192 non-Hispanic white girls and their
   parents, assessed when the girls were 5 and 7 y of age. The girls'
   eating when exposed to palatable foods in the absence of hunger was
   measured after they consumed a standard lunch and indicated that they
   were no longer hungry.
   Results: Eating in the absence of hunger showed moderate stability
   across the 2-y period for most of the girls. The girls who ate large
   amounts of snack foods in the absence of hunger at 5 and 7 y of age were
   4.6 times as likely to be overweight at both ages. Parents' reports of
   restricting their daughter's access to foods at age 5 y predicted girls'
   eating in the absence of hunger at age 7 y, even when the girls' weight
   status and eating in the absence of hunger at age 5 y were controlled
   for.
   Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence that young girls'
   eating in the absence of hunger may represent a stable phenotypic
   behavior of young overweight girls. In addition, these findings are
   consistent with previous work indicating that parents' restrictive
   feeding practices may contribute to this behavior.}},

Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1953-1964}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Populations in nature face a number of factors that can alter their
   traits and subsequent performance. Predation is one factor that can have
   widespread effects on the mean trait value in a prey population because
   predators can impact prey traits through a number of processes.
   Predators can directly induce prey phenotypes through visual and
   chemical cues, predators can indirectly alter prey phenotypes by
   thinning the prey population (thereby reducing competition), and
   predators can cause selection on prey phenotypes through nonrandom
   killing. Ecologists are beginning to understand each of these three
   processes in isolation, but these processes act on prey phenotypes
   simultaneously, and we lack information on the relative importance of
   these processes in determining the final phenotype of prey.
   I used a system of gray treefrog tadpoles (Hyla versicolor) and
   dragonfly predators (Anax longipes) to determine the separate and
   combined impacts of induction, thinning, and selection on the behavior,
   morphology, and growth of tadpoles reared in aquatic mesocosms. Using
   combinations of hand thinning, cues emitted from caged predators, and
   lethal predators, I demonstrated that the impact of lethal predators on
   growth was mediated primarily through thinning, the impact on morphology
   was primarily through induction, and the impact on behavior was affected
   similarly through thinning and induction. Surprisingly, while we know
   from numerous studies that the dragonflies kill tadpoles nonrandomly,
   selection did not have a significant impact on the final phenotypes of
   the tadpoles. This work appears to be the first study that identifies
   the relative magnitudes of the three predatory processes on a suite of
   prey phenotypes. The three processes can have opposing or supporting
   effects, the relative magnitudes of which likely differ among systems,
   illustrating why we often observe contradictory results when we examine
   the impact of lethal predators on prey phenotypes. Thus, it is important
   that we identify the mechanisms underlying the outcomes of predation,
   rather than simply observing the outcomes and then inferring which
   processes are responsible.}},

Abstract = {{1. Ecological influences on social organization can best be measured by
   comparing populations of a socially variable species living in different

   in Ghana, West Africa.
   2. In total, 161 individually identified oribi were observed at five
   sites along an ecological gradient through dry and rainy seasons.
   Behavioural observations and ecological data were used to test the
   relative influence of forage abundance and quality, habitat structure
   and predation pressure on female dispersion and male social behaviour.
   3. Of nine ecological variables that were quantified, forage abundance
   and quality accounted best for variation in female dispersion among and
   within study populations. Specifically, female oribi formed larger
   groups and had smaller ranges where dry season forage was relatively
   abundant and low in fibre.
   4. Male territorial behaviour differed among sites and was related to
   female home range size. Males were most active in territory maintenance
   where females had small home ranges, and males defended a female rather
   than a territory where females ranged widely.
   5. These results show that variation in social organization among oribi

Abstract = {{In this study, we tested the hypothesis that baseline corticosterone

   that was either available during the same time each day (constant) or
   starting at variable times during the day. Food intake rates, frequency
   of aggressive interactions, and baseline levels of corticosterone were
   measured. In the majority of cases, red knots showed higher plasma
   corticosterone concentrations during feeding schedules that were
   irregular than when food was available at consistent times. These
   findings are supported by a previous study that showed that red knots

Abstract = {{Since early history, human beings have been closely exposed to several
   types of traumatic events. Although modern societies have developed a
   more acceptable kind of convivence these traumatic events have become
   increasingly present in the everyday life of any individual in
   underdeveloped societies. This is due to extended problems, like a lower
   income pet, capita, which gives rise to such conducts as violent
   robbery, kidnapping, or murder. Similarly, family desintegration is a
   likely factor leading to the development of interfamily violence, and
   illegal substances traffic and abuse; even weather phenomena (e.g., ``El
   Nino{''}) may trigger a higher incidence of PTSD given the suffering
   brought about by hurricanes or tornados.
   At the Fourth Consensus Group International Meeting on Depression and
   Anxiety, held in Montecatini, Italy, in April 1999, PTSD was regarded as
   the main issue, because of its high prevalence, social impact, and
   financial burden on society. For these reasons, it represents an
   enormous public health problem in both underdeveloped and developed
   countries, During the last three decades, biological guidelines for PTSD
   have been studied and proposed, together with the development of new
   effective treatments.
   Epidemiological studies allow us to calculate the rates of specific
   disorders and their impact on the community and health system. The
   prevalence of the exposure to traumatic events themselves is an
   important part of PTSD study. Recent epidemiological studies have shown
   that about 40 to 90\% individuals from adult community samples have been
   exposed to a traumatic event. Prevalence life rates of PTSD vary from 5
   to 15\% in developed countries. Nowadays, 4 to 6\% of the population
   presents PTSD symptoms, considering only the worst traumatic event (8,
   9, 13, 20, 29, 32, 39).
   In the last two decades, PTSD is an anxiety disorder which has Called
   the attention in research and clinical areas due to several reasons. One
   Of these is that the rates of violence have had a dramatic increase all
   over the world; another one is the identification of their subdiagnosis
   in several places.
   However, not everyone who has been exposed to a traumatic event develops
   PTSD. Several risk factors increase the possibility of its expression
   and chronicity - for instance, to experience the event at early life
   stages, multiple traumatic events, their severity, gender experiencing
   the event, personal stress - and behavior, or psychological problems
   history, comorbid psychopathology, parents' PTSD history,, or subsequent
   exposure to reactivant environmental events.
   Likewise, risk factors can be classified according to the person
   involved and the traumatic event experienced (19, 22). In this sense,
   different studies have shown women have a higher risk than men to
   develop PTSD, in spite of men having an increased exposure to traumatic
   events (13, 20, 37). The psycho-biological development level is
   important when a traumatic event appears, since it has been demonstrated
   that age is a significative factor to develop PTSD: traumatic events in
   childhood have been associated with a higher risk of PTSD and more
   severe symptoms (10). The clinical course of PTSD is often chronic, with
   only 50\% of the patients recovering within two years after the
   incident. Most of those unable tu recover will still show symptoms 15
   years later (32).
   The situation in underdeveloped countries is particularly interesting,
   since traumatic events frequently associated with long wars, hunger,
   politic opression, and sectary violence seem to make PTSD more chronic
   and the profile of its symptoms more complex and disabling than in
   developed countries (21, 23, 38, 45, 46).
   PTSD has a relevant impact on different areas of life, as is revealed
   fur instance in its enormous social costs. Generally, individuals who
   suffer PTSD earn a lower income, present high scholar failure rates, and
   more interpersonal problems compared tu the overall population. In
   addition, the age of onset of the mental disorders has a predictive
   value over educational, birth, marriage, and economic accomplishments
   (8, 23, 24, 27, 28, 30, 32).
   A research conducted among the overall American population estimated
   that 38\% of the individuals with PTSD received some form of treatment
   during a given year. The reason more commonly reported by the remaining
   62\% to refuse getting medical attention was that they did not think
   they had any problem at all (3 1). Often, the traumatic reaction adapts
   over several years and becomes part of the individual's coping style.
   People at risk of PTSD commonly ask for medical help early, but do not
   do so in the psychiatric area. Finally, PTSD brings about less
   stigmatization compared to another psychiatric disorders, because their
   symptoms are considered as natural consequences of a severe traumatic
   event (32).
   Apparently, the presence of psychiatric disorders other than PTSD is the
   rule rather than the exception. According to clinical and general
   populations studies, between 50-90\% of PTSD patients show comorbid
   psychiatric disorders (14-18, 33, 42, 43). PTSD is frequently associated
   with comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as High Depressive Disorder
   (HDD), Anguish Disorder (AD), Social Phobia (SP), Generalized Anxiety
   Disorder, Substance Use Disorder -mostly alcohol- (SUD), Personality,
   Disorders (PD) (e.g., borderline, avoidance, antisocial), and
   Dissociative Disorders (4, 5, 9, 29, 32, 48).
   In brief, the relevance of PTSD study becomes clear due to several
   aspects, Apparently, PTSD is more common than it is thought so. The life
   prevalence of PTSD among the general population is about 8 to 9\%, and
   women have a higher risk to develop PTSD (22). Also, PTSD is more
   frequent after certain kinds of traumatic events (e.g., rape), not
   considering in this case the survivor's gender (29).
   This discussion is divided in two parts. In this first article we will
   analyze some general aspects like the introduction of this disorder in
   the American classification, together with its definition, epidemiology,
   clinic course, effect on the individual's general functioning, and
   comorbidity, with different psychiatric disorders.}},

Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{The chick-a-dee call of the avian genus Poecile is a structurally
   complex vocal system because it possesses a set of simple rules that
   governs how the notes of the call are ordered, and variable numbers of
   each of the note types strung together can generate an extraordinary
   number of unique calls. Whereas it has been hypothesized that
   chick-a-dee calls with different notes may convey different information,
   no experimental evidence has been offered in support of the hypothesis.
   Previously published studies suggested that flock members use
   chick-a-dee calls in the context of moving to or from a feeding site.
   Here, we tested Carolina chickadees' responses to playbacks of
   chick-a-dee calls that differed in note composition. Playbacks were
   conducted in the field in the context of a novel food source. Our pilot
   data had indicated that chick-a-dee calls with relatively large numbers
   of `C' notes were given by birds on their first contact with a novel
   seed stand. In the present study, we found that chickadees flew in close
   to the playback speaker and subsequently took seed from a seed stand
   more often during playbacks of chick-a-dee calls containing C notes than
   chick-a-dee calls not containing C notes or than control playbacks.
   Vocal responses of chickadees to the playbacks also differed in relation
   to the particular vocal signal being played back. These results indicate
   that receivers respond differently to chick-a-dee calls containing
   different compositions of note types and represent a first step to link
   variation in note composition and ordering in these calls to possible
   meanings. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The costs of singing in birds are poorly understood. One potential type
   of cost is a metabolic cost of singing. Previous studies have measured
   short-term changes in oxygen consumption associated with bouts of
   vocalizations, with equivocal results. In this study, I used an
   alternative approach to measuring the metabolic cost of singing, by
   measuring overnight loss of body mass, in male common nightingales,
   Luscinia megarhynchos, singing at night at different rates. Nightingales
   were shown not to forage at night. They reached a higher mass at dusk
   prior to singing more at night, and lost more mass overnight when dusk
   mass and overnight song rate were high. These results show that singing
   at night is associated with increased overnight consumption of body
   reserves, which represents a significant metabolic cost of singing at
   night. However, the correlation between dusk mass and overnight song
   rate makes it impossible to determine whether these costs arise from the
   energetic costs of the singing itself, or from the metabolic costs of
   the additional body reserves laid down at dusk on nights when song rate
   was high. There are also likely to be costs associated with accumulating
   and carrying these extra body reserves during daylight, as well as other
   potential costs of singing such as an increased risk of predation. These
   results are consistent with those models of signalling in biology that
   predict or assume that honest signals are costly. (C) 2002 The

Abstract = {{Animals living in environments of different quality will have different
   expectations of their future reproductive success and survival. This may
   affect the individual's risk-taking behaviour as manifest in the cost of
   predation. We investigated the foraging behaviour of starlings, Sturnus
   vulgaris, when perceived predation risk varied between patches.
   Short-term food availability varied between treatments and long-term
   differences in perceptions of environmental quality varied between
   groups of individuals. This corresponds to variation in the three
   components of the cost of predation (P): the predation risk (p); the
   change in reproductive value with energy gain (partial
   derivativeF/partial derivativee); and the reproductive value or fitness
   factor (F). The birds showed that they experienced a higher cost of
   predation while using the risky food patches (mu component) and in the
   high food treatment (partial derivativeF/partial derivativee component).
   Furthermore, birds from a high-reward habitat revealed a higher P than
   birds from a poor habitat (F component). The results show that the costs
   of predation are possible to tease apart by using behavioural
   indicators. The method presented allows measurement of fitness prospects

Abstract = {{(O)bjective: To explain an apparently paradoxical pattern wherein

Abstract = {{Background: Little is known as to whether or not the seven personality
   dimensions of Cloninger's theory, particularly the three character
   dimensions newly included in the theory, are independent of the states
   of depression. Methods: One hundred and eight patients with major
   depression filled out the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI)
   before and after a 16-week antidepressant treatment. Results: The level
   of depression, as assessed by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression,
   was correlated positively to the harm avoidance score and negatively to
   the self-directedness and cooperativeness scores. During the treatment,
   the scores on these three dimensions significantly changed toward normal
   values in treatment-responders, but were stable in
   treatment-nonresponders. The changes in these dimensions were
   significantly explained by the change in the depression severity during
   treatment. Scores on novelty seeking, reward dependence, persistence,
   and self-transcendence were not correlated significantly to the level of
   depression and did not change significantly during the treatment in
   either treatment-responders or nonresponders. Limitations: The changes
   in the TCI scores during treatment in this study may reflect a
   non-specific tendency for the scores to change on retest. Conclusions:
   The results suggest that a depressive state can significantly affect
   assessments of harm avoidance, self-directedness, and cooperativeness in
   major depression. The administration of the TCI during a depressive
   episode may elevate the HA score, and may lower the SD and C scores.
   These findings highlight the importance of considering the state of
   depression before drawing conclusions about the TCI personality traits,

Abstract = {{Background: This article selectively reviews the biological bases of
   antisocial and aggressive behavior in children with a focus on low
   autonomic functioning, prefrontal deficits, and early health factors.
   Results: Low resting heart rate is thought to be the best-replicated
   biological correlate of antisocial and aggressive behavior in child and
   adolescent populations and may reflect reduced noradrenergic functioning
   and a fearless, stimulation-seeking temperament. Evidence from
   neuropsychological, neurological, and brain imaging studies converges on
   the conclusion that prefrontal structural and functional deficits are
   related to antisocial, aggressive behavior throughout the lifespan. A
   prefrontal dysfunction theory of antisocial behavior is advanced. This
   argues that social and executive function demands of late adolescence
   overload the late developing prefrontal cortex, giving rise to
   prefrontal dysfunction and a lack of inhibitory control over antisocial,
   violent behavior that peaks at this age. Birth complications and minor
   physical anomalies are selectively associated with later violent
   behavior, especially when combined with adverse psychosocial risk
   factors for violence. Cigarette smoking during pregnancy may increase
   the risk for antisocial and violent behavior in later life by disrupting
   noradrenergic functioning and enhancement of cholinergic receptors that
   inhibit cardiac functioning. Malnutrition during pregnancy is associated
   with later antisocial behavior and may be mediated by protein
   deficiency. Conclusions: It is argued that early health intervention and
   prevention studies may provide the most effective way of reversing
   biological deficits that predispose to antisocial and aggressive

Abstract = {{Most studies of dietary change during aging have focused oil maintaining

   The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine the major

   reduction intervention. Method: A diverse sample of 92 women aged 55 to
   80 was recruited from two East Coast sites of the Women's Health
   Initiative. All the women were participating in the dietary modification
   arm of WHI, had received the same dietary instruction, and were in the
   maintenance phase of the intervention. The women were classified by
   nutritionists as adherent or nonadherent to a diet limiting fat intake
   to <20\% of total calories. Focus groups and telephone interviews were
   conducted, and textual data were coded and sorted using content analysis
   techniques within the four categories of the Stimuli-Organismic
   Factors-Response Repertoire-Consequences (SORC) behavioral model.
   Frequencies of responses within categories were tabulated and compared

Abstract = {{Refuge use by animals provides greater safety from predation. A refuging

   Frightened fish typically fled into a foodless refuge nearby. The amount

   significantly with body length, but was not affected by their current
   nutritional state or the threatening stimulus (type of model). Smaller
   killifish were thus more risk-prone than larger conspecifics

Abstract = {{Anuran larvae exhibit high levels of phenotypic plasticity in growth and
   developmental rates in response to variation in temperature and food
   availability. We tested the hypothesis that alteration of developmental
   pathways during the aquatic larval stage should affect the
   postmetamorphic performance of the Iberian painted frog (Discoglossus
   galganoi). We exposed tadpoles to different temperatures and food types
   (animal- vs. plant-based diets) to induce variation in the length of the
   larval period and body size at metamorphosis. In this species, larval
   period varied with temperature but was unaffected by diet composition.
   In contrast, size at metamorphosis was shaped by the interaction between
   food quality and temperature; tadpoles fed on an animal-based diet
   became bulkier metamorphs than those fed on plant-based food at high
   (22degreesC) but not at low (12degreesC) temperature. Body condition of
   newly metamorphosed frogs was unrelated to the temperature or food type
   experienced during the premetamorphic stage. Frogs maintained at high
   temperature during the larval period showed reduced jumping ability,
   especially when fed on the plant-based diet. However, when considering
   size-independent jumping ability, cold-reared individuals exhibited the
   lowest performance, and herbivores reared at 17degreesC the highest.
   Cold-reared (12degreesC) frogs accumulated larger amounts of energy
   reserves than individuals raised at 17degreesC or 22degreesC. This was
   still the case after correction for differences in body mass, thus
   indicating some size-independent effect of developmental temperature.
   Despite the higher lipid content of the carnivorous diet, the
   differences in energy reserves between herbivores and carnivores were
   relatively weak and associated with differences in body size. These
   results suggest that the consequences of environmental variation in the
   larval habitat can extend to the terrestrial phase and influence
   juvenile growth and survival.}},

   Maternal body composition and diet are thought to affect fetal

   placental function and structure. Alterations in placental growth and
   vascular resistance, altered nutrient and hormone metabolism in the

Abstract = {{We tested male mantis' responses to square, computer-generated visual
   stimuli of various sizes to determine the stimulus parameters that
   affect their striking behaviour. Males in a high-hunger group displayed
   a sharp preference for solid black 12 x 12-degree squares moving
   linearly against a white background, especially when the squares moved
   downward (versus horizontally). Males in a low-hunger group visually
   tracked but, with rare exception, did not strike at any linearly moving
   squares. In contrast, when solid black squares moved erratically around
   visual field centre, males struck regularly at them irrespective of
   hunger level, even when the squares were as large as 47 x 47 degrees.
   Males also recognized black-and-white Julesz-patterned square stimuli

   recognized the synchronous movement of a group of stimulus elements as a
   single moving object. Finally, we compared allometric and life history

Abstract = {{Man has a major impact on marine environments through exploitation of
   fish resources. Fisheries can induce different selective pressures,
   either directly, i.e., through elevated mortality (which is often highly
   selective) or through ecosystem-level responses, as exploitation affects
   food availability and predation risk in both target and nontarget
   species. Responses to selection can be observed at two levels. First, at
   the community level, some species may suffer more from effects of
   harvesting than others; some may even increase in abundance. Responses
   by species to exploitation are associated with their life histories. In
   particular, species with late maturation at large size and with low
   population growth rate tend to undergo more pronounced declines than
   early-maturing species with rapid growth. Second, the phenotypic
   composition within species may also change. If phenotypic variability
   has a genetic basis, then fisheries-induced selection can result in
   evolutionary change in life-history traits influencing sustainable
   yields, behavioral traits (e.g., gear-avoidance behavior), and
   morphological traits. We discuss the possible implications of
   fisheries-induced adaptive changes for sustainable fisheries management.}},

Abstract = {{Fisheries managers have often suggested that survival of trout during
   the winter is a major factor affecting population densities in many
   stream ecosystems in the Rocky Mountains. In Wyoming, trout population
   reductions from fall to spring in excess of 90\% have been documented in
   some reservoir tailwaters. Though biologists have surmised that these
   reductions were the result of either mortality or emigration from some
   river sections, the specific mechanisms have not been defined and the
   factors leading to the trout loss are unknown. This is a review of four
   studies that were conducted or funded between 1991 and 1998 by the
   Wyoming Game and Fish Department to understand the extent of overwinter
   losses, identify some of the mechanisms leading to those conditions and
   develop management strategies to help avoid those impacts. Winter
   studies were conducted on tailwater fisheries in the Green, North
   Platte, Bighorn and Shoshone rivers to document trout population
   dynamics, assess physical habitat availability, evaluate trout movement
   and habitat selection, and understand the relationships between food
   availability and bioenergetic relationships. Results indicate that
   winter trout losses are extreme in some years, that trout movement and
   habitat selection are affected by supercooled flows, and that mortality
   is probably not directly due to starvation. The combination of
   physiological impairment with frequently altered habitat availability
   probably leads to indirect mortality from predators and other factors.

Abstract = {{A trait database based on habitat, behavioral and morphological

   Among all of these traits the most important were associated with
   invertebrate spatial proximity to salmonids (macrohabitat preference),
   potential conspicuousness and accessibility (e.g. flow exposure,
   mobility, tendency to drift, trajectory and agility) and handling
   efficiency (body flexibility and size). Data on benthos assemblages and
   brown trout salmo trutta diets collected over two consecutive Summers in
   different macrohabitat types (e.g. pools, runs and riffles) of two
   Pyrenean streams demonstrated that: (i) decrease in torrential flow
   characteristics of habitats was associated with changes in invertebrate
   body shape and movement, and a decrease in bode flexibility and tendency
   to drift; (ii) brown trout tended to feed on the most vulnerable
   invertebrates (e.g. those living in exposed microhabitats and with a
   high tendency to drift, agility and aggregation), except in faster
   flowing habitats. The results suggest that the potential vulnerability
   of benthic invertebrates increased with increases in flow (torrential)

Abstract = {{The goal of the research presented here was to examine phenotypic
   plasticity exhibited by three morphotypes of the common Caribbean sponge
   Anthosigmella varians (Duchassaing \& Michelotti). We were interested in
   examining the biotic (and, to a lesser extent, abiotic) factors
   responsible for branch production in this species. We also tested the
   hypothesis that the skeleton may serve an anti-predator function in this
   sponge, focusing on vertebrate fish predators (i.e., angelfish) in this
   work. In transplant and caging experiments. unprotected forma varians
   replicates were immediately consumed by angelfish, while caged
   replicates persisted on the reef for several months. These findings
   support the hypothesis that predators (and not wave energy) restrict
   forma varians to lagoonal habitats. Branch production was not observed
   in A. varians forma incrustans when sponges were protected from
   predators or placed in predator-free, low-wave-energy environments. It
   is not clear from our work whether forma incrustans is capable of
   producing branches (i.e., whether branch production is a plastic trait
   in this morph). Additional field experiments demonstrated that A.
   varians forma varians increased spicule concentrations. compared to
   uninjured sponges, in response to artificial predation events, and A.
   varians forma rigida reduced spicule concentrations, compared to uncaged
   controls, when protected from predators. These findings indicate that
   spicule concentration is a plastic morphological trait that can be
   induced by damage, and that A. varians may be able to reduce spicule
   concentrations when environmental conditions change (e.g., in the
   absence of predators). The potential significance of inducible defenses
   and structural anti-predator defenses in sponges is discussed in
   relation to recent work on sponge chemical defenses.}},

Abstract = {{In disturbance ecology there is a tension between ecological and
   evolutionary viewpoints, because while disturbances often cause
   mortality in populations (an ecological effect), populations may also
   evolve mechanisms that ameliorate mortality risk (an evolutionary
   effect). Flash floods cause high mortality in the juvenile aquatic stage
   of desert stream insects, but these ecological effects may be mitigated
   by the evolution of life-history strategies that allow the terrestrial
   adult stage to avoid floods. Life-history theory predicts that, to
   balance trade-offs between juvenile growth and mortality risk from
   floods, (1) most individuals should emerge before the peak of the flood
   season, (2) optimal body size at emergence should decline as flood
   probability increases, and (3) a second decline in body size at
   emergence should occur as the reproductive season ends. These
   predictions were tested with data on body mass at and timing of
   emergence of the caddisfly Phylloicus aeneus measured in three montane
   Chihuahuan Desert (Arizona, USA) streams over two years. P. aeneus that
   had not reached the adult stage were eliminated from site-years that
   experienced flash floods, suggesting that timing of emergence is an
   important fitness component. On average 86\% of emergence occurred
   before the long-term (similar to100 yr) mean arrival date of the first
   seasonal flood, supporting prediction 1. The presence of two consecutive
   declines in body mass at emergence in most site-years was congruent with
   predictions 2 and 3. To test whether the two declines were associated
   with increasing flood probability and end of the reproductive season,
   respectively, maximum-likelihood methods were used to compare five
   body-size models: a null model that contains no parameters related to
   flood regime or reproductive season, a seasonal model that incorporates
   a reproductive time constraint, and three disturbance models that
   incorporate both reproductive time constraints and flood dynamics. The
   disturbance models outperformed the other models, suggesting that at
   least some of the body-mass pattern was influenced by flood dynamics.
   The timing of the first flood of the season was the most important
   determinant of observed emergence patterns. Overall, this study
   demonstrates that aquatic insects can compensate for flash floods by
   using state-dependent emergence strategies that are synchronized with
   long-term flood dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{In Australia, colorectal, prostate and breast cancers are the most
   frequently occurring cancers in our society, a pattern that is quite
   different from that of underdeveloped countries. While diet is largely
   responsible for these differences, technological advances mean that the
   solutions can be viewed as systematic, financial, lifestyle or
   technological. They range from those that require self-discipline and
   care for personal well-being through to those that are seemingly a quick
   technological fix that will work in spite of an unhealthy lifestyle.
   There are three main approaches available for prevention of these
   cancers: dietary lifestyle, chemoprevention and screening. It has been
   estimated that the potential for prevention by a healthy dietary
   lifestyle is excellent and might reduce the burden of breast, prostate
   and colorectal cancer by 33-55\%, 10-20\% and 66-75\%, respectively.
   This should be safe and inexpensive and have collateral benefit such as
   reduced cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. But, population
   compliance with more plant-based, less calorie dense foods is uncertain,
   the most healthy are likely to be the most compliant and evidence for
   effectiveness when interventional programs are undertaken is
   disappointing. It is not clear how dependable the dietary approach would
   be where inherited genetic factors determine risk for one of these
   cancers. Chemoprevention, the administration of natural or synthetic
   agents that delay, slow down or inhibit the process of tumorigenesis,
   are still under development and study. Hormone receptor modulators for
   breast and derivatives of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for
   colorectal cancers seem to have most promise and may reduce tumour
   incidence or death by as much as 50\%. These agents are simpler to
   comply with than changing dietary lifestyle and they are more potent,
   hence they may be of particular value in high-risk settings. But they
   are likely to be more costly and run the risk of adverse effects with
   few collateral benefits. Screening, or the testing of an individual for
   a disease when that individual does not have any symptoms or signs
   suggesting that the disease is present, aims to prevent or delay the
   development of the cancer. Screening impacts on mortality more so than
   on incidence, reducing colorectal cancer mortality in the range 15-60\%
   and breast cancer mortality by 23-37\%. Screening has the advantage of
   being effective in high-risk as well as average-risk groups and is an
   `easy' solution for the person who elects not to follow a healthy
   dietary lifestyle. Nonetheless, it is expensive, demanding on resources,
   provides no collateral benefits and does not have the same potential to
   reduce incidence of disease as does the dietary approach. With these
   Western cancers, we are fortunate that there are options for prevention.
   At least choices are available and some will suite certain circumstances
   and personalities more than others.}},

Abstract = {{Birds species, like plants and other animals are facing an unprecedented
   decline. About 11\% of bird species are threatened with extinction.
   Captive breeding as a conservation tool can be used as a substitute for
   wild populations in research and education, to provide demographic and
   genetic reservoirs for reinforcing or founding wild populations, and as
   a last resort for species that have no immediate opportunity for
   survival in nature, Candidates for captive propagation are zoos, private
   breeders, state agencies, conservation foundations and research centres
   within or outside of universities. The problems in managing endangered
   species have motivated conservation biologists to conduct research in
   many disciplines such as behaviour, physiology, endocrinology, genetics,
   husbandry, nutrition and veterinary medicine. In addition, an increasing
   number of techniques for increasing reproductive success, improving
   genetic management and enhancing reintroduction success have been
   employed. Breeding success has been improved by improved knowledge of
   factors that trigger reproduction and stimulate replacement clutches, as
   well as by improvements in artificial incubation and artificial
   insemination. Assuming that the correct social behaviour group is
   constituted and the animals start to breed, genetic problems are likely
   to occur in species with only a few remaining individuals. Once numbers
   are low, genetic variability is reduced and this brings about diminished
   ability to respond to environmental change. Recent advances in molecular
   genetics have enabled studies in taxonomy to be carried out in order to
   determine species, subspecies and population boundaries. They have also
   contributed to the theoretical development of small population genetics
   and demographics aimed at improving ex-situ population management,
   Captive birds are often hand-reared, but since many behaviours are
   acquired from the parents, or by experience in the wild, artificial
   rearing by hand could affect the survival potential of released animals.
   In order to prevent imprinting on humans and other detrimental effects
   of hand-rearing techniques, parents, foster-parents, puppets or costumes
   have been used to rear chicks. Finally, recent developments in research
   on training programmes to find food, to fly, to avoid specific dangers,
   or to recognise and to avoid predators, appear to have substantially
   increased release success in reintroduction programmes.}},

   different conditions were examined: (a) natural predation, (b) no
   predation, and (c) experimental predation through artificial removal of
   termites. In the shrub savanna, foraging termites responded to
   increasing predation with increasing GUDs. By contrast, in the gallery
   forest, there was no gradual response. Instead termites abandoned a food
   patch immediately after an attack by predators. Without predation GUDs
   were lower in the savanna than in the gallery forest indicating that
   food had a higher value in the former habitat. This, together with the
   differential behavioral responses to predation, was in accordance with
   high availability of food in the gallery forest and a limited supply of
   food in the savanna. Thus, according to our results termites traded off

Abstract = {{Costs of reproduction are fundamental trade-offs shaping the evolution
   of life histories. There has been much interest, discussion and
   controversy about the nature and type of reproductive costs. The
   manipulation of reproductive effort (e.g. brood size manipulation) may
   alter not only life-history traits such as future adult survival rate
   and future reproductive effort, but also behavioural decisions affecting
   recapture/resighting and dispersal probabilities. We argue that many
   previous studies of the costs of reproduction may have erroneously
   concluded the existence or non-existence of such costs because of their
   use of local return rates to assess survival. In this paper, we take
   advantage of the modern multistate capture-recapture methods to
   highlight how the accurate assessment of the costs of reproduction
   requires incorporating not only recapture probability, but also
   behavioural `state' variables, for example dispersal status and cur rent
   reproductive investment. The inclusion of state-dependent decisions can
   radically alter the conclusions drawn regarding the costs of
   reproduction on future survival or reproductive investment. We
   illustrate this point by re-analysing data collected to address the
   question of the costs of reproduction in the collared flycatcher and the
   great tit. We discuss in some detail the methodological issues and

Abstract = {{Factors affecting dispersal and recruitment in animal populations will
   play a prominent role in the dynamics of populations. This is
   particularly the case for subdivided populations where the dispersal of
   individuals among patches may lead to local extinction and `rescue
   effects'. A long-term observational study carried out in Brittany,
   France, and involving colour-ringed Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa
   tridactyla) suggested that the reproductive success of conspecifics (or
   some social cor relate) could be one important factor likely to affect
   dispersal and recruitment. By dispersing from patches where the local
   reproductive success was low and recruiting to patches where the local
   reproductive success was high, individual birds could track
   spatio-temporal variations in the quality of breeding patches (the
   quality of breeding patches can be affected by different factors, such
   as food availability, the presence of predators or ectoparasites, which
   can vary in space and time at different scales). Such an observational
   study may nevertheless have confounded the role of conspecific
   reproductive success with the effect of a cor related factor (e. g. the
   local activities of a predator). In other words, individuals may have
   been influenced directly by the factor responsible for the low local
   reproductive success or indirectly by the low success of their
   neighbours. Thus, an experimental approach was needed to address this
   question. Estimates of demographic parameters (other than reproductive
   success) and studies of the response of marked individuals to changes in
   their environment usually face problems associated with variability in
   the probability of detecting individuals and with non-independence among
   events occur ring on a local scale. Further, very few studies on
   dispersal have attempted to address the causal nature of relationships
   by experimentally manipulating factors. Here we present an experiment
   designed to test for an effect of local reproductive success of
   conspecifics on behavioural decisions of individuals regarding dispersal
   and recruitment. The experiment was carried out on Kittiwakes within a
   large seabird colony in northern Norway. It involved (i) the colour
   banding of several hundreds of birds; (ii) the manipulation
   (increase/decrease) of the local reproductive success of breeding groups
   on cliffpatches; and (iii) the detailed survey of attendance and
   activities of birds on these patches. It also involved the manipulation
   of the nest content of marked individuals breeding within these patches
   (individuals failing at the egg stage were expected to respond in terms
   of dispersal to the success of their neighbours). This allowed us to
   test whether a lower local reproductive success would lower (1) the
   attendance of breeders at the end of the breeding season; (2) the
   presence of prospecting birds; and (3) the proportion of failed breeders
   that came back to breed on the same patch the year after. In this paper,
   we discuss how we dealt with (I) the use of return rates to infer
   differences in dispersal rates; (II) the trade-off between sample sizes
   and local treatment levels; and (III) potential differences in detection
   probabilities among locations. We also present some results to
   illustrate the design and implementation of the experiment.}},

   salmonids, sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), and parental sticklebacks
   and cichlids illustrate some of these influences. It is argued that most
   species have a circadian system but that having such a system does not
   necessarily imply strict diurnalism or nocturnalism. Rigidity of
   activity phase seems more common in species, mostly marine, that display
   behavioral sleep, and for these animals the circadian clock can help
   maintain the integrity of the sleep period and ensure that its
   occurrence takes place at that time of day to which the animal's sensory
   equipment is not as well adapted. However, in other fishes, mostly from
   freshwater habitats, the circadian clock seems to be used mainly for
   anticipation of daily events such as the arrival of day, night, or food,
   and possibly for other abilities such as time-place learning and sun
   compass orientation, rather than for strict control of activity phase.
   In these species, various considerations relating to foraging success
   and predation risk may determine whether the animal is diurnal or
   nocturnal at any particular time and place.}},

Abstract = {{The polygyny threshold model states that secondary females gain benefits
   from high territory quality that outweigh the costs of sharing a male.
   We aimed to test this prediction using the dusky warbler as a model
   species. We first showed that neither the shifted sex ratio hypothesis
   nor the no-cost models were likely to apply to our study. Secondary
   females settled in territories of higher quality (high food abundance,
   low predator density) and had a nonsignificantly higher reproductive
   success than simultaneously settling monogamous females. However, there
   were strong indications that these two groups of females differed
   intrinsically. Secondary females were older than late monogamous
   females, and while they replaced lost clutches more often, they also
   suffered from a nonsignificantly higher winter mortality. Consequently,
   it was impossible to tell whether differences in reproductive success
   were caused by differences in territory quality or in female qualities.
   Our study suggests that female choice may also depend on characteristics
   that are specific to the individual, and may therefore be more
   sophisticated than allowed for in traditional polygyny models. In other
   words, the polygyny threshold may be not the same for all individuals.
   We suggest that prior breeding experience may help older females to
   profit more from the benefits and to suffer less from the costs of
   polygyny than young females. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{The threat-sensitivity hypothesis predicts that prey individuals will
   increase antipredator behaviors as apparent predator risk increases. An
   implicit assumption of the threat-sensitivity hypothesis is that
   predator risk is additive. In other words, all characteristics of a
   predator that indicate risk should contribute in an additive way to
   determine the degree of risk-sensitive behavior. We tested this
   assumption in the laboratory by presenting live predators (green
   sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus) to groups of western mosquitofish (Gambusia
   affinis). We examined effects of predator diet, hunger level, and size
   on predator avoidance and inspection behavior of mosquitofish. Both
   predator diet and predator hunger level were significant and additive
   determinants of distance maintained from a predator, resulting in a
   graded response to combinations of these predator cues. In contrast,
   whereas predator diet was the most important determinant of general
   avoidance distances, predator hunger level was more important in
   determining mosquitofish vertical distribution and inspection behavior.
   Thus, the relationship between predator cue and the antipredator
   behavior that it elicits is dependent on which cues and behaviors are
   examined. Our data suggest that during risky behaviors, such as predator
   inspection, mosquitofish rely mainly on visual cues (behavior
   differences between hungry and satiated predators), whereas general
   avoidance behavior is determined by additive responses from visual and
   chemical cues.}},

Volume = {{2}},

Pages = {{353-370}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Given the current global epidemic of obesity there is a demand for new
   antiobesity drugs to overcome the problem. Many pharmacological agents
   reduce food intake and significantly decrease body mass when
   administered to animals but affect feeding behaviour in a profoundly
   different way indicating the variety of biological mechanisms by which
   such agents act (appetite verses non-appetite). More limited clinical
   data demonstrates that some of the same drugs produce decreases in food
   intake and weight loss in humans. A few of these drugs do so by
   modifying the functioning of the appetite system as measured by
   subjective changes in feelings of hunger and fullness (indices of
   satiety). These drugs that modify the daily flux of appetite could be
   considered as `appetite suppressants' with clinical potential as
   anti-obesity agents. Drugs that can be considered suitable candidates
   for appetite suppressants are agents that enhance peripherally satiety
   peptide systems (such as CCK, Bombesin/GRP, Enterostatin and GLP-1),
   alter the CNS levels of various hypothalamic neuropeptides (NPY,
   Galanin, Orexin, CART and Melanocortins) or monoamine neurotransmitters
   (such as serotonin, nor-adrenaline and possibly dopamine). Recently, the
   hormone leptin has become regarded as a key hormonal signal linking
   adipose tissue status with a number of key central nervous system
   circuits (NPY, CART, CRF, Melanocortins and possibly Orexins). This
   tonic system may also provide drug targets for the control of appetite.
   Any changes induced by a potential appetite suppressant should be
   considered in terms of the (i) psychological experience and behavioural
   expression of appetite, (ii) metabolism and peripheral physiology, and
   (iii) functioning of CNS neural pathways. In humans, such modulation of
   appetite will involve changes in total caloric consumption, subjective
   changes in feelings of hunger and fullness, preferences for specific
   food items, and general macronutrient preferences. These may be
   expressed behaviourally as changes in meal patterns, snacking behaviour
   and food choice. Within the next 20 years it is certain that clinicians
   will have a new range of anti-obesity compounds available to choose
   from. Such novel compounds may act on a single component of the appetite
   system or target a combination of these components detailed in this
   review. Such compounds used in combination with life style changes and
   dietary intervention may be critical in dealing with the rising world
   epidemic of obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Passerines maintain low levels of fat in winter even though larger fat
   reserves would provide better insurance against starvation. This is
   believed to be a result of predation risk and/or metabolic expenditure
   increasing with the amount of fat carried. Recent empirical studies
   indicate that the effect of increased mass on predation risk is small,
   but the effect on metabolic expenditure is large. Using dynamic
   modelling, I investigated how mass-dependent costs affect the pattern of
   fat gain. I found that increases in metabolic expenditure were
   sufficient to explain strong regulation of the level of fat, but that
   increases in direct predation risk cannot be excluded. A plausible
   explanation for the increase in metabolic expenditure is if the extra
   weight is compensated for by a parallel gain in flight muscle. Such
   compensation means that an increase in instantaneous predation risk can
   be avoided, but that costs depending on an increase in energy intake may
   occur instead. For example more time spent foraging increases exposure
   to predators, Hence, one form of predation risk (impaired ability to
   escape from an attacking predator) may be traded for another (more time
   spent foraging). This will be beneficial if this extended foraging is
   not risky, whereas failure to compensate for the extra mass would mean
   the risk of being caught by a predator increasing considerably. Besides
   the widely recognized trade-off between starvation and predation, this
   means that there may also be a trade-off between different forms of
   predation in wintering birds. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{We studied the selection response of the freshwater grazing zooplankter,
   Daphnia galeata, to increased abundance of cyanobacteria in its
   environment. Cyanobacteria are a poor-quality and often toxic food.
   Distinct genotypes of D. galeata were hatched from diapausing eggs
   extracted from three time horizons in the sediments of Lake Constance,
   Europe, covering the period 1962 to 1997, a time of change in both the
   prevalence of planktonic cyanobacteria and levels of phosphorus
   pollution. We assessed whether the grazers evolved to become more
   resistant to dietary cyanobacteria by exposing genetically distinct
   clones to two diets, one composed only of the nutritious green alga,
   Scenedesmus obliquus (good food), and the other a mixture of S. obliquus
   and the toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa (poor food),
   Genotype performance was measured as the specific rate of weight gain
   from neonate to maturity (g(j)).
   We evaluated evolutionary change in the Daphnia population using an
   analysis of reaction norms based on relative (log-transformed) changes
   in g(j). Log(g(j)) is a measure of the proportional effect of dietary
   cyanobacteria on other fitness components of the Daphnia phenotype. For
   comparison, we also analyze absolute (i.e., nontransformed) changes in
   g(i) and discuss the interpretations of the two approaches. Statistical
   results using a general linear model demonstrate a significant effect of
   genotype (showing differences in g(j) among genotypes), a significant
   genotype X food-type interaction (showing differences in phenotypic
   plasticity among genotypes), and, in the case of log-transformed data, a
   significant sediment-genotype-age X food-type interaction. The latter
   shows that phenotypic plasticity evolved over the period studied.
   Two constraints act on response to selection in the D. galeata-Lake
   Constance system. First, g(j) on a diet containing poor food is highly
   correlated with g(j) on a diet of good food, thus evolving resistance
   also meant evolving an increase in g(j) on both diets. Second, because
   genotypes with a high g(j) also grow to a large adult body size, which
   in turn increases Daphnia vulnerability to fish predation, we suggest
   that selection only acted to favor genotypes possessing a high potential
   gj after cyanobacteria became prevalent. The presence of cyanobacteria
   depressed realized g(j) and led to animals of small adult body size even
   if their genotypes had the potential for high g(j) and large size. With
   realized g(j) reduced, genotypes with an inherently high value could be
   selected even in the presence of predatory fish. The joint action of
   selection by dietary cyanobacteria and vulnerability to fish predation
   provides an explanation for the observed evolution of resistance to poor
   food through reduced phenotypic plasticity.}},

   Obesity should be recognized and treated as a primary medical condition

   obesity has been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk factors and
   comorbid conditions. Physician involvement is necessary for medical
   assessment, management, counseling, and coordination of

   counseling and weight management from physicians are significantly more
   likely to undertake weight management programs than those who do not.
   Obesity treatment guidelines and materials are available from various
   health organizations. A comprehensive weight management program must
   include dietary adjustments, increased physical activity, and behavioral
   modification. Nutritional modifications should take into account the
   diet's energy content, composition, and suitability for the individual
   patient. The physical activity component should be safe and practical,
   including aerobic activity, strength training, and increased daily
   lifestyle activities. Various behavioral strategies enable the patient
   to make lifestyle changes that will promote weight loss and management.
   Adjunct therapies may serve to sup-L port lifestyle modifications in
   severe or resistant cases of obesity. Models for multidisciplinary care
   vary depending on whether they are designed for an individual medical
   practice or as part of the health care services of a larger facility.
   Lifestyle changes for healthy weight management must be permanently

Abstract = {{We analysed the effects of forest fragmentation on the flock structure
   of insectivorous forest passerines (Parus, Aegithalos, Certhia, Regulus,
   etc.), and on the anti-predator behaviour and energy management of blue
   tits in these flocks. We surveyed flocks in Central Spain during two
   winters. Flocks in fragments comprised fewer individuals and species
   than flocks in unfragmented forests. The most abundant species in forest
   flocks (blue tit, Parus caeruleus, and firecrest, Regulus ignicapillus)
   were also the most abundant in fragments, while the rarest species in
   the area never occurred in small woodlots. We investigated how
   fragmentation and related changes in flock structure affect
   anti-predator behaviour of blue tits, a widely distributed species in
   the area. In fragments but not in forests, blue tits increased scanning
   rates with decreasing flock size. Vigilance was relaxed when great tits,
   Parus major, were abundant as flock mates, suggesting that the absence
   of this dominant species in fragments could intensify anti-predator
   behaviour of blue tits. Blue tits enhanced anti-predator behaviour in
   the second winter parallel to an increase in the abundance of raptors.
   This behavioural change was stronger in fragments, where blue tits
   foraged deeper in the canopy and increased scanning and hopping rates.
   Under increased predation risk, birds are expected to reduce body mass
   to improve predator avoidance. On average, blue tits weighed similar in
   fragments and forests the second winter. However, they accumulated fat
   along the day in-fragments only, and adjusted body mass to body size
   more closely in that habitat type. This suggests that blue tits
   perceived fragments as unpredictable habitats where fattening would help
   avoid starvation, but also as dangerous sites where overweight would
   further increase the risk of predation. In summary, our results. support
   that fragmentation affects individual behaviour of blue tits, and show
   the potential of behavioural approaches to unravel how different species
   face the advancing fragmentation of their habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Plant morphology is dramatically influenced by environmental signals.
   The growth and development of the root system is an excellent example of
   this developmental plasticity. Both the number and placement of lateral
   roots are highly responsive to nutritional cues. This indicates that
   there must be a signal transduction pathway that interprets complex
   environmental conditions and makes the ``decision{''} to form a lateral
   root at a particular time and place. Lateral roots originate from
   differentiated cells in adult tissues. These cells must reenter the cell
   cycle, proliferate, and redifferentiate to produce all of the cell types
   that make up a new organ. Almost nothing is known about how lateral root
   initiation is regulated or coordinated with growth conditions. Here, we
   report a novel growth assay that allows this regulatory mechanism to be
   dissected in Arabidopsis. When Arabidopsis seedlings are grown on
   nutrient media with a high sucrose to nitrogen ratio, lateral root
   initiation is dramatically repressed. Auxin localization appears to be a
   key factor in this nutrient-mediated repression of lateral root
   initiation. We have isolated a mutant, lateral root initiation 1 (lin1),
   that overcomes the repressive conditions. This mutant produces a highly
   branched root system on media with high sucrose to nitrogen ratios. The
   lin1 phenotype is specific to these growth conditions, suggesting that
   the lin1 gene is involved in coordinating lateral root initiation with
   nutritional cues. Therefore, these studies provide novel insights into
   the mechanisms that regulate the earliest steps in lateral root
   initiation and that coordinate plant development with the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Using an automatic identification and weighing system, we investigated
   changes in adult body mass in relation to reproductive behaviour during
   courtship and incubation in free-living king penguins. Despite stressful
   nutritional conditions and variability of fast length, the majority of
   pairs incubated successfully by accumulating large body reserves before
   fasting, which provided flexibility in fasting strategies. Our data
   indicate a low body mass during fasting below which males either delayed
   or stopped breeding: (1) at 12 kg, the mate interruped courtship to
   replenish his body reserves at sea before re-engaging in courtship; and
   (2) when body mass dropped to 9 kg during incubation, the male deserted
   the egg. The behavioural decision to go to sea was not controlled by the
   time spent fasting, but by the amount of body reserves. In deserting
   males, the depletion of body reserves during incubation before relief by
   the females was due to a lower stored energy ( - 2 kg) at the onset of
   courtship compared with successful males. Unsuccessful males weighed
   only 12 kg when they started to court, and consequently had no safety
   margin that allowed them to wait for a delayed female. The unusual
   depletion of body reserves of male breeders caused only 3\% of
   incubation attempts to fail. Compared with successful pairs, their
   female partners gained less body mass at sea ( - 40 g/day) and made a
   slightly longer foraging trip (+5 days). We suggest that the deserting
   males had risked breeding with the lowest fasting safety margin
   possible, rather than breeding later that year. However, the low body
   mass at desertion did not affect the penguins' survival or their feeding
   capacity, and therefore did not compromise another breeding attempt

Abstract = {{Increasing fruit and vegetable consumption reduces risk factors for
   cancer, cardiovascular disease and a number of other diet-related
   chronic diseases. These foodstuffs contain relatively high levels of
   beneficial phytochemicals (plant-derived, biologically active compounds)
   among which the preventative activity of antioxidants are most
   well-known and well-documented. Since small fruit typically contain high
   levels of antioxidants, increasing their incorporation in the diet is a
   laudable goal. Media reports of medical studies pertaining to dietary
   intake and national education initiatives such as the USDA's Food Guide
   Pyramid and the 5 A Day-for Better Health program have successfully
   raised public awareness of the health benefits of increased fruit and
   vegetable consumption, but, as of yet, may not have altered dietary
   habits. The factors influencing food choice are complex and
   interrelated. They include: sensory preference, physiological factors
   (pre- and postingestion), age, gender, lifestyle, behavior, personality,
   education, income, social attitudes about diet and health, ethnicity and
   tradition, religious beliefs, social pressures, marketing pressures,
   available product information and knowledge (labeling, media coverage,
   etc.) or self-identity beliefs. Some of these factors offer
   opportunities for increasing fruit and vegetable consumption while

   factors that tend to increase consumption include public awareness of

Abstract = {{Most established risk factors for chronic disease incidence and
   mortality from cancer, such as cigarette smoke, alcohol drinking,
   occupational and environmental hazards and dietary factors, have been
   shown to vary in their importance in terms of relative risk. In studies
   which addressed the individual level of behaviour, but also coping and
   self-regulation, a strong modifying effect of long-lasting hopelessness
   and helplessness has been found to depend on personality. Autonomy and
   healthful self-regulation have been defined as the regulation of
   behaviour in those activities which are carried out in the physical and
   social environment and lead to stimulated feeling, pleasure, perception
   of inner and social security and competence. Persons with such
   well-regulated behaviour are capable of coping wit sources of
   listlessness, uncertainty and instability. Those individuals showing a
   well-regulated behaviour arrive at a psycho-neuro-physiological basis
   for better competence and defence against health hazards.
   The capability determined by the degree of self-regulation is measured
   with different instruments. The experience with a questionnaire for the
   assessment of self-regulation, its quantification and predictive value
   is presented here. The method of study is by prospective approach, which
   permits the demonstration of causal associations (promotion,
   co-causality) and facilitates the experimental approach through
   intervention. A causal association is likely if the effect of a modifier
   is not only found in a prospective (observational) follow-up but also if
   the (experimental) intervention shows an effect. The method of
   intervention by stimulation of self-regulation is the autonomy training
   developed by Grossarth-Maticek. Using several examples presenting the
   method, the modifying effect is shown by referring to four risk factors.
   If the risk factors are associated with an inhibited self-regulation,
   then the effect in terms of disease and pathological outcome is
   stronger. This was shown with the hazardous effects of smoking, alcohol
   drinking and dietary malnutrition as well as with automobile exhaust. It
   may be important, for example, whether a person feels self-determined
   when driving a car for hours but does not need to consume
   ethanol-containing drinks for feeling well. One's own capability to
   regulate well over time apparently modulates functions of the body and
   hence modifies the effects of physical factors. In epidemiological
   studies, which assess mostly only exogenous factors (so called
   established risk factors) this evidence has to be considered by
   including the pertinent data on the relevant questions in each field
   study.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a stochastic model of an animal exploring and foraging
   within an uncertain environment. Behaviour is determined not by an
   optimizing algorithm but by fuzzy systems using linguistic rules derived
   from the information primacy hypothesis which stresses the importance of
   continual information gathering under conditions of uncertainty. In the
   model, the animal's hunger increases steadily over time and is reduced
   by visiting locations that may contain varying amounts of food.
   Uncertainty arises from three sources: (1) location novelty or
   ambiguity, that is, the animal is uncertain whether it has visited the
   same location before; (2) variation in the amounts of food in a given
   location; and (3) the recency of information concerning these two
   aspects of a given location. In complex and changing environments fresh
   information is likely to be more accurate than old information and
   consequently our model gives most weight to recently gathered
   information. All sources of uncertainty are reduced by visiting
   locations and gathering fresh information. The model is successful in
   simulating results from experiments investigating such phenomena as:
   spontaneous alternation; patrolling; the effects of hunger on the
   variability of learnt responses; latent learning; contrafreeloading; and
   behaviour following changes in food availability. (C) 2001 The

Abstract = {{Isolated individuals of most species are thought to be at a higher risk

   However, supporting evidence remains scant. As part of a broader study
   of grey-cheeked mangabey, Lophocebus albigena, dispersal in Kibale
   National Park, Uganda between October 1996 to February 1999, we
   investigated starvation and mortality risks within a sample of 27
   radiotagged mangabey males. Each male was contacted on average three
   times a week to collect data on spatial relations, habitat use, activity
   patterns and fates. We assessed risks by comparing data from `isolated'
   (greater than or equal to 200 m from the group) males with data from
   `within-group' males. We assessed starvation risks by comparing
   proportions of time spent in feeding, foraging and moving, comparing
   rates of movement during focal samples, and comparing proportions of
   time that males spent in different habitat types and canopy levels. We
   assessed mortality risks by comparing scanning rates and mortality
   events of within-group and isolated males. Isolated males spent
   significantly more time scanning, but we could detect no other
   significant differences in time allocated to different activities by the
   two categories of males. Nor could we detect differences between
   within-group and isolated males in the use of habitat types and canopy
   levels. At least three of five established mortality events involved
   males known to be isolated from groups. Given that males were found
   isolated only 11\% of the time, it is estimated that isolated males were
   at least 12 times as likely to die as within-group males. These results

Abstract = {{I manipulated food availability in juvenile and adult fishing spiders
   (Dolomedes triton) to test two hypotheses for sexual cannibalism. The
   adaptive foraging hypothesis posits that sexual cannibalism is an
   economic, adaptive foraging strategy on the part of the adult female. In
   contrast, the aggressive-spillover hypothesis suggests that
   precopulatory sexual cannibalism is misplaced aggression favoured in
   previous life-history phases. Several results indicated support for the
   adaptive foraging hypothesis. First, increased adult food availability
   produced marginally nonsignificant fecundity benefits in female's first
   egg sacs and highly significant fecundity benefits in female's second
   egg sacs. Second, while consumption of a male did not result in more
   offspring in either egg sac, it did significantly increase the
   probability a female would successfully hatch an egg sac. Finally,
   mating trials revealed mixed support for the adaptive foraging
   hypothesis as, for the most part, female mating behaviour (attack or
   mate) was not determined by the adaptive value a male represented (food
   item or sperm donor). Specifically, the likelihood of it precopulatory
   attack was not determined by male size, date (an indirect estimate of
   male availability)or female nutrient load. However, mated females did
   tend to attack courting males more often than virgin females. The
   aggressive-spillover hypothesis was supported by several findings. For
   juveniles, food availability had a significant positive effect on fixed
   female size (cephalothorax area at final moult) which, in turn, had a
   significant positive effect on fecundity. Thus, the spillover
   hypothesis' assertion that strong fecundity selection acts on juvenile
   feeding and fixed adult size was supported. The possibility that the
   spillover and adaptive foraging hypotheses are not mutually exclusive is
   discussed, especially in light of the presence of high levels of sexual
   cannibalism both before and after mating. (C) 2001 The Association for

Abstract = {{Wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, frequently hunt and share meat.
   Despite widespread interest and considerable study, continued
   controversy exists regarding the factors that influence chimpanzee
   hunting decisions and meat sharing. Three hypotheses invoke the
   importance of ecological, reproductive and social factors. A nutritional
   shortfall hypothesis suggests that chimpanzees hunt to compensate for
   seasonal shortages in food availability. A second hypothesis argues that
   male chimpanzees hunt to obtain meat that they swap for matings. A third
   hypothesis proposes that males use meat as a social-tool to develop and
   maintain alliances with other males. We tested these hypotheses using
   observations of an unusually large community of chimpanzees at Ngogo in
   Kibale National Park, Uganda. Results did not support the nutritional
   shortfall or meat-for-sex hypotheses. The Ngogo chimpanzees hunted
   primarily during times of food abundance rather than scarcity. The
   presence of oestrous females did not predict the tendency of chimpanzees
   to hunt. Furthermore, meat-for-sex exchanges occurred infrequently, and
   males did not gain a mating advantage through sharing meat. Additional
   observations were consistent with the male social bonding hypothesis. At
   Ngogo, male chimpanzees were likely to hunt when accompanied by other
   males. Males shared meat nonrandomly and reciprocally among themselves,
   and males exchanged meat for agonistic support. Although several factors
   are likely to affect chimpanzee hunting decisions and meat sharing,
   these results indicate that primary causes will not be found through
   invoking simple energetic or reproductive considerations. (C) 2001 The

Abstract = {{Pairing patterns in monogamous birds are thought to be the consequence

   individual quality in the opposite sex. Although this may result in
   assortative pairing for a single character, there may be no simple match
   between male and female phenotype if the traits linked to individual
   quality are sex specific. For instance, in several passerine species,
   females tend to select males on the basis of territory quality or
   characters that may reflect health or vigour, whereas males benefit from
   pairing with females in good condition that breed early because early
   breeding increases reproductive success. We investigated pairing
   patterns in an urban population of the sexually dimorphic European
   blackbird in relation to bill colour in males and body condition in
   females, over a 3-year period. Females breeding early were in
   significantly better condition than those breeding late. The number of

   Female condition was correlated with male bill colour within pairs, with

Abstract = {{Using food supplementation, we tested whether food limits juvenile
   survival in a population of Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) in
   northeastern Utah. The influence of additional food on female nest
   attendance also tvas investigated because those strategics may influence
   predation mortality rates of juveniles. We provided supplemental food
   near 13 nests from close to hatching until close to independence during
   the 1996 and 1997 breeding seasons. Thirteen additional nests served as
   controls and received no supplemental food. We compared the following
   variables at treatment and control nests: (1) adult female mass, (2)
   nestling mass and size, (3) female nest attendance, and (4) juvenile
   survival. Following supplemental feeding, adult females from treatment
   nests were heavier than their control counterparts, and remained closer
   to the nest during the latter part of the nestling period and throughout
   the postpledging period. Nestlings from supplemented nests were
   significantly heavier than those from unsupplemented nests, but results
   for size measurements were equivocal. Survival rates for treatment
   nestlings were significantly higher than controls in 1997, but not in
   1996. Those results support the hypothesis that food does not limit
   avian reproductive success on an annual basis. Most deaths in 1997 were
   the result of starvation or sibling competition. That observation, and
   the fact that fed nestlings were heavier, is consistent with the idea
   that treatment nestlings were in improved nutritional condition. Overall
   patterns of mass and nest-attendance for adult female goshawks supports
   the hypothesis that female condition and behavior are adjusted in
   response to food supplies. However, it is less clear what role the
   females' presence in the nest stand plays in mediating juvenile deaths,
   because we did not document predation as a primary mortality factor
   during the two years of this study. The apparent flexibility in female
   nest attendance behavior suggests that such plasticity may be an
   adaptation to lower the risk of predation.}},

   males are higher than those for older age groups. Risk factors can be
   grouped according to their social/familial, individual, or environmental
   nature. Based on these findings an explanatory model of suicidal
   behaviour can be developed, in which three criteria call be discerned:
   i.e. trait-dependent factors, including those related to serotonin,
   personality and cognitive psychological dysfunctions; state-dependent
   characteristics, such as depression and hopelessness; and threshold
   factors, which mag have a risk enhancing or protective effect, such as
   social support, contagion effects, the availability of means, and the
   accessibility of mental health care. Preventive actions need to be
   developed, targeting the general population (through, for example,
   educational programmes) or populations at particular risk, such as
   adolescents attempting suicide. Potential treatment approaches include
   the treatment of individual psychopathological phenomena, whether or not
   in school-based clinics, but particular attention has to be given to
   inducting and keeping young people at risk in treatment.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Leporids have long been known to reingest soft faeces. However, it was
   recently found that they regularly reingest hard faeces, too. During the
   daytime, both soft and hard faeces are defecated and all of the faeces
   are reingested. Excreted at night are the hard faeces, which are
   normally discarded but reingested in starvation. The separation
   mechanism in the proximal colon, which diverts fine particles into the
   caecum and thus only passes large food particles, produces hard faeces.
   When the mechanism ceases acting, fermented caecal materials are
   excreted as soft faeces. The reingestion of soft faeces, rich in
   vitamins and microbial proteins. is physiologically imperative. Hard
   faeces are basically a refuse, but their thorough mastication at
   reingestion reduces poorly digestible large particles to fine ones good
   fur fermentation. The regular reingestion of daytime hard faeces thus
   promotes food digestibility. The temporary use of night-time hard faeces
   allows leporids to do without food for some time. It thus gives leporids
   behavioural flexibility and thereby an ecological advantage. Reingestion
   is also known in other small- to medium-sized herbivores, which are all
   caecal fermenters. Morphological differentiation between faeces is
   reported only in larger species, but all ingested faeces are found to be
   richer in nutrients than discarded ones. Thus a separation mechanism is
   probably present in all reingesting species. Reingestion activity is
   deeply related to other behavioural and physiological traits of small
   mammalian herbivores, hence its study is important to understanding of
   their ecology and biology. Leporids are the largest of the reingesting
   species except for the semi-aquatic Coypu, and reingestion by leporids
   is certainly the most sophisticated. This development of a
   reingestion-involved digestive system has probably brought them to their
   present niche, as terrestrial medium-sized generalist mammalian
   herbivores, and consequently made their characteristic hide-and-run
   lifeforms by exposing them to a strong predation pressure.}},

Abstract = {{How do different levels of sibling competition affect nestling growth
   strategies? We investigated this through the effect of different levels
   of per capita feeding rate on the average growth rate of nestlings and
   on individual growth strategies within broods. To manipulate sibling
   competition, we transferred marsh tit nestlings between nests creating
   broods with fewer (reduced) or more (enlarged) nestlings than
   originally. Mean mass decreased as brood size, and thus sibling
   competition, increased. This was due to a large difference in mass
   between the smallest young in each brood. The mass of the largest young
   did not differ significantly between the broods. In reduced broods, the
   largest and smallest nestlings had equal mass, whereas in enlarged
   broods the difference was large. In contrast, wing length close to
   fledging did not differ between the experimental broods. We conclude
   that the growth of the wing has priority over general increase in size.
   This depends on the risk of starving for nestlings unable to leave the
   nest when their most dominant sibling leaves. Thus, low intake rates
   induce a trade-off in the growth of different structures, leading
   subdominant nestlings to divert proportionally more resources to wing
   length growth at the expense of general size. Subdominant nestlings are
   thus facing both a food constraint, depending on parental feeding rate
   and number of dominant siblings, and a time constraint, depending on the
   growth rate of the largest sibling. Hence, to fledge successfully,
   subdominant nestlings will leave the nest at suboptimal masses with a
   likely increase in postfledging mortality. (C) 2001 The Association for

Abstract = {{Over the last three decades, many studies have attempted to explain
   forager diets by using optimal diet theory (ODT). Despite some obvious
   successes, the utility of this theory remains controversial. We reviewed
   the results of 134 studies of optimal diet theory to test hypotheses on
   factors that can explain variation in the ability of ODT to predict
   diets and diet shifts in response to changes in prey availability. Our
   major conclusion is that while ODT has generally worked well for
   foragers that feed on immobile prey, the theory often failed to predict
   the diets of foragers that attack mobile prey. We found only mixed
   support for the hypothesis that the theory works better when the study
   scenario more closely fits the assumptions of the model. Contrary to our
   a priori predictions, forager types (invertebrate versus ectothermic
   vertebrate versus endothermic vertebrate) did not differ in their
   likelihood of corroborating ODT. Two explanations for why optimal diet
   theory does not work well with mobile prey are that studies on mobile
   prey often lack information on key parameters that are required to
   rigorously test ODT, and that with mobile prey, variations among prey in
   vulnerability (encounter rate and capture success) are often more
   important than variation in predator active choice in determining
   predator diets. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{To evaluate the effects of larval environment on postmetamorphic
   performance in the spadefoot toad, Spea hammondii, larvae were reared at
   one of two densities, creating groups of small and large terrestrial
   juveniles. These terrestrial juveniles were reared, either individually
   in the laboratory or in groups in outdoor tanks, at high and low food
   levels until they were 1 yr old. Larger terrestrial juveniles had higher
   probabilities of survival to 1 yr of age than smaller juveniles. Larval
   density did not strongly affect the maximum postmetamorphic growth rate
   of metamorphs. Body mass differences resulting from larval environment
   were maintained or slightly increased over the first year of terrestrial
   growth. The only exception occurred among males receiving high food
   after metamorphosis in both the laboratory and outdoor tanks; here the
   size differences disappeared. Larval environment did not influence the
   proportion of males reaching maturity in their first year. No females
   matured in their first year; this difference in the rate of maturation
   in males and females is consistent with published field studies. In
   outdoor tanks, males from the high-density larval treatment were active
   on the surface more often than those from the low-density larval
   treatment. These results are in general agreement with previous studies
   that have suggested that small size at metamorphosis is associated with
   lower adult fitness, in this case through lower survival and smaller
   body sizes. However, the results of this study suggest that the extent
   to which larval environment can influence subsequent terrestrial
   characteristics, such as growth and behavior, may vary with sex and
   terrestrial food availability.}},

Abstract = {{The begging displays used by altricial nestling birds to solicit care

   signals have attracted considerable interest, mainly because their
   intensity seems excessive for the function of transmitting information
   about nestling need to parents. However, how information on need is
   encoded in the various components of the signal, especially its acoustic
   components, is poorly understood. We examined how begging calls of large
   and small nestling tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor, changed during a
   short period of food deprivation and cooling, as a first step in
   determining the role that various call characteristics played in
   advertising nestling need. In contrast to previous studies, we examined
   several call variables, and related them not only to need for food but
   also need for warmth. When nestlings were deprived of food, their calls
   increased in rate and length. Large nestlings also increased the
   amplitude of their calls. When nestlings were cooled during food
   deprivation, they decreased the frequency of their calls and their call
   rate. The latter trend was especially evident in small nestlings. Our
   results suggest that begging calls carry information not only on the
   overall hunger level of broods, as emphasized in previous studies, but
   also on the size, hunger and thermal need of individual nestlings.

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-28}},
Abstract = {{This review of sow welfare addresses all aspects of housing for adult
   female pigs, including the issue of piglet welfare during lactation. It
   puts the issue of sow welfare in perspective by briefly outlining
   different approaches to the scientific assessment of welfare, the
   `feelings, preference, nature, and the functional or homeostasis'
   approaches. We believe the last approach currently offers science the
   best assessment of welfare and is the approach that is utilised in this
   review. It involves comparing housing or husbandry systems and risks to
   welfare on the basis of relative changes in biological (behavioural and
   physiological) responses and corresponding decreases in fitness (growth
   rate, reproductive performance, or health/injury/immunology).
   The review discusses the following areas: (i) housing of individually
   housed pregnant pigs, with subsections on tethers, stalls, reproductive
   performance, exercise, and new stall designs; conventional, alternative,
   and outdoor group housing with subsections on aggression, electronic
   feeding stations, ecoshelters, and other alternative group housing
   designs; and other issues, such as lameness, culling, straw and other
   substrates, diet and hunger, quality of stockpeople, and housing around
   mating including oestrus detection and mating; and (ii) farrowing and
   lactating pigs with subsections on farrowing crates and alternative
   farrowing systems, stress around farrowing and during lactation,
   maternal behaviour and piglet survival, and sow and piglet injury and
   lameness.
   Conclusions and recommendations arising from the review include the need
   for public education to provide an informed consumer base that will
   result in some consensus on welfare issues among diverse interest groups
   and the need for industry education that results in better animal
   welfare and a sustainable industry. Some specific research
   recommendations include space allowance and the duration of housing for
   individually housed pigs, welfare issues of breeding sows in
   echoshelters, piglet mortality in alternative systems, aggression in
   conventional and large groups, bedding, and hunger.}},

   humile, to different kinds of disturbance while workers foraged on food
   of differing quality. The behaviour of disturbed individuals was
   influenced by group size, by the behaviour of nearby nestmates and by
   how much food had already been consumed. When in large groups, workers
   were less likely to leave the foraging arena and resumed feeding more
   rapidly. This response was even more marked among workers whose gasters
   were only partially replete. However, individuals took more time to
   resume feeding and became more likely to run away from a food source
   when greater numbers of ants were disturbed. These influences may allow
   foraging groups to maximise food intake while minimising the mortality

Abstract = {{The provisioning parameters, breeding success, adult mass, and survival
   of yellow-nosed albatrosses were studied over 7 successive years at
   Amsterdam Island, southern Indian Ocean. We examined the ability of this
   long-lived seabird to adjust its breeding effort under different
   environmental conditions and the fitness consequences in terms of
   survival and quality of offspring produced. Provisioning rate and adult
   mass varied extensively between years, and the lo lowest and highest
   values were associated with sea surface temperature anomalies. When
   waters around the island were colder, adults were in good condition and
   brought large meals at short intervals, whereas warmer waters resulted
   in lower provisioning rates, lower adult mass, and lighter chicks at
   fledging. Adult survival and fledging success were not affected by sea
   surface temperature anomalies. Yellow-nosed albatrosses appear to be
   unable to adjust their breeding effort every season, and their
   differential breeding investment probably primarily reflects different
   levels of food availability. Yellow-nosed albatrosses are able to
   regulate their provisioning behavior according to the nutritional status
   of their chick only when conditions are favorable. Birds appear to
   invest primarily in their own future maintenance rather than in
   provisioning. They have a wide safety margin in body mass that limits
   mortality risks during good years as well as during poor years.
   Hoc-ever, during unfavorable seasons adults continue to provision chicks
   that have a poor prospect of survival to breeding, without additional
   survival costs for the parents. Favorable seasons therefore have a high
   value in terms of fitness because of the high quality of the chick
   produced. We suggest that understanding hew long-lived animals optimize
   their provisioning behavior and lifetime reproduction can only be
   achieved through studies encompassing several contrasted seasons.}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{The Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) is the dominant paradigm in predicting
   patch use and numerous tests support its qualitative predictions.
   Quantitative tests under complex foraging situations could be expected
   to be more variable in their support because the MVT assumes behavior
   maximizes only net energy-intake rate. However across a survey of 26
   studies, foragers rather consistently ``erred{''} in staying too long in
   patches. Such a consistent direction to the errors suggests that the
   simplifying assumptions of the MVT introduce a systematic bias rather
   than just imprecision. Therefore, I simulated patch use as a
   state-dependent response to physiological state, travel cost, predation
   risk, prey densities, and fitness currencies other than net-rate
   maximization (e.g., maximizing survival, reproductive investment, or
   mating opportunities). State-dependent behavior consistently results in
   longer patch residence times than predicted by the MVT or another
   foraging model, the minimize mu /g rule, and these rules fail to closely
   approximate the best behavioral strategy over a wide range of
   conditions. Because patch residence times increase with state-dependent
   behavior, this also predicts mass regulation below maximum energy
   capacities without direct mass-specific costs. Finally, qualitative
   behavioral predictions from the MVT about giving-up densities in patches
   and the effects of travel costs are often inconsistent with
   state-dependent behavior. Thus in order to accurately predict patch
   exploitation patterns, the model highlights the need to: (1) consider
   predator behavior (sit-and-wait versus actively foraging); (2) identify
   activities that can occur simultaneously to foraging (i.e., mate search
   or parental care); and (3) specify the range of nutritional states
   likely in foraging animals. Future predictive models of patch use should
   explicitly consider these parameters.}},

   generally not found where dissolved oxygen concentrations are < 0.29 mg
   l(-1), though some species are able to survive at oxygen concentrations
   as low as 0.07 mg l(-1). Physiological studies indicate that survival of
   these more tolerant species is facilitated by anaerobic respiration in
   the oxygen-depleted waters followed by upward vertical migration into
   oxygenated waters to repay the oxygen debt. Microzooplankton, which tend
   to be more common than macrozooplankton in regions with extremely
   reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations, are also capable of anaerobic
   respiration since some have been found in anoxic waters. Episodic
   periods of hypoxia/anoxia are becoming more common in coastal waters.
   The impact of hypoxia/anoxia, however, on estuarine and coastal
   zooplankton has received little attention yet micro- and mesozooplankton
   are important elements in marine food webs. Copepods in particular
   constitute a critical component of the diet of larval fish in these
   regions, Based on a limited number of studies, coastal zooplankton
   appear to be more sensitive to hypoxia/anoxia than zooplankton
   associated with permanent oxygen minimum zones. Mortality increases
   markedly at dissolved oxygen concentrations < 1.43 to 2.0 mg l(-1). The
   potential consequences of the increasing occurrence of hypoxic/anoxic

Abstract = {{Dispersal polymorphisms are known from many terrestrial organisms that
   inhabit fluctuating environments, but they are not well-recognized among
   marine invertebrates. An unusual form of variation was found in the
   settlement behavior of lecithotrophic larvae of the mollusc Alderia
   modesta (Loven, 1844) that markedly altered the dispersal potential of
   sibling larvae. Most clutches contained, in variable proportions, larvae
   that spontaneously metamorphosed in the egg mass or within 2 d of
   hatching, and larvae that delayed metamorphosis until encountering the
   obligate adult food, the yellow-green alga Vaucheria longicaulis. The
   proportion of larvae undergoing spontaneous metamorphosis within a
   clutch was highly variable, ranging from 0 to 90 \%, and was unrelated
   to adult size. The proportion of intracapsular metamorphosis was also
   variable, ranging from 0 to 32\%. The percentage of spontaneous
   metamorphosis per clutch was phenotypically plastic: when adults were
   starved, there was a significant tendency for each successive clutch to
   have a lower percentage of spontaneous metamorphosis, thus increasing
   the dispersal potential of the offspring. The decrease in spontaneous
   metamorphosis was significant after only 24 h of starvation. There was
   no significant increase in the cumulative level of spontaneous
   metamorphosis after the 2nd day post-hatching, but larval mortality
   increased as a linear function after the 5th day. Most larvae that did
   not spontaneously settle in the first 2 d delayed metamorphosis until
   they were exposed to the adult host alga, V; longicaulis. When 2 d old
   larvae were exposed to 17 species of macroalgae and sediment from the
   adult habitat, only V. longicaulis induced significant metamorphosis
   (93.3 +/- 6.7 \%); all other species of algae and field sediment induced
   no metamorphosis or low levels (0-9 \%) that were not significantly
   higher than sea water controls. There was no difference in the
   settlement specificity of 2 and 9 d old larvae when tested against 2
   different algae, nor in their ability to complete metamorphosis. The
   high initial percentage of spontaneous metamorphosis reduces the
   dispersal potential of some larvae in each clutch relative to their
   siblings that delay metamorphosis until stimulated by V. longicaulis;
   this settlement dimorphism represents a novel bet-hedging strategy among
   marine invertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{Several factors appear to affect vertical HIV-1 transmission, dependent
   mainly on characteristics of the mother (extent of immunodeficiency,
   co-infections, risk behaviour, nutritional status, immune response,
   genetical make-up), but also if the virus (phenotype, tropism) and,
   possibly, of the child (genetical make-up). This complex situation is
   compounded by the fact that the virus may have the whole gestation
   period, apart from variable periods between membrane rupture and birth
   and the breast-feeding period, to pass from the mother to the infant. It
   seems probable that an extensive interplay of all factors occurs, and
   that some factors may be more important during specific periods and
   other factors in other periods. Factors predominant in protection
   against in utero transmission may be less important for peri-natal
   transmission, and probably quite different from those that predominantly
   affect transmission by mothers milk. For instance, cytotoxic T
   lymphocytes will probably be unable to exert any effect during
   breast-feeding, while neutralizing antibodies will be unable to protect
   transmission by HIV transmitted through infected cells. Furthermore,
   some responses may be capable of controlling transmission of determined
   virus types, while being inadequate for controlling others. As occurence
   of mixed infections and recombination of HIV-1 types is a known fact, it
   does not appear possible to prevent vertical HIV-1 transmission by
   reinforcing just one of the factors, and probably a general strategy
   including all known factors must be used. Recent reports have brought
   information on vertical HIV-1 transmission in a variety of research
   fields, which will have to be considered in conjunction as background
   for specific studies.}},

Abstract = {{Animals utilise a wide range of regulatory systems to control the
   conditions within their bodies or homeostasis. These regulatory systems
   control for example, body temperature, nutritional state, water balance,
   social interactions and fear and these systems react to environmental
   and endogenous stimuli so as to correct. or prevent displacements from
   the optimal range. The behavioural and physiological responses utilised
   by the animal are usually proportional to the challenge to homeostasis.
   The stress response commences with the central nervous system perceiving
   a potential challenge to homeostasis. Once the central nervous system
   perceives a threat, it develops a biological response or defence that
   consists of some combination of the four general biological defence
   responses: behavioural responses, responses of the autonomic nervous
   system, responses of the neuroendocrine system and responses of the
   immune system. Although biological regulation is occurring constantly,
   adaptation is not always possible and when homeostasis fails, there are
   biological costs for the animal, which may include growth and
   reproductive failure, injury, disease as a consequence of
   immunosuppression or even death. While animal comfort is not strictly
   defined in the scientific literature, an appropriate definition of
   comfort that is utilised in this review is a dictionary definition, ``at
   ease in body and mind{''}.
   With the likely trend to greater intensification of grassland
   production, there are a number of factors that will affect animal
   comfort. Both group size and space allowance are key features of the
   social environment that may affect animal comfort, while the nature of
   human contact is an important factor, which through fear, may also
   affect animal comfort. Thermal stressors can have significant impact on
   animal comfort with cold around parturition being a serious problem for
   the offspring and heat having adverse consequences for adult animal
   production and welfare. The concerns for animal comfort over husbandry
   procedures include practices ranging from simple interventions such as
   shearing that involve challenges including restraint, close human
   contact and isolation to more complex surgical interventions such as
   tail docking and castration that may include additional challenges such
   as acute and chronic pain, as well as short-term production depressions.
   Others issues include risks associated with animal biotechnologies,
   including simple manipulations such as twinning to more complex
   transgenic manipulations.}},

Title = {{Bioenergetics and nutrition of Mississippi Valley population Canada
   geese during winter and migration}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2001}},
Number = {{146}},
Pages = {{1-65}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Survival and reproduction of northern-nesting geese are potentially
   affected by body condition during the non-breeding season. Body
   condition is presumed to be determined by the quantity of food available
   to geese during autumn, winter, and spring migration. However, food
   resources likely do not limit populations that exploit agricultural
   systems. Other factors such as hunting, refuge management, diet quality,
   weather may affect survival and reproduction. We studied time-energy
   budgets, food intake, and body condition to determine how Canada geese
   (Branta canadensis interior) of the Mississippi Valley Population (MVP)
   acquire and utilize energy and nutrients during autumn, winter, and
   spring migration during 1984-1989.
   Abundant food and behavioral flexibility allowed MVP Canada geese to
   exist on a high nutritional plane. Food intake was sufficient to meet or
   exceed daily energy and protein requirements except during winter. High
   energy, low protein diets fueled deposition of large lipid reserves, and
   were adequate to meet protein requirements during autumn in east-central
   Wisconsin. Late migrant geese that spent autumn in east-central
   Wisconsin expended more energy (x = 583 kcal/day) yet deposited more
   lipid (x = 4.51 g) compared to early migrants that spent autumn in
   southern Illinois (x = 526 kcal/day, x = 151 g lipid) during 1984 and
   1985. Both groups averaged 4.5 hr feeding/day during autumn and consumed
   similar quantities (dry mass) of food (x = 187-190 g/day). However, late
   migrants consumed a high energy (x = 3.67 kcal/g) low protein (x = 12\%)
   diet comprised mostly of corn (x = 81\%) during autumn in east-central
   Wisconsin. Early migrants consumed a lower energy (x = 2.99 kcal/g) but
   higher protein (24\%) diet that consisted mostly of green forages (x =
   24\% dry mass) in soybeans (x = 28\%) in southern Illinois.
   Wintering geese consumed a high energy (x = 3.49 kcal/g) diet with
   intermediate protein content (x = 19\%). Corn (x = 58\%) and soybeans (x
   = 22\%) comprised most of dry matter intake during winter in southern
   Illinois when daily energy expenditure averaged 536 kcal/day. However
   food intake declined (x = 152 g food/ day) during winter when geese
   averaged 3.5 hr feeding/day. Variation in crop food energy relative to
   population energy requirements on 2 southern Illinois refuges did not
   impact body condition during 1984-1989. Nutrient reserves contributed
   minimally (<1-6\%) to meeting daily energy requirements, so geese left
   winter refuges with more lipid and similar protein masses compared to
   early autumn.
   Geese exhibited a wide range of behavioral adaptation to spatial and
   temporal variation in food resources and nutritional requirements. Late
   migrants entered winter with larger energy reserves than early migrants
   during 1984-1989. Although early and late migrants were sympatric in
   southern Illinois during winter, they converged to similar levels of
   body condition by the end of winter during 1986-1989. Late migrants
   apparently used stored energy to reduce food intake, possibly to
   minimize mortality during winter. Early migrants apparently minimized
   exposure to hunting by feeding almost entirely within refuges during
   autumn. With smaller energy reserves, early migrants maintained higher
   levels of energy intake to maintain body condition after autumn,
   possibly increasing mortality risk during winter. We expected more
   similar trends in body condition between early and late migrant Canada
   geese, and more consistent losses of nutrient reserves each year if
   winter weight declines were driven by an endogenous physiological
   rhythm. We see no reason to invoke an endogenously driven physiological
   mechanism to explain winter weight losses in MVP Canada geese. Without
   controlled metabolic experiments, we prefer the simpler and more
   plausible explanation that winter weight declines result from
   facultative adjustments of feeding behavior to weather conditions, food
   availability, and pre-winter nutrient reserves. Overwinter survival
   should be enhanced by an energetic strategy that balances potential
   benefits and risks of feeding in relation to the size of remaining
   nutrient reserves. Decline of the early migrant tradition during the
   1990's suggests that the energetic strategy of late migrants is more
   suited to recent harvest and refuge management regimes.
   Adults deposited 73\% (females) and 28\% (males) of their spring protein
   reserves while migrating between southern Illinois and east-central
   Wisconsin. Spring lipid reserves were acquired mostly (84\% in females,
   92\% in males) during a 4-5 week staging period in east-central
   Wisconsin. Juveniles deposited 41-51\% of lipid reserves and 80-91\% of
   protein between southern Illinois and east-central Wisconsin. Feeding
   time (x = 5.8 hr/day), and food intake (x = 263 g/day) increased during
   spring-staging when lipid reserves more than doubled. Spring-staging
   geese consumed a moderate energy (x = 3.25 kcal/g) low protein (x =
   13\%) diet that was more evenly composed of corn (x = 50\%), wild seeds
   and rootstocks (x = 21\%), and green forages (x = 27\%) compared to
   autumn and winter.
   Deposition of nutrient reserves was neither time- nor resource-limited
   during spring migration. Thus, food resources likely did not limit
   reproduction of MVP Canada geese under the conditions we observed during
   1984-1989. Shallow wetland and moist soil habitats can be enhanced on
   southern Illinois refuges to benefit a wider diversity of
   wetland-dependent species and provide nutritional resources for geese
   without compromising energy available to support wintering populations.
   However, geese still need an abundant source of energy during autumn and
   winter, particularly when foraging opportunities are restricted by
   inclement weather or hunting. Food restriction on winter refuges during
   long and late-closing hunting seasons in the 1990's may have contributed
   to long-term changes in autumn migration patterns and wintering
   traditions in southern Illinois. Forage and non-crop foods are essential
   sources of protein and other nutrients during all seasons. but are
   especially important during spring migration. Shallow wetlands and
   lowland pastures on private lands in central Illinois and east-central
   Wisconsin are critical sources of non-crop foods that provide essential
   nutrients that geese use to complete the nesting cycle. Thus,
   reproduction could be impaired in the future if changing land use and
   farming practices reduce availability of moist soil and lowland pasture
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Abundantly fed Euplotes versatilis n. sp. undergo unequal fissions
   yielding opisthes definitely larger than proters and larger than
   mothers. This process results in production of giant cells some of which
   become predatory or cannibalistic. Starvation induces the reversion to
   the small phenotype, by means of both unequal fissions yielding smaller
   opisths and physiological reorganizations. These size variations are
   associated with extensive variations of the dorsal argyrome pattern, the
   taxonomic value of which is therefore poor. The largest cells exhibit
   supernumerary ventral cirri and dorsal kineties.
   A somewhat similar phenotypic plasticity is known in E. balteatus and at
   a lesser degree in E. focardii. The latter shares with E. versatilis an
   uncommon asymmetrical mode of conjugation. The three species are assumed
   to be phylogenetically close and adapted to frequent and unpredictable
   variations of food availability.
   From a morphogenetical point of view, the occurrence of unequal cell
   fission in these species is assumed to be related to some genetically
   modified integration of cellular growth with the other components of the
   cell cycle, so that fission may be triggered even in cells with a
   posterior part much larger or much smaller than the anterior one.}},

Abstract = {{Females of the shield bug Parastrachia japonensis Scott progressively

   impetus for the occurrence of provisioning in this species. However, the
   function of provisioning is not well understood. We carried out two
   field experiments to determine whether provisioning is nutritionally
   important and whether it affords protection against predation.
   Development of nymphs was significantly delayed and their survival was
   low in the absence of provisioning, even when nests were within the area
   of ground on to which the drupes fell, apparently because of the poor
   quality of the majority of the drupes. Selective provisioning of
   good-quality drupes by female P. japonensis, a semelparous species, was
   thus necessary for young nymphs to obtain enough food for their
   development. Furthermore, even without a female in attendance, having
   drupes in the nest significantly reduced early mortality in the presence

Abstract = {{Gambusia hubbsi populations occur in a variety of fresh and

   they are frequented by avian piscivores and may be occasionally occupied
   by piscivores such as Eleotris. We sampled 10 shallow water sites, 14

Abstract = {{It is expected that through flexibility in behaviour, flock living birds
   respond to the asymmetries in resource access derived from dominance
   relationships. We analysed the microhabitat use of willow tits in winter
   flocks and assessed possible factors which shape habitat segregation
   between adults and juveniles in different temperature regimes. When
   foraging in mild conditions (ambient temperature > 0 degreesC), flocks
   split up into subgroups with adults foraging in inner parts of trees
   more often than juveniles. However, no differences were recorded in the
   vertical position occupied in trees. In harsh conditions (< -
   4<degrees>C), flocks re-united and juveniles further moved to outer
   parts of trees, increasing horizontal segregation between age classes.
   In mild conditions, vigilance behaviour was not related to the position
   of birds in trees, but in harsh conditions, scanning frequency was
   higher in outer parts of trees only for adults. In mild weather,
   juvenile position in trees was associated with body size and mass. The
   foraging microhabitat segregation detected in harsh conditions fits the
   age-related hoarding distribution previously described in the same
   population. This supports the hypothesis that hoarded food is important
   in determining future foraging habitat use. Adult preference and
   intraspecific competition for safer or richer inner parts of trees as
   foraging sites during harsh conditions seems to determine the habitat
   segregation between adults and juveniles. Furthermore, we suggest that
   in mild weather, when foraging in the absence of adults, juveniles
   balance the costs of using a potentially dangerous microhabitat with the
   benefits of building energetically cheap and large food reserves through
   hoarding. The expected patterns of microhabitat segregation may differ
   in parids, depending on whether predation risk or other factors such as
   food availability are the main factors controlling habitat quality.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. The attention deficit syndrome is one of the commonest
   behavior disorders of infancy, although it is considerably
   underestimated. Development. The aetiology of attention deficit syndrome
   is multifactorial since genetic, environmental nutritional and
   psychosocial factors have been found to be associated with its
   development. Diagnosis depends mainly on the identification of behavior
   changes especially of inattention, impulsiveness and hyperactivity: it
   should be made at home and at school and based on the exclusion of
   severe organic and neurological disorders which also present initially
   with similar characteristics. Electrophysiological studies may be useful
   since multiple electroencephalographic changes have been reported, as
   have prolonged latency of III and V waves of brain stem evoked
   potentials. The best management requires educational therapy combined
   with controlled medical treatment. Use of stimulants should be carefully
   considered and the tricyclic drugs are preferably the first
   pharmacological option. Conclusions. Current findings regarding the
   repercussions of attention deficit syndrome in adults shows the need for
   early diagnosis and treatment of the condition so as to avoid severe
   personality disorders including antisocial and criminal behavior. It is
   essential that the parents and the child himself understand the
   condition in order to achieve satisfactory results of long term

Abstract = {{Subordinates often have to wait for dominants to obtain food. As a
   result, their foraging success should be less predictable and they
   should therefore maintain a higher level of energy reserves compared
   with dominants. A corollary of this prediction is that subordinates
   should gain mass earlier in the day and maintain higher mass than
   dominants. We tested these predictions with captive Carolina chickadees.
   In two different experiments tone where birds were given ad libitum
   access to food and the other with food access limited to 60 min/day), we
   formed social flocks of two previously unfamiliar birds and compared
   their energy management (body fat and food caches) while they were in
   the flock with energy management when housed alone. Results from both
   experiments failed to support the predictions. Of all the parameters of
   body mass and food caching we measured only the following results were
   significant: (1) On the ad libitum food schedule, both subordinates and
   dominants accumulated more mass over the day when in a flock compared
   with when they were solitary, and there were no differences in mass gain
   between dominants and subordinates. (2) When analysed separately,
   dominants showed a higher evening mass in the flock compared with the
   solitary condition, a trend that runs opposite to the prediction. Our
   results suggest that when in favourable foraging conditions, social
   interactions might cause dominant and subordinate birds to accumulate
   more energy reserves as a result of competition. On the other hand, if
   food supply is limited, both dominants and subordinates may be forced to
   maintain similar fat reserves as an insurance against increased risk of
   starvation. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Predators may control the impact of herbivores on their plant resources
   by 1) decreasing herbivore numbers, 2) imposing predation risk affecting
   foraging behavior. The goal of the present study was to examine the
   effects of a predator and auditory cues indicating its presence on the
   rare of tree seedling (Acer rubrum, Betula lenta) consumption bq meadow
   voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus). The first of our experiments involved
   introduction of a stoat (Microtus pennsylvanicus) into an enclosed vole
   population and the second a playback of recordings of vole distress
   calls, movements of a stoat and its. vocalizations. In both experiments
   we manipulated vegetation cover and the availability of Food next to the
   experimental seedlings to assess the effects of microhabitat under the
   different risk situations. The results of the first unreplicated
   experiment suggested an increased rate of seedling predation in the
   presence of the stoat. Consistent with these results, the playback of
   predator sounds in the second replicated experiment caused an increased
   rate of seedling predation compared to control plots with no recordings.
   A mon ed circle around a seedling station, representing increased risk
   of predation on the voles. decreased seedling consumption. This effect
   was modest in the playback treatment. We suggest the results to be due
   to displacement behavior by time voles exposed to prolonged risk and
   conflicting demands of foraging and avoiding predators. Alternatively.
   as suggested by the model of Lima and Bednekoff, prolonged risk of
   predation forced the voles to decrease their levels of vigilance during
   low-risk playback breaks. The modest inhibitory effect of cover removal
   on seedling predation in time playback treatment is consistent with this
   interpretation. The results confirm recent evidence for trophic cascades
   mediated by behavioral interactions between predator and prey. They are
   novel in suggesting that the presence of predation risk can increase the
   inhibitory effects of consumers on their resources.}},

   swordtails or tetras. There was no significant difference in the
   frequency of predator inspection behaviour towards the odour of the
   starved cichlids and the odour of the fed cichlids in either of the two
   diet treatments. However, when tetras were exposed to the odour of
   cichlids fed tetras, they took significantly longer to initiate an
   inspection visit, remained further from the source of the chemical cues
   and inspected in smaller groups, compared with the odour of a starved
   cichlid or a cichlid fed swordtails. These data strongly suggest that
   tetras will inspect chemical cues alone, but only if the cue contains
   information about the predator. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {{Despite warning labels and increases in evidence of the adverse effects
   of tobacco use, women continue to use tobacco products during pregnancy.
   Cigarette smoking has been linked to increased prenatal mortality,
   increased incidence of SIDS, reductions in birth weight, and disruptions
   in CNS and behavioral development. Animal model systems have critically
   established the causal relationship between nicotine and adverse
   developmental outcome. The present study examines the behavioral effects
   of nicotine exposure in the rat during the third trimester equivalent of
   the human brain growth spurt, a period of rapid development of the
   cholinergic systems and a period during which the CNS is particularly
   vulnerable to a number of insults. Sprague-Dawley rat pups were exposed
   to nicotine (6.0 mg/kg/day) from postnatal days (PD) 4-9 via an
   artificial rearing procedure. This procedure ensures that observed
   effects are not due to nutritional deficits. Two control groups were
   employed, an artificially reared control group and a normally reared
   control group. Activity level was measured on PD 18-19. Nicotine-exposed
   subjects were significantly overactive compared to both control groups,
   which did not differ significantly from one another. This behavioral
   alteration was observed in the absence of nicotine-induced body weight
   deficits. These results suggest that women who use tobacco products
   during late gestation may place their fetuses at risk for hyperactivity
   later in life, particularly during early adolescence. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The way in which novel learned behaviour patterns spread through animal
   populations remains poorly understood, despite extensive field research
   and the recognition that such processes play an important role in the
   behavioural development, social interactions and evolution of many
   animal species. We conducted a series of controlled diffusions of
   foraging information in replicate experimental populations of the guppy,
   Paecilia reticulata. We presented novel foraging tasks over 15 trials to
   mixed-sex groups, made up of food-deprived and nonfood-deprived adults
   (experiment 1) or small, young fish and old, large adults (experiment
   2). In these diffusions, knowledge of a route to a feeder could spread
   through the group by subjects learning from others, discovering the
   route for themselves, or, most likely, by some combination of these
   social and asocial learning processes. We found a striking sex
   difference, with novel foraging information spreading at a significantly
   faster rate through subgroups of females than of males. Females both
   discovered the goal and learned the route more quickly than males.
   Food-deprived individuals were faster at completing the tasks over the
   15 trials than nonfood-deprived guppies, and there was a significant
   interaction between sex and size, with a sex difference in adults but
   not young individuals. There was also an interaction between sex and
   hunger level, with food deprivation having a stronger effect on male
   than female performance. We suggest that information may diffuse in a
   similar nonrandom or `directed' manner through many natural populations
   of animals. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) share food even if separated by a mesh
   restraint. Pairs of capuchins were moved into a test chamber in which
   one of them received apple pieces for 20 min, and the other received
   carrot pieces for the next 20 min. Previous research had shown a
   correlation between the rate of food transfer in both directions across
   female-female dyads. The present study confirmed this result.
   Reciprocity across dyads can be explained, however, by symmetry in
   affiliative and tolerant tendencies between two individuals, provided
   these tendencies determine food sharing. The present study was designed
   to exclude this symmetry-based explanation by testing each pair (N=16)
   of adult females on six separate occasions. There existed a significant
   covariation across tests of sharing in both dyadic directions, a result
   unexplained by relationship symmetry. Moreover, control procedures (i.e.
   testing of a food possessor without a partner, or testing of two
   individuals with the same food or two different foods at the same time)
   indicated that behaviour during food trials is not fully explained by
   mutual attraction or aversion. The monkeys take the quality of their own
   and the partner's food into account, and possessors limit transfers of
   high-quality foods. Instead of a symmetry-based reciprocity explanation,
   a mediating role of memory is suggested, and a mirroring of social
   attitude between partners. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Life-history theory predicts that differences in reproductive effort and
   residual reproductive value among species should result in differences
   in the level of risk that parents are willing to tolerate to themselves
   versus their offspring. Specifically, highly fecund and shorter-lived
   species are expected to place greater value in current offspring than
   themselves, whereas less fecund and longer-lived species are expected to
   place greater value in their own survival and future breeding
   opportunities. Here, we test the prediction that parental investment
   decisions are correlated with life histories by comparing risk-taking
   behaviour in two species of nuthatch that differ in reproductive effort:
   the white-breasted nuthatch, Sitta carolinensis (more fecund, lower
   survival) and the red-breasted nuthatch, S. canadensis (less fecund,
   higher survival). We experimentally manipulated stage-specific predation
   risk by presenting models of an adult predator (hawk) and an egg
   predator (wren) and measured the willingness of males to feed incubating
   females on the nest. We found that both species of nuthatch responded to
   predators by increasing the length of time between visits and aborting
   more visits to the nest. However, as predicted by their life histories,
   S. carolinensis displayed a significantly stronger response to the egg
   predator, whereas S. canadensis responded more strongly to the adult
   predator. Thus, species can differ in their willingness to tolerate risk
   to themselves and their young, and such differences appear to be related
   to differences in investment in current reproduction and the probability
   of future survival. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Most herbivorous arthropods are specialists that feed on one or a few
   related plant species. To understand why this is so, both mechanistic
   and functional studies have been carried out, predominantly restricted
   to bitrophic aspects. Host-selection behaviour of herbivorous arthropods
   has been intensively studied and this has provided ample evidence for
   the role of secondary plant chemicals as source of information in
   behavioural decisions of herbivores. Many evolutionary studies have
   regarded co-evolution between plants and herbivores to explain the
   diversity of secondary plant chemicals and host specialisation of
   herbivores. However, many cases remain unexplained where: herbivores
   select host plants that are suboptimal in terms of fitness returns. A
   stimulating paper by Bernays and Graham {[}(1988) Ecology 69, 886-892)]
   has initiated a discussion on the need of a multitrophic perspective to
   understand the evolution of host-plant specialisation by herbivorous
   arthropods. However, this has hardly resulted in ecological studies on
   host-selection behaviour that take a multitrophic perspective. Yet,
   evidence is accumulating that constitutive and induced infochemicals
   from natural enemies and competitors can affect herbivore behaviour.
   These cues may constitute important information on fitness prospects,
   just as plant cues can do. In this paper I selectively review how
   information from organisms at different trophic levels varies in space
   and time and how herbivores can integratively exploit this information
   during host selection. In doing so, research areas are identified that
   are likely to provide important new insights to explain several of the
   questions in herbivore host selection that remain unanswered so far.
   These research areas are at the interface of evolutionary ecology,
   behavioural ecology and chemical ecology. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{1. Daphnia magna reproduced at a smaller size (body mass) when exposed
   to fish-kairomone than D. magna growing up without this cue.
   2. The total egg mass for first reproduction was the same in both
   groups, but the proportion of clutch mass to total body mass was about
   11\% higher in daphniids exposed to fish-kairomone. This difference was
   about the same for low and high food concentrations (0.5 or 1.5 mgC
   l(-1)).
   3. Although egg mass was the same, triglyceride (TAG) content of the egg
   material was significantly lower when daphniids were exposed to
   fish-kairomones for both food concentrations.
   4. The TAG content of the clutch was lowered to the extent that the TAG
   proportion in the clutch in relation to the somatic mass of the animal
   was the same for animals treated with fish-kairomone and controls (5\%
   of body mass at first reproduction).
   5. The lower TAG content per clutch resulted in a lower quality of the
   individual egg in daphniids exposed to fish-kairomone. The resulting
   higher susceptibility to starvation under low food conditions is a
   substantial cost of the plastic response to fish-kairomones.
   6. This cost may set a limit on the plastic response in resource
   allocation of Daphnia magna exposed to fish-kairomones. However,
   daphniids living in a system with fish predation are more likely to be
   eaten by fish than to starve to death.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{564-588}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. In order to assess the future impact of a proposed development or
   evaluate the cost effectiveness of proposed mitigating measures,
   ecologists must be able to provide accurate predictions under new
   environmental conditions. The difficulty with predicting to new
   circumstances is that often there is no way of knowing whether the
   empirical relationships upon which models are based will hold under the
   new conditions, and so predictions are of uncertain accuracy.
   2. We present a model, based on the optimality approach of behavioural
   ecology, that is designed to overcome this problem. The model's central
   assumption is that each individual within a population always behaves in
   order to maximize its fitness. The model follows the optimal decisions
   of each individual within a population and predicts population mortality
   rate from the survival consequences of these decisions. Such
   behaviour-based models should provide a reliable means of predicting to
   new circumstances because, even if conditions change greatly, the basis
   of predictions - fitness maximization - will not.
   3. The model was parameterized and tested for a shorebird, the
   oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus. Development aimed to minimize the
   difference between predicted and observed overwinter starvation rates of
   juveniles, immatures and adults during the model calibration years of
   1976-80. The model was tested by comparing its predicted starvation
   rates with the observed rates for another sample of years during
   1980-91, when the oystercatcher population was larger than in the model
   calibration years. It predicted the observed density-dependent increase
   in mortality rate in these years, outside the conditions for which it
   was parameterized.
   4. The predicted overwinter mortality rate was based on generally
   realistic behaviour of oystercatchers within the model population. The
   two submodels that predicted the interference-free intake rates and the
   numbers and densities of birds on the different mussel Mytilus edulis
   beds at low water did so with good precision. The model also predicted
   reasonably well (i) the stage of the winter at which the birds starved;
   (ii) the relative mass of birds using different feeding methods; (iii)
   the number of minutes birds spent feeding on mussels at low water during
   both the night and day; and (iv) the dates at which birds supplemented
   their low tide intake of mussels by also feeding on supplementary prey
   in fields while mussel beds were unavailable over the high water period.
   5. A sensitivity analysis showed that the model's predictive ability
   depended on virtually all of its parameters. However, the importance of
   different parameters varied considerably. In particular, variation in
   gross energetic parameters had a greater influence on predictions than
   variations in behavioural parameters. In accord with this, much of the
   model's predictive power was retained when a detailed foraging submodel
   was replaced with a simple functional response relating intake rate to
   mussel biomass. The behavioural parameters were not irrelevant, however,
   as these were the basis of predictions.
   6. Although we applied the model to oystercatchers, the general
   principle on which it is based applies widely. We list the key
   parameters that need to be measured in order to apply the model to other
   systems, estimate the time scales involved and describe the types of
   environmental changes that can be modelled. For example, in the case of
   estuaries, the model can be used to predict the impact of habitat loss,
   changes in the intensity or method of shellfishing, or changes in the
   frequency of human disturbance.
   7. We conclude that behaviour-based models provide a good basis for
   predicting how demographic parameters, and thus population size, would
   be affected by novel environments. The key reason for this is that, by
   being based on optimal decision rules, animals in these models are
   likely to respond to environmental changes in the same way as real ones
   would.}},

   Group size was smallest at the height of the rainy season and greatest
   at the beginning of the rainy season. Whereas increase in group size in
   the beginning rainy season might have been related to the improving
   feeding conditions and to reproductive behaviour, reduction of number of
   animals per group at the height of the rainy season was probably
   influenced by grass height. In addition to grass height, other factors
   influencing visibility such as vegetation density, time of the day
   (day/night) and moon light intensity at night effected group size. While
   long term trends in group size changes are effected by food availability
   and reproduction, we assume visibility to be the proximate factor
   influencing short term (1-24 hours) group size changes in kobs in the
