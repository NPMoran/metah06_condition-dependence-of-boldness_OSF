abstract={Alcohol addiction is a common affliction with a strong genetic component [1]. Although mammalian studies have provided significant insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying ethanol consumption [2], other organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster are better suited for unbiased, forward genetic approaches to identify novel genes. Behavioral responses to ethanol, such as hyperactivity, sedation, and tolerance, are conserved between flies and mammals [3, 4], as are the underlying molecular pathways [5-9]. However, few studies have investigated ethanol self-administration in flies [10]. Here we characterize ethanol consumption and preference in Drosophila. Flies prefer to consume ethanol-containing food over regular food, and this preference increases over time. Flies are attracted to the smell of ethanol, which partially mediates ethanol preference, but are averse to its taste. Preference for consuming ethanol is not entirely explained by attraction to either its sensory or caloric properties. We demonstrate that flies can exhibit features of alcohol addiction. First, flies self-administer ethanol to pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Second, flies will overcome an aversive stimulus in order to consume ethanol. Third, flies rapidly return to high levels of ethanol consumption after a period of imposed abstinence. Thus, ethanol preference in Drosophila provides a new model for studying aspects of addiction. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This chapter provides an overview of the truism that both nature and nurture determine human athletic ability. The major thesis developed is that environmental effects work through the process of growth and development and interact with an individual's genetic background to produce a specific adult phenotype, i.e. an athletic or nonathletic phenotype. On the nature side (genetics), a brief historical review is provided with emphasis on several areas that are likely to command future attention including the rise of genome-wide association as a mapping strategy, the problem of false positives using association approaches, as well as the relatively unknown effects of gene-gene interaction(epistasis), gene-environment interaction, and genome structure on complex trait variance. On the nurture side (environment), common environmental effects such as training-level and sports nutrition are largely ignored in favor of developmental environmental effects that are channeled through growth and development processes. Developmental effects are difficult to distinguish from genetic effects as phenotypic plasticity in response to early life environmental perturbation can produce lasting effects into adulthood. In this regard, the fetal programming (FP) hypothesis is reviewed insome detail as FP provides an excellent example of how developmental effects work and also interact with genetics. In general, FP has well-documented effects on adult body composition and the risk for adult chronic disease, but there is emerging evidence that FP affects human athletic performance as well.

abstract={Chronic stress induces abnormal mental state and behavior, and can be a risk factor for mental disorders. Although it is reported that l-tyrosine, an amino acid that is a precursor of catecholamine synthesis, alleviated the change of cognition and behavior induced by acute stress, knowledge about its effects on chronic stress is limited. In the present study, the effects of dietary l-tyrosine on behavioral alteration induced by chronic stress were investigated by employing a social isolation stress model in mice. Social isolation stress increased locomotor activity in both the home cage and open field. These increases of locomotor activity were suppressed by dietary l-tyrosine. Moreover, l-tyrosine increased both the concentration and turnover rate of norepinephrine metabolites. These findings partly suggest the availability of dietary l-tyrosine for psychic dysfunctions induced by chronic stress. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Exploration is a central component of human and animal behavior that has been studied in rodents for almost a century. The measures used by neuroscientists to characterize full-blown exploration are limited in exposing the dynamics of the exploratory process, leaving the morphogenesis of its structure and meaning hidden. By unfettering exploration from constraints imposed by hunger, thirst, coercion, and the confines of small cage and short session, using advanced computational tools, we reveal its meaning in the operational world of the mouse. Exploration consists of reiterated roundtrips of increasing amplitude and freedom, involving an increase in the number of independent dimensions along which the mouse moves (macro degrees of freedom). This measurable gradient can serve as a standard reference scale for the developmental dynamics of some aspects of the mouse's emotional-cognitive state and for the study of the interface between behavior and the neurophysiologic and genetic processes mediating it.},

abstract={Previous studies with macaque monkeys have found rapid learning to be impaired in both spatial (visuospatial) and non-spatial (visuomotor) associative learning tasks after fornix transection. In order to test theories that posit a general role for the fornix in associative learning, we investigated whether monkeys with fornix transection would also be impaired in the rapid acquisition of visuovisual conditional associations. We trained monkeys, postoperatively, on three sets of conditional stimulus-stimulus concurrent associations. Fornix transection did not impair learning of these associations, even in the early stages; to the contrary, animals with fornix transection made significantly fewer perseverative errors during the initial acquisition stages. These results challenge the idea that the hippocampal system plays a general role in the rapid acquisition of all kinds of associative knowledge. We suggest that the lower error rate in the early stages of the non-spatial task in the fornix transected animals may be secondary to an impairment in visuospatial processing; this might act to bias animals away from attempts to learn about spatial strategies for solving novel tasks. Additionally, we observed that fornix transected and control monkeys adopted a Change-shift response strategy in this task; the use of which was found to be fornix independent. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Impairments in different forms of behavioral flexibility, such as set-shifting and reversal learning, are some of the most reliable cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, and have been attributed to a disruption in frontal lobe functioning. However, recent animal studies have highlighted the distinct functional roles that different subcortical systems interconnected with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) play in different forms of behavioral flexibility. This suggests that dysfunction in these circuits also contribute to the cognitive impairments in these processes observed in schizophrenia. The present review summarizes findings from studies that utilize or rodent studies rodents to elucidate the dissociable contributions that prefrontal cortical, striatal, thalamic and dopaminergic systems make to different component processes of behavioral flexibility, with an emphasis on set-shifting functions mediated by the medial PFC. We also review recent work investigating how different manipulations thought to model certain aspects of schizophrenia affect set-shifting and reversal learning. Lastly, we report novel data describing the effects of subchronic ketamine exposure on these forms of flexibility. Ketamine treatment reduced perseverative tendencies during set-shifting, but impaired reversal learning, suggesting a complex disruption of neural circuits related to the nucleus accumbens shell and orbitofrontal cortex. Viewed collectively, these findings further our understanding of how certain neural abnormalities observed in the schizophrenic brain may relate to impairments in behavioral flexibility. This information may facilitate the development of animal models that resemble the complex disruptions in neural circuitry observed in schizophrenia, which would aid in the discovery of novel targeted pharmacotheraputic approaches to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction linked to these circuits. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Several species of seabirds show cyclic patterns of attendance at their nesting colonies. We examined the patterns of variation in the numbers of Cory's shearwater at three colonies (two oceanic and one located on the continental shelf), including the world's largest, at Selvagem Grande, Madeira, Portugal and considered several hypotheses concerning their causal mechanisms. At Selvagem Grande, cycles were exceptionally marked and regular, with a periodicity ranging from 7.8 to 11 days, and involved both breeders and nonbreeders. In contrast, variation in numbers was aperiodic at a nearby and much smaller colony (Selvagem Pequena), and also at the colony located off the Portuguese coast (Berlenga Island). We found no relationships between number of birds ashore and environmental variables such as wind direction and speed or lunar cycle. Cycles did not seem to be driven by oscillations in food availability or accessibility, given that they did not correlate with daily chick growth rates (which were acyclic) or diet. Despite their regularity, cycles were slightly out of phase in different sectors of Selvagem Grande, which suggests that social interactions at the colony could act as an entrainment agent for an endogenous rhythm, and so cycles are probably more likely to occur in large and dense colonies. Observations are consistent with the hypothesis that cycles facilitate social interactions by maximizing the probability of encounters at the colony. However, the exact mechanisms through which these remarkable cycles are controlled are still completely unknown, and clearly further research is needed. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Changes in age/size-specific mortality, due to such factors as predation, have potent evolutionary consequences. However, interactions with predators commonly impact prey growth rates and food availability and such indirect effects may also influence evolutionary change. We evaluated life-history differences in Trinidadian killifish, Rivulus hartii, across a gradient in predation. Rivulus are located in (1) "high predation" sites with large piscivores, (2) "Rivulus/guppy" sites with guppies, and (3) "Rivulus-only" sites with just Rivulus. Rivulus suffer higher mortality with large predators, and guppies may prey upon small/young Rivulus in Rivulus/guppy environments. In turn, population densities decline while growth rates increase in both localities compared to Rivulus-only sites. To explore how the direct and indirect effects of predators and guppies influence trait diversification in Rivulus, we examined life-history phenotypes across five rivers. High predation phenotypes exhibited a smaller size at reproduction, a greater number of eggs that were smaller, and increased reproductive allotment. Such changes are consistent with a direct response to predation. Rivulus from Rivulus/guppy sites were intermediate; they exhibited a smaller size at reproduction, increased fecundity, smaller eggs, and larger reproductive allotment than Rivulus-only fish. These changes are consistent with models that incorporate the impacts of growth and resources. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.},

abstract={Social communication in the house mouse relies heavily on pheromone-carrying major urinary proteins (MUPs), which delay release of pheromones thus extending longevity of the scent signal. Moreover, MUPs appear to play an important role in individual recognition. In the last few years, new research has led to some important advances. It has been shown that MUPs without their volatile ligands are able to activate neurons in vomeronasal organ and elicit behavioural and physiological responses in the signal receiver. Furthermore, increasing evidence has been found showing that, contrary to the traditional view, MUP expression is condition and state dependent, and that this variation may provide additional information about an individual. Progress has also been made in the description of MUP-like proteins in other rodents; as yet, however, the protein variability typical of the house mouse has not been observed in any other species. Despite these new results, the concept of MUPs has remained more or less unchanged from the date they were first recognized as an identity signal. The aim of this review is to summarise recent knowledge about MUPs and to discuss previous findings in the light of novel facts. Special attention is paid to the consequences the new results may have on our understanding of the individual recognition role of MUPs.},

abstract={Members of the neuropeptide-Y (NPY) family acting via Y2 and/or Y4 receptors have been proposed to participate in the control of ingestive behaviour and energy homeostasis. Since these processes vary between day and night, we explored the circadian patterns of locomotor, exploratory and ingestive behaviour in mice with disrupted genes for Y2 (Y2-/-) or Y4 (Y4-/-) receptors. To this end, the LabMaster system was used and its utility for the analysis of changes in circadian activity and ingestion caused by gene knockout evaluated. Female animals, aged 27 weeks on average, were housed singly in cages fitted with sensors for water and food intake and two infrared frames for recording ambulation and rearing under a 12 h light/dark cycle for 4 days. Relative to WT animals, diurnal locomotion, exploration, drinking and feeding were reduced, whereas nocturnal locomotion was enhanced in Y2-/- mice. In contrast, Y4-/- mice moved more but ate and drank less during the photophase, while they ate more and explored less during the scotophase. Both Y2-/- and Y4-/- mice weighed more than WT mice. These findings attest to a differential role of Y2 and Y4 receptor signalling in the circadian control of behaviours that balance energy intake and energy expenditure. These phenotypic traits can be sensitively and continuously recorded by the LabMaster system. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Since the discovery of the double helix, the study of brain function, in terms of both physiology and behavioral traits, has resulted in a plethora of research linking these activities to the genetic basis of neurotransmitter function. Knowledge about how genes are expressed, as well as their potential impairment due to polygenic inheritance, can shed light on predispositions to addiction and self-destructive behaviors. Genetic information derived from scientific explorations of genetic traits may have important links to understanding the basis for feelings of well-being and potentially the phenomena associated with human happiness. While non-genetic oriented research of social, political, and biological studies have addressed the impact of social and institutional environments on mass political attitudes and behaviors, there is a paucity of solid research on the interrelation and influence of genetic and environmental factors on these parameters. The separate fields of psychology and molecular biology are subject to inherent limitations that may only be resolved through collaboration across disciplines. Certainly areas relating to spirituality ("Genospirituality") and political science are just two that are beginning to emerge as fruitful grounds for identification of specific polymorphic gene associations and may pave the way to advance a new science of human nature. We address the issue of "Nature vs. Nurture" as it relates to questions regarding the definition of happiness, its causes, and its promotion. These questions are central to understanding human nature and are emerging as an important target of research, especially in the area of nutrigenomics. The present commentary attempts to identify key "vector influences" that link genes, the brain, nutrition, and social behavior to a most desired, but misunderstood, and potentially fragile experience known as "happiness." Specifically, we propose that successful changes in body composition/body mass index (BMI)/percentage of body fat will increase not only positive self-image, but overall wellness that produces a state of happiness. We provide preliminary evidence that utilization of a customized dopaminergic agonist LG839 DNA directed nutraceutical, significantly increased happiness in obese subjects. We detail genotypes that may play a role in determining happiness, based on current knowledge.},

abstract={Purpose: Fenugreek seeds (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) are an old herbal remedy used to treat metabolic and nutritive dysfunctions. They have been shown to modulate feeding behaviour in animals, but strong clinical data are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a repeated administration of a fenugreek seed extract on energy intake and eating behaviour in healthy human volunteers. Methods: Twelve healthy male volunteers completed a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled three-period cross-over trial of two different doses of a fenugreek seed extract (588 and 1176 mg). The three 14-day treatment periods were separated by a 14-day washout period. The main endpoints were energy intake, assessed in volunteers under normal ambulatory and free-living conditions by a 3-day detailed dietary record and during a meal test, weight, fasting glucose level, insulin and lipid profile, visual analogue scale scores of appetite/satiety and blood glucose and insulin levels measured repeatedly after a standardized breakfast. Results: Daily fat consumption was significantly decreased by the higher dose of fenugreek seed extract [3.73 vs. 4.51 MJ day-1, -17.3% vs. placebo, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.51 to -0.05, n∈=∈12, P∈=∈0.038]. This specific reduction tended to lower the total energy intake (9.97 vs. 11.29 MJ day-1, -11.7% vs. placebo, 95% CI -2.91 to 0.26, n∈=∈12, P∈=∈0.094) . No significant effect was observed on the other nutrients or other endpoints. Conclusions: The repeated administration of a fenugreek seed extract specifically decreases dietary fat consumption in humans which, given the traditional use of the plant, constitutes a novel result. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Unlike other visceral organs, the gastrointestinal tract has several communication channels transmitting to the spinal cord and brain, which include vagal afferent neurons, spinal afferent neurons, intestinofugal enteric neurons, and endocrine mechanisms. The vagus nerves have long been thought to play only a role in the efferent reflex regulation of digestion. It has turned out, however, that the majority of fibers in the vagus nerves is afferent in nature and subserves an unprecedented variety of physiological and pathophysiological roles. Thus, vagal afferents have a function in chemonociception and interoception (the sense of the physiological state of the body), modify affective-emotional processes in the brain, can give rise to nausea and vomiting, and carry messages relevant to appetite and nutrition. In the context of this book, it is particularly relevant that vagal afferents serve as a sensory interface between the peripheral immune system and the central as well as autonomic nervous system. Vagal afferents can respond to proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta and contribute to the behavioral sickness response to infection. In addition, they elicit a vagovagal anti-inflammatory reflex that results in the stimulation of cholinergic vagal efferents. Upon peripheral release, acetylcholine activates alpha7 subunit-containing nicotinic receptors on immune cells, which inhibits further release of proinflammatory cytokines and suppresses inflammation. These substantial advances in the understanding of vagal nerve function offer novel therapeutic opportunities for the management of nociception and inflammation. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={1. For phenotypically plastic organisms to produce phenotypes that are well matched to their environment, they must acquire information about their environment. For inducible defences, cues from damaged prey and cues from predators both have the potential to provide important information, yet we know little about the relative importance of these separate sources of information for behavioural and morphological defences. We also do not know the point during a predation event at which kairomones are produced, i.e. whether they are produced constitutively, during prey attack or during prey digestion. 2. We exposed leopard frog tadpoles (Rana pipiens) to nine predator cue treatments involving several combinations of cues from damaged conspecifics or heterospecifics, starved predators, predators only chewing prey, predators only digesting prey or predators chewing and digesting prey. 3. We quantified two behavioural defences. Tadpole hiding behaviour was induced only by cues from crushed tadpoles. Reduced tadpole activity was induced only by cues from predators digesting tadpoles or predators chewing + digesting tadpoles. 4. We also quantified tadpole mass and two size-adjusted morphological traits that are known to be phenotypically plastic. Mass was unaffected by the cue treatments. Relative body length was affected (i.e. there were differences among some treatments), but none of the treatments significantly differed from the no-predator control. Relative tail depth was affected by the treatments and deeper tails were induced only when tadpoles were exposed to cues from predators digesting tadpoles or cues from predators chewing + digesting tadpoles. 5. These results demonstrate that some prey species can discriminate among a diverse set of potential cues from heterospecific prey, conspecific prey and predators. Moreover, the results illustrate that the cues responsible for the full suite of behavioural and morphological defences are not induced by tadpole crushing nor can they be induced by generalized digestive chemicals produced when predators digest their prey. Instead, both prey damage and predator digestion of conspecific tissues appear to be important for communicating predatory risk to phenotypically plastic anuran prey. Importantly, the production of chemical cues by predators may be unavoidable and prey have evolved the ability to eavesdrop on these signals. © 2009 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={The present study was designed to examine possible anxiolytic profile of aqueous fruit extracts of a medicinal plant Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L. spp. Turkestanica) in experimental animal models. Sea buckthorn (SBT) is a very potent medicinal and multipurpose plant which has gained global significance due to its biochemical and nutritional utility in folk medicine. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine with CNS depressant properties and a sedative-hypnotic drug traditionally used to treat anxiety. Animal models for anxiety-related behavior are based on the assumption that anxiety in animals is comparable to anxiety in humans. To unravel neurobiological mechanisms underlying normal anxiety as well as its pathological variations, animal models are indispensable tools. In this investigation rats were treated with the aqueous fruit extracts of Sea buckthorn (SBT-FE) (20 and 40 mg/kg P.O.) and diazepam at doses of 3.0mg/kg I.P. 1 hr before introducing the groups of animals to various experimental models of anxiety. Anti anxiety activity was evaluated using elevated plus maze (EPM), light-dark model (LDM) and open field test (OFT). Results revealed that in elevated plus maze, treatment with aqueous extracts of SBT-FE increased the time spent in open arm and total locomotion time in aversive environment. In light-dark model treatment with these extracts showed significant (p<0.01) increases in time spent in lit-box and in open field test treatment with SBT-FE exhibited significant increases in the exploratory activity and latency time as compared to controls. The results indicate that aqueous SBT-FE is an effective anxiolytic agent and could be useful in primary medical care.},

abstract={Debate has emerged in the literature on mania, with some evidence suggesting that tendencies toward mania relate to negative emotional and cognitive styles, and other evidence suggesting that tendencies toward mania relate to positive emotional and cognitive styles. An initial study examined how tendencies toward mania (as measured by the Hypomanic Personality Scale) and tendencies toward depression (as measured by the Inventory to Diagnose Depression-Lifetime version) were related to diverse measures pertaining to incentive and threat motivations, negative and positive emotionality, and cognitive responses to emotion, among 238 undergraduates. Tendencies toward mania related to a self-reported pattern of reacting intensely to positive stimuli, both cognitively and emotionally, as well as lower sensitivity to threatening stimuli and less restraint over impulses. In contrast, tendencies toward depression related to a pattern of reacting more strongly to negative stimuli emotionally and cognitively, as well as deficits in the ability to savor positive affect. This pattern was re-confirmed in a second sample of 394 undergraduates, who completed many of the same measures plus a measure of current mood symptoms. This second sample confirmed that the pattern was not mood-state dependent. Implications for future research and clinical work are discussed, including an intriguing conceptual parallel in the distinct sets of correlates of depressive versus manic tendencies. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Mounting evidence indicates that the development of the fetus is heavily influenced by the intra-uterine milieu during pregnancy, and that such influence may have life-long consequences for the individual. The intra-uterine milieu is not only influenced by nutritional factors, but also by maternal endocrine and autonomic activity. Such activity is prone to be affected by an individual's personality, but only little is known about influences of maternal personality on the development of the fetus. We tested pregnant women for their propensity for impulsive, uncontrollable outbursts of temper (referred to here as moderate Intermittent Explosive Disorder, mIED). After the women gave birth, we measured electrocardiograms (ECGs) from their newborn infants to compare ECGs between newborns of women with and without mIED. The data show that infants of women with mIED have larger QRS complexes in the electrocardiogram, and lower heart rate variability, compared to infants of women without mIED. These results reveal effects of maternal mIED on the fetal heart development. These effects may predispose the individual to increased risk for later cardio-vascular disease. The findings open perspectives for better risk prevention models for the unborn child. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Exhausted Literature. The Emergence of the New in Samuel Beckett's Novels and Plays. The article investigates literary subjectivity in some texts by Samuel Beckett. The article proceeds by relating the ways of how narration and speech acts constitute literary subjectivity to the problems of subjectivity that scientific investigations deal with. While successful self-regulation of the organism nourishes the roots of subjectivity, i. e. the habits, subjectivity decomposes in states of exhaustion, when self-regulation breaks down. As soon as a certain threshold is transgressed, fatigue sets in, alters the personality and eventually leads to exhaustion - a state, which psychiatrists compare to mental illness. Notwithstanding the different explanations given, scientists agreed about the effects of exhaustion. According to their investigations, the decomposition of personality by exhaustion generally does not involve apathy, withdrawal from activity or termination of movements, but rather mere action. Similarly, in Beckett's novels and plays exhaustion is much more than tiredness, as French philosopher Gille Deleuze observed. For Beckett, exhaustion is rather the model for both literary innovation and a new concept of subjectivity, which he explores on the basis of a detailed knowledge of physiology, psychology, and psychiatry, but using his own literary means. The exhausted subject is beyond any calculus of activity. It will perform an activity even if he or she makes mistakes or loses control, and will thus act in an unpredictable way. This unpredictable action is not an exception in the continuation of the habits, but rather points to the moment when a new subjectivity emerges. Such new subjectivity surfaces in Beckett's novels and plays in forms of literary innovation.},

abstract={This book is an attempt to better our understanding of the determinants of welfare in Latin America and the Caribbean,1 a region that is diverse in terms of culture and levels of development. Some countries in the region are approaching developed country standards of living, while others approximate the per capita income levels of sub-Saharan Africa. Further, as is well-known, the region has relatively high intra-country variations in per capita income - indeed with the highest inequalities of any of the major world regions. These per capita income differences, in addition to the region's cultural diversity, provide a laboratory for studying how quality of life varies with a number of important objective and subjective measures, including per capita income but also including others such as job insecurity, job satisfaction, schooling attainment, educational quality, nutritional insecurity, personal insecurity, mortality, and self-assessed health. The concept of quality of life is a broad one, which incorporates basic needs but extends beyond them to include capabilities, as typically measured by the United Nations Development Program's human development index (UNDP's HDI); the "livability" of the environment, as measured by income per capita and growth; and life appreciation and happiness, as measured by well-being surveys. In this book we focus on reported or subjective well-being ("happiness" or " satisfaction"), a concept that differs from but complements other indicators of the quality of life. Our analysis builds upon a number of new approaches in economics, particularly those related to the economics of happiness. In addition to standard "objective" data such as on income, consumption, schooling attainment, mortality and job insecurity, our study relies heavily on surveys of reported well-being, both at a general level and in specific domains. This is a fundamental departure from traditional economics. Most economists historically have shied away from the use of survey data on expressed well-being and instead relied on revealed preferences - via consumption and investment choices - as a basis for analysis. The rationale is that answers to questions about well-being are not good signals of the preferences and constraints underlying actual behavior; there is no consequence to answering surveys, thus they do not clearly identify underlying preferences and/or constraints. In contrast, consumption and investment choices usually reflect a conscious choice about expenditure trade-offs. If the constraints are known, then preferences can be identified more accurately. In addition, unobserved heterogeneities in factors such as personality traits can bias the manner in which people answer surveys. Yet in recent years the use of survey data on well-being has become more accepted. The increase in the number of economists working with such survey data over the past decade has been nothing short of remarkable.2 In part this is because econometric techniques have been developed that allow control for some of the unobserved error/personality traits that might significantly bias the interpretation of responses on well-being as reflecting underlying preferences. And the increasing coverage of large samples across countries and regions with varying levels of development and other conditions gives survey data on well-being tremendous analytical potential. Research by psychologists, meanwhile, demonstrates that answers to surveys are in large part validated by psychological and neurological measures of happiness and well-being. While the traditional reliance on revealed preferences has informed a number of important questions, there are some limitations. One is that there is increasing evidence that factors other than rational choice may drive important consumption and investment choices, including addiction or self control problems on the one hand and low expectations norms on the other. These factors may help explain a number of consumption choices that would otherwise appear perverse from a welfare perspective. A second is that there are a number of choices that revealed preferences approaches cannot answer, precisely because individuals are constrained in their abilities to make those choices, due to lack of agency, lack of information, and other factors related to poverty or discrimination, among other reasons. The use of survey data on well-being is not without its problems, however, some of which are relevant to all kinds of data and some of which are more important for survey questions on well-being. A particularly important question in terms of well-being data is that of question framing. How questions are asked, and where they are placed in the survey can make a big difference in the responses. Subjective well-being has both cognitive and affective components, and different questions capture more or fewer of these elements. Open-ended happiness questions, for example, capture more of the affective components than do more framed questions, such as the best possible life question or domain satisfaction questions. Which questions are used can have significant effects on the relationship that is found between happiness and critical correlates. An important example is the relationship between happiness and income. There is a major debate in the literature on the relationship between happiness and income across countries and over time. This began with Richard Easterlin's (1974) seminal work demonstrating that there was not a relationship between happiness and income over time as countries got wealthier - the so-called Easter-lin paradox. While Easterlin found that countries that were desperately poor were less happy than those above a minimum per capita income threshold, his work also showed that above that threshold happiness does not seem to increase with additional income, at least not in a linear manner. There is still a great deal of debate about whether there is an Easterlin paradox or not. Some recent work based on a new and broader cross-country dataset from the Gallup World Poll has challenged the Easterlin paradox and highlights a strong and consistent relationship between per capita income levels and average country-level happiness.3 The findings are surely provocative, but it is not clear that they are fully comparable to Easterlin's, for two reasons. The first is question framing. The "life satisfaction" variable they rely on in the Gallup Poll is based on Cantril's 1965 ladder of life question, which asks respondents to compare their lives to the best possible life they can imagine. That frames the question much more than does an open-ended life satisfaction question (as Easterlin used). Surely when asked to compare, respondents in very poor countries are aware that life is likely better in wealthier ones, not least because of widespread access to the media and the Internet. Affect questions typically (and not surprisingly) have less of a relationship with income than do more framed questions, such as the best possible life. Graham, Chattopadhyay, and Picon (2008), using the Gallup World Poll, find that the income and happiness relationship holds across countries for the best possible life, economic satisfaction, and the economic ladder questions, but not for life purpose and freedom to choose in life questions. Howell and Howell (2008), using a meta-analysis of 111 samples from 54 developing countries, find (Figure Presented) that the income-subjective well-being relationship is stronger when subjective well-being is measured as life satisfaction - a cognitive assessment (instead of happiness, an emotional assessment). Secondly, there were far fewer developing countries in the sample when Easter-lin did his original work. Since then, the Gallup Poll has included a large number of new countries: small, poor countries in sub-Saharan Africa and the transition economies, which have seen the dismantling of existing social welfare systems and dramatic falls in happiness. So the more linear relationship between income and happiness may not be driven by rising incomes and happiness in the rich countries, but by low or falling incomes and happiness in a large number of small countries at the bottom of the distribution.

abstract={A major question in the biology of stress and environmental adaptation concerns the neurobiological basis of how neuroendocrine systems governing physiological regulatory mechanisms essential for life (metabolism, immune response, organ function) become harmful. The current view is that a switch from protection to damage occurs when vulnerable phenotypes are exposed to adverse environmental conditions. In accordance with this theory, sequelae of early life social and environmental stressors, such as childhood abuse, neglect, poverty, and poor nutrition, have been associated with the emergence of mental and physical illness (i.e., anxiety, mood disorders, poor impulse control, psychosis, and drug abuse) and an increased risk of common metabolic and cardiovascular diseases later in life. Evidence from animal and human studies investigating the associations between early life experiences (including parent-infant bonding), hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, brain development, and health outcome provide important clues into the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate the contribution of stressful experiences to personality development and the manifestation of illness. This review summarizes our current molecular understanding of how early environment influences brain development in a manner that persists through life and highlights recent evidence from rodent studies suggesting that maternal care in the first week of postnatal life establishes diverse and stable phenotypes in the offspring through epigenetic modification of genes expressed in the brain that shape neuroendocrine and behavioral stress responsivity throughout life. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Variation in antipredation behavior should translate into variation in survival. Effective general defenses, such as predator avoidance, decrease the likelihood that an individual is attacked and should therefore reduce selection on behaviors that enhance probability of escape on attack. Escape behaviors become important if animals cannot avoid attack. We investigated the relative effects of avoidance and escape enhancing behaviors on the survival of juvenile redshanks, Tringa totanus, over 2 winters. We predicted that avoidance behavior should be the primary behavioral correlate of survival, but when forced, by starvation risk, into areas where risk of attack is much higher, behaviors that reduce risk of capture once attacked should also promote survival. We found that reducing exposure to attack was most important for increasing survival and that increased vigilance and foraging success rate only increased survival for individuals that spent more time in high-risk areas. Use of the high-risk area and survival varied between years, suggesting that variation in starvation risk (i.e., colder winters) may provide a mechanism for selection on "capture-reducing" antipredation behaviors to be maintained because predator avoidance, the most effective antipredation behavior, is not then possible.},

abstract={Background: Primary prevention of childhood overweight is an international priority. In Australia 20-25% of 2-8 year olds are already overweight. These children are at substantially increased the risk of becoming overweight adults, with attendant increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Early feeding practices determine infant exposure to food (type, amount, frequency) and include responses (eg coercion) to infant feeding behaviour (eg. food refusal). There is correlational evidence linking parenting style and early feeding practices to child eating behaviour and weight status. A focus on early feeding is consistent with the national focus on early childhood as the foundation for life-long health and well being. The NOURISH trial aims to implement and evaluate a community-based intervention to promote early feeding practices that will foster healthy food preferences and intake and preserve the innate capacity to self-regulate food intake in young children. Methods/Design. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to recruit 820 first-time mothers and their healthy term infants. A consecutive sample of eligible mothers will be approached postnatally at major maternity hospitals in Brisbane and Adelaide. Initial consent will be for re-contact for full enrolment when the infants are 4-7 months old. Individual mother- infant dyads will be randomised to usual care or the intervention. The intervention will provide anticipatory guidance via two modules of six fortnightly parent education and peer support group sessions, each followed by six months of regular maintenance contact. The modules will commence when the infants are aged 4-7 and 13-16 months to coincide with establishment of solid feeding, and autonomy and independence, respectively. Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, with follow up at nine and 18 months. These will include infant intake (type and amount of foods), food preferences, feeding behaviour and growth and self-reported maternal feeding practices and parenting practices and efficacy. Covariates will include sociodemographics, infant feeding mode and temperament, maternal weight status and weight concern and child care exposure. Discussion. Despite the strong rationale to focus on parents' early feeding practices as a key determinant of child food preferences, intake and self-regulatory capacity, prospective longitudinal and intervention studies are rare. This trial will be amongst to provide Level II evidence regarding the impact of an intervention (commencing prior to age 12 months) on children's eating patterns and behaviours. Trial Registration.

abstract={Background: Understanding the behavior of birds in agricultural habitats can be the first step in evaluating the conservation implications of birds' use of landscapes shaped by modern agriculture. The existence and magnitude of risk from agricultural practices and the quality of resources agricultural lands provide will be determined largely by how birds use these habitats. Buff-breasted Sandpipers (Tryngites subruficollis) are a species of conservation concern. During spring migration large numbers of Buff-breasted Sandpipers stopover in row crop fields in the Rainwater Basin region of Nebraska. We used behavioral observations as a first step in evaluating how Buff-breasted Sandpipers use crop fields during migratory stopover. Methodology/Principal Findings: We measured behavior during migratory stopover using scan and focal individual sampling to determine how birds were using crop fields. Foraging was the most frequent behavior observed, but the intensity of foraging changed over the course of the day with a distinct mid-day low point. Relative to other migrating shorebirds, Buff-breasted Sandpipers spent a significant proportion of their time in social interactions including courtship displays. Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that the primary use of upland agricultural fields by migrating Buff-breasted Sandpipers is foraging while wetlands are used for maintenance and resting. The importance of foraging in row crop fields suggests that both the quality of food resources available in fields and the possible risks from dietary exposure to agricultural chemicals will be important to consider when developing conservation plans for Buff-breasted Sandpipers migrating through the Great Plains. © 2009 McCarty et al.},

abstract={There is now clear evidence that the pace and pathway of early growth is a major risk factor for the development of a group of chronic diseases that include coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. This has led to a new 'developmental' model for these disorders. The so-called 'fetal origins hypothesis' proposes that the disorders originate through developmental plasticity, whereby malnutrition during fetal life, infancy and early childhood permanently change the structure and function of the body, a phenomenon known as 'programming'. This paper reviews recent findings in the Helsinki Birth Cohort, which comprises 13 345 men and women born in the city during 19341944. There is also an older cohort comprising 7086 people born during 19241933. We review the paths of pre- and postnatal growth that lead to later disease. Children who later develop coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes grow slowly during fetal life and infancy but thereafter increase their body mass indices rapidly. Those who later develop stroke grow slowly in fetal life, infancy and during childhood. We also review how the growth of girls during infancy, childhood and at puberty influences chronic disease in the next generation. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd.},

abstract={The role of gamma melanocyte stimulating hormone (γ-MSH) in appetite regulation is controversial in mammals and to our knowledge unreported within the avian class. Thus, the present study was designed to determine the effects of intracerebroventricularly (ICV) administered γ2-MSH on food intake using Cobb-500 chicks as models. In Experiment 1, chicks that received ICV γ2-MSH decreased their food intake throughout the 180 min observation period and plasma glucose concentration was not affected. Water intake was also decreased in ICV γ2-MSH-treated chicks, but only from 30 to 90 min post-injection. In Experiment 2, food pecking efficiency was decreased in ICV γ2-MSH-treated chicks and the amount of time spent sitting was increased. Other behaviors were not significantly affected by ICV γ2-MSH including distance traveled, the number of jumps, escape attempts, defecations, food pecks, exploratory pecks, and the amount of time spent standing, preening, perching, or in deep rest. These data suggest that γ2-MSH is associated with anorexigenic effects and because of γ-MSH's selectivity, implicates the melanocortin 3 receptor in appetite regulation. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract={Ecological impacts of vehicle traffic are a significant environmental management issue on many sandy shores. Impacts usually focus on lethal effects of vehicles to organisms, but sub-lethal effects which could reduce the fitness of macrofauna populations are equally possible but unknown. Consequently, we measured changes in body condition and burrowing performance of the beach clam Donax deltoides subjected to vehicle traffic on sandy shores in eastern Australia. Body mass index of clams on beaches open to traffic was 16% lower, but gonadosomatic index and relative valve thickness were not consistently linked to vehicle access to beaches. By contrast, off-road vehicles significantly impaired the burrowing performance of clams. After experimental exposure to ORV traffic (30 passes) and dislodgement from the sediment, the time taken for clams to re-bury into the sand doubled irrespective of the vehicle weight used. Because burrowing is such a critical function in the behavioural repertoire of sandy beach animals, the traffic-induced changes to organisms' performance found in this study may increase mortality by causing displacement to less favourable habitats by swash, and by intensifying the risk of predation and desiccation. When assessing the ecological impacts of vehicles on beach fauna, it is thus important to consider both lethal and sub-lethal effects. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The identification of differentially regulated proteins in animal models of psychiatric diseases is essential for a comprehensive analysis of associated psychopathological processes. Mass spectrometry is the most relevant method for analyzing differences in protein expression of tissue and body fluid proteomes. However, standardization of sample handling and sample-to-sample variability are problematic. Stable isotope metabolic labeling of a proteome represents the gold standard for quantitative mass spectrometry analysis. The simultaneous processing of a mixture of labeled and unlabeled samples allows a sensitive and accurate comparative analysis between the respective proteomes. Here, we describe a cost-effective feeding protocol based on a newly developed 15N bacteria diet based on Ralstonia eutropha protein, which was applied to a mouse model for trait anxiety. Tissue from 15N-labeled vs. 14N-unlabeled mice was examined by mass spectrometry and differences in the expression of glyoxalase-1 (GLO1) and histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 2 (Hint2) proteins were correlated with the animals' psychopathological behaviors for methodological validation and proof of concept, respectively. Additionally, phenotyping unraveled an antidepressant-like effect of the incorporation of the stable isotope 15N into the proteome of highly anxious mice. This novel phenomenon is of considerable relevance to the metabolic labeling method and could provide an opportunity for the discovery of candidate proteins involved in depression-like behavior. The newly developed 15N bacteria diet provides researchers a novel tool to discover disease-relevant protein expression differences in mouse models using quantitative mass spectrometry. © 2009 Frank et al.},

abstract={Cooperation is the cornerstone of lion social behavior. In a notorious case, a coalition of two adult male lions from Tsavo, southern Kenya, cooperatively killed dozens of railway workers in 1898. The "man-eaters of Tsavo" have since become the subject of numerous popular accounts, including three Hollywood films. Yet the full extent of the lions' man-eating behavior is unknown; estimates range widely from 28 to 135 victims. Here we use stable isotope ratios to quantify increasing dietary specialization on novel prey during a time of food limitation. For one lion, the δ13C and δ15N values of bone collagen and hair keratin (which reflect dietary inputs over years and months, respectively) reveal isotopic changes that are consistent with a progressive dietary specialization on humans. These findings not only support the hypothesis that prey scarcity drives individual dietary specialization, but also demonstrate that sustained dietary individuality can exist within a cooperative framework. The intensity of human predation (up to 30% reliance during the final months of 1898) is also associated with severe craniodental infirmities, which may have further promoted the inclusion of unconventional prey under perturbed environmental conditions.},

abstract={Aggression is a topic that has been much investigated in behavioural research. Despite the large number of publications dealing with this subject, many aspects are still not understood. The present review focuses on both the bio-social and the physiological regulation of aggression and its valid models. Recent studies have provided new endocrine and neurophysiological insights into the underlying mechanisms. In the past, the steroid hormone testosterone (T) was believed to be the main endocrine activator of aggressive behaviour and its expression rate. However, the importance of T seems to lie in its neuromodulatory function, especially in the regulation of overall dominance and competitive aggression. In turn, unrestrained aggression, impulsivity and risk-taking behaviour are associated with low central serotonergic activity. Other centrally active molecules,such as vasopressin or dopamine are also key players in mediating aggressiveness. In a social context, aggression is mostly applied in competitive processes to get access to limited resources such as food and mating partners, or for the defence of resources. Intriguingly, diverse forms of aggression are probably triggered by environmental factors such as the availability and quality of food. This review investigates both availability and quality of food, with regard to their influence on anti-social behaviours in a variety of species and tries to work out their potential function as neurophysiological modulators. Furthermore, unresolved methodological issues concerning the central activity of nutritional factors will be discussed. © CAB International 2009.},

abstract={The food available to coccinellid larvae and their exposure to predation is influenced by where they are placed as eggs. This review examines adult distribution and female oviposition strategies which in turn determine the distribution of coccinellid larvae in habitats. Immigration into a habitat can be influenced by visual and olfactory cues related to habitat quality. Adults are retained in a habitat if sufficient food resources are present. The abundance and quality of food in a habitat affects the reproductive output of a female and survival of larvae. Consequently, there is higher retention and oviposition preference for sites with abundant essential prey. Coccinellids also increase reproduction in response to non-prey foods (i.e., pollen), but avoid ovipositing in areas with copious amounts of honeydew. In laboratory studies, many plant-derived chemicals have been demonstrated to be attractants and oviposition stimulants. The need to place eggs in proximity to food for offspring must be weighed against the risk of cannibalism and intraguild predation. Lady beetles avoid egg predation by reducing oviposition where other adults are present, ovipositing on plants associated with less exposure or incidence of intraguild predation, and avoiding areas with tracks and frass of con- and heterospecific larvae. Indeed, deterrent cues for avoiding predation seem stronger than the positive ones associated with food. An understanding of the resources needed for successful reproduction and larval development in a habitat and the sensory cues that signal these resources, and thus elicit oviposition, may enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms affecting coccinellid distribution in habitats.},

abstract={Sex differences in spatial learning are found in many species of mammals and even in invertebrates. Results from laboratory mouse studies, however, have been inconsistent in comparison to studies of humans, laboratory rats and wild rodent species. Here we re-examined this question in C57BL/6J mice that were exposed to enriched environments using two tasks, an object recognition task and a place learning task where mice were motivated by exploratory drive, not aversive conditioning or food restriction. Using these methods, we found a female advantage for object recognition, similar to the female advantage found in humans and laboratory rats. In the place learning task, male performance was unimpaired by intra-maze cue deletion but impaired by extra-maze cue masking. Female mice, in contrast, were able to navigate accurately under both cue conditions. In summary, by utilizing testing and housing methods that were more species appropriate, we found sex-specific patterns of cue encoding and place learning in better accordance with prior results from other mammalian species. The implication of these results is that the C57BL/6J mouse is an appropriate model for the study of cognitive sex differences in mammals.},

abstract={Vigilance is thought to have evolved as an antipredator defense but, in primates, conspecific threat often better explains this behavior. We examined vigilance in one group of Colobus vellerosus inhabiting the Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary in Ghana. We aimed to (1) describe factors affecting vigilance in this population, and (2) examine the importance of predation avoidance and conspecific threat in explaining vigilance patterns. Because of a male takeover preceding the study, our focal group (B2) consisted of six adult males and three adult females. We collected 490 10-min focal samples (82 hr) from all adults in the group (N = 9) from July to November, 2001. To avoid predators, individuals should be more vigilant (i) with fewer neighbors, and (ii) in areas of the canopy with higher predation risks. Conspecific threats can be divided into extra- and intra-group threats. Extra-group threats should lead to higher vigilance levels (iii) during intergroup encounters, and (iv) in areas where the home range overlaps with other groups of colobus. Intra-group threats should lead to greater vigilance (v) in the presence of neighbors and (vi) while feeding or occupying food patches (if resources are limiting). Our results best support the hypothesis that vigilance functions primarily to detect extra-group, conspecific threats. Individuals were most vigilant during intergroup encounters and in areas of range overlap, and monthly vigilance rates were associated with monthly encounter rates. Individuals tended to scan less in proximity to familiar vs. unfamiliar group mates, suggesting that relationship quality may affect colobus vigilance. Finally, predation pressures or anthropogenic disturbances might have influenced vigilance, as individuals were more vigilant low in the canopy. However, this last result could also be due to the lower visibility because of dense foliage or to the fact that the monkeys have access to fewer escape routes when ranging lower in the canopy. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={1. Foraging decisions by herbivores depend on variation in food types, the scale(s) at which this variation occurs and the opportunity and capacity for herbivores to respond to such variation. These decisions affect not only the herbivores themselves, but also the vulnerability of individual plants to being eaten. Associational plant refuges, in which neighbouring plants alter focal plant vulnerability, are an emergent property of foraging decisions. 2. Using the red-bellied pademelon (Thylogale billardierii) as a model generalist mammalian herbivore, we investigated the spatial scale(s) at which animals made foraging decisions and the resultant effect on focal plant vulnerability. In a replicated design, we varied vegetation at the individual plant scale, generating intraspecific differences in Eucalyptus nitens seedlings by altering their nutrient status (high, low). We varied vegetation at the patch scale, in which seedlings were planted, using high- (grass) and low- (herbicided) quality patches. Animals were allowed to choose where they fed and what they ate. Animal behaviour was recorded and intake of seedlings measured. 3. We found that animals made foraging decisions first at the patch scale then at the scale of individual plants; both patch and focal seedling characteristics influenced browsing. Pademelons spent most of their time in high-quality patches, and seedlings were consequently more vulnerable there than in low-quality patches. Pademelons also ate more foliage from high- than from low-nutrient status seedlings. This behaviour concentrated resources, increasing foraging efficiency and making focal plants more vulnerable to browsing. 4. The opportunity and capacity to choose at both plant and patch scales resulted in a pattern of focal plant vulnerability consistent with the repellent-plant hypothesis. This contrasts with our previous study, in which animals were only provided with choice at the plant level and plant vulnerability followed the attractant-decoy hypothesis. These combined results demonstrate that the influence of neighbouring vegetation on consumption of a focal plant depends on the spatial scale of selection and on opportunities (and capacity) for herbivores to choose. © 2009 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been suggested to associate with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. The present study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that EPA and DHA increase oxidative stress and hemorrhage volume in rats with intracerebral hemorrhagic (ICH) stroke. Thirty-five-week-old male rats were fed an American Institute of Nutrition-93M diet containing 0% (n = 27), 0.5% (n = 15), or 1% EPA + DHA of total energy for 5 weeks. Of 5 rats fed 1% EPA + DHA (41%), 5 died because of excessive bleeding within 12 hours after ICH surgery. Behavior test score and hemorrhage volume were significantly (P < .05) greater in the 1% EPA + DHA-fed rats than in other rats. Magnetic resonance imaging consistently showed that edema and bleeding were visible in only the rats fed 1% EPA + DHA. Levels of superoxide dismutase and glutathione were significantly (P < .05) lower in rats fed 0.5% and 1% EPA + DHA than those fed 0% EPA + DHA. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance content was significantly (P < .05) higher in 1% EPA + DHA-fed rats than in 0% and 0.5% EPA + DHA-fed rats. The level of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine was significantly (P < .05) higher in ICH rats with all diets than in sham surgery rats. Brain levels of EPA and DHA were highest in rats fed 1% EPA + DHA than in rats fed 0% and 0.5% EPA + DHA. These results suggested that intake of 1% EPA + DHA of total energy could lead to oxidative damage to the brain and thus increase the risk of intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke in this rat model. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Interactions among parents, offspring and the environment are a critical aspect of parental care. Begging by offspring usually results in increased parental provisioning. Yet, parents also vary their behaviours to reduce offspring predation. Both begging sounds and provisioning activity can increase risk of nest predation. We predicted in a high nest-predation environment, parents would satiate young and reduce begging by increasing food load but maintaining the same provisioning rates. We also assessed whether increased begging was beneficial to offspring and whether parents changed the allocation of food to particular nestlings. We increased whole-brood begging via playbacks at nests of a tropical passerine bird, the western slaty antshrike, Thamnophilus atrinucha. We observed that parents increased provisioning rates and reduced food load in response to elevated begging. Selection may therefore favour feeding hungry nestlings even when predation risk is elevated, or begging sounds may place offspring at a higher risk than increased activity. Parents reduced the time between arrival to the nest and feeding of nestlings, potentially to reduce begging sounds. Exaggerated begging did not appear to be beneficial to offspring since parents did not deliver more food. Parents switched to preferentially feed the closest offspring during the begging treatment. This suggests that, under elevated begging, parents either allowed sibling competition to influence feeding decisions, or fed the closer nestling to reduce the time between arrival to the nest and feeding. Studying species in different environments provides insight into how ecological factors such as nest predation influence parental behaviour. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Differences in bold and shy personality on sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax were investigated between a population (wild) produced from wild-brood fish and a population (selected) produced from selected-brood fish. During the experiment (112 days), fish were reared under self-feeding condition to characterize the feeding behaviour of each individual fish. Three risk-taking tests (T1, T2 and T3 of 24 h with day-night alternation) were carried out at > 1 month intervals on 180 fish of each strain in order to monitor D. labrax behaviour over time and in relation to the light:dark period. A risk-taking score was evaluated via a preference choice between a safe zone (without food) and a risky zone (potentially with food) by recording the number and the duration of individual passages through an opening in an opaque divider. Results showed that fish performed passages preferentially during the night period and that wild fish were generally bolder than selected fish during T1 and T2 but showed a decrease in risk taking during T3, contrary to selected fish which showed a constant increase in their risk-taking behaviour. The phenotypic characteristics of the bold fish were different in the two strains: wild bold fish were the smallest within the wild strain and selected bold fish presented the higher growth rate within the selected strain. For both strains, these bold fish were also generally characterized by a high feed-demand activity. Fish hunger state thus seemed to be the highest motivation for risk-taking behaviour under the present conditions. Furthermore, behavioural variations over tests such as higher risk taking (number of passages) and faster exploratory responses (higher score emergence) could be interpreted as relevant indicators of the learning process and habituation. According to the results, however, no real difference in coping strategy between strains could be observed at this first stage of domestication and selection. © 2009 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

abstract={Background:Peritoneal dialysis is used more and more as treatment of substitution of the end stage renal disease at the old subjects of more than 65 years and its effectiveness and its good tolerance were shown. Aims:To study the epidemiological and clinical profile of these patients, the indication and the advantages of PD, the various complications, the elements of prognostic and the survival of the patients and the technique. Methods:We made a retrospective study including a series of 13 old patients of more than 65 years and treaties by PD during the period extending from the 1983 /2/ 11 to the 2005/ 12/31. They are 10 men and 3 women on average of 70 ± 3, 1 year and representing 3, 62 % of the totality of the patients. The diabetic and vascular nephropathies represent the first cause of ESRD. Results:The PD was used of first intention at 53,84 % of the patients whose majority suffers from a malnutrition due to advanced age, anorexia, psychological disorders, bad dental state and uraemia. The cardiovascular complications are frequent in this age bracket explaining heavy morbidity. The pulmonary and urinary infectious complications are also frequent. The more frequent peritonitis compared to the literature, are comparable between the 2 age brackets < and = with 65 years and the mode of PD (APD or CAPD). The time separating the beginning from PD and which has occurred of the peritonitis is shorter in APD. The lesions of renal osteodystrophy are found among 6 patients: 3 cases of hyperparathyroidism and 3 cases of adynamic osteopathy The return in HD is rare due to dysfunction of the catheter.The survival of the patients is 92, 8 % at 1 year and 60, 8 % at 5 years; that of the technique is worse with 88, 3 % at 1 year and 33, 7 % at 5 years Eight patients died (61, 5 %) because of cardiovascular diseases and of the infections. We found a correlation statistically significant between the survival of the patients and the mode of PD, on the other hand any correlation was not found with the age or the sex. The survival of the technique is not correlated to a significant degree with the age, the sex and the mode of PD. Conclusion: Peritoneal dialysis is used of first intention at more half of the old subjects and remains a last recourse for haemodialysis which have an initially vascular problem. The family support and the good nurse allow these patients to adhere well to the technique. The cardiovascular diseases and the infections are responsible for heavy morbi-mortality. The survival of the technique is worse than that of the patients.},

abstract={When searching for prey, animals should maximize energetic gain, while minimizing energy expenditure by altering their movements relative to prey availability. However, with increasing amounts of marine debris, what once may have been optimal' foraging strategies for top marine predators, are leading to sub-optimal diets comprised in large part of plastic. Indeed, the highly vagile Laysan albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) which forages throughout the North Pacific, are well known for their tendency to ingest plastic. Here we examine whether Laysan albatrosses nesting on Kure Atoll and Oahu Island, 2,150 km apart, experience different levels of plastic ingestion. Twenty two geolocators were deployed on breeding adults for up to two years. Regurgitated boluses of undigestable material were also collected from chicks at each site to compare the amount of plastic vs. natural foods. Chicks from Kure Atoll were fed almost ten times the amount of plastic compared to chicks from Oahu despite boluses from both colonies having similar amounts of natural food. Tracking data indicated that adults from either colony did not have core overlapping distributions during the early half of the breeding period and that adults from Kure had a greater overlap with the putative range of the Western Garbage Patch corroborating our observation of higher plastic loads at this colony. At-sea distributions also varied throughout the year suggesting that Laysan albatrosses either adjusted their foraging behavior according to constraints on time away from the nest or to variation in resources. However, in the non-breeding season, distributional overlap was greater indicating that the energy required to reach the foraging grounds was less important than the total energy available. These results demonstrate how a marine predator that is not dispersal limited alters its foraging strategy throughout the reproductive cycle to maximize energetic gain and how this has led to differences in plastic ingestion. © 2009 Young et al.},

abstract={Molecular details of ion channel interactions with modulatory subunits have been investigated widely in transfected cells, but the physiological roles of ion channel modulatory protein complexes in native neurons remain largely unexplored. The Drosophila largeconductance calcium-activated potassium channel (dSlo) binds to and is modulated by its binding partner Slob. We have constructed flies in which Slob expression is manipulated by P-element mutagenesis, or by transgenic expression of Slob protein or Slob-RNAi. In vivo recordings of both macroscopic and single dSlo channel currents in identified neurosecretory neurons in the pars intercerebralis (PI) region of the Drosophila brain reveal that whole-cell potassium current and properties of single dSlo channels are modulated by Slob expression level. Furthermore, Slob genotype influences action potential duration in vivo. This unprecedented combination of current-clamp, macroscopic-current, and single-channel recordings from neurons in brains of living flies defines a critical role for an ion channel modulatory protein complex in the control of neuronal excitability. We show further that Slob-null flies exhibit significantly longer lifespan than controls under conditions of complete food deprivation. Crosses with deficiency lines demonstrate that this enhanced resistance to starvation-induced death maps close to the slob locus. Together, these results indicate that Slob may serve a novel regulatory function in feeding behavior, possibly by influencing the excitability of the PI neurons.

abstract={The baby boom generation is approaching the age of greatest risk for cognitive impairment and dementia. There is growing interest in strategies to modify the environment in midlife to increase the probability of maintaining cognitive health in late life. Several potentially modifiable risk factors have been studied in relation to cognitive impairment and dementia in late life, but methodological limitations of observational research have resulted in some inconsistencies across studies. The most promising strategies are maintaining cardiovascular health, engaging in mental, physical, and social activities, using alcohol in moderation, abstaining from tobacco use, and following a heart-healthy diet. Other factors that may influence cognitive health are occupational attainment, depression, personality, exposure to general anesthesia, head injury, postmenopausal hormone therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and nutritional supplements such as antioxidants. Some long-term observational studies initiated in midlife or earlier, and some randomized controlled trials, have examined the effects of specific cognitive health promotion behaviors in midlife on the risk of cognitive impairment in late life. Overall, these studies provide limited support for risk reduction at this time. Recommendations and challenges for developing effective strategies to reduce the burden of cognitive impairment and dementia in the future are discussed. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.},

abstract={The light/dark test is based on the innate aversion of rodents to brightly illuminated areas and on the spontaneous exploratory behaviour of the animals, applying mild stressors, i.e. novel environment and light. The test apparatus consists of a small dark secure compartment (one-third) and a large illuminated aversive compartment (two-thirds). The test was developed with male mice. The strain, weight and age may be crucial factors. The extent to which an anxiolytic compound can facilitate the exploratory activity depends on the baseline level in the control group. Differences between the type and severity of external stressors might account for variable results reported by different laboratories. The light-dark test may be useful to predict anxiolytic-like or anxiogenic-like activity in mice. Transitions have been reported to be an index of activity exploration because of habituation over time and the time spent in each compartment to be a reflection of aversion. Classic anxiolytics (benzodiazepines) as well as the newer anxiolytic-like compounds (e.g. serotonergic drugs or drugs acting on neuropeptides receptors) can be detected using this paradigm. It has the advantages of being quick and easy to use, without requiring the prior training of animals. © 2009 Humana Press.},

abstract={The term «Cannibalism» is a linguistic distortion resulting from Arawak terminology (Amerindians in the Antilles) caribal that means courageous. Columbus uses it to describe Caribbean Indians identified as eaters of human flesh. Cannibalism behavior is widespread in the animal kingdom. It has occurred in human society since the paleolithic and many typologies of cannibalism have recently been described. Identifying the evolutionary causes and benefits of cannibalism in animal populations may provide information about its taxonomic diversity. In general cannibalism is favored by ecological factors related to the low availability of alternative food. It may also depend to varying degrees upon population density. Social factors, like competition for mates and offspring parental care when food is scare may also promote cannibalism behavior. Significant nutritional and energy benefits combined to a territorial advantage were provided by cannibalism. For many species cannibalism can strongly affect population dynamics and mortality rates with enhancing the risk of infection from parasites and viruses.},

abstract={Peptide YY (PYY) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) have been proposed to participate in the control of energy homeostasis. Since these activities show circadian variations, we explored the circadian pattern of locomotor, exploratory and ingestive behaviour in male and/or female mice with disrupted genes for PYY (PYY-/-), NPY (NPY-/-) as well as PYY plus NPY (PYY + NPY-/-). The effect of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.1 mg/kg intraperitoneally) on these behaviours was also examined. The animals were housed singly in cages fitted with sensors for water and food intake and two infrared frames for recording ambulation and rearing under a 12 h light/dark cycle for 4 days. Locomotor and exploratory behaviour was decreased in female NPY-/- as well as male and female PYY + NPY-/- mice during the photo- and scotophase, and in male PYY-/- mice during the scotophase. Significant decreases in water and food intake were seen in female NPY-/- as well as male and female PYY + NPY-/- mice during the photophase. The effect of LPS to attenuate ingestive behaviour during the light and/or dark phase was most pronounced in PYY-/- and NPY-/- mice. These findings attest to a circadian cycle- and gender-related role of NPY and PYY in the control of behaviours that balance energy intake and energy expenditure.

abstract={Exposure to flavors in the amniotic fluid and mother's milk derived from the maternal diet has been shown to modulate food preferences and neophobia of young animals of several species. Aim of the experiment was to study the effects of pre- and postnatal flavor exposure on behavior of piglets during (re)exposure to this flavor. Furthermore, we investigated whether varying stress levels, caused by different test settings, affected behavior of animals during (re)exposure. Piglets were exposed to anisic flavor through the maternal diet during late gestation and/or during lactation or never. Piglets that were prenatally exposed to the flavor through the maternal diet behaved differently compared with unexposed pigs during reexposure to the flavor in several tests, suggesting recognition of the flavor. The differences between groups were more pronounced in tests with relatively high stress levels. This suggests that stress levels, caused by the design of the test, can affect the behavior shown in the presence of the flavor. We conclude that prenatal flavor exposure affects behaviors of piglets that are indicative of recognition and that these behaviors are influenced by stress levels during (re)exposure. © The Author 2009.

abstract={Background: The outbreak of the pandemic flu, Influenza A H1N1 (Swine Flu) in early 2009, provided a major challenge to health services around the world. Previous pandemics have led to stockpiling of goods, the victimisation of particular population groups, and the cancellation of travel and the boycotting of particular foods (e.g. pork). We examined initial behavioural and attitudinal responses towards Influenza A, H1N1 ("Swine flu") in the six days following the WHO pandemic alert level 5, and regional differences in these responses. Methods: 328 respondents completed a cross-sectional Internet or paper-based questionnaire study in Malaysia (N = 180) or Europe (N = 148). Measures assessed changes in transport usage, purchase of preparatory goods for a pandemic, perceived risk groups, indicators of anxiety, assessed estimated mortality rates for seasonal flu, effectiveness of seasonal flu vaccination, and changes in pork consumption. Results: 26% of the respondents were 'very concerned' about being a flu victim (42% Malaysians, 5% Europeans, p < .001). 36% reported reduced public transport use (48% Malaysia, 22% Europe, p < .001), 39% flight cancellations (56% Malaysia, 17% Europe, p < .001). 8% had purchased preparatory materials (e.g. face masks: 8% Malaysia, 7% Europe), 41% Malaysia (15% Europe) intended to do so (p < .001). 63% of Europeans, 19% of Malaysians had discussed the pandemic with friends (p < .001). Groups seen as at 'high risk' of infection included the immune compromised (mentioned by 87% respondents), pig farmers (70%), elderly (57%), prostitutes/highly sexually active (53%), and the homeless (53%). In data collected only in Europe, 64% greatly underestimated the mortality rates of seasonal flu, 26% believed seasonal flu vaccination gave protection against swine flu. 7% had reduced/stopped eating pork. 3% had purchased anti-viral drugs for use at home, while 32% intended to do so if the pandemic worsened. Conclusion: Initial responses to Influenza A show large regional differences in anxiety, with Malaysians more anxious and more likely to reduce travel and to buy masks and food. Discussions with family and friends may reinforce existing anxiety levels. Particular groups (homosexuals, prostitutes, the homeless) are perceived as at greater risk, potentially leading to increased prejudice during a pandemic. Europeans underestimated mortality of seasonal flu, and require more information about the protection given by seasonal flu inoculation. © 2009 Goodwin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Food consumption, number of movements and feeding hierarchy of juvenile transgenic common carp Cyprinus carpio and their size-matched non-transgenic conspecifics were measured under conditions of limited food supply. Transgenic fish exhibited 73·3% more movements as well as a higher feeding order, and consumed 1·86 times as many food pellets as their non-transgenic counterparts. After the 10 day experiment, transgenic C. carpio had still not realized their higher growth potential, which may be partly explained by the higher frequency of movements of transgenics and the 'sneaky' feeding strategy used by the non-transgenics. The results indicate that these transgenic fish possess an elevated ability to compete for limited food resources, which could be advantageous after an escape into the wild. It may be that other factors in the natural environment (i.e. predation risk and food distribution), however, would offset this advantage. Thus, these results need to be assessed with caution. © 2009 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

abstract={Animal prey has developed a variety of behavioural strategies to avoid predation. Many fish species form shoals in the open water or seek refuge in structurally complex habitats. Since anti-predator strategies bear costs and are energy-demanding, we hypothesised that the nutritional state of prey should modify the performance level and efficiency of such strategies. In aquaria either containing or lacking a structured refuge habitat, well-fed or food-deprived juvenile roach (Rutilus rutilus) were exposed to an open-water predator (pikeperch, Sander lucioperca). Controls were run without predators. In the presence of the predator, roach enhanced the performance of the anti-predator strategy and increased the use of the refuge habitat whereby food-deprived roach were encountered more often in the structure than well-fed roach. Nonetheless more starved than well-fed roach were fed upon by the predator. In the treatments offering only open-water areas, roach always formed dense shoals in the presence of the predator. The shoal density, however, was lower in starved roach. Starving fish in shoals experienced the highest predation mortality across all experimental treatments. The experiment confirmed the plasticity of the anti-predator behaviour in roach and demonstrated that food deprivation diminished the efficiency of shoaling more strongly than the efficiency of hiding. The findings may be relevant to spatial distribution of prey and predator-prey interactions under natural conditions because when prey are confronted with phases of reduced resource availability, flexible anti-predator strategies may lead to dynamic habitat use patterns. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Fishes are often subjected to seasonal and spatial patchiness of food sources. We tested how risk-taking behaviour in the six-lined trumpeter, an estuarine seagrass resident fish, changed with hunger level in a laboratory experiment. When repeatedly offered a risky source of food, well-fed fish did not approach it and all fish survived over a one-month trial. In contrast, fish deprived of all food boldly first approached the risky food source after only a few days without food in some cases, or after many days in other cases, and then continued to approach risky food each time it was presented. Larger individuals were more bold (and had longer starvation endurance) than smaller ones, and after statistically controlling for these size effects, there were consistent individual differences in the propensity to take risks (i.e. boldness). These results show that food- and individual-dependent boldness will together affect vulnerability to predators and influence predation rates when resources become scarce. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract={The increase in the incidence of obesity and eating disorders has promoted research aimed at understanding the aetiology of abnormal eating behaviours. Apart from metabolic factors, obesity is caused by overeating. Clinical reports have led to the suggestion that some individuals may develop addictive-like behaviours when consuming palatable foods, and compulsive eating plays a similar dominant role in obesity as compulsive drug taking does in drug addiction. The progress made in the development of treatment strategies for obesity is limited, in part, because the physiological and neurological causes and consequences of compulsive eating behaviour are not clearly understood and cannot readily be studied in human subjects. We have developed experimental approaches that reflect the functioning of the components of eating control, including compulsive food taking in rats. Rats that are given free choice between standard chow and a palatable, chocolate-containing 'Cafeteria Diet' (CD) develop distinct signs of compulsive food taking that appear at an early stage. These include the inability to adapt intake behaviour in periods of limited or bitter-tasting CD access, continued food intake during resting phases and changes in fine structure of feeding (duration, distribution and recurrence of feeding bouts). The model will help examine the neurobiological underpinnings of compulsive food seeking and food taking and provides a possibility to study the effects of novel anti-obesity compounds on compulsive eating and other components of food-taking behaviour in detail. For future use of genetic models, the possibility of a transfer to a mouse was discussed. © 2009 Society for the Study of Addiction.},

abstract={Dog diets may differ in their effectiveness of maintaining satiety after a meal. Consequently, sensations of hunger, feeding motivation, physical activity, and sensitivity to environmental stressors may be increased. Dietary fibre may be effective in prolonging postprandial satiety depending on type and inclusion level. This study evaluated the effect of fibre fermentability on behaviour in dogs. Sixteen healthy adult dogs were housed individually and fed a low-fermentable fibre (LFF) diet containing 8.5% cellulose or a high-fermentable fibre (HFF) diet containing 8.5% sugar beet pulp and 2% inulin. Dogs were fed two equal portions at 8:30 and 18:30 according to energy requirements. Behaviour of dogs in their home-cage was recorded and analyzed by instantaneous scan sampling (2 × 24 h with 15 min intervals) and focal sampling continuous recordings (10 min per animal per hour, from 9:00 until 18:00). Dogs were subjected to a behaviour test composed of the subtests open-field, sudden-silence, novel-object, and acoustic-startle. The behavioural responses of each dog were recorded. Scores for the scan and focal samples were expressed per clock hour and DIET × TIME effects were tested statistically using Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML). Data from the tests were examined using principal component analysis resulting in the compilation of two components. Data were tested statistically for DIET and DIET × SUBTEST effects using REML. Variables specific for the open-field and novel-object test were analyzed using analysis of variance. For the scans, a significant DIET × TIME effect was found for resting. At night and in the morning, HFF dogs rested more compared to LFF dogs, but they rested less between 14:00 and 17:00. For the continuous recordings, the main findings were a tendency for DIET × TIME effect for time spent resting with a pattern consistent with that for the scans. The interaction was significant for inactive-alert (lie with head up or sitting) with HFF-fed dogs having lower values around 10:00-11:00 and higher values hereafter. Finally, time spent tail wagging was significantly higher for LFF-fed dogs just before the evening meal that may indicate higher level of arousal. For the behaviour tests, no significant DIET or DIET × SUBTEST effects were detected. It is concluded that compared to the LFF diet, the HFF diet increased inactivity in kennelled beagle dogs likely through the prolongation of postprandial satiety. This effect did not change the reaction to stressful events in kennelled laboratory dogs. Enhanced susceptibility to environmental stressors at times of hunger in sensitive companion dogs may occur but requires further study. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Like many trophically transmitted parasites, the trematode Microphallus papillorobustus alters the behavior of its intermediate host, the crustacean gammarid Gammarus insensibilis, in a way that favors its vulnerability to definitive hosts (aquatic birds). Parasitized females still produce eggs, but because juvenile development occurs inside the female marsupial brood pouch, young gammarids are subject to the same risk of predation as their mothers until they exit the marsupium. We explored the idea that developing juveniles can adjust their developmental schedule in a state-dependent manner according to the parasitic status of the mother. We predicted that juveniles from parasitized females would accelerate their development, or exit the marsupium at an earlier stage, to avoid predation by birds. Contrary to our expectations, we observed the opposite, that is, juveniles from parasitized females exited the marsupial brood pouch significantly later than those from uninfected mothers. We discuss these results in relation to current ideas on host manipulation by parasites in ecosystems.},

abstract={Within phylogenetic limits reproductive characteristics of a given species may vary between populations in response to ecological and social factors. For instance, in environments where high quality nutrition is readily available, the onset and speed of reproduction are often accelerated. Other influencing factors might be maternal experience or the sex of the infant. Here we present data on reproductive characteristics for the silvered leaf monkey (Trachypithecus cristatus), a medium-sized Asian colobine housed at the Wildlife Conservation Society's Bronx Zoo as a one-male group. To place the species into an appropriate phylogenetic context, we limited our comparison to other colobine species. Demographic data span 21.4 years (October 1985 to March 2007) and derive from 30 adult females (128.0 female years). Detailed behavioral data stem from a 2.2 years study (November 2002 to January 2005; 734 days, 4,225hr). As in other Asian colobines, receptive periods were short (mean54.3 days, n568). This is expected for one-male groups where receptivity likely indicates, rather than conceals, ovulation. Gestation length was estimated based on a change in the pattern of sexual behavior (mean5194.6 days, n57). It fell within the range reported for the taxon. Births occurred year round, at an early age (mean52.9 years, n58), at short intervals (mean514.9 months, n559) in combination with a short lactation (mean 12.1 months, n59) likely due to the nearly unlimited availability of nutrition in this zoo setting. Primiparous females tended to have a longer first interbirth interval but infant survival rates were similar to multipara possibly due to the absence of predators. Maternal investment was independent of the infant's sex and birth sex ratio was even. Our results emphasize that when interpreted with caution, zoo populations yield realistic reproductive characteristics that can help fill the gap in our knowledge about colobine life history. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that youth who are homeless engage in high-risk behaviors. However, there has been little information published on nutritional and physical activity behaviors in this population, and studies comparing homeless youth in school with their non-homeless peers are scarce. This study compares weight-related risk behaviors of public high school students in Massachusetts based on homeless status. METHODS: We obtained data from 3264 9th through 12th grade students who participated in the 2005 Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Multivariable logistic regression, controlling for gender, grade, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation, was performed to assess the relationship between homeless status as defined by the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and weight-related indicators. Analyses were weighted and adjusted for the multistage complex sampling design. RESULTS: Of this sample, 4.2% reported being homeless (n = 152). Higher prevalence of homelessness was found among males, racial/ethnic minorities, sexual minorities, and students who were not in a traditional grade level. The distribution of body mass index was similar among students who were homeless and non-homeless (underweight 4.0 and 3.0%, and overweight 27.1 and 27.1%, respectively). Homeless students were more likely than non-homeless students to report disordered weight-control behaviors including fasting (aOR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4-4.5) and diet pill use (aOR 3.3, 95% CI 1.6-6.9). CONCLUSIONS: More than 4% of public high school students in Massachusetts meet the federal definition of homelessness. These students are at high risk for disordered weight-control behaviors. Policy decisions at the school, state, and federal levels should make a concerted effort to target these students with social services and nutritional interventions. © 2009, American School Health Association.},

abstract={The concept of fetal programming states that changes in the fetal environment during sensitive periods of organ development may cause long-lasting changes in the structure and functioning of these organs later in life and influence the risk for chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Fetal growth is a summary marker of the fetal environment and is reflected by relatively easy-to-obtain measures of size at birth such as birth weight. In the last two decades, a body of evidence emerged linking fetal growth with behavioural and mental health outcomes later in life. Cognitive functioning and behavioural problems in childhood, in particular inattention/hyperactivity, have been shown to be inversely related to fetal growth. Although results are mixed, risk for personality disorders and schizophrenia seems to be linked with fetal growth and adversity, while the evidence for mood disorders is weak. Vulnerability for psychopathology may also be influenced by prenatal adversity. There is evidence for associations of fetal growth with temperament in childhood as well as stress reactivity and distress. The associations of fetal growth with mental health later in life are potentially caused by specific prenatal factors such as maternal smoking, alcohol, toxins/drugs, nutrition, psychosocial stress and infection during pregnancy. The mechanisms likely involve changes in neurodevelopment and in the set point of neuroendocrine systems, and there is evidence that prenatal adversity interacts with genetic and postnatal environmental factors. Future studies should examine the effects of specific prenatal factors and attempt to disentangle genetic and prenatal environmental effects. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Objectives: To study the risk factors related to the development of aggressive behavior. Method: A search was carried out in two electronic databases, Medline and SciElo by retrospective studies, longitudinal and review that assessed risk factors for the development of aggressive behavior. Results: There were selected 11 longitudinal studies (8 prospective and 3 case-control studies) and a cross sectional study that evaluated the risk factors and socio-biological related to aggressive behavior. Five studies have evaluated gene expression, five evaluated exposure to tobacco, alcohol and cocaine in the prenatal period, one evaluated the effect of early malnutrition on the development of aggressive behavior and one assessed the impact of child maltreatment. Conclusion: The main biological factors were: genetic (low expression of the monoamine oxidase gene and serotonin transporter gene, variations in transporter and dopamine receptor genes), exposure to substances during intrauterine development (tobacco, alcohol and cocaine) and nutrition (malnutrition). The main environmental factors were: child abuse, poverty, crime and antisocial behavior in childhood, while the highest level of evidence was related to early neglect. The interaction between biological and environmental factors can be catalyzed by a hostile environment, increasing the risk for the development of aggressive behavior.},

abstract={The adaptive significance of learning is supported by studies showing its positive effects on mating behaviour, but they rarely go beyond fertilization success. Here we studied how learning contributes to qualitative reproductive investment, by testing the hypothesis that mating in the context that predicts male appearance has positive effects on female reproductive investment compared with unsignalled mating. Using Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), we found that effects of mating in the context predicting mating opportunity depend on female body condition and receptivity, while the outcome of unexpected mating depends on male behaviour. In particular, among females mated with the familiar male in the context predicting that he will appear, female condition positively affected the number of fertilized eggs and egg mass and more receptive females tended to produce more sons. Additionally, conditioned females laid heavier eggs for daughters than for sons. In contrast, in females that were mated unexpectedly and with a novel male, the number of fertilized eggs was highly dependent on male behaviour and was negatively related to maternal body condition. Egg mass was not related to body condition, and there were no indications of sex allocation. This is, to our knowledge, the first study demonstrating how female body condition and behaviour interact with the context of mating in shaping maternal reproductive investment. © 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract={The assumption that mortality risk increases with dispersal distance has rarely been tested. We compared patterns of natal dispersal in the American marten (Martes americana) between a large regenerating forest landscape and an uncut landscape that was dominated by more mature forest to test whether mortality risk increased with dispersal distance, and whether variation in mortality risk influenced dispersal distance. Mortality risk increased with dispersal distance in both landscape treatments, but the distancedependent increase in mortality in the regenerating landscape was twice that in the uncut landscape. Differences in body condition, supported by other data on foraging efficiency, suggested that juveniles from the regenerating landscape were less able to cope with the energetic demands of dispersal compared with juveniles from older forests. Juveniles travelled shorter distances in the regenerating versus uncut landscape. These results implied that dispersal was costly in terms of juvenile survival and that mean dispersal distance was shaped, in part, by mortality risk. © 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Behavioral changes of animal species can influence the consequence of population dynamics. One of the most remarkable behaviors of animal species is the aggregation by which species can reduce predation risk as a consequence of dilution or the other effects by forming a group. Empirical studies have demonstrated that an incompatibility exists in aggregation since resource competition might become severe at the cost of reducing predation pressure from predatory species. Parental care by supplying the food consumed by adults to their juveniles would reduce the mortality of juvenile due to starvation, but it would reduce the reproduction rate at the same time. In this paper, we study a class of stage-structured resource-consumer models to investigate the effect of behavioral changes on population dynamics. It is shown that under the presence of trade-off in parental care, moderate degrees of parental care will be favored as maximizing the equilibrium density of consumers. For consumer species having a long maturation period, consumer species might get benefit from dilution effects as a result of aggregation despite the elevated resource competition. Aggregation gives rise to two different outcomes in consumer extinction. Resource exhaustion as a consequence of over-exploitation can induce extinction of consumers due to Allee effects if aggregation strongly mediates juvenile survival. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The introduction of genome-wide association study (GWAS) and omics resulted in the development of nutrigenomics. The individual difference in the values of clinical chemistry is caused by the genetic polymorphisms, and the daily fluctuation of the values of an individual is controlled by clock gene. The products of genome via omic process start from transcriptome, proteome and then metabolome, and finally to phenome. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) is based on estimated average requirement {EAR: the intake enough to satisfy the need of 50% of the subjects) and the standard deviation (SD) obtained by balance studies of a large number of subjects. Usually, RDA (= EAR+2SD) is proposed to cover the nutritional requirement of 97.5% of the subjects. The same idea is also applied to the definition of reference range obtained by clinical chemistry, which is considered to be useful in differentiating normal subjects from those with diseases. However, nutrigenomics based on polymorphisms and clock genes covers wider areas than reference values and RDA do. The statistics of the reference ranges or RDAs assumes nearly normal distribution of the data, which is not always true for population composed of many individuals with different genetic polymorphisms including SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms). For example, the guideline recommends ethanol intake less than 20g/day, but some people with an SNP in aldehyde dehydrogenase become intoxicated by only 1g/day, while others with a different SNP can drink 200g/day without significant impaired performance. Moreover, nutrigenomics enables not only appropriate treatment but also prediction of the risk for prophylaxis by testing genetic polymorphism. C677T-TT, an SNP of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase found among 15% of the population, is associated with a 3.5-fold higher risk for stroke as compared to the wild type, and for TT, 400 μ g folic acid/day are needed, instead of RDA (240 μ g). Mental activity is supported by both clock and personality genes. RDA is determined by physical activity, but human nutrigenomics aims to optimize mental activity also. For this, the genes for both circadian activity and personality are important. RDA does not specify the timing of meals, but central and peripheral clock genes are regulated by morning light and breakfast, respectively. In order to implement nutrigenomics, the author developed a rapid, low-cost and simple on-site technique for genotyping SNPs suitable for one-day health check clinic. Thus, nutrigenomics became a new field of clinical chemistry which has merely been based on reference range obtained by averaging levels of a population that is, in reality, heterogeneous owing to gene polymorphisms and clock gene activity.},

abstract={We investigated temporal trends in some life-history traits of Atlantic herring. Population size of Newfoundland herring stock complexes declined precipitously through the 1970s. Maturation age and size also decreased substantially, but not until the late 1980s. Although significant effects were found for region and gear type, these were only minor compared with the general trend. No effects were found for sex. Changes in maturation age and size can represent an evolutionary response to fishery-induced selection, or phenotypic plasticity as a result of a compensatory response to stock declines, or a response to other changes in the environment. Length-at-age and body condition decreased concurrently with changes in maturation, suggesting that declines in maturation age and size were not a compensatory response to reduced stock sizes. This supports the hypothesis of evolutionary changes in maturation. However, increases observed in the most recent year classes, and concurrent changes in other species, suggest that changes in the environment may have also affected age- and size-at-maturation. © 2009 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

abstract={Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most resistant type of epilepsy. Currently available drugs for epilepsy are not antiepileptogenic. A novel treatment for epilepsy would be to block or reverse the process of epileptogenesis. We used intermittent feeding (IF) regimen of the dietary restriction (DR) to study its effect on epileptogenesis and neuroprotection in the pilocarpine model of TLE in rats. The effect of IF regimen on the induction of status epilepticus (SE), the duration of latent period, and the frequency, duration, severity and the time of occurrence of Spontaneous Recurrent Seizures (SRS) were investigated. We also studied the effect of IF regimen on hippocampal neurons against the excitotoxic damage of prolonged SE (about 4 h) induced by pilocarpine. The animals (Wistar, male, 200-250 g) were divided into four main groups: AL-AL (ad libitum diet throughout), AL-IF (PfS) [IF post-first seizure], AL-IF (PSE) [IF post-SE] and IF-IF (IF diet throughout), and two AL and IF control groups. SE was induced by pilocarpine (350 mg/kg, i.p.) and with diazepam (6 mg/kg, i.p.) injected after 3 h, the behavioral signs of SE terminated at about 4 h (AL animals, n = 29, 260.43 ± 8.74 min; IF animals, n = 19, 224.32 ± 20.73 min). Behavioral monitoring was carried out by 24 h video recording for 3 weeks after the first SRS. Rat brains were then prepared for histological study with Nissl stain and cell counting was done in CA1, CA2 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. The results show that the animals on IF diet had significantly less SE induction and significantly longer duration of latent period (the period of epileptogenesis) was seen in IF-IF group compared to the AL-AL group. The severity of SRS was significantly more in AL-IF (PfS) compared to the AL-IF (PSE) group. These results indicate that IF diet can make rats resistant to the induction of SE and can prolong the process of epileptogenesis. The results of the histological study show that the number of pyramidal neurons was statistically less in CA1, CA2 and CA3 of the hippocampus in the experimental groups compared to the control groups. However, IF regimen could not protect the hippocampal neurons against the excitotoxic injury caused by a prolonged SE. We conclude that IF regimen can significantly influence various behavioral characteristics of pilocarpine model of TLE. Further studies can elaborate the exact mechanisms as well as its possible role in the treatment of human TLE. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={There is some agreement in the food policy literature in that inception of genetic modification (GM) techniques in food production conveys both opportunities and risks which are found to differ across heterogeneous populations, which calls for a better understanding of behavioural responses to risk and benefit information . One of the major limitations of previous behavioural research lies in taking into account food values and trust in information sources in a way that causality is accounted for. This paper contributes to the literature by examining the behavioural process that drives individual's perceptions of GM food taking advantage of an empirical choice methodology that corrects for endogeneity in decision making relationships, namely structural equation modelling. We report the results of an empirical application to conceptualise food decision making in three specific Mediterranean countries, namely Spain, Italy and Greece. Our first major finding indicates that public attitudes toward GM food are being formed from a reasoning mechanism that departs from trust in science and in public authorities, ultimately determining consumer's final purchasing decisions. Our second important finding suggests marked differences in the reasoning mechanism that lead to the acceptance of GM food in the three countries examined suggesting different food communication strategies to each culture. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Iron deficiency (ID) is the most prevalent worldwide nutritional deficiency. Groups at risk of developing ID anemia are infants and pregnant women, even in industrialized countries. Our goal in this study was to evaluate the long-term consequences of maternal ID on the offspring's fatty acid and eicosanoid metabolism, behavior, and spatial memory. Female guinea pigs consumed iron-sufficient (IS) and -deficient (ID) diets for 14 d before mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation. Dietary iron restriction resulted in ID in pregnant females. On postnatal d 9, all offspring (ID and IS) were weaned to the IS diet and at 42 d, all offspring were iron replete. Locomotion was tested in pups on postnatal d 24 and 40 and spatial memory from d 25 to 40. Pups from the ID group were significantly more active in the open field at both times of testing, whereas spatial memory, tested in a Morris water maze, was comparable in both groups. On postnatal d 42, liver, RBC, and brain fatty acid composition were measured. Dihomogammalinolenic [20:3(n-6)], docosapentaenoic [22:5(n-3)], and docosahexaenoic [22:6(n-3)] acid contents were significantly higher in brain phospholipids of offspring born to ID dams. Prostaglandin E2 and F2α concentrations were also significantly higher in brains of offspring born to ID dams. This demonstrates that moderate ID during gestation and lactation results in alterations of brain fatty acid and eicosanoid metabolism and perturbation in behavior in adult offspring. © 2009 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={The effects of inducible defenses and constitutive defenses on population dynamics were investigated in a freshwater plankton system with rotifers as predators and different algal strains as prey. We made predictions for these systems using a chemostat predator-prey model and focused on population stability and predator persistence as a function of flow-through rate. The model exhibits three major types of behavior at a high nutrient concentration: (1) at high dilution rates, only algae exist; (2) at intermediate dilution rates, algae and rotifers show stable coexistence; (3) at low dilution rates, large population fluctuations occur, with low minimum densities entailing a risk of stochastic rotifer extinctions. The size and location of the corresponding areas in parameter space critically depend on the type of algal defense strategy. In an 83-day high-nutrient chemostat experiment we changed the dilution rate every 3 weeks, from 0.7 to 0.5 to 0.3 to 0.1 per day. Within this range of dilution rates, rotifers and algae coexisted, and population fluctuations of algae clearly increased as dilution rates decreased. The CV of herbivore densities was highest at the end of the experiment, when the dilution rate was low. On day 80, herbivorous rotifers had become undetectable in all three chemostats with permanently defended algae (where rotifer densities had already been low) and in two out of three chemostats where rotifers had been feeding on algae with inducible defenses (that represented more edible food). We interpret our results in relation to the paradox of enrichment. © The Ecological Society of Japan 2009.},

abstract={The costs and benefits of anti-predator behavioral responses should be functions of the actual risk of predation, the availability of the prey's resources, and the physiological state of the prey. For example, a food-stressed individual risks starvation when hiding from predators, while a well-fed organism can better afford to hide (and pay the cost of not foraging). Similarly, the benefits of resource acquisition are probably highest for the prey in the poorest state, while there may be diminishing returns for prey nearing satiation. Empirical studies of state-dependent behavior are only beginning, however, and few studies have investigated interactions between all three potentially important factors. Here I present the results of a laboratory experiment where I manipulated the physiological state of pond snails (Physa gyrina), the abundance of algal resources, and predation cues (Belostoma flumineum waterbugs consuming snails) in a full factorial design to assess their direct effects on snail behavior and indirect effects on algal biomass. On average, snails foraged more when resources were abundant, and when predators were absent. Snails also foraged more when previously exposed to physiological stress. Snails spent more time at the water's surface (a refuging behavior) in the presence of predation cues on average, but predation, resource levels, and prey state had interactive effects on refuge use. There was a consistent positive trait-mediated indirect effect of predators on algal biomass, across all resource levels and prey states. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We present an individual-based predator-prey model with, for the first time, each agent behavior being modeled by a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM), allowing the evolution of the agent behavior through the epochs of the simulation. The FCM enables the agent to evaluate its environment (e.g., distance to predator or prey, distance to potential breeding partner, distance to food, energy level) and its internal states (e.g., fear, hunger, curiosity), and to choose several possible actions such as evasion, eating, or breeding. The FCM of each individual is unique and is the result of the evolutionary process. The notion of species is also implemented in such a way that species emerge from the evolving population of agents. To our knowledge, our system is the only one that allows the modeling of links between behavior patterns and speciation. The simulation produces a lot of data, including number of individuals, level of energy by individual, choice of action, age of the individuals, and average FCM associated with each species. This study investigates patterns of macroevolutionary processes, such as the emergence of species in a simulated ecosystem, and proposes a general framework for the study of specific ecological problems such as invasive species and species diversity patterns. We present promising results showing coherent behaviors of the whole simulation with the emergence of strong correlation patterns also observed in existing ecosystems. © 2009 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract={Background: The neonatal brain is particularly vulnerable to imbalances in redox homeostasis because of rapid growth and immature antioxidant systems. Vitamin C has been shown to have a key function in the brain, and during states of deficiency it is able to retain higher concentrations of vitamin C than other organs. However, because neurons maintain one of the highest intracellular concentrations of vitamin C in the organism, the brain may still be more sensitive to deficiency despite these preventive measures. Objective: The objective was to study the potential link between chronic vitamin C deficiency and neuronal damage in newborn guinea pigs. Design: Thirty 6- to 7-d-old guinea pigs were randomly assigned to 2 groups to receive either a vitamin C-sufficient diet or the same diet containing a low concentration of vitamin C (but adequate to prevent scurvy) for 2 mo. Spatial memory was assessed by the Morris Water Maze, and hippocampal neuron numbers were quantified by stereologic techniques. Results: The results showed a reduction in spatial memory (P < 0.05) and an increased time to first platform hit (P < 0.05) in deficient animals compared with controls. The deficient animals had a lower total number of neurons in hippocampal subdivisions (dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis 1, and cornu ammonis 2-3) than did the normal controls (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our data show that vitamin C deficiency in early postnatal life results in impaired neuronal development and a functional decrease in spatial memory in guinea pigs. We speculate that this unrecognized effect of vitamin C deficiency may have clinical implications for high-risk individuals, such as in children born from vitamin C-deficient mothers. © 2009 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Specialized parasites are expected to express complex adaptations to their hosts. Manipulation of host behavior is such an adaptation. We studied the fungus Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, a locally specialized parasite of arboreal Camponotus leonardi ants. Antinfecting Ophiocordyceps are known to make hosts bite onto vegetation before killing them. We show that this represents a fine-tuned fungal adaptation: an. extended, phenotype. Dead ants were found under leaves, attached by their mandibles, on the northern side of saplings ∼25 cm above the soil, where temperature and humidity conditions were optimal for fungal growth. Experimental relocation confirmed that parasite fitness was lower outside this manipulative zone. Host resources were rapidly colonized and further secured by extensive internal structuring. Nutritional composition analysis indicated that such structuring allows the parasite to produce a large fruiting body for spore production. Our findings suggest that the osmotrophic lifestyle of fungi may have facilitated novel exploitation strategies. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={The neonatal nutritional environment is critical for programming the systems regulating body weight, and an inappropriate nutritional environment in early life can lead to overweight or obesity later on. In this study we demonstrate that changes to the neonatal nutritional environment, induced by changing the litter size in which the animal is raised, can alter not only body weight into adulthood, but also anxiety behaviours and stress responsiveness. These effects appear to be somewhat sex-dependent, affecting female rats more strongly than males. Thus, Wistar rats raised in small litters, where they have greater access to their mothers' milk, weigh more in adulthood than those raised in large litters. Females from these small litters show enhanced exploratory behaviour and reduced anxiety in the elevated plus maze, entering the open arms more often. They also display enhanced central responses to restraint stress including greater activation of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, possibly indicating that the changes we see are related to enhanced arousal. Thus, while neonatal litter size affects long-term body weight regulation, it can also alter long-term activity, anxiety and stress responsiveness, and the degree to which it does so appears to be sex-dependent. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={How individuals balance time spent satisfying nutritional needs and time spent being vigilant to protect against potential predation has received abundant attention from researchers. Evidence indicates that both social conditions and predator risk affect how individuals perceive environmental threat, however, the relative influence of each type of risk remains unclear. The risk allocation hypothesis considers how individuals respond to predation risk over time by adapting their investment in high-quality or low-quality vigilance. Here we use the risk allocation hypothesis as a guide to examine how different risk factors influence vigilance quantity and quality in Cape ground squirrels, Xerus inauris. We tested how the social conditions of age, sex, distance to a safe refuge, distance from a nearest neighbour and predator risk affect the amount of time (quantity) individuals spend vigilant. Individuals were more vigilant in areas with more potential predators and when they were further from a safe refuge or nearest neighbour. We then tested whether these risk factors that affected vigilance quantity also affected vigilance quality by measuring exclusive vigilance (high-cost, high-quality) and shared-foraging-vigilance (low-cost, low-quality). Individuals in high-predation risk areas invested more time in high-cost vigilance behaviour than in low-cost vigilance/foraging behaviour compared with individuals in low-predation risk areas. Since squirrels invested in high-cost vigilance significantly more than in low-cost vigilance regardless of distance to a refuge or other squirrels, we suggest that combined foraging with vigilance compromises vigilance to lower its quality. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Objective: Both self-reported indicators of stress and hormones such as cortisol and corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) have been examined in relation to preterm birth. Although these hormones have been interpreted as biomarkers of stress, it is unclear whether psychosocial measures are empirically associated with biomarkers of stress in pregnant women. Methods: We analyzed data from 1,587 North Carolina pregnant women enrolled in the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition study during 2000-2004 who provided at least one saliva sample for cortisol measurement or blood samples for CRH at 14-19 and 24-29 weeks' gestation. Cortisol measures were limited to those taken between 8 and 10 a.m. Perceived stress, state-trait anxiety, coping style, life events, social support, and pregnancy-specific anxiety were measured by questionnaires and interviews. Spearman correlations and multiple regressions were used to describe the relationship among the measures of stress. Results: No correlations larger than r=0.15 were seen between reported psychosocial measures and cortisol or CRH. Women with demographic characteristics associated with poor pregnancy outcomes (unmarried, African-American, young, low pre-pregnancy body mass index) reported higher levels of stress but did not consistently have higher levels of stress hormones. Pre-eclampsia was associated with higher CRH, but not with higher cortisol. Conclusions: The relationship between measurements of reported stress and biomarkers is not straightforward in large epidemiological studies of pregnancy.

abstract={Undernutrition in early childhood is associated with poor cognitive development and some changes in behavior. However, there is little information on their temperament. Our objective in this study was to determine whether undernourished children aged 6-24 mo had different temperament traits than better-nourished children. Two hundred and twelve undernourished children (weight for age < -2 Z-scores) attending community nutrition centers in 20 villages in rural Bangladesh and 108 better-nourished children (weight-for-age ≥ -2 Z-scores) matched for age, sex, and village participated in the study. Temperament was assessed through an interviewer-administered maternal questionnaire consisting of 7 subscales: manageability, activity, emotionality, sociability, attention, soothability, and fear. After adjusting for significant covariates, the undernourished children were less sociable [regression coefficient (B) = 20.96; 95% CI = 20.04, 21.88], less attentive (B = 20.94; 95% CI = 20.19, 21.69), more fearful (B = 1.43; 95% CI = 2.44, 0.42), and had more negative emotionality (B = 21.08; 95% CI = 0.006, 22.16). In conclusion, these undernourished children had comprehensive differences in temperament traits, which may increase their risk of developing behavioral and mental health problems in later childhood. © 2009 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={The use of 'tactical deception' is argued to have been important in the cognitive evolution of the order Primates, but systematic studies of active deception in wild non-human primates are scant. This study tests whether wild tufted capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella nigritus) use alarm calls in a functionally deceptive manner to usurp food resources. If capuchins use alarm calls 'deceptively', it was predicted that false alarms should be: (i) given by subordinates more than by dominants, (ii) more frequent when food is most contestable, (iii) more frequent when less food is available, and (iv) given when the caller is in a spatial position in which it could increase its feeding success if conspecifics react to the call. These predictions were tested by observing subjects in experimental contexts, in which the amount and distribution of a high-value resource (banana pieces) were manipulated using wooden platforms suspended from tree branches. While false alarms were non-significantly more common when more food was available, the three remaining predictions were supported. These results generally support the hypothesis that alarm calls are used by capuchins to reduce the effects of feeding competition. Whether this is intentional on the part of the caller requires further investigation. © 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Olfactory stimuli and calorie restriction (CR) have both been found to reduce anxiety-like behaviour and alter anxiety-related neurochemical mechanisms in rats. The aim of this study was to determine if exposure to olfactory cues from 25% CR male rats leads to anxiolytic-like behaviour in male rats fed ad libitum. Animals were divided into four groups: control (fed ad libitum and given new bedding every 5 days), control olfactory group (fed ad libitum and given the bedding from the control group every 5 days), CR (fed a 25% CR regime and given new bedding every 5 days), and CR olfaction (fed ad libitum and given the bedding from the CR group every 5 days). All animals were assessed on two measures of anxiety-like behaviour: the open field and the elevated plus maze. The CR group demonstrated anxiolytic-like behavioural responses in the open field test, characterised by more time spent in the aversive central zone and a higher frequency of central and middle zone entries compared to all other groups. Intriguingly, the CR olfaction group demonstrated anxiolytic-like behaviour in the elevated plus maze test, characterised by more time spent on the open arms, and a higher ratio of open compared to total arm entries relative to the control and control olfaction groups. After the completion of behavioural testing, serum corticosterone assays were conducted on trunk blood. However, only the CR group demonstrated an increase in corticosterone. Olfactory cues from conspecifics on a CR regime significantly reduced anxiety-like behaviour in rats fed ad libitum, similar to the reduction in anxiety-like behaviour following CR. This may have implications for the development of more efficacious novel treatments for anxiety disorders. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={An animal's level of vigilance depends on various environmental factors such as predator presence or the proximity of conspecific competitors. In addition, several individual traits may influence vigilance. We investigated the effects of body condition, social rank and the state of pregnancy on individual vigilance (scanning) rates in individually marked European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) of a field enclosure population. We found lower rates in young rabbits than in adult females, but male and female juveniles did not differ. Vigilance of juveniles was positively correlated with their age-dependent body mass (used as a measure of body condition), i.e. young rabbits with lower body condition scanned less. We suggest that juveniles with low body condition were trading off vigilance against feeding to maximise their growth. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between body mass and vigilance in adult females. Adult females increased scanning rates during late pregnancy, which might constitute a behavioural compensation because of their lower capacity to escape predator attacks. In addition, adult females with low social ranks scanned more than high ranking individuals, likely because of their higher risk of attacks by conspecifics. In summary, our results highlight various individual characteristics that influence vigilance behaviour in European rabbits. © 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

Behaviour and glucocorticoid metabo-lite concentrations (GCM) were assessed throughout the experiment Our hypotheses were that enrichment procedures would lead to an increase in activity in the short and long term, a decrease in pacing, and a reduction in GCM concentrations. We also hypothesised that the concentrations of GCM would show a correlation with behaviour. Enrichment conditions increased immediate locomotion but did not produce long-term changes of activity nor reduced pacing. The procedures had a clear effect on individual behaviour and induced, under food enrichment conditions, an increased interest in food. Enrichment did not lead to decreased GCM concentration in the group as a whole, but there was a tendency for male and female animals to differ in hormonal reactions to environmental change. A positive corre-lation between GCM concentrations and pacing behaviour and a negative correlation between GCM concentrations and social behaviour were found. Results suggest that food scattering as an enrichment procedure may be used with maned wolves to enhance welfare, whilst also revealing the importance of taking individual and gender differences into account when planning enrichment techniques. © 2009 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.},

abstract={The cache decisions of scatter-hoarding animals are influenced by a number of factors, including satiety, food quality, number of competitors, and the risk of predation and pilferage. However, it is unknown how animals assess these variables. We investigated this process experimentally in free-ranging fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) by measuring the effects of nut characteristics and social context on nut-handling behavior and subsequent cache decisions. We found that a behavior involved in nut handling, the head flick, was correlated with nut quality, shell presence, the decision to cache rather than eat the nut, and the time and energy spent caching. In contrast, a 2nd nut-handling behavior, the paw maneuver, was correlated with the social context but not the cache decision, and may instead reflect a response to social competition. Our results suggest that fox squirrels assess nut quality using overt, observable nut-handling behaviors. The experimental study of these behaviors can help us understand how animals use information about food and the social context to make adaptive foodstoring decisions. © 2009 American Society of Mammalogists.},

abstract={Vigilance in animals decreases with group size in many species of birds and mammals, but the effect of group size can be confounded by several ecological factors, most notably food density. Given that large groups often aggregate in areas of higher food density and that vigilance may be reduced when animals feed more, the group-size effect of vigilance may be confounded by the direct effect of food density on vigilance. In this paper, I examine the theoretical expectations regarding the effect of food density on vigilance and review the available empirical evidence. Two bodies of theory predict either no relationship or a negative relationship between vigilance and food density, but none has been tested explicitly. The empirical support for a negative relationship is mixed given that many studies actually document a positive correlation between vigilance and food density. I review the factors modulating the effect of food density on vigilance and show that there are several reasons to believe that the case against a confounding effect of food density is not as strong as expected. In fact, food density can actually mask the expected decrease in vigilance with group size. A statement about the magnitude of the group-size effect on vigilance will require an assessment of the role of food density as well as the many factors reviewed here that modulate the effect of food density on vigilance in birds and mammals. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Personality in animal behaviour describes the observation that behavioural differences between individuals are consistent over time and context. Studies of group-living animals show that movement order among individuals is also consistent over time and context, suggesting that some individuals lead and others follow. However, the relationship between leadership and personality traits is poorly studied. We measured several personality traits and leadership of individual barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis. We measured body size and scored the dominance of individuals living in a stable group situation before subjecting them to an open-field test, an activity test, a novel-object test, and a leadership test in which the order of the movement of individuals in pairs towards a feeding patch was scored. We found high repeatability for activity and novel-object scores over time. Leadership was strongly correlated with novel-object score but not with dominance rank, activity or exploration in an open field. These results provide evidence that leadership is closely related to some aspects of personality. Interestingly, an individual's arrival at the food patch was affected not only by the novel-object score of the focal individual, but also by the novel-object score of the companion individual, indicating that movement patterns of individuals living in groups are affected by the personality traits of other group members and suggesting that movement patterns of a group may be shaped by the mix of personality types present in the group.

abstract={Socially influenced learning is important because it can drive the spread of novel behaviours among individuals within and between generations. While work on a few vertebrates suggests the conditions favouring the use of social over individual learning, we know little about the evolution of social learning. As a part of an ongoing examination of the evolutionary roots of social learning in insects, we tested for social learning in locusts, Locusta migratoria. Locusts showed rapid individual learning, preferring a diet they ate for a single meal of only 20 min over another diet of equal nutritional quality. Locusts, however, did not show stronger preference for novel food that they had previously consumed while in the presence of a conspecific experienced with that food. Furthermore, focal locusts did not learn about novel food from (1) experienced conspecifics that were observable through a screen, (2) interactions with conspecifics that had previously fed on and gave off odours from novel food and (3) cannibalizing conspecifics that had recently fed on novel food. Whereas our results extend previous work indicating excellent individual learning in locusts, they provide no evidence for socially influenced learning in a species that, in its gregarious form, has the opportunity for social learning and could benefit from such an ability. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Vertebrate blood is essential for the growth and the reproduction of haematophagous insects. Provided that hosts play the double role of food sources and predators, feeding on their blood exposes these insects to a high predation risk. Therefore, it is expected that host seeking occurs only when insects need to feed. In the present study, we analyse how the feeding status affects the response to host-associated cues in the blood-sucking insect Rhodnius prolixus. We show that the responsiveness to host- associated cues, such as CO2 and heat, and that the motivation to feed depend on the time elapsed since a blood meal. Depending on the time elapsed after feeding, the same concentration of CO2 may attract or repel the insects. As far as we know, this is the first time that a host signal has been shown to be repellent for a haematophagous insect. The response to heat is also modulated but no repellence was observed. When blood was replaced by saline solution as food, a significant reduction of the response to both signals was evinced but repellence was not observed. The injection of haemolymph from fed insects into starved insects inhibited the response of the receiver insects to both signals but this was not observed after the injection of saline solution or of haemolymph from non-fed insects. This is the first time that the modulation of feeding behaviour by the feeding status has been analysed in a hemimetabolous blood-sucking insect, fully excluding any effect of other processes, such as reproduction.},

abstract={When animals forage or court their behaviors are often constrained by factors such as predation risk. Predator-prey interactions govern the evolution of many behavioral and morphological traits. However, animals with foraging or courtship tightly linked to morphology cannot make quick behavioral adjustments when encountering a dilemma. In this study, we investigate how opposing pressures of maximizing prey intake and minimizing predation risk shape the morphology-associated foraging traits of a sit-and-wait predator. Recently, the conspicuous body colorations of certain orb-weaving spiders have been demonstrated to be attractive to both insect prey and predators. In this study, we performed field manipulations to assess how visual luring signals of such predators trade off opposing pressures of feeding and surviving. We created dummies made of cardboard to test how changing size of conspicuous signal affected attractiveness to prey and predators. Dummies mimicked the coloration pattern and chromatic properties of giant wood spider Nephila pilipes. We found that dummies were similarly attractive to prey and predators as real spiders were. Uniformly yellow colored dummies attracted significantly more prey than those dummies that mimicked the color pattern of N. pilipes. However, such dummies also attracted far more hymenopteran predators. Our findings indicate that current morphology-associated foraging traits of certain animals do not necessarily provide the best feeding performance but reflect a trade-off between opposing pressures of foraging intake and predation risk.},

abstract={Predators affect prey demography through direct predation and through the costs of antipredator behavioral responses, or risk effects. Experiments have shown that risk effects can comprise a substantial proportion of a predator's total effect on prey dynamics, but we know little about their strength in wild populations, or the physiological mechanisms that mediate them. When wolves are present, elk alter their grouping patterns, vigilance, foraging behavior, habitat selection, and diet. These responses are associated with decreased progesterone levels, decreased calf production, and reduced population size [Creel S, Christianson D, Liley S, Winnie JA (2007) Science 315:960]. Two general mechanisms for the effect of predation risk on reproduction have been proposed: the predation stress hypothesis and the predator-sensitive-food hypothesis. Here, we used enzyme immunoassay to measure fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations for 1,205 samples collected from 4 elk populations over 4 winters to test the hypothesis that the effect of predation risk on elk reproduction is mediated by chronic stress. Across populations and years, fecal glucocorticoid concentrations were not related to predator-prey ratios, progesterone concentrations or calf-cow ratios. Overall, the effect of wolf presence on elk reproduction is better explained by changes in foraging patterns that carry nutritional costs than by changes in glucocorticoid concentrations.},

abstract={In transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders affecting many species, the key event in disease pathogenesis is the accumulation of an abnormal conformational isoform (PrPSc) of the host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrPC). While the precise mechanism of the PrPC to PrPSc conversion is not understood, it is clear that host PrPC expression is a prerequisite for effective infectious prion propagation. Although there have been many studies on TSEs in mammalian species, little is known about TSE pathogenesis in fish. Here we show that while gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) orally challenged with brain homogenates prepared either from a BSE infected cow or from scrapie infected sheep developed no clinical prion disease, the brains of TSE-fed fish sampled two years after challenge did show signs of neurodegeneration and accumulation of deposits that reacted positively with antibodies raised against sea bream PrP. The control groups, fed with brains from uninfected animals, showed no such signs. Remarkably, the deposits developed much more rapidly and extensively in fish inoculated with BSE-infected material than in the ones challenged with the scrapie-infected brain homogenate, with numerous deposits being proteinase K-resistant. These plaque-like aggregates exhibited congophilia and birefringence in polarized light, consistent with an amyloid-like component. The neurodegeneration and abnormal deposition in the brains of fish challenged with prion, especially BSE, raises concerns about the potential risk to public health. As fish aquaculture is an economically important industry providing high protein nutrition for humans and other mammalian species, the prospect of farmed fish being contaminated with infectious mammalian PrPSc, or of a prion disease developing in farmed fish is alarming and requires further evaluation. © 2009 Salta et al.},

abstract={To test the hypothesis that digestion has a more notable physiological effect on ambush foragers than on active foragers, we investigated the behavioural, digestive and metabolic characteristics, as well as the postprandial locomotory capacity, of four species of juvenile fish distributed along the Yangtze River, China, with distinct foraging strategies. The ambush foraging southern catfish (Silurus meridionlis) had the fewest movements per minute (MPM), lowest per cent time spent moving (PTM), slowest critical swimming speed (Ucrit), lowest maintenance metabolism (V̇ O2rest) and lowest maximum locomotory metabolism (V̇ O2max). However, the southern catfish had the highest feeding level and maximum feeding metabolism (V̇O2peak) and the greatest decrease in Ucrlt after consumption of a large meal. Thus, this fish is highly adapted to its ambush behavioural strategy and sedentary life style. In the herbivorous grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus), a low digestive capacity led to little change in postprandial locomotory performance, which benefits its frequent grazing behaviour. In this species, the greater amount of energy spent on routine activity and avoiding predators versus Ucrit might be related to its herbivorous life style and high predation risk. The active foraging crucian carp (Carassius auratus) adopts a unique high energy cost strategy that allows for high capacity in both routine activity and digestion, and the great flexibility of its cardio-respiratory capacity (increased V̇o2max after feeding) guarantees a small decrease in Ucrlt even after maximum feeding. Finally, the sluggish foraging darkbarbel catfish (Pelteobagrus vachelli) has low digestive and locomotory capacity, but its energy-efficient venomous defence strategy may be related to its abundance. These results show that the digestive, behavioural and metabolic strategies differ among these fish species. The locomotory capacity in the sedentary fishes decreased profoundly after feeding, whereas it decreased little or not at all in the active fishes. The maintenance of high locomotory capacity after eating in the active fishes is probably related to a large metabolic capacity, a lower digestive capacity or an improvement in cardio-respiratory capacity after feeding.},

abstract={That metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with schizophrenia is well established but recent findings suggest that the risk of MetS may be similar in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The investigators identified all admissions age 18-59 with a clinical diagnosis of MDD (n = 1,776) at an urban, not-for-profit hospital in the US to determine the prevalence of MetS and of each of its five ATP III criteria. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the prevalence of MetS and its component measures and χ2 analyses to compare these results with the most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Data (NHANES). Stepwise logistic regressions were used to identify associated demographic and clinical features. In the subset of patients for whom all metabolic measures were available (n = 1,028), 23.4% (n = 241) had MetS and 75.6% (n = 777) met at least one criterion for the syndrome. Compared with the NHANES sample, MDD patients were more likely to have elevated glucose (p &lt; 0.001), decreased HDL cholesterol (p &lt; 0.001), at least one ATP-III criterion present (p &lt; 0.001), and the full syndrome (i.e. at least three ATP-III criteria) (p = 0.003). In the logistic regressions atypical antipsychotics were not associated with either an increased risk for MetS or the presence of ≥1 of the criteria. However, patients receiving venlafaxine were 65% more likely to have ≥1 criterion, and those receiving two or more antidepressants or an anticonvulsant were more likely to have the full syndrome (100% and 58% increased risk, respectively). Risk for MetS was more than doubled in patients ≥40 years, Latino females, and those with a co-diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. Copyright © 2009 S. Karger AG.},

abstract={Despite the potential impact on prey fitness and predator-prey interactions, most studies of predation risk ignore physiological responses and their dependence upon food level and sex. Therefore, we reared male and female larvae of the damselfly Lestes viridis under predator stress (dragonfly larvae) at high and low food levels, and subsequently scored for important variables of insect immune defence (i.e. phenoloxidase) and antioxidant defence [i.e. superoxide dismutase, and catalase (CAT)]. Under predation risk, larvae did not decrease growth rate or immune defence, and only slightly reduced food intake in the high food treatment, probably because of time stress, i.e. little time available to complete the larval development. However, larvae facing predator stress did show an upregulation of antioxidant enzymes. This upregulation was dependent upon food level for CAT and both food level and sex for SOD, consistent with energetic constraints and sex differences in the link between longevity and adult fitness. Our results illustrate that predator stress can influence life history, behavioural and physiological responses differentially and in a context-dependent way. This implies that non-consumptive physiological effects of predators on their prey show independent yet similar complexities in behavioural and life history response variables. In general, our results advocate that mechanistic studies on predator-prey interactions may benefit from including physiological variables. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

abstract={Indirect benefits derived by females that mate with males that express preferred traits are important to our understanding of 'good genes' models of sexual selection. However, few studies have explored male courtship behaviours with potential indirect benefits conferred to females in order to ascertain whether these behaviours serve as honest indicators of male quality. Using a common species of wolf spider, Pardosa milvina, we addressed the honesty of male courtship behaviours in two laboratory experiments. In our first experiment, we quantified the repeatability of courtship rate in adult males that were manipulated to be in high or low condition and were sequentially presented with adult virgin females that similarly differed in body condition. In our second experiment, we explored the effect of male courtship rate on several measures of fitness: number of offspring produced, days until offspring emerged and offspring viability measured as offspring survival. Our experiments show that male courtship rate is statistically significantly repeatable except when males in high condition have repeated encounters with females in low condition. Our results also reveal that females have the potential to gain indirect genetic benefits by mating with males that naturally court at high rates: females produced more offspring that emerged from eggsacs sooner and survived starvation better compared to females that mated with males that naturally courted at low rates. Our study provides additional support that male courtship rate is an honest indicator of quality, and it makes the novel finding that the repeatability of courtship rate is context sensitive. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The fitness consequences of plural breeding vary considerably among social vertebrates. We tested three hypotheses for the direct reproductive fitness consequences of group living in the degu Octodon degus, a social rodent endemic to central Chile. To test the 'benefits of communal care' hypothesis, we determined the relationship between the number of females per group, per capita direct fitness and offspring survival. To test the 'food abundance and quality' hypothesis, we determined the relationship between the biomass of preferred foods at burrow systems, group size, per capita direct fitness and offspring survival. To test the 'predation risk' hypothesis, we determined the relationship between group size, the density of burrow entrances to which social groups had access, per capita direct fitness, and survival of adults and offspring. Group size of core females (i.e. those with 50% or more nightly overlap) was negatively correlated with per capita direct fitness, but not with the number of females per group or total group size. Group living did not enhance the survival of offspring. Greater biomass of food (at 3 m and 9 m) and burrow density were not linked to larger groups and offspring survival. Our results did not support predictions of the 'benefits of communal care', 'food abundance and quality' or 'predation risk' hypothesis. Pending microsatellite analyses, we hypothesize that survival benefits linked to foraging group size and not reproductive fitness benefits may explain the evolution of sociality in degus. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Pond-drying is a model for understanding the causes of life history variation in metamorphic organisms. However, we know relatively little about how interactions among specific proximate cues of pond-drying affect juvenile life history, how those responses might be mitigated by diet, and the post-metamorphic consequences for adult fitness. I manipulated larval diet, water depth, and water temperature during the aquatic larval stage of a temporary pond-dwelling caddisfly, Limnephilus indivisus. I predicted that shallow depths and warm temperatures (depth × temperature) associated with pond-drying would have negative effects on larval survival, growth, development, adult size, female fecundity, and adult longevity, but that supplementation of the larval diet should mitigate the trade-off between juvenile growth and pre-reproductive mortality risk by ameliorating the negative effects of pond-drying (diet × depth, diet × temperature) on these traits. Larval survival was enhanced by diet supplementation but was not affected by depth or temperature. Larval diet and water temperatures acted independently on growth, development, and female size, and growth rates were higher when larval diets were supplemented relative to ambient diets; development times were shorter when temperatures were warmer relative to colder; adult females were larger when larvae were fed a supplemented diet but smaller when reared in warm water. Larval growth and development were not affected by depth, but female size was reduced under shallow relative to deep conditions. Female longevity and fecundity were affected by the larval diet × female size interaction. Surprisingly, this was independent of the depth × temperature interaction on female longevity and fecundity suggesting that reductions in adult fitness due to juvenile abiotic conditions can be independent of size-at-maturity. Future studies should quantify the effect of proximate cues of pond-drying on juvenile survival and life history as well as adult fitness correlates. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

abstract={Recommendations for intake of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, and low-fat dairy form the underpinning of dietary guidance for health promotion. We examined the association of a summary index of food consumption behaviors compatible with the spirit of prevailing dietary guidance and mortality.We used data from the NIH-American Association of Retired Persons cohort (n = 350,886), aged 50-71 y and disease free at baseline in 1995-1996, to examine the association of a dietary behavior score (DBS) with mortality after 10.5 y of follow-up (deaths, n = 29,838). The DBS included 6 equally weighted components derived from responses to questions on usual dietary behaviors related to consumption of fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, whole grains, lean meat and poultry, and discretionary fat. The covariate-adjusted association of DBS and mortality from all causes, cancer, and coronary heart disease was examined using Cox proportional hazards regression methods. Compared with those in the lowest one-fifth of DBS, the multivariate-adjusted relative risk of mortality in the highest one-fifth of the DBS was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.70-0.80) in women and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75-0.83) in men (P-trend < 0.0001). The inverse association of DBS and mortality was significant in both genders in nearly all categories of covariates. Similar trends were observed for DBS associations with mortality from cancer and heart disease. Nearly 12% of the covariate-adjusted population risk of mortality was attributable to nonconformity with dietary recommendations. Adoption of recommended dietary behaviors was associated with lower mortality in both men and women independent of other lifestyle risk factors. © 2009 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={■ PURPOSE: Although cardiac rehabilitation programs have been shown to decrease cardiovascular risk, morbidity, and mortality, few programs have integrated a balanced mind/body approach in which patients are taught the relaxation response and utilize cognitive behavior skills for stress management, along with diet and exercise. We examined the medical and psychological outcomes of patients treated in such a cardiac rehabilitation program in a general hospital setting. ■ METHODS: From 1997 to 2005, outcomes were measured in 637 patients with coronary artery disease at baseline and after a 3-month program. Components of the intervention included smoking cessation, moderate aerobic exercise, nutrition counseling, relaxation response training, and cognitive/behavioral skills. ■ RESULTS: Men and women improved significantly with respect to medical outcomes (blood pressure, lipids, weight, exercise conditioning, frequency of symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath) and psychological outcomes (general severity index, depression, anxiety, and hostility) (P < .0001). Patients considered "at higher risk" for cardiac events due to high baseline measures improved their measures to a less than "at higher risk" level. Data indicate that specific components of the intervention, that is, increased relaxation response practice and exercise, significantly contributed to these improvements (P < .05). Furthermore, age and gender differences, particularly for psychological measures, were found; younger patients and female patients had greater improvements than older patients and male patients. ■ CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary data for a subsequent randomized control trial to test mind/body-based interventions to determine the most effective outcomes at an affordable cost. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.},

Methods: College students (N = 583) completed the American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment and the International Personality Item Pool Big Five short-form questionnaire. Results: Highly conscientious individuals were more likely to wear seat belts, utilize alcohol-related harm reduction, exercise, get enough sleep, and consume fruits and vegetables. They were also less likely to smoke cigarettes, consume alcohol, and binge drink. Highly extraverted individuals were more likely to smoke cigarettes, consume alcohol, binge drink, and have multiple sexual partners, and they were less likely to engage in alcohol-related harm reduction, use condoms, and get enough sleep. Conclusions: These findings are supportive of a growing body of evidence indicating that conscientiousness and extraversion are robust concomitants of health behaviors among college students.

abstract={Violent offenders have abnormalities in their glucose metabolism as indicated by decreased glucose uptake in their prefrontal cortex and a low blood glucose nadir in the glucose tolerance test. We tested the hypothesis that low non-oxidative glucose metabolism (NOG) predicts forthcoming violent offending among antisocial males. Glucose metabolism was measured using the insulin clamp method among 49 impulsive, violent, antisocial offenders during a forensic psychiatric examination. Those offenders who committed at least one new violent crime during the 8-year follow-up had a mean NOG of 1.4 standard deviations lower than non-recidivistic offenders. In logistic regression analysis, NOG alone explained 27% of the variation in the recidivistic offending. Low non-oxidative metabolism may be a crucial component in the pathophysiology of habitually violent behavior among subjects with antisocial personality disorder. This might suggest that substances increasing glycogen formation and decreasing the risk of hypoglycemia might be potential treatments for impulsive violent behavior. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract={Sucrose is considered by many to be detrimental to health, giving rise to deterioration of the body associated with ageing. This study was undertaken to determine whether replacing sucrose in the diet long-term with honey that has a high antioxidant content could decrease deterioration in brain function during ageing. Forty-five 2-month old Sprague Dawley rats were fed ad libitum for 52 weeks on a powdered diet that was either sugar-free or contained 7.9% sucrose or 10% honey (which is the equivalent amount of sugar). Anxiety levels were assessed using an Elevated Plus Maze, whilst a Y maze and an Object Recognition task were used to assess memory. Locomotor activity was also measured using an Open Field task to ensure that differences in activity levels did not bias results in the other tasks. Anxiety generally decreased overall from 3 to 12 months, but the honey-fed rats showed significantly less anxiety at all stages of ageing compared with those fed sucrose. Honey-fed animals also displayed better spatial memory throughout the 12-month period: at 9 and 12 months a significantly greater proportion of honey-fed rats recognised the novel arm as the unvisited arm of the maze compared to rats on a sugar-free or sucrose-based diet. No significant differences among groups were observed in the Object Recognition task, and there appeared to be no differences in locomotor activity among groups at either 6 or 12 months. In conclusion, it appears that consumption of honey may reduce anxiety and improve spatial memory in middle age. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Elite dancers are at increased risk of eating disorders. The authors hypothesized that specific learning about thinness in dance class, rather than simple participation in dance training, tends to be an important aspect of the risk process. Approximately 500 college women reported on their previous dance experiences, their dance-related learning about thinness, their eating behaviours and attitudes and their thinness expectancies. Results showed that lifetime amount of time spent in dance class was unrelated to adult eating disturbance, women's reports of learning experiences concerning thinness during their dance classes predicted adult disordered eating concurrently, and thinness expectancies appeared to mediate the relationship between learning about thinness and adult eating disturbance. Learning experiences about thinness in dance class seem more important than time spent in dance class when examining the relationship between dance study and eating disorders.

abstract={One potential trade-off that bold individuals face is between increased predation risks and gains in resources. Individuals experiencing high predation and hungry individuals (or individuals with low body condition) are predicted to show increased boldness. We examined one behavioral trait previously reported to be associated with boldness (the time individual fish needed to emerge from shelter) in various populations of mollies (Poecilia spp.). Our study system included several southern Mexican surface streams with high piscine predation and high food availability, sulfidic surface streams with high avian predation, in which the inhabiting fish show reduced body condition, and a sulfidic cave, where predation and body condition are low. Our comparison revealed very short times to emerge from the start box in populations from non-sulfidic streams. In sulfidic habitats (whether surface or cave), it took individual Poecilia mexicana considerably longer to emerge from the start box, and the same difference was also found in an independent comparison between P. mexicana and the closely related, highly sulfide-adapted Poecilia sulphuraria. Fish reared under common garden conditions (in the absence of predators and hydrogen sulfide) showed intermediate boldness scores to the extremes observed in the field. Our data thus indicate that (a) boldness is shaped by environmental conditions/experiential effects, but is not heritable, (b) predation affects boldness in the predicted direction, but (c) low body condition leads to reduced boldness. Extremophile Poecilia spp. spend most of their time surfacing to survive under sulfidic and hypoxic conditions, which exposes them to increased levels of predations, but the fish forage on the bottom. Hence, in this system, increased boldness does not increase foraging success. We argue that energy limitation favors reducing energetically costly behaviors, and exploring novel environments may be just one of them. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

abstract={Impulsivity, a core symptom of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is tested in animal models by delay-discounting tasks. So far, mainly male subjects have been used in this paradigm at severe levels of food restriction. Here we studied the impulsive behaviour of CD-1 adult male and female mice at mild levels of food restriction. Mice maintained at 90 ± 5% of ad libitum bodyweight, were tested in operant chambers provided with nose-poking holes. Nose poking in one hole resulted in the immediate delivery of one food pellet (small-soon, SS), whereas nose poking in the other hole delivered five food pellets after a delay (large-late, LL), which was increased progressively each day (0-150 s). Two subgroups emerged: individuals that shifted at short delays ("steep") and individuals that did not shift, even at the highest delays ("flat"). Analysis showed that "steep" females shifted at shorter delays than "steep" males, while no difference existed between males and females within the "flat" sub-population. In home-cage circadian activity as well as in a novelty-seeking test, females were more active than males. It can be concluded from these results that female mice are more impulsive than male mice under mild food restriction. This is in contrast with findings in earlier studies with more severe food restriction. Therefore, an alternative explanation is that females are more explorative, and that different features might be tested in delay-discounting paradigms, depending on restriction levels. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study was to examine the influence of restricted diets, including a ketogenic diet (KD) and a standard rodent chow diet (SD), on behavior in male Mecp2308/y mice, a model of RTT. The KD is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that has anticonvulsant efficacy in children with intractable epilepsy and may be therapeutic in children with RTT. Following an 11-day pretrial period, adult wild-type and mutant Rett mice were separated into groups that were fed either an SD in unrestricted or restricted amounts or a ketogenic diet (KetoCal) in restricted amounts for a total of 30 days. The restricted diets were administered to reduce mouse body weight by 20-23% compared to the body weight of each mouse before the initiation of the diet. All mice were subjected to a battery of behavioral tests to determine the influence of the diet on the RTT phenotype. We found that performance in tests of motor behavior and anxiety was significantly worse in male RTT mice compared to wild-type mice and that restriction of either the KD or the SD improved motor behavior and reduced anxiety. We conclude that although both restricted diets increased the tendency of Rett mice to explore a novel environment, the beneficial effects of the KD were due more to calorie restriction than to the composition of the diet. Our findings suggest that calorically restricted diets could be effective in reducing the anxiety and in improving motor behavior in girls with RTT. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Food consumption is controlled by both internal and external factors. Environmental signals associated with food may prepare an animal to forage, consume and digest more effectively. Furthermore, environmental cues that provide information about food availability enable animals to make predictions about future food resources and act upon that knowledge in appropriate fashion. For example, when exposed to a cue that signals the presence of food, animals can eat beyond their present needs to cope with predicted future famine. Interestingly, cues previously paired with meal interruption have a similar effect. In two experiments, food-deprived rats learned to associate one conditioned stimulus (CS+) with delivery of a food unconditioned stimulus (US), and another stimulus (IS) with an unexpected termination of CS-US trials. Subsequently, both CS+ and IS enhanced consumption of the US food by sated rats. The results of Experiment 2 indicated that IS's ability to potentiate feeding of sated rats in test depended more on its accompanying CS+ termination in training than on its signaling reductions in US frequency. These experiments may provide a novel animal model of binge-like behaviors in sated rats induced by external cues paired with meal interruption. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Dispersal is a common response to deteriorating conditions such as intense competition, food limitation, predation or parasitism. Although it provides obvious advantages, dispersal is often assumed to be costly. Selection is therefore likely to have acted to decrease these costs, and indeed several studies demonstrated that dispersers and philopatric individuals differ in their morphology, physiology and/or behavior. Using the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara) as our model system, we examined the contribution of phenotypic plasticity to the establishment of dispersal-dependent behavioral traits. We used a reciprocal transplant experiment in which conditions at the maternal site of origin, during offspring development in utero, and at the release site were manipulated. We then compared activity, social interactions and foraging behavior between individuals that stayed philopatric and those that dispersed. Most behavioral traits were also measured at birth and after the dispersal phase. This study demonstrates that (a) 10 months after the dispersal phase, there were still marked behavioral differences between dispersing and philopatric individuals, (b) the reaction when confronted to another individual was also dispersal-status dependent, a result which strongly suggests that individuals are able to recognize the dispersal status of same-age conspecifics and (c) none of the behavioral characteristics were found to be dependent on the environmental conditions (maternal and natal environment) indicating a lack of phenotypic plasticity in the building of the dispersal-dependent behavioral traits examined. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, affects and identity, as well as poorly controlled impulsivity. BPD causes serious distress and impairment in social, occupational and role functioning, and it is associated with high rates of self-destructive behaviors and suicide. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) treatment guidelines indicate the use of pharmacotherapy to manage state symptoms during periods of acute exacerbations and trait vulnerability, while psychotherapy is required to attain lasting improvements in patients' personality and overall functioning. Three symptom dimensions are the main targets for pharmacotherapy of borderline personality disorder: affective dysregulation, impulsive-behavioral dyscontrol and cognitive-perceptual symptoms. APA guidelines recommend choosing antidepressant agents, in particular, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and mood stabilizers to treat affective dysregulation and impulsive-behavioral dyscontrol; low-dose antipsychotics are suggested for cognitive-perceptual symptoms. Two psychotherapeutic approaches have been shown in randomized controlled trials to be efficacious, i.e., psychodynamic therapy and dialectical behavior therapy. Cognitive, interpersonal, and support psychotherapies have also been considered. Objective: This review aims to report and discuss data from clinical trials, reviews and meta-analyses concerning efficacy and tolerability of antidepressants in the treatment of borderline personality dis-order (Tables I, II). Methods: Clinical trials, reviews and meta-analyses of antidepressants in patients with borderline personality disorder were identified through careful searches in MedLine and other sources. Results: Investigations that considered controlled trials of antidepressant agents mainly focused on SSRIs. These drugs, mainly fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, are indicated as first-line treatments for affective instability (depression, anxiety, and outbursts of anger) and impulsive dyscontrol (impulsive aggression, self-mutilation, and self-damaging behaviors). SSRIs present lower incidence and milder sever3 ity of adverse effects than tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and MAOIs. Risk of toxicity is also lower. Available controlled studies indicate that MAOIs can be useful in treating borderline personality disorder with main effects on symptoms of atypical ? depression, anger and impulsivity, but the risk of adverse effects and the difficulties with adherence to required dietary restrictions constitute limitations to their use in clinical practice. TCAs are second-choice drugs in treatment of BPD; these agents can produce effects on mood instability and irritability control, but available results are limited. Clinical experience suggests that TCAs may sometimes be indicated for patients with comorbid severe depressive disorders. However, their risk for toxicity and potential lethality in overdose support the preferential use of SSRIs or related antidepressants. Although more clinical trials are needed, initial data concerning reuptake inhibitors of serotonin and noradrenaline (SNRIs) (duloxetine and venlafaxine) are promising. These antidepressants have been found to be efficacious in reducing impulsivity, anger, affective instability, anxiety, and suicidality. Conclusions: Many antidepressive agents with different mechanism of actions have been evaluated in the treatment of patients with borderline personality disorder. However, a part of available studies suffer from serious methodological limitations. Further controlled trials vs. placebo or active agents are required, including larger samples and using longer durations of treatments, in order to confirm current indications for pharmacotherapy of patients with BPD.},

The ability to balance energy intake and expenditure is critical to survival, and sophisticated physiological mechanisms have developed in order to do this, including the control of appetite. Satiation and satiety are part of the body's appetite control system and are involved in limiting energy intake. Satiation is the process that causes one to stop eating; satiety is the feeling of fullness that persists after eating, suppressing further consumption, and both are important in determining total energy intake. Satiation and satiety are controlled by a cascade of factors that begin when a food or drink is consumed and continues as it enters the gastrointestinal tract and is digested and absorbed. Signals about the ingestion of energy feed into specific areas of the brain that are involved in the regulation of energy intake, in response to the sensory and cognitive perceptions of the food or drink consumed, and distension of the stomach. These signals are integrated by the brain, and satiation is stimulated. When nutrients reach the intestine and are absorbed, a number of hormonal signals that are again integrated in the brain to induce satiety are released. In addition to these episodic signals, satiety is also affected by fluctuations in hormones, such as leptin and insulin, which indicate the level of fat storage in the body. Satiation and satiety can be measured directly via food intake or indirectly via ratings of subjective sensations of appetite. The most common study design when measuring satiation or satiety over a short period is using a test preload in which the variables of interest are carefully controlled. This is followed by subjects rating aspects of their appetite sensations, such as fullness or hunger, at intervals and then, after a predetermined time interval, a test meal at which energy intake is measured. Longer-term studies may provide foods or drinks of known composition to be consumed ad libitum and use measures of energy intake and/or appetite ratings as indicators of satiety. The measurement of satiation and satiety is complicated by the fact that many factors besides these internal signals may influence appetite and energy intake, for example, physical factors such as bodyweight, age or gender, or behavioural factors such as diet or the influence of other people present. For this reason, the majority of studies on satiation and satiety take place in a laboratory, where confounders can be controlled as much as possible, and are, therefore, of short duration. It is possible for any food or drink to affect appetite, and so it is important to determine whether, for a given amount of energy, particular variables have the potential to enhance or reduce satiation or satiety. A great deal of research has been conducted to investigate the effect of different foods, drinks, food components and nutrients on satiety. Overall, the characteristic of a food or drink that appears to have the most impact on satiety is its energy density. That is the amount of energy it contains per unit weight (kJ/g, kcal/g). When energy density is controlled, the macronutrient composition of foods does not appear to have a major impact on satiety. In practice, high-fat foods tend to have a higher energy density than high-protein or high-carbohydrate foods, and foods with the highest water content tend to have the lowest energy density. Some studies have shown that energy from protein is more satiating than energy from carbohydrate or fat. In addition, certain types of fibre have been shown to enhance satiation and satiety. It has been suggested that energy from liquids is less satiating then energy from solids. However, evidence for this is inconsistent, and it may be the mode of consumption (i.e. whether the liquid is perceived to be a food or drink) that influences its effect on satiety. Alcohol appears to stimulate energy intake in the short-term, and consuming energy from alcohol does not appear to lead to a subsequent compensatory reduction in energy intake. The consumption of food and drink to provide energy is a voluntary behaviour, and, despite the existence of sophisticated physiological mechanisms to match intake to requirements, humans often eat when sated and sometimes refrain from eating when hungry. Thus, there are numerous influences on eating behaviour beyond satiation and satiety. These include: the portion size, appeal, palatability and variety of foods and drinks available; the physiological impact on the body of physical activity and sleep; and other external influences such as television viewing and the effect of social situations. Because satiation and satiety are key to controlling energy intake, inter-individual differences in the strength of these signals and responsiveness to their effects could affect risk of obesity. Such differences have been observed at a genetic, physiological and behavioural level and may be important to consider in strategies to prevent or treat obesity. Overall, it is clear that, although the processes of satiation and satiety have the potential to control energy intake, many individuals override the signals generated. Hence, in such people, satiation and satiety alone are not sufficient to prevent weight gain in the current obesogenic environment. Knowledge about foods, ingredients and dietary patterns that can enhance satiation and satiety is potentially useful for controlling bodyweight. However, this must be coupled with an understanding of the myriad of other factors that influence eating behaviour, in order to help people to control their energy intake. © 2009 British Nutrition Foundation Nutrition.},

abstract={Sandy mice have a deletion mutation in the gene encoding dysbindin-1, Dtnbp1, with consequent reduction of the protein in heterozygotes and its loss in homozygotes. The sandy mouse thus serves as an animal model of dysbindin-1 function. As this protein is concentrated in synaptic tissue and affects transmitter release, it may affect neuronal processes that mediate behavior. To investigate the neurobehavioral effects of the Dtnbp1 mutation, we studied littermate sandy and wild-type controls on a C57BL/6J genetic background. The three animal groups were indistinguishable in their external physical characteristics, sensorimotor skills and indices of anxiety-like behaviors. In the open field, however, homozygous animals were hyperactive and appeared to show less habituation to the initially novel environment. In the Morris water maze, homozygous animals displayed clear deficits in spatial learning and memory with marginal deficits in visual association learning. Apart from the last mentioned deficits, these abnormalities are consistent with hippocampal dysfunction and in some cases with elevated dopaminergic transmission via D2 dopamine receptors. As similar deficits in spatial learning and memory have been found in schizophrenia, where decreased dysbindin-1 has been found in the hippocampus, the sandy mouse may also model certain aspects of cognition and behavior relevant to schizophrenia. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society.},

abstract={Alterations in nutritional factors during early development can exert long-term effects on growth, neural function, and associated behaviors. The lipid component of milk provides a critical nutritional source for generating both energy and essential nutrients for the growth of the newborn. The present study, therefore, investigated the hypothesis that nutritional supplementation with a complex milk lipid (CML) preparation, derived from the milk fat globule membrane rich in phospholipids and gangliosides from young rats, has beneficial effects on learning behavior and postnatal growth and development. Male Wistar rat offspring from normal pregnancies were treated from neonatal day 10 until postnatal day 80 with either vehicle or CML at a dose of 0.2% (low) and 1.0% (high) based on total food intake (n = 16 per group). Neonatal dosing was via daily oral gavage, while postweaning dosing was via gel supplementation to a standard chow diet. Animals underwent behavioral tasks related to spatial memory, learning, and cognitive function. Complex milk lipid supplementation significantly increased linear growth rate (P < .05), and the improved growth trajectory was not related to changes in body composition as quantified by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scanning or altered plasma lipid profiles. Moreover, this effect was not dose dependent and not attributable to the contribution to total energy intake of the CML composition. Supplementation of the CML to growing rats resulted in statistically significant improvements in parameters related to novelty recognition (P < .02) and spatial memory (P < .05) using standard behavioral techniques, but operant testing showed no significant differences between treatment groups. Supplementation with a CML containing gangliosides had positive growth and learning behavioral effects in young normal growing rats. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Objective: This study investigates the clustering of a broad range of health-compromising and delinquent behaviors. We examine whether these behaviors belong to a single but broad cluster, 'risk-taking behavior', and whether the nature and degree of clustering in adolescents differs from that in adults. Method: A representative sample (N = 4395) of the Dutch population aged 12 to 40 (overall response rate 67%), was asked about various health-compromising behaviors, such as alcohol consumption, smoking, illegal drug use, unsafe sexual behavior, physical inactivity, poor nutrition (such as skipping breakfast and not eating fruit and vegetables), poor sleep behavior, unlawful traffic behavior, and delinquent and aggressive behavior. Data were collected from fall 2005 to spring 2006 using internet questionnaires and face-to-face computer-assisted interviews. Results: No single broad cluster was found. Instead, there were several separate but interrelated clusters. The contents of these clusters differed between age groups. For young adolescents (12-15) two clusters were identified: Alcohol and Delinquency. For older adolescents (16-18) and adults (19-40) three clusters were identified: Alcohol, Delinquency and Health. Conclusion: The findings of this study support a more integrated approach to promoting healthier lifestyles, and suggest that the behavior targets of integrated prevention programs should be different for adolescents and adults. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We propose here a new unifying model based on a series of neurocognitive mechanisms (and fed with crucial information provided by research on the fields of emotion, stress and cognition) whereby individuals presenting a high anxiety trait are particularly vulnerable to develop depression when facing stress and adversity. Our model highlights the importance of developing prevention programs addressed to restrain, in high anxious individuals, the triggering of a dysfunctional neurocognitive cascade while coping with stress. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Mutations affecting the Na+, K+ ATPase alpha subunit have been implicated in at least two distinct human diseases, rapid-onset dystonia Parkinsonism (RDP), and familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM). Over 40 mutations have been mapped to the human ATP1A2 and ATP1A3 genes and are known to result in RDP, FHM or a variant of FHM with neurological complications. To develop a genetically tractable model system for investigating the role of the Na+, K+ ATPase in neural pathologies we performed genetic screens in Drosophila melanogaster to isolate loss-of-function alleles affecting the Na+, K+ ATPase alpha subunit. Flies heterozygous for these mutations all exhibit reduced respiration, consistent with a loss-of-function in the major ATPase. However, these mutations do not affect all functions of the Na+, K+ ATPase alpha protein since embryos homozygous for these mutations have normal septate junction paracellular barrier function and tracheal morphology. Importantly, all of these mutations cause neurological phenotypes and, akin to the mutations that cause RDP and FHM, these new alleles are missense mutations. All of these alleles exhibit progressive stress-induced locomotor impairment suggesting neuromuscular dysfunction, yet neurodegeneration is observed in an allele-specific manner. Surprisingly, studies of longevity demonstrate that mild hypomorphic mutations in the sodium pump significantly improve longevity, which was verified using the Na+, K+ ATPase antagonist ouabain. The isolation and characterization of a series of new missense alleles of ATPalpha in Drosophila provides the foundation for further studies of these neurological diseases and the role of sodium pump impairment in animal longevity. © The Author(s) 2009.},

abstract={Background: The vast majority of global stillbirths occur in low- and middle-income countries, and in many settings, the majority of stillbirths occur antenatally, prior to the onset of labour. Poor nutritional status, lack of antenatal care and a number of behaviours increase women's risk of stillbirth in many resource-poor settings. Interventions to reduce these risks could reduce the resulting burden of stillbirths, but the evidence for the impact of such interventions has not yet been comprehensively evaluated. Methods: This second paper of asystematic review of interventions that could plausibly impact stillbirth rates covers 12 different interventions relating to behavioural and socially mediated risk factors, including exposures to harmful practices and substances, antenatal care utilisation and quality, and maternal nutrition before and during pregnancy. The search strategy reviewed indexed medical journals on PubMed and the Cochrane Library. If any eligible randomised controlled trials were identified that were published after the most recent Cochrane review, they were added to generate new meta-analyses. Interventions covered in this paper have a focus on low- and middle-income countries, both because of the large burden of stillbirths and because of the high prevalence of risk factors including maternal malnutrition and harmful environmental exposures. The reviews and studies belonging to these interventions were graded and conclusions derived about the evidence of benefit of these interventions. Results: From a programmatic perspective, none of the interventions achieved clear evidence of benefit. Evidence for some socially mediated risk factors were identified, such as exposure to indoor air pollution and birth spacing, but still require the development of appropriate interventions. There is a need for additional studies on culturally appropriate behavioural interventions and clinical trials to increase smoking cessation and reduce exposure to smokeless tobacco. Balanced protein-energy supplementation was associated with reduced stillbirth rates, but larger well-designed trials are required to confirm findings. Peri-conceptional folic acid supplementation significantly reduces neural tube defects, yet no significant associated reductions in stillbirth rates have been documented. Evidence for other nutritional interventions including multiple micronutrient and Vitamin A supplementation is weak, suggesting the need for further research to assess potential of nutritional interventions to reduce stillbirths. Conclusion: Antenatal care is widely used in low- and middle-income countries, and provides a natural facility-based contact through which to provide or educate about many of the interventions we reviewed. The impact of broader socially mediated behaviors, such as fertility decision-making, access to antenatal care, and maternal diet and exposures like tobacco and indoor air pollution during pregnancy, are poorly understood, and further research and appropriate interventions are needed to test the association of these behaviours with stillbirth outcomes. For most nutritional interventions, larger randomised controlled trials are needed which report stillbirths disaggregated from composite perinatal mortality. Many antepartum stillbirths are potentially preventable in low- and middle-income countries, particularly through dietary and environmental improvement, and through improving the quality of antenatal care - particularly including diagnosis and management of high-risk pregnancies - that pregnant women receive. © 2009 Yakoob et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Wild and domestic ungulates modify their behaviour in the presence of olfactory and visual cues of predators but investigations have not exposed a domestic species to a series of cues representing various predators and other ungulate herbivores. We used wolf (Canis lupus), mountain lion (Puma concolor), and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) stimuli (olfactory and visual), and a control (no stimuli) to experimentally test for differences in behaviour of cattle (Bos taurus) raised in Arizona. We measured (1) vigilance, (2) foraging rates, (3) giving up density (GUD) of high quality foods and (4) time spent in high quality forage locations in response to location of stimuli treatments. In general, we found a consistent pattern in that wolf and deer treatments caused disparate results in all 4 response variables. Wolf stimuli significantly increased cattle vigilance and decreased cattle foraging rates; conversely, deer stimuli significantly increased cattle foraging rate and increased cattle use of high quality forage areas containing stimuli. Mountain lion stimuli did not significantly impact any of the 4 response variables. Our findings suggest that domestic herbivores react to predatory stimuli, can differentiate between stimuli representing two predatory species, and suggest that cattle may reduce antipredatory behaviour when near heterospecifics. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Bivalves are newly discovered models of natural aging. This invertebrate group includes species with the longest metazoan lifespan approaching 400 y, as well as species of swimming and sessile lifestyles that live just for 1 y. Bivalves from natural populations can be aged by shell growth bands formed at regular intervals of time. This enables the study of abiotic and biotic environment factors (temperature, salinity, predator and physical disturbance) on senescence and fitness in natural populations, and distinguishes the impact of extrinsic effectors from intrinsic (genetic) determinants of animal aging. Extreme longevity of some bivalve models may help to analyze general metabolic strategies thought to be life prolonging, like the transient depression of metabolism, which forms part of natural behaviour in these species. Thus, seasonal food shortage experienced by benthic filter feeding bivalves in polar and temperate seas may mimic caloric restriction in vertebrates. Incidence of malignant neoplasms in bivalves needs to be investigated, to determine the implication of late acting mutations for bivalve longevity. Finally, bivalves are applicable models for testing the implication of heterozygosity of multiple genes for physiological tolerance, adaptability (heterozygote superiority), and life expectancy. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={In vertebrates, stressors such as starvation or predator attacks stimulate the rapid elevation of circulating glucocorticoid hormones, triggering physiological and behavioral responses that aid immediate survival but simultaneously inhibit reproduction. This stress response has been proposed to serve as a physiological mediator of life-history trade-offs: when the value of current reproduction is high relative to the value of future reproduction and survival, a mitigated stress response is expected to enable successful breeding and maximize fitness. Using phylogenetic comparative analyses, we investigated baseline and peak stress-induced plasma corticosterone levels during parental care in 64 bird species. We found that (1) species with a higher value of the current brood relative to future breeding mounted weaker corticosterone responses during acute stress, and (2) females in species with more female-biased parental care had weaker corticosterone responses. These results support the brood value hypothesis, suggesting that the stress response evolves as an adaptive basis for life-history strategies. Further, we found that (3) baseline corticosterone correlated positively with brood value and negatively with body mass, and (4) peak corticosterone was greater in species breeding at higher latitudes. The latter findings suggest that circulating corticosterone concentrations might be matched to the anticipated demands and risks during nesting. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={Chemical defences against predation often involve responses to specific predation events where the prey expels fluids, such as haemolymph or gut contents, which are aversive to the predator. The common link is that each predation attempt that is averted results in an energetic cost and a reduction in the chemical defences of the prey, which might leave the prey vulnerable if the next predation attempt occurs soon afterwards. Since prey appear to be able to control the magnitude of their responses, we should expect them to trade-off the need to repel the current threat against the need to preserve defences against future threats and conserve energy for other essential activities. Here we use dynamic state-dependent models to predict optimal strategies of defence deployment in the juvenile stage of an animal that has to survive to maturation. We explore the importance of resource level, predator density, and the costs of making defences on the magnitude of the responses and optimal age and size at maturation. We predict the patterns of investment and the magnitude of the deployment of defences to potentially multiple attacks over the juvenile period, and show that responses should be smaller when the costs of defences and/or predation risk are higher. The model enables us to predict that animals in which defences benefit the adult stage will employ different strategies than those that do not use the same defences as adults, and thereby experience a smaller reduction in body size as a result of repeated attacks. We also explore the effect of the importance of adult size, and find that the sex and mating system of the prey should also affect defensive strategies. Our work provides the first predictive theory of the adaptive use of responsive defences across taxa. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={A chronology of food scares combined with a rapid, unchecked, rise in lifestyle-related diseases such as obesity highlights the need for a focus on effective food risk communication. However, food risk communication is highly complex. Many factors will affect its success, including the demeanour and conduct of the source, its transparency, interaction with the public, acknowledgement of risks and timely disclosure. How the message is developed is also important in terms of language, style and pretesting with target audiences, as is the choice of appropriate channels for reaching target audiences. Finally, there are many personal factors that may affect risk perception such as previous experience, knowledge, attitudes and beliefs, personality, psychological factors and socio-demographic factors, many of which remain unexplored. While there is evidence that campaigns that communicate health risk have been associated with behaviour change in relation to major public health and safety issues in the past, it is unknown at this stage whether targeting risk information based on risk-perception segmentation can increase the effectiveness of the messages.},

abstract={Introduction: Although food restriction is well known to increase ethanol intake, the subject has not been extensively studied in developing animals which could be more vulnerable to long-lasting effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to show some findings concerning this subject. Materials and methods: Food restriction was used to produce malnutrition either during lactation (lactating dams food restricted 60%) or after weaning (pups food restricted 60%). At weaning, day 25, males were assigned to one of the following groups: C, food ad libitum throughout the experiment - control group; MW, malnourished only after weaning; ML, malnourished only during lactation period; and MLW, malnourished throughout the experiment, during lactation and after weaning. All rats were kept isolated in cages in which they could choose to drink either a 10% ethanol solution or tap water (from days 25 to 45). Re-exposure to this model was performed on day 49. Between exposure and re-exposure, rats drank tap water for 4 days. Results: There was a significant effect of malnutrition during lactation, up to day 35, with heavy drinking patterns (ethanol intake day 2: C, 8 g/kg; MW, 9 g/kg; ML, 19 g/kg; and MLW, 22 g/kg). This heavy drinking pattern lasted until the recovery of body weight. Food restriction after weaning had significant effects after 14 days, when a statistically significant decrease in body weight occurred (body weight day 39: C, 147.8 g; MW, 98.5 g). Only rats which were persistently malnourished (MLW and MW) drank ethanol more significantly than their ad libitum-fed counterparts during the re-exposure period (ethanol intake: malnourished, 5 g/kg; and well-nourished, 2.5 g/kg). Adulteration of the ethanol solution with quinine (0.1 g/l) precluded the effect of malnutrition. Conclusions: Malnutrition during early development had no long-lasting effects on ethanol consumption. In addition, malnutrition increased ethanol consumption as long as it kept body weight low, which was apparently more significant in young animals. © W. S. Maney & Son Ltd 2009.},

abstract={Several studies have supported the idea that ionotropic glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA) is an important player in the etiology of psychopathologies, such as anxiety disorders and major depression. Additionally, studies have shown that ketamine induces antidepressant effects in humans as well as in rodents subjected to animal models of depression. In this context, the present study was aimed to evaluate behavioral and physiological effects of acute and chronic administration of ketamine, a NMDA receptor antagonist, in rats exposed to chronic mild stress (CMS). After 40 days of CMS, rats were treated with ketamine (15 mg/kg) and sweet food consumption, body and adrenal gland weight, corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic (ACTH) hormone levels, and hippocampal BDNF protein levels were assessed. Our findings demonstrated that CMS evoked anhedonia, induced hypertrophy of adrenal gland, impaired gain of body weight and increased corticosterone and ACTH circulating levels in rats. Acute and chronic treatment with ketamine reversed the increase in adrenal gland weight, promoted regain of body weight, and normalized corticosterone and ACTH circulating levels. Repeated, but not acute, administration of ketamine reversed anhedonia-like behavior, although the treatment with ketamine per se increased sweet food consumption in non-stressed rats. Finally, acute and chronic ketamine treatment did not alter hippocampal BDNF protein levels in stressed rats. In conclusion, these findings support the idea of a putative role of NMDA receptors in mood-related symptoms, and rapid and robust effects of ketamine in reverting mainly physiological alterations induced by chronic mild stressful situations in rats. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Humans and chimpanzees are unusual among primates in that they frequently perform group hunts of mammalian prey and share meat with conspecifics. Especially interesting are cases in which males give meat to unrelated females. The meat-for-sex hypothesis aims at explaining these cases by proposing that males and females exchange meat for sex, which would result in males increasing their mating success and females increasing their caloric intake without suffering the energetic costs and potential risk of injury related to hunting. Although chimpanzees have been shown to share meat extensively with females, there has not been much direct evidence in this species to support the meat-for-sex hypothesis. Here we show that female wild chimpanzees copulate more frequently with those males who, over a period of 22 months, share meat with them. We excluded other alternative hypotheses to exchanging meat for sex, by statistically controlling for rank of the male, age, rank and gregariousness of the female, association patterns of each male-female dyad and meat begging frequency of each female. Although males were more likely to share meat with estrous than anestrous females given their proportional representation in hunting parties, the relationship between mating success and sharing meat remained significant after excluding from the analysis sharing episodes with estrous females. These results strongly suggest that wild chimpanzees exchange meat for sex, and do so on a long-term basis. Similar studies on humans will determine if the direct nutritional benefits that women receive from hunters in foraging societies could also be driving the relationship between reproductive success and good hunting skills. © 2009 Gomes, Boesch.},

abstract={Domestication and selection for high production have selected animals with less energy-demanding behaviour. In the natural environment of the ancestors, fitness (reproductive success) is often favoured by an ability to locate and remember food sites, whereas in captivity, fitness may be more related to the ability to grow and reproduce efficiently under stable food conditions. We hypothesized that domestication and selection for production traits have caused animals to react less actively to food shortage. In this experiment, 26 red junglefowl (RJF) and 27 White Leghorn layers (WL), the latter selected for high egg production, were exposed to 0, 3 and 24 h of food deprivation while housed in furnished cages. After food deprivation, we quantified the bird's behaviour, in a series of tests. Birds of both breeds performed more foraging-exploring, less preening behaviour and less perching with increasing length of food deprivation. However, when tested in a group, RJF showed a more active response than WL to food shortage by reducing perching time and increasing the foraging and exploration time on the ground, which may be interpreted as a more risk-prone behaviour. Furthermore, when tested individually, there was a breed effect on response in the open field and the novel object tests, where RJF were more cautious than WL. The results may reflect different feeding strategies: the behaviour of RJF would probably be more adaptive in a natural environment, while the behaviour shown by WL may allow more investment in production traits in a more predictable environment. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an inherited disorder of branched-chain amino acid metabolism presenting with life-threatening cerebral oedema and dysmyelination in affected individuals. Treatment requires life-long dietary restriction and monitoring of branched-chain amino acids to avoid brain injury. Despite careful management, children commonly suffer metabolic decompensation in the context of catabolic stress associated with non-specific illness. The mechanisms underlying this decompensation and brain injury are poorly understood. Using recently developed mouse models of classic and intermediate maple syrup urine disease, we assessed biochemical, behavioural and neuropathological changes that occurred during encephalopathy in these mice. Here, we show that rapid brain leucine accumulation displaces other essential amino acids resulting in neurotransmitter depletion and disruption of normal brain growth and development. A novel approach of administering norleucine to heterozygous mothers of classic maple syrup urine disease pups reduced branched-chain amino acid accumulation in milk as well as blood and brain of these pups to enhance survival. Similarly, norleucine substantially delayed encephalopathy in intermediate maple syrup urine disease mice placed on a high protein diet that mimics the catabolic stress shown to cause encephalopathy in human maple syrup urine disease. Current findings suggest two converging mechanisms of brain injury in maple syrup urine disease including: (i) neurotransmitter deficiencies and growth restriction associated with branched-chain amino acid accumulation and (ii) energy deprivation through Krebs cycle disruption associated with branched-chain ketoacid accumulation. Both classic and intermediate models appear to be useful to study the mechanism of brain injury and potential treatment strategies for maple syrup urine disease. Norleucine should be further tested as a potential treatment to prevent encephalopathy in children with maple syrup urine disease during catabolic stress.},

abstract={Visually foraging planktivorous fish are prey of visual predators, and their foraging behaviour may be affected by light levels both in terms of gain and risk. The large seasonal change in day length throughout a subarctic summer at 69°N was used to show the influence of light on diel vertical migration (DVM) and shoaling patterns in a planktivorous fish assemblage consisting of two species (Coregonus lavaretus and Coregonus albula). Under the midnight sun in June, night and daytime behaviour was similar, with extensive shoaling and limited DVM. With increasingly darker nights towards autumn, the fish dispersed during the dark hours and showed more extensive DVM. Throughout the changing light regime of both the day and the season, the planktivores consistently chose depths with light levels compatible with visual foraging and reduced predation risk as revealed from reactive distance modelling of coregonids and their salmonid predators. The findings support the hypothesis that behavioural decisions are based on a trade-off between foraging rate and pre- dation risk, and increased predator avoidance behaviour towards autumn suggests that this trade-off is state-dependent.},

abstract={There is growing international interest in how environmental conditions experienced during development can shape adult phenotypes and the extent to which such induced changes are adaptive. One physiological system that links an individual to changes in environmental circumstances during development is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Mammalian studies have linked early postnatal stress to later changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; however, the physiological link [lactational corticosterone (CORT) transfer] between mother and offspring during postnatal development constrains the ability to determine the direct effects of such stressors on subsequent physiology and behavior. Here we present a novel model using an avian species, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), in which maternal hormonal transfer during postnatal development is likely to be absent. Postnatal exposure of chicks to the stress hormone CORT was manipulated for a 16-d period up until nutritional independence (28 d), and the long-term effects on the physiological response to stress determined. CORT doses were scaled to mimic the physiological response of juvenile birds to a capture-handling-restraint protocol. CORT-fed birds showed exaggerated and prolonged responses to acute stress at 60 d of age. Our results clearly demonstrate that postnatal stress has significant long-term effects on the physiological stress response in birds and provides a potential mechanism underlying long-term behavioural responses to developmental conditions. This study represents the first direct evidence for postnatal glucocorticoid programming of the stress response using this novel model for postnatal stress. This model therefore provides an important tool with which to investigate the role of glucocorticoids in shaping adult phenotypes. Copyright © 2009 by The Endocrine Society.},

abstract={Larvae of the grapevine moth Lobesia botrana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) are a major pest of vine, Vitis vinifera. As larvae have limited energy reserves and are in danger of desiccation and predation an efficient response to plant volatiles that would guide them to food and shelter could be expected. The responses of starved 2nd or 3rd instar larvae to volatile emissions from their artificial diet and to single host plant volatiles were recorded on a locomotion compensator. Test products were added to an air stream passing over the 30 cm diameter servosphere. The larvae showed non-directed walks of low rectitude in the air stream alone but changed to goal-oriented upwind displacement characterised by relatively straight tracks when the odour of the artificial diet and vapours of methyl salicylate, 1-hexanol, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, terpinen-4-ol, 1-octen-3-ol, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate were added to the air stream. This chemoanemotactic targeted displacement illustrates appetence for certain volatile cues from food by starved Lobesia larvae. Analysis of the larval behaviour indicates dose dependent responses to some of the host plant volatiles tested with a response to methyl salicylate already visible at 1 ng, the lowest source dose tested. These behavioural responses show that Lobesia larvae can efficiently locate mixtures of volatile products released by food sources as well as single volatile constituents of their host plants. Such goal-oriented responses with shorter travel time and reduced energy loss are probably of importance for larval survival as it decreases the time they are exposed to biotic and abiotic hazards. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Background: Depression in old age is an important public health problem causing considerable morbidity and disability worldwide. There is a dearth of community studies from India investigating geriatric depression and its associated risk factors. This study aimed to establish the nature, prevalence and factors associated with geriatric depression in a rural south Indian community. Methods: We recruited 1000 participants aged over 65 years from Kaniyambadi block, Vellore, India. We assessed their socio-demographic profile, psychiatric morbidity, cognitive functioning, anthropometrics and disability status using the following structured assessment tools: Geriatric Mental State, Community Screening Instrument for Dementia, Modified CERAD 10 word list learning task, History and Aetiology Schedule Dementia Diagnosis and Subtype, WHO Disability Assessment Scale II, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory. We adopted a case control framework to study the factors associated with geriatric depression. Results: Prevalence of geriatric depression (ICD-10) within the previous one month was 12.7% (95% CI 10.64-14.76%). Low income (OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.08-2.91), experiencing hunger (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.56-4.26), history of cardiac illnesses (OR 4.75; 95% CI 1.96-11.52), transient ischemic attack (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.17-5.05), past head injury (OR 2.70; 95% CI 1.36-5.36) and diabetes (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.15-4.72) increased the risk for geriatric depression after adjusting for other determinants using conditional logistic regression. Having more confidants (OR 0.13; 95% CI 0.06-0.26) was the significant protective factor. Age, female gender, cognitive impairment and disability status were not significantly associated with geriatric depression. DSM-IV diagnosis of major depression was significantly correlated with experiencing hunger, diabetes, transient ischemic attack, past head injury, more disability and less nourishment; having more friends was protective. Conclusions: Geriatric depression is prevalent in rural south India. Poverty and physical ill health are risk factors for depression among elderly while good social support is protective. © 2009 International Psychogeriatric Association.},

abstract={Encephalopathy due to hepatic or renal failure, electrolyte disturbances, or the administration of benzodiazepines and narcotics is commonly encountered, well reviewed in the literature, and, therefore, not usually missed. This article focuses on encephalopathies that were previously well described but may be overlooked by modern clinicians, as well as those that are still taught in the classroom but seldom thought of in practice. Due to the presumed relative rarity of these cases and emphasis on the well-memorized "classic" clinical presentations, these often treatable, and perhaps not so rare, encephalopathies due to systemic medical illness may go undiagnosed and untreated. Pancreatic encephalopathy, Wernicke's encephalopathy, and pellagra encephalopathy are reviewed in detail; cefepime and ifosfamide encephalopathies are discussed as examples of specific medication-induced encephalopathies. Septic encephalopathy, central pontine myelinolysis, and fat embolism syndrome are briefly reviewed. The encephalopathies reviewed have the potential for devastating neurological consequences if recognition and, therefore, treatment are delayed. Clinical improvement for many of these syndromes depends on prompt intervention. This article highlights some representative examples of less-commonly diagnosed metabolic and toxic encephalopathies.

abstract={GOALS: To determine whether personality traits and psychological characteristics are related to gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence in an adult population diagnosed with celiac disease (CD). BACKGROUND: Little research has examined psychological correlates of adherence to the GFD. STUDY: One hundred fifty-seven adults with biopsy-confirmed CD on the GFD for >3 months completed measures of personality and self-reported GFD adherence, provided a blood sample, and participated in an evaluation of GFD adherence conducted by an expert dietician at a clinical care center in a major teaching hospital in Boston, MA. RESULTS: An expert evaluation of GFD adherence remained the "gold standard" for measuring GFD adherence when compared with self-report and serology. Logistic regression results indicated that the following were independently associated with GFD adherence: conscientiousness (B=-0.04, SE=0.01, P<0.00), values (B=-0.10, SE=0.05, P<0.05), other food intolerances [odds ratio=0.28, 95% confidence interval=0.10-0.78], and CD symptoms (B=0.05, SE=0.02, P<0.03). A model accounting for these associations effectively predicted whether a participant was adherent or nonadherent on the basis of psychological and demographic/disease-specific factors. Successful prediction rates of GFD adherence for the final model were 75.8% for those rated to be adherent with the GFD and 54.5% for those rated to be nonadherent with the GFD. CONCLUSIONS: The model of psychological and demographic/disease- specific characteristics developed can be used to identify patients who may be at risk for poor dietary adherence to provide additional support, education, and encouragement to individuals with CD. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.},

abstract={Conditions experienced during early life can have profound effects on individual development and condition in adulthood. Differences in nutritional provisioning in birds during the first month of life can lead to differences in growth, reproductive success and survival. Yet, under natural conditions shorter periods of nutritional stress will be more prevalent. Individuals may respond differently, depending on the period of development during which nutritional stress was experienced. Such differences may surface specifically when poor environmental conditions challenge individuals again as adults. Here, we investigated long term consequences of differences in nutritional conditions experienced during different periods of early development by female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) on measures of management and acquisition of body reserves. As nestlings or fledglings, subjects were raised under different nutritional conditions, a low or high quality diet. After subjects reached sexual maturity, we measured their sensitivity to periods of food restriction, their exploration and foraging behaviour as well as adult resting metabolic rate (RMR). During a short period of food restriction, subjects from the poor nutritional conditions had a higher body mass loss than those raised under qualitatively superior nutritional conditions. Moreover, subjects that were raised under poor nutritional conditions were faster to engage in exploratory and foraging behaviour. But RMR did not differ among treatments. These results reveal that early nutritional conditions affect adult exploratory behaviour, a representative personality trait, foraging and adult's physiological condition. As early nutritional conditions are reflected in adult phenotypic plasticity specifically when stressful situations reappear, the results suggest that costs for poor developmental conditions are paid when environmental conditions deteriorate. © 2009 Krause et al.},

abstract={In tasks of associative learning, animals establish new links between unrelated items by using information about trial outcome to strengthen correct/rewarded associations and modify incorrect/unrewarded ones. To study how hippocampal neurons convey information about reward and trial outcome during new associative learning, we recorded hippocampal neurons as monkeys learned novel object-place associations. A large population of hippocampal neurons (50%) signaled trial outcome by differentiating between correct and error trials during the period after the behavioral response. About half these cells increased their activity following correct trials (correct up cells) while the remaining half fired more following error trials (error up cells). Moreover, correct up cells, but not error up cells, conveyed information about learning by increasing their stimulus-selective response properties with behavioral learning. These findings suggest that information about successful trial outcome conveyed by correct up cells may influence new associative learning through changes in the cell's stimulus-selective response properties. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The behavioral outcomes of a calorie restricted diet are often neglected in favour of a more physiological examination of the consequences of calorie restriction (CR). This is especially the case with social behavior. A few findings within the maternal CR literature suggest that adult male social behavior is altered by this regimen. Despite the paucity of findings within the maternal CR literature, a systematic investigation of the behavioral phenotype of males administered an adult-onset CR is completely lacking and was the focus of the current study. Adult male hooded Wistar rats were administered a three week CR, with one group receiving a 25% CR and another group receiving a 50% CR before male-to-male social behavior was examined and compared with ad libitium fed males. Various behavioral elements were modulated by CR, both the CR25% and 50% group initiated contact sooner and engaged in greater social activity compared to the ad libitum fed controls. The CR25% group also demonstrated less non-social (self-grooming) behavior and a greater frequency of walkovers compared to all groups, indicating a propensity towards dominance. The CR50% group demonstrated greater environmental assessment/exploration, as measured by the frequency of rearing. As with the maternal CR literature, an adult-onset chronic CR induces a more socially active behavioral phenotype and reduces interest in non-social behavior in the moderately CR group. Taken together, the social behavioral phenotype can be modulated by a CR initiated and maintained during adulthood. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The ability of dietary manipulation to influence learning and behavior is well recognized and almost exclusively interpreted as direct effects of dietary constituents on the central nervous system. The role of dietary modification on gut bacterial populations and the possibility of such microbial population shifts related to learning and behavior is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to examine whether shifts in bacterial diversity due to dietary manipulation could be correlated with changes in memory and learning. Five week old male CF1 mice were randomly assigned to receive standard rodent chow (PP diet) or chow containing 50% lean ground beef (BD diet) for 3 months. As a measure of memory and learning, both groups were trained and tested on a hole-board open field apparatus. Following behavioral testing, all mice were sacrificed and colonic stool samples collected and analyzed by automated rRNA intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) and bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) approach for microbial diversity. Results demonstrated significantly higher bacterial diversity in the beef supplemented diet group according to ARISA and bTEFAP. Compared to the PP diet, the BD diet fed mice displayed improved working (P = 0.0008) and reference memory (P < 0.0001). The BD diet fed animals also displayed slower speed (P < 0.0001) in seeking food as well as reduced anxiety level in the first day of testing (P = 0.0004). In conclusion, we observed a correlation between dietary induced shifts in bacteria diversity and animal behavior that may indicate a role for gut bacterial diversity in memory and learning. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Social associations with conspecifics can expedite animals' acclimation to novel environments. However, the benefits gained from sociality may change as the habitat becomes familiar. Furthermore, the particular individuals with whom animals associate upon arrival at a new place, familiar conspecifics or knowledgeable unfamiliar residents, may influence the type of information they acquire about their new home. To examine animals' social dynamics in novel habitats, we studied the social behaviour of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) translocated into a novel environment. We found that the translocated elephants' association with conspecifics decreased over time supporting our hypothesis that sociality provides added benefits in novel environments. In addition, we found a positive correlation between body condition and social association, suggesting that elephants gain direct benefits from sociality. Furthermore, the translocated elephants associated significantly less than expected with the local residents and more than expected with familiar, but not necessarily genetically related, translocated elephants. The social segregation between the translocated and resident elephants declined over time, suggesting that elephants can integrate into an existing social setting. Knowledge of the relationship between sociality and habitat familiarity is highly important in our constantly changing world to both conservation practice and our understanding of animals' behaviour in novel environments. © 2008 The Royal Society.},

abstract={This study introduces a novel scheme for the discrete high-frequency forced vibration analysis based on discrete singular convolution (DSC) and mode superposition (MS) approaches. The accuracy of the DSC-MS is validated for thin beams and plates by comparing with available analytical solutions. The performance of the DSC-MS is evaluated by predicting spatial distribution and discrete frequency spectra of the vibration response of thin plates with two different boundary conditions. The frequency spectra of the time-harmonic excitation forces are in the form of ideal and band-limited white noise so that the natural modes in the frequency band are provoked. The solution exposes high-frequency response behaviour definitely. Therefore, it is hoped with this paper to contribute the studies on the treatment of uncertainties in the high-frequency design applications. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The purinergic P2X7 receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel found on peripheral macrophages and microglia in the nervous system. Activation of P2X7 receptors results in the rapid release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Cytokines like IL-1β are suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression. The aim of this study was to behaviorally profile P2X7 receptor knockout (KO) mice in behavioral models of depression- and anxiety-like behaviors. P2X7 receptor KO and wild type (WT) mice were tested in multiple models including; forced swim test, tail suspension test, elevated plus maze, novelty suppressed feeding, spontaneous locomotor activity, and food intake. P2X7 receptor KO mice exhibited an antidepressant-like profile in tail suspension test and forced swim test; an effect that was not associated with changes in spontaneous locomotor activity. In addition, P2X7 receptor KO mice showed higher responsivity to a subefficacious dose of the antidepressant drug imipramine (15 mg/kg) in forced swim test. No significant differences between genotypes were observed in models of anxiety. These data support the relevance of pro-inflammatory cytokines in depressive-like states, and suggest that P2X7 receptor antagonists could be of potential interest for the treatment of affective disorders. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Background: Cholesterol may have a role in the pathophysiology of depression. Lowering cholesterol levels with statins reduces risks for cardiovascular events, and there is clinical evidence that statins exert neuroprotective properties not fully explained by their effects on serum cholesterol levels. Altered cholesterol levels can affect serotonergic neurotransmission, which might be involved in the clinical efficacy of standard antidepressants. Methods: We examined interactions between a statin (lovastatin) and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (fluoxetine) using the forced swim test (FST) in rats, a behavioral assay that identifies treatments with antidepressant effects in humans. Specifically, we determined if the addition of lovastatin to the diet would increase the efficacy of a subeffective dose of fluoxetine. Results: Rats maintained on a lovastatin-enriched diet for 30 days were more sensitive to the antidepressant-like effects of a low (subthreshold) dose of fluoxetine. The behavior of rats treated with this combination resembled that normally seen with higher doses of fluoxetine. No effects were observed in rats maintained on a lovastatin-enriched diet for 3 days. Conclusions: Lovastatin can augment the antidepressant-like effects of a low dose of fluoxetine in rats, raising the possibility that statins could be used to facilitate the effects of antidepressants in humans.},

abstract={Group foraging can be beneficial for ungulates by decreasing the time required for vigilance, but it can also prove costly because of competition. To determine responses to gregarious behaviour, we studied foraging activity and vigilance of impala (Aepyceros melampus) near Kruger National Park, South Africa. We measured time spent foraging, vigilant, moving, grooming, engaging in social interactions and determined herd size and group distribution (i.e. density). We calculated accepted food abundance (AFA), food ingestion rate, steps per minute and percent vigilance for female, bachelor male and herd male impala. There was no relationship between herd size and vigilance, but vigilance decreased with increasing density (t1,311 = 4.91, P &lt;0.0001). Additionally, AFA decreased (t1,61 = 5.96, P &lt;0.0001) and steps per minute increased (t1,311 = 14.38, P &lt; 0.0001) as more individuals fed in close proximity to each other. Impala could be altering their behaviour to accommodate a perceived change in resources because of intraspecific competition and these adjustments might be related more to the distribution of herd members than to herd size. Further studies should examine the behaviour of gregarious animals in relation to the distribution of herd members in addition to group size. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={Populations living in contaminated environments may exhibit behavioral changes that can alter predator-prey interactions. Blue crabs from the contaminated Hackensack Meadowlands (HM) had reduced ability to capture juvenile blue crabs and adult mummichogs (both active prey) compared with crabs from a reference site (Tuckerton (TK)). However, they consumed equivalent amounts of ribbed mussels and fiddler crabs, which are less active prey. Crabs may have reduced coordination rather than appetite or motivation. The lab data are supported by stomach analysis of field-caught crabs. HM crab stomachs contained ~60% algae, plant material, detritus, and sediment and much lower weights of crab, fish, and other live food than TK crabs. However, the relative absence of bivalves in their diet may reflect reduced amounts available. When TK crabs were caged in HM or fed food from HM in the lab for 8 weeks, their prey capture ability declined significantly, and mercury in their muscle tissue increased significantly, indicating that environmental factors were responsible for the behavioral differences. When HM crabs were caged in TK or fed fish from TK in the lab for 8 weeks, their prey capture ability improved significantly. Mercury levels were variable and did not show a significant decrease. © 2008 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.},

abstract={Profound impairment in social interaction is a core symptom of autism, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. Deficits can include a lack of interest in social contact and low levels of approach and proximity to other children. In this study, a three-chambered choice task was used to evaluate sociability and social novelty preference in five lines of mice with mutations in genes implicated in autism spectrum disorders. Fmr1 tm1Cgr/Y (Fmr1 -/y) mice represent a model for fragile X, a mental retardation syndrome that is partially comorbid with autism. We tested Fmr1 -/y mice on two genetic backgrounds, C57BL/6J and FVB/N-129/OlaHsd (FVB/129). Targeted disruption of Fmr1 resulted in low sociability on one measure, but only when the mutation was expressed on FVB/129. Autism has been associated with altered serotonin levels and polymorphisms in SLC6A4 (SERT), the serotonin transporter gene. Male mice with targeted disruption of Slc6a4 displayed significantly less sociability than wild-type controls. Mice with conditional overexpression of Igf-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) offered a model for brain overgrowth associated with autism. Igf-1 transgenic mice engaged in levels of social approach similar to wild-type controls. Targeted disruption in other genes of interest, En2 (engrailed-2) and Dhcr7, was carried on genetic backgrounds that showed low levels of exploration in the choice task, precluding meaningful interpretations of social behavior scores. Overall, results show that loss of Fmr1 or Slc6a4 gene function can lead to deficits in sociability. Findings from the fragile X model suggest that the FVB/129 background confers enhanced susceptibility to consequences of Fmr1 mutation on social approach. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society.},

abstract={American trypanosomiasis is a parasitic zoonosis that occurs throughout Latin America. The etiological agent, Trypanosoma cruzi, is able to infect almost all tissues of its mammalian hosts and spreads in the environment in multifarious transmission cycles that may or not be connected. This biological plasticity, which is probably the result of the considerable heterogeneity of the taxon, exemplifies a successful adaptation of a parasite resulting in distinct outcomes of infection and a complex epidemiological pattern. In the 1990s, most endemic countries strengthened national control programs to interrupt the transmission of this parasite to humans. However, many obstacles remain to the effective control of the disease. Current knowledge of the different components involved in elaborate system that is American trypanosomiasis (the protozoan parasite T. cruzi, vectors Triatominae and the many reservoirs of infection), as well as the interactions existing within the system, is still incomplete. The Triatominae probably evolve from predatory reduvids in response to the availability of vertebrate food source. However, the basic mechanisms of adaptation of some of them to artificial ecotopes remain poorly understood. Nevertheless, these adaptations seem to be associated with a behavioral plasticity, a reduction in the genetic repertoire and increasing developmental instability. © 2009 INRA EDP Sciences.},

abstract={Both rs17782313 (near MC4R) and rs1421085 (FTO) polymorphisms have been consistently associated with increased risk of obesity and with body mass index (BMI) variation. An effect of both polymorphisms on satiety has recently been suggested. We genotyped rs17782313 and rs1421085 in 5764 relatives from 1109 French pedigrees with familial obesity, 1274 Swiss class III obese adults as well as in 4877 French adults and 5612 Finnish teenagers from two randomly selected population cohorts. In all subjects, eating behaviour traits were documented through questionnaires. We first assessed the association of both single nucleotide polymorphisms with BMI and then studied eating behaviour. Under an additive model, the rs17782313-C MC4R allele showed a trend towards higher percentages of snacking in both French obese children (P=0.01) and Swiss obese adults (P=0.04) as well as in adolescents from the Finnish general population (P=0.04). In French adults with familial obesity, this allele tended to be also associated with a higher Stunkard hunger score (P=0.02) and in obese children with a higher prevalence of eating large amounts of food (P=0.04). However, no consistent association of the FTO rs1421085-C allele and available eating behaviour trait was found in our studied populations. The rs17782313-C allele nearby MC4R may modulate eating behaviour-related phenotypes in European obese and randomly selected populations, in both children and adults, supporting a regulatory role of this genetic variant on eating behaviour, as previously shown for MC4R non-synonymous loss-of-function mutations. The potential effect of the obesity-associated FTO gene on eating behaviour deserves additional investigation. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract={Mental health problems in women, children, and adolescents are a significant public health issue. Given current barriers to the effective treatment of these problems, researchers are looking to the field of nutrition for potential alternatives to better understand and address mental health issues. The purpose of this article was to review current evidence on the relation between zinc and mental health disorders with a focus on 2 mental health problems that commonly affect women and children: depression and attention-deficit hyper-activity disorder (ADHD). A literature search of the databases Medline and PsychInfo was conducted with the use of key terms. The review included articles from 1975 to May 2008, but focused on articles published in recent years. Relations between zinc concentrations and behavior in animals; the relation between zinc deficiency, depression, and ADHD in patient and community samples; and the potential biological mechanisms for these relations were explored. The data support a relation between low concentrations of zinc and mental health problems, especially in at-risk populations. Evidence for the potential use of zinc in treating mental health problems comes mainly from patient populations and is strongest when zinc is given in combination with pharmacologic treatment. Less conclusive evidence exists for the effectiveness of zinc alone or in general community samples. Recommendations for further research in this area are provided. © 2009 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Rationale: Two issues were addressed regarding the effects of amygdala dopamine manipulations on associative learning: first, an apparent contradiction between the effects of post- vs. pre-session dopaminergic manipulations and second, the ability of dopaminergic infusions to affect association formation vs. its expression following extended training. Objectives: The ability of pre-session infusions of a dopamine receptor agonist (R(+) 7-OH-DPAT) to inhibit acquisition of a conditioned approach response was examined and compared with the same manipulation following overtraining. Further experiments extended these findings. Materials and methods: Experiment 1 infused pre-session intra-amygdala R(+) 7-OH-DPAT (0, 0.1, 1 nmol) during conditioned approach acquisition. Experiment 2 applied pre-session intra-amygdala R(+) 7-OH-DPAT (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1 nmol) during expression of the same response, once well learned. Experiment 3 required the inhibition of a conditioned approach response following unconditioned stimulus (US) removal. Experiment 4 examined the ability of animals with prior drug experience to acquire a conditioned response to a novel stimulus. Results: Experiments 1-3 showed that pre-session amygdala R(+) 7-OH-DPAT impaired acquisition of either excitatory or inhibitory conditioned responding, but was ineffective following overtraining. Drug-induced impairments in acquisition of a specific conditioned stimulus (CS)-US relationship continued well beyond the cessation of drug treatment, but were found not to transfer to an alternate CS in Experiment 4. Conclusions: Pre-session dopamine receptor activation within the amygdala may impair the acquisition, but not expression, of CS-US associations. Enhanced learning reported earlier following post-session dopamine receptor activation may occur indirectly through reduced interference with the consolidation of recent learning.},

abstract={Artificially selected qualities can reduce fitness in a wild setting, thus feral domesticates should experience strong selective forces. Domestic sheep Ovis aries have frequently become feral on islands, which differ substantially from mainland environments. We examined changes in body mass and wool traits in feral sheep inhabiting Santa Cruz Island (SCI), California for ≥90 years. To elucidate the influence of nutrition, we compared the mass of feral island sheep with that of island sheep raised in farm conditions. We found that feral sheep on SCI were smaller than purported founder breeds, and that most documented populations of insular feral sheep worldwide have converged to similar body sizes (within 6 kg). SCI rams attained greater mass in farm conditions but ewes did not, suggesting phenotypic plasticity in ram body mass. Ewes exhibited self-shedding of wool at a greater frequency than rams, and sex differences and shedding patterns were consistent with thermoregulation and the risk of fly strike disease as benefits of wool loss. Pigmentation rates did not increase, further supporting the influence of heat stress on wool traits. These changes occurred in <25 generations and may have had a genetic basis, representing a potential example of rapid evolution in insular feral sheep. © 2008 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract={Fetal and neonatal programming is the phenomenon describing deviations from normal developmental patterns. These deviations can increase risks for diseases later in life and are an example of phenotypic plasticity seen throughout nature. For instance, infants born with low birth weight, as a marker of an unfavorable intrauterine environment, are programmed differently and may have an increased risk for multiple diseases in adulthood. These risks include coronary heart disease, increased insulin resistance, hypertension, and imbalances in the immune system. This article discusses mechanisms responsible for fetal and neonatal programming. We also introduce possible changes to current clinical management and practices that reflect the current findings of fetal and neonatal programming.

abstract={The primary goal of this article was to illustrate how nutritional deficiencies can translate into adult or child mental health problems. Whereas brain development and function play an essential role in the etiology and maintenance of mental health problems, what is required are models that go beyond nutrition-brain relations and integrate the contributions of nutritionally related contextual and behavioral characteristics. Four such models are presented. The multiple risks model derives from evidence showing covariance between nutritional deficiencies and other life stressors. Given that poorly nourished adults may be less able to actively cope with stressors, nutritional deficiencies may accentuate the negative impact of stress exposure on mental health. The cross-generational model is based on evidence showing less adequate patterns of mother-child interactions when mothers are poorly nourished. Impairments in mother-child interactions increase the likelihood of child mental health problems and the risk of subsequent child nutritional deficiencies. The attachment model derives from evidence showing that poorly nourished infants may be less likely to elicit the types of maternal child-rearing patterns that translate into secure infant-mother attachments. Insecure attachments in infancy are associated with an increased risk of both short-term and long-term child mental health problems. The temperament model is based on evidence documenting that certain patterns of infant temperament are related to an increased risk of later behavioral problems. Infant nutritional deficiencies can influence the development of temperament, and certain temperament patterns can contribute to an increased risk of infant nutritional deficiencies. © 2009 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Blue crabs are cannibalistic, and therefore the scent of injured conspecifics represents both a potential food cue, as well as an indicator of predation risk. We examined the response of blue crabs to conspecific odor alone, as well as in mixtures of attractive cues to determine how animals evaluate and respond to this odor. We explicitly manipulated risk-sensitivity based on either animal size (an indicator of susceptibility to predation) or hunger state (susceptibility to starvation) as ways to evaluate theories of risk-allocation, which suggest that decreases in predation risk, or increases in the risk of starvation, ought to result in diminished responses to sensory cues that signal predator presence or activity. Large and small blue crabs were challenged to locate the source of odor plumes consisting of the scent of injured conspecifics (risk cue), attractive food odors (attractive cue), or their mixture (conflicting cue). Neither large nor small blue crabs tracked aversive cues, but large blue crabs consistently tracked conflicting treatments to their source. Responses to conflicting and aversive treatments also involved diminished movement and reduced tracking speed relative to behaviors displayed in attractive plumes. Thus, even cannibalistic crabs seem to respond more prevalently to the apparent predation risk then to food reward, and risk-sensitive behaviors have a likely cost in terms of reduced food intake. Starved animals were more likely than unstarved animals to track conflicting plumes. Both the ontogenic shift and the response of starved animals support the notion that the cost of risk-aversive behaviors results in this strategy being allocated in proportion to the degree of potential risk. Since risk-aversive responses to chemical cues can produce strong effects in communities, the size-dependent nature of these responses in blue crabs may introduce considerable complexity in interactions between blue crabs, their predators, and their prey. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The processes promoting disease in wild animal populations are highly complex, yet identifying these processes is critically important for conservation when disease is limiting a population. By combining field studies with epidemiologic tools, we evaluated the relationship between key factors impeding southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) population growth: disease and resource limitation. This threatened population has struggled to recover despite protection, so we followed radio-tagged sea otters and evaluated infection with 2 disease-causing protozoal pathogens, Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis neurona, to reveal risks that increased the likelihood of pathogen exposure. We identified patterns of pathogen infection that are linked to individual animal behavior, prey choice, and habitat use. We detected a high-risk spatial cluster of S. neurona infections in otters with home ranges in southern Monterey Bay and a coastal segment near San Simeon and Cambria where otters had high levels of infection with T. gondii. We found that otters feeding on abalone, which is the preferred prey in a resource-abundant marine ecosystem, had a very low risk of infection with either pathogen, whereas otters consuming small marine snails were more likely to be infected with T. gondii. Individual dietary specialization in sea otters is an adaptive mechanism for coping with limited food resources along central coastal California. High levels of infection with protozoal pathogens may be an adverse consequence of dietary specialization in this threatened species, with both depleted resources and disease working synergistically to limit recovery. © 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract={Foraging theory seeks to explain how the distribution and abundance of prey influence the evolution of predatory behaviour, including the allocation of effort to searching for prey and handling them after they are found. While experiments have shown that many predators alter their behaviour phenotypically within individual lifetimes, few have examined the actual evolution of predatory behaviour in light of this theory. Here, we test the effects of prey density on the evolution of a predator's searching and handling behaviours using a bacterial predator, Myxococcus xanthus. Sixteen predator populations evolved for almost a year on agar surfaces containing patches of Escherichia coli prey at low or high density. Improvements in searching rate were significantly greater in those predators that evolved at low prey density. Handling performance also improved in some predator populations, but prey density did not significantly affect the magnitude of these gains. As the predators evolved greater foraging proficiency, their capacity diminished to produce fruiting bodies that enable them to survive prolonged periods of starvation. More generally, these results demonstrate that predators evolve behaviours that reflect at least some of the opportunities and limitations imposed by the distribution and abundance of their prey. © 2008 The Royal Society.},

abstract={1. The number of individuals involved in an invasion event, or 'propagule size', has a strong theoretical basis for influencing invasion success. However, rarely has propagule size been experimentally manipulated to examine changes in invader behaviour, and propagule longevity and success. 2. We manipulated propagule size of the invasive Argentine ant Linepithema humile in laboratory and field studies. Laboratory experiments involved L. humile propagules containing two queens and 10, 100, 200 or 1000 workers. Propagules were introduced into arenas containing colonies of queens and 200 workers of the competing native ant Monomorium antarcticum. The effects of food availability were investigated via treatments of only one central resource, or 10 separated resources. Field studies used similar colony sizes of L. humile, which were introduced into novel environments near an invasion front. 3. In laboratory studies, small propagules of L. humile were quickly annihilated. Only the larger propagule size survived and killed the native ant colony in some replicates. Aggression was largely independent of food availability, but the behaviour of L. humile changed substantially with propagule size. In larger propagules, aggressive behaviour was significantly more frequent, while L. humile were much more likely to avoid conflict in smaller propagules. 4. In field studies, however, propagule size did not influence colony persistence. Linepithema humile colonies persisted for up to 2 months, even in small propagules of 10 workers. Factors such as temperature or competitor abundance had no effect, although some colonies were decimated by M. antarcticum. 5. Synthesis and applications. Although propagule size has been correlated with invasion success in a wide variety of taxa, our results indicate that it will have limited predictive power with species displaying behavioural plasticity. We recommend that aspects of animal behaviour be given much more consideration in attempts to model invasion success. Secondly, areas of high biodiversity are thought to offer biotic resistance to invasion via the abundance of predators and competitors. Invasive pests such as L. humile appear to modify their behaviour according to local conditions, and establishment was not related to resource availability. We cannot necessarily rely on high levels of native biodiversity to repel invasions. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={Epidemiological data suggest that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) consumption may be inversely correlated to the prevalence and severity of depression but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we experimentally investigated whether a chronic supplementation with PUFA may induce antidepressant-like effects in mice in parallel to brain structural and molecular changes. Six weeks feeding with a PUFA-enriched diet induced behavioral changes in the Forced Swim Test (FST), the Tail Suspension Test and the Novelty-Suppressed Feeding Test. Moreover, more than 5 weeks supplementation with a PUFA blend containing 70% alpha-linolenic acid induced antidepressant-like effects in the FST with an increase in both swimming and climbing behaviors. The combination of a shorter duration of PUFA supplementation with a low dose of imipramine also induced an additive effect in the FST. Finally, PUFA supplementation was associated with an increase in the hippocampal volume, an over-expression of both synaptophysin and BDNF, and a raise in the number of newborn cells. Besides the possible modulation of brain plasticity, present results highlight the effectiveness of PUFA given alone or in combination with antidepressant drug as potential treatment of depressive disorders. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={1. Open population mark-recapture analysis of unbounded populations accommodates some types of closure violations (e.g. emigration, immigration). In contrast, closed population analysis of such populations readily allows estimation of capture heterogeneity and behavioural response, but requires crucial assumptions about closure (e.g. no permanent emigration) that are suspect and rarely tested empirically. 2. In 2003, we erected a double-sided barrier to prevent movement of snakes in or out of a 5-ha semi-forested study site in northern Guam. This geographically closed population of >100 snakes was monitored using a series of transects for visual searches and a 13 × 13 trapping array, with the aim of marking all snakes within the site. Forty-five marked snakes were also supplemented into the resident population to quantify the efficacy of our sampling methods. We used the program mark to analyse trap captures (101 occasions), referenced to census data from visual surveys, and quantified heterogeneity, behavioural response, and size bias in trappability. Analytical inclusion of untrapped individuals greatly improved precision in the estimation of some covariate effects. 3. A novel discovery was that trap captures for individual snakes consisted of asynchronous bouts of high capture probability lasting about 7 days (ephemeral behavioural effect). There was modest behavioural response (trap happiness) and significant latent (unexplained) heterogeneity, with small influences on capture success of date, gender, residency status (translocated or not), and body condition. 4. Trapping was shown to be an effective tool for eradicating large brown treesnakes Boiga irregularis (>900 mm snout-vent length, SVL). 5. Synthesis and applications. Mark-recapture modelling is commonly used by ecological managers to estimate populations. However, existing models involve making assumptions about either closure violations or response to capture. Physical closure of our population on a landscape scale allowed us to determine the relative importance of covariates influencing capture probability (body size, trappability periods, and latent heterogeneity). This information was used to develop models in which different segments of the population could be assigned different probabilities of capture, and suggests that modelling of open populations should incorporate easily measured, but potentially overlooked, parameters such as body size or condition. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={Behavioural field observations are increasingly being used in ecotoxicological research to identify potential adverse effects of exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs). We investigated thermal conditions inside the nest and parental behaviour of glaucous gulls, Larus hyperboreus, breeding in the Norwegian Arctic in relation to the concentrations of major classes of POPs (organochlorines, brominated flame retardants and metabolically derived products) accumulated in their blood. Most notably, nest temperature was negatively correlated with the concentrations of the sum of (Σ) DDT, ΣPCB and several quantitatively minor POP classes within the incubating parent. To investigate the relationship between incubation ability and parental POP exposure further, we experimentally increased the costs of incubation by artificially increasing the clutch size from two to four eggs. Clutch enlargement was followed by a decrease in nest temperature, but this drop in temperature was not associated with POP concentrations within the incubating parent. However, males, which had higher POP concentrations and lower white blood cell counts than females, seemed less able to maintain nest temperature. There was virtually no evidence to suggest that ΣPCB or ΣDDT were associated with changes in the time a bird spent incubating. However, there was some indication that nest site attendance by nonincubating males was negatively related to ΣDDT, suggesting that nest protection may have been compromised. The results suggest that adverse effects of parental POP exposure may occur through suboptimal thermal conditions for embryo development and possibly increased egg predation risk. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The study of breeding habitat selection has focused mainly on physical characteristics of the environment such as nest sites and food abundance, both of which are required for successful reproduction. However, individuals may have limited time to make settlement decisions, and thus, their knowledge of resource availability may be incomplete. Furthermore, food abundance during settlement may not reflect levels later in the breeding season. An alternative perspective is that the most direct measure of habitat suitability is derived from social information such as the presence of conspecifics (conspecific attraction) or their reproductive performance (habitat copying). We tested resource and socially based hypotheses of habitat selection in a population of eastern kingbirds, Tyrannus tyrannus, at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Oregon, U.S.A. Kingbirds nested in areas with a greater proportion of suitable nest trees than what was generally available, but many areas with suitable numbers of trees went unused. Kingbirds also settled in areas of relatively high insect abundance, but only in years when overall abundance was low. We also found support for the socially based hypotheses. Relative to where they nested previously, kingbirds tended to settle in areas of higher conspecific density. But, we found stronger evidence in favour of habitat copying, suggesting that dispersing individuals settled in areas that produced more fledglings in the previous year. Kingbirds thus appeared to select breeding habitat based, in part, on resource availability, but dispersal decisions may be influenced by social information, primarily past reproductive success of conspecifics. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Many herbivores and omnivores can balance their intake of macronutrients when faced with nutritionally variable environments. Carnivores, however, are widely believed to optimize their rates of prey capture and energy intake rather than balancing nutrients. We tested nutrient balancing in captive mink and found a pronounced ability to balance and regulate intake of protein and lipid. When faced with one of several different pairings of complementary foods varying in protein to lipid composition, mink apportioned intake between the two foods to defend a near constant ratio and amount (intake target) of the two macronutrients. When given only one food of fixed nutrient composition, mink balanced macronutrient intake relative to the intake target, without showing the excessive energy intake on diets with a low percentage of protein and energy deficit on diets with a high percentage of protein previously reported for herbivores and omnivores, including humans. This demonstration of nutrient balancing in a carnivorous mammal indicates that the capacity for nutrient balancing is a more general phenomenon across trophic levels than was hitherto believed to be the case. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Cage size is widely recognised as an important determinant of captive animal welfare, but in contrast, cage shape has received far less attention. Husbandry recommendations for flying birds state that cages should be long in shape because this allows greater potential for flight. However, so far no studies have investigated the impact of cage shape on the behaviour or welfare of captive flying birds. We measured the effects of cage size and shape on the condition and behaviour of captive wild-caught European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) using a 2 × 3 factorial design in which birds were individually housed for 1 week in cages of one of two volumes (either medium at 0.3 m3 or large at 1 m3), and one of three shapes (long with an aspect ratio (i.e. length/height) of 3.43), standard with an aspect ratio of 1.72 or tall with an aspect ratio of 0.86). We found effects of cage size and the interaction of cage size and shape on the behaviour and condition of birds. In interpreting the welfare implications of our results we focused on stereotypic behaviour as measured by incidence of somersaulting and a novel statistic that quantifies sequential dependencies in the birds' locations within the cage. The lowest measures of stereotypic behaviour were recorded in the large cages and the medium long cage. Cage shape was more important in determining the quantity of stereotypic behaviour in the medium cages than the large cages. Our findings support the recommendation that starlings be housed in long-shaped cages. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The objective of the present experiment was to determine the implications of prenatal undernutrition on the behaviour of juvenile lambs. Dams of one group (C) were fed 100% of the recommended requirements throughout pregnancy, while those of two other groups were fed 50% of the control nutrient allowance during the first 30 days of pregnancy (R1) or 50% of the control nutrient allowance from days 31-100 of pregnancy (R2). Between 2 and 5 months old, behaviour of lambs was tested by the implementation of 2 types of test: isolation and novelty. There were no statistical differences between lamb treatments in escape behaviour and heart rates during isolation test, or the latency to approach a novel or a familiar object in the novelty test in tests conducted at 2, 3, 4 and 5 months of age. Male lambs showed a tendency of turning to the right-hand side of the test pen, irrespective of treatment group, between the age of 2 and 5 months old. A greater proportion of C compared to R1 males turned right at the age of 2 and 5 months old (P < 0.05). Significant differences concerning laterality were found also between C and R1 female lambs at the age of 2 and 4 months old (P < 0.001), between C and R2 male lambs at the age of 2 months old (P < 0.05), between C and R2 female lambs at the age of 4 and 5 months old (P < 0.01), between R1 and R2 male lambs at the age of 2 and 5 months old (P < 0.05) and between R1 and R2 female lambs at the age of 2 months old (P < 0.001). It is concluded that prenatal undernutrition during different periods of pregnancy had no effect on fear-related behaviour, but effect on laterality at the early stages of lamb age between 2 and 5 months old. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Recent human functional MRI (fMRI) studies have revealed that two widely distributed groups of cortical areas display inverse changes in activity when attentional demands increase, with one group showing higher (task-on) and the second lower (task-off) blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals. Moreover, task-on and task-off regions also exhibit slow (<0.2 Hz) inversely correlated fluctuations in BOLD signal at rest. However, the neuronal correlates of these reciprocal BOLD signal fluctuations are unknown. Here, we addressed this question using simultaneous recordings of unit activity and local field potentials (LFPs) in the cat homologues of task-on and task-off regions. In all states of vigilance, LFP power was lower in task-off than task-on regions with no difference in firing rates. Both sets of regions displayed slow (0.5-0.15 Hz) cyclical modulations in LFP power in all frequency bands but with large and variable phase differences such that task-on and task-off regions were often anticorrelated. Inversely correlated LFP power fluctuations were state-dependent in that they were much more frequent in waking and paradoxical sleep than in slow-wave sleep. Moreover, consistent with fMRI findings, when attentional demands increased, LFP power in task-on and task-off regions changed in opposite directions, further augmenting and decreasing, respectively. At odds with previous fMRI studies, however, the decreased LFP power in task-off regions was associated with increased firing rates, suggesting that the engagement of task-off regions might not be reduced but in fact enhanced during attention.

abstract={Eating is not only triggered by hunger but also by the sight of foods. Viewing appetizing foods alone can induce food craving and eating, although there is considerable variation in this "external food sensitivity" (EFS). Because increased EFS is associated with overeating, identifying its neural correlates is important for understanding the current epidemic of obesity. Animal research has identified the ventral striatum, amygdala, hypothalamus, medial prefrontal and premotor cortices as key interacting structures for feeding. However, it is unclear whether a similar network exists in humans and how it is affected by EFS. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we showed that viewing appetizing compared with bland foods produced changes in connectivity among the human ventral striatum, amygdala, anterior cingulate and premotor cortex that were strongly correlated with EFS. Differences in the dynamic interactions within the human appetitive network in response to pictures of appetizing foods may determine an individual's risk of obesity.

abstract={Cape Gannets Morus capensis are declining in numbers in all breeding colonies at the southern African west coast, potentially caused by deteriorating food availability. The behavioural responses of individuals to changing conditions can provide insights into the mechanisms that drive population dynamics. We studied the relationship between parental provisioning behaviour and the breeding success of Cape Gannets breeding at Ichaboe Island (Namibia) in two years with different nesting success, to assess the potential role of variation in food availability in explaining variation in chick survival. In 2006/07 parents delayed the onset of breeding and visited nests at a lower frequency than in 2005/06, indicating that food availability was limited. Within the years individual differences in provisioning rate but not in parental condition were associated with chick growth and survival. These associations remained present when controlling for seasonal changes. Predation, not starvation, was the main cause of mortality. Under poor conditions, as indicated by long foraging trips, Cape Gannet parents left small chicks unattended, resulting in many being killed by Kelp Gulls Larus domínicanus. Long foraging trips were associated with reduced average breeding success, but impacted some parents more than others. Knowledge of the origin of this inter-individual variability is needed to predict how changes in food availability affect seabird population dynamics, which is one of the steps towards conservation of these birds.},

abstract={We examined effects of seasonality, larval food availability and larval rearing density on sperm length, sperm transfer rates and body size in the bivoltine scorpionfly Panorpa vulgaris. Males of the first annual generation were larger and had larger sperm. Comparing individuals of two summer generations showed that adult males resulting from group bred, ad libitum fed larvae were larger but had smaller sperm than males resulting from singly kept, food deprived larvae. Thus, sperm size is not a simple function of body size. Instead, we suggest that sperm size modification was caused by varying rearing densities. Group bred individuals produced smaller sperm but transferred at higher rate. This indicates a trade-off between sperm number and sperm size as predicted by evolutionary models of sperm production. Given the strong influence of larval history in our present work, we recommend that future studies investigating the consequences of varying sperm competition risk or intensity on male gametic strategies should also control for larval history in order to avoid distorting effects. © 2003 Institute of Entomology.},

abstract={Predation is a strong selective force with both direct and indirect effects on an animal's fitness. In order to increase the chances of survival, animals have developed different antipredator strategies. However, these strategies have associated costs, so animals should assess their actual risk of predation and shape their antipredator effort accordingly. Under a stressful situation, such as the presence of predators, animals display a physiological stress response that might be proportional to the risk perceived. We tested this hypothesis in wild European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), subjected to different predator pressures, in Doñana National Park (Spain). We measured the concentrations of fecal corticosterone metabolites (FCM) in 20 rabbit populations. By means of track censuses we obtained indexes of mammalian predator presence for each rabbit population. Other factors that could modify the physiological stress response, such as breeding status, food availability and rabbit density, were also considered. Model selection based on information theory showed that predator pressure was the main factor triggering the glucocorticoid release and that the physiological stress response was positively correlated with the indexes of the presence of mammalian carnivore predators. Other factors, such as food availability and density of rabbits, were considerably less important. We conclude that rabbits are able to assess their actual risk of predation and show a threat-sensitive physiological response. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

Low levels of leptin indicating food deprivation and depleted fat stores have been identified as the strongest signals to induce adaptive biological actions such as increased energy intake and reduced energy expenditure. In concert with other signals from the gut and metabolically active tissues, low leptin levels trigger powerful activation of multiple peripheral and brain systems to restore energy balance. It is not just neurons in the arcuate nucleus, but many other brain systems involved in finding potential food sources, smelling and tasting food, and learning to maximize rewarding effects of foods, that are affected by low leptin. Food restriction and fat depletion thus lead to a ‘hungry’ brain, preoccupied with food. By contrast, because of less (adaptive thrifty fuel efficiency) or lost (lack of predators) evolutionary pressure, the upper limits of body weight/adiposity are not as strongly defended by high levels of leptin and other signals. The modern environment is characterized by the increased availability of large amounts of energy-dense foods and increased presence of powerful food cues, together with minimal physical procurement costs and a sedentary lifestyle. Much of these environmental influences affect cortico-limbic brain areas concerned with learning and memory, reward, mood and emotion. Common obesity results when individual predisposition to deal with a restrictive environment, as engraved by genetics, epigenetics and/or early life experience, is confronted with an environment of plenty. Therefore, increased adiposity in prone individuals should be seen as a normal physiological response to a changed environment, not in the pathology of the regulatory system. The first line of defense should ideally lie in modifications to the environment and lifestyle. However, as such modifications will be slow and incomplete, it is equally important to gain better insight into how the brain deals with environmental stimuli and to develop behavioral strategies to better cope with them. Clearly, alternative therapeutic strategies such as drugs and bariatric surgery should also be considered to prevent or treat this debilitating disease. It will be crucial to understand the functional crosstalk between neural systems responding to metabolic and environmental stimuli, i.e. crosstalk between hypothalamic and cortico-limbic circuitry. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract={To maximize their growth, grazers should shift their behavior to balance the cues from predators and periphyton in the field. As a stream grazer seeks periphyton that are heterogeneously distributed, a shift in its behavior on the basis of the intensity of microalgal cues would be beneficial as it would allow the grazer to feed on more periphyton. Using a caddisfly grazer, Glossosoma larvae, we conducted a laboratory channel experiment with upstream experimental plates having four levels of periphyton abundance (control, low, medium, and high), and we recorded the movement behavior of the larvae. As periphyton abundance increased, both larval crawling time and the total crawling distance to the periphyton patch significantly decreased and the directness of the crawling path significantly increased. That is, larvae crawled in various directions as they approached a relatively low-abundance periphyton patch, whereas they crawled straight to the high-abundance periphyton patch in a short time. The behavior change was likely due to the detection of some microalgal cue, which should intensify with an increase in upstream periphyton abundance. © 2009, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

It is reported more frequently by patients with restricting-type anorexia nervosa than with other eating disorders. It is associated with higher eating disorder psychopathology, dietary restraint, general psychopathlogy, and specific personality features (ie, higher levels of perfectionism, persistence, and lower novelty seeking). It is a potent maintaining mechanism of eating disorder psychopathology, and it increases the risk of overuse injuries, bone fractures, and cardiac complications. It also appears to be a predictor of poor treatment outcome.

abstract={One of the main functions of exploratory behaviour is to gain information about the environment. The adaptive value of such behaviour should vary with ecological conditions influencing the diversity and stability of resources, as well as with the costs associated with gathering information. Consequently, predictions can be made about environmental factors influencing the evolution of exploration. We used comparative methods, combining a field experiment with literature data, to study correlated evolution between explorative behaviour and ecology among 13 species of Darwin's finches. Controlling for phylogenetic influences, we found that exploration (measured as the proportion of individuals responding in the experiment) increased with diet diversity and the amount of fruit in diet, consistent with theories stating that exploration aimed at finding new food types should be more beneficial for generalists than for specialists. However, our study is the first to demonstrate a correlation between neophilia and food diversity. Contrary to our prediction, species with a high percentage of concealed food in their diet were less on the discovery of new food types. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.},

abstract={Average longevity in free-living edible dormice (Glis glis) can reach 9 years, which is extremely high for a small rodent. This remarkable life span has been related to a peculiar life history strategy and the rarity of reproductive bouts in these seed eaters. Most females (96%) reproduce only once or twice in their lifetime, predominantly during years of mast seeding of, e.g., beech, but entire populations can skip reproduction in years of low seed availability. Surprisingly, in non-reproductive years, large fractions of populations apparently vanished and were never captured above ground. Therefore, we determined the duration of above-ground activity, and body temperature profiles in a subset of animals, of dormice under semi-natural conditions in outdoor enclosures. We found that non-reproductive dormice returned to dormancy in underground burrows throughout summer after active seasons as short as <2 weeks. Thus, animals spent up to >10 months per year in dormancy. This exceeds dormancy duration of any other mammal under natural conditions. Summer dormancy was not caused by energy constraints, as it occurred in animals in good condition, fed ad libitum and without climatic stress. We suggest that almost year-round torpor has evolved as a strategy to escape birds of prey, the major predators of this arboreal mammal. This unique predator-avoidance strategy clearly helps in explaining the unusually high longevity of dormice. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Objective: The authors sought to evaluate psychiatric comorbidity, subjective quality of life, and impact of psychopathology on quality of life measures in a clinical sample of patients attending a center for the diagnosis and treatment of obesity compared to a matched sample of non-obese subjects. Methods: Two hundred ninety-three consecutive obese patients (48 males, 245 females, mean age 45.41 ± 13.55 yrs; mean BMI 35.60 ± 6.20) were compared with a control group made of 293 non obese subjects (48 males, 245 females, mean age 45.66 ± 13.86 yrs; mean BMI 21.8 ± 2.06); all subjects were interviewed by means of SCID I and SCID II and completed the WHO-QoL-Bref, a self-administered instrument for evaluation of subjective quality of life. Results: Obesity was associated with a significant lifetime major risk both for axis I (OR = 3.47, p = 0.000) and axis II disorders (OR = 2.27, <i>p = 0.000); obesity was also associated with significantly lower measures of subjective quality of life on physical, social, and psychological domains; comorbidity with axis I/II disorders was associated with lower QoL measures on WHO-QoL-Bref, in particular among obese patients. Conclusions: Obesity is significantly associated with a significant major risk of psychiatric comorbidity and poor quality of life; comorbid mental disorders play a significant role in worsening quality of life of obese patients; a multimodal approach to the treatment of obesity, including psychiatric evaluation and intervention, is needed to improve quality of life of patients.},

abstract={BACKGROUND:: Recent evidence suggests that G protein-coupled receptors, especially those linked to Gαi, contribute to the mechanisms of anesthetic action. Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins bind to activated Gαi and inhibit signal transduction. Genomic knock-in mice with an RGS-insensitive Gαi2 G184S (Gαi2 GS) allele exhibit enhanced Gαi2 signaling and provide a novel approach for investigating the role of Gαi2 signaling and RGS proteins in general anesthesia. METHODS:: We anesthetized homozygous Gαi2 GS/GS and wild-type (WT) mice with isoflurane and quantified time (in seconds) to loss and resumption of righting response. During recovery from isoflurane anesthesia, breathing was quantified in a plethysmography chamber for both lines of mice. RESULTS:: Gαi2 GS/GS mice required significantly less time for loss of righting and significantly more time for resumption of righting than WT mice. During recovery from isoflurane anesthesia, Gαi2 GS/GS mice exhibited significantly greater respiratory depression. Poincaré analyses show that GS/GS mice have diminished respiratory variability compared with WT mice. CONCLUSION:: Modulation of Gαi2 signaling by RGS proteins alters loss and resumption of wakefulness and state-dependent changes in breathing.

abstract={Recent epidemic increases in the U.S. prevalence of obesity and diabetes are a consequence of widespread environmental changes affecting energy balance and its regulation. These environmental changes range from exposure to endocrine disrupting pollutants to shortened sleep duration to physical inactivity to excess caloric intake. Overall, we need a better understanding of the factors affecting individual susceptibility and resistance to adverse exposures and behaviors and of determinants of individual response to treatment. Obesity and diabetes prevention will require responding to two primary behavioral risk factors: excess energy intake and insufficient energy expenditure. Adverse food environments (external, nonphysiological influences on eating behaviors) contribute to excess caloric intake but can be countered through behavioral and economic approaches. Adverse built environments, which can be modified to foster more physical activity, are promising venues for community-level intervention. Techniques to help people to modulate energy intake and increase energy expenditure must address their personal situations: health literacy, psychological factors, and social relationships. Behaviorally oriented translational research can help in developing useful interventions and environmental modifications that are tailored to individual needs. © Diabetes Technology Society.},

abstract={The use of hormonal contraception is commonly associated with weight gain. The purpose of this retrospective study was to explore the association between the use of hormonal contraception and weight change in an outpatient adolescent patient population in Lexington, Kentucky. Data were gathered from the charts of 259 adolescent female patients seen in an outpatient adolescent clinic for up to 72 months. At the initial visit, all patients were evaluated for risk-taking behavior and received preventive counseling. Patients were categorized as either contraception users or non-users (control group). Contraception users were subdivided into Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA) user group or non-DMPA contraception user group. The latter group included patients using oral contraceptive pills, transdermal contraceptive patch, intravaginal contraceptive ring, or other forms of hormonal contraception. Following the initial visit, all contraception users (DMPA and non-DMPA) visited the clinic every three- or six-months for follow-up. During the follow-up visits, patient weight was recorded and the patient received counseling services by a physician, a licensed psychologist, and/or a nutritionist as deemed appropriate. Data were entered in Microsoft Excel and analyzed using Statistical Analysis Software. The results showed no significant difference in weight gain between groups. We hypothesize that hormonal contraception in adolescent patients, coupled with clinical intervention in form of counseling and regular monitoring, over an extended period (longer than 24 months) is not associated with significant weight gain. © 2009, by Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co.

abstract={Chronic stress can affect human health through a myriad of behavioral and biochemical pathways. This review focuses on some key hormonal and metabolic pathways that appear important today. In modern society, we are faced with excessive psychological stress, as well as an epidemic of overeating, and the two together appear to have synergistic effects. Chronic stress can lead to overeating, co-elevation of cortisol and insulin, and suppression of certain anabolic hormones. This state of metabolic stress in turn promotes abdominal adiposity. Both the direct stress response and the accumulation of visceral fat can promote a milieu of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. This biochemical environment appears to be conducive to several cell aging mechanisms, mainly dampening telomerase and leading to telomere length (TL) shortening and cell senescence. Immune cell telomere shortness is linked with many chronic disease states and earlier mortality. In this way, chronic stress may influence a variety of diseases through a biochemical cascade leading to immune cell senescence. Certain psychological temperaments at high risk of this stress cascade (mainly anxiety prone), gene-environment interactions, and potential interventions for interrupting the stress-aging cascade are discussed.},

abstract={Early dietary habits are formative for dietary habits later in life. Maternal personality might be an important factor in unhealthy feeding of children. The current study aims to assess the degree to which the personality trait of negative affectivity in mothers predicts their child's diet at age 18 months. This study is a part of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study conducted at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. A total of 27 763 mothers completed 3 repeated assessments of negative affectivity before and after childbirth and of the child's diet when the child was 18 months old. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the dietary patterns, and structural equation modeling was used to investigate the relationship with negative affectivity adjusted for socio-demographical variables. Exploratory factor analysis of a foods frequency questionnaire revealed two dietary patterns in the child, labeled unhealthy diet and wholesome diet. The unhealthy diet comprised foods rich in sugar and fat; the wholesome diet comprised foods rich in fibre, vitamins and minerals. Mothers high in negative affectivity were more inclined to feed their child an unhealthy diet. The results were adjusted for maternal age, years of education, relative income, marital status, number of children, having the child in daycare, maternal smoking, maternal body mass index, and child gender. This study shows that a maternal personality trait, negative affectivity, is related to feeding the child an unhealthy diet after controlling for key socio-demographic variables. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Our dramatically changed food environment—since periods in our history when food sources were highly constrained—has presented new challenges for obesity research. For example, these alterations have strongly emphasized the physiological differences between the homeostatic and the hedonic regulation of food intake—the latter being largely responsible for the pronounced increase in obesity in the past few decades. There is also increasing agreement that compulsive overeating shares many parallels with addiction disorders such as drug abuse. These factors have also fostered a renewed interest in identifying individual differences in personality and motivational systems that increase the risk for overeating and weight gain in our population. Reward sensitivity has been the focus of a recent body of compelling research, with evidence favoring two seemingly opposite points of view. On the one hand, studies have found support for a link between low reward sensitivity and obesity, whereas other evidence suggests that a strong appetitive motivation leads to overeating and weight gain. Arguments are provided to reconcile these apparently disparate theories. Finally, the role of impulsivity and its links with symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder are discussed, as well as their respective roles in the risk profile for obesity. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract={Some mammals, including laboratory mice, enter torpor in response to food deprivation, and leptin can attenuate these bouts of torpor. We previously showed that dopamine β-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh -/-) mice, which lack norepinephrine (NE), do not reduce circulating leptin upon fasting nor do they enter torpor. To test whether the onset of torpor in mice during a fast requires a NE-mediated reduction in circulating leptin, double mutant mice deficient in both leptin (ob/ob) and DBH (DBL MUT) were generated. Upon fasting, control and ob/ob mice entered torpor as assessed by telemetric core Tb acquisition. While fasting failed to induce torpor in Dbh -/- mice, leptin deficiency bypassed the requirement for NE, as DBL MUT mice readily entered torpor upon fasting. These data indicate that sympathetic activation of white fat and suppression of leptin is required for the onset of torpor in the mouse. Emergence from torpor was severely retarded in DBL MUT mice, revealing a novel, leptin-independent role for NE in torpor recovery. This phenotype was mimicked by administration of a β3 adrenergic receptor antagonist to control mice during a torpor bout. Hence, NE signaling via β3 adrenergic receptors presumably in brown fat is the first neurotransmitter-receptor system identified that is required for normal recovery from torpor. © 2008 Swoap et al.},

abstract={An important component of learned behaviour is the ability to forecast positive or negative outcomes based on specific sensory cues. Predictive capacity is typically manifested by appropriate behavioural patterning. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying behavioural plasticity are poorly understood. Caenorhabditis elegans displays experience-dependent behavioural responses by associating distinct environmental signals. We find that ASIC-1, a member of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel family, which localizes at presynaptic terminals of dopaminergic neurons, is required for associative learning in C. elegans. ASIC-1 functions in these neurons to amplify normal dopaminergic signalling, necessary for associative learning. Our results reveal a novel role of DEG/ENaC ion channels in neuronal communication by enhancing the activity of dopaminergic synapses. Similar mechanisms may facilitate synaptic plasticity in vertebrates. © 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Context: Identifying effective obesity treatment is both a clinical challenge and a public health priority due to the health consequences of obesity. Objective: To determine whether common decision errors identified by behavioral economists such as prospect theory, loss aversion, and regret could be used to design an effective weight loss intervention. Design, Setting, and Participants: Fifty-seven healthy participants aged 30-70 years with a body mass index of 30-40 were randomized to 3 weight loss plans: monthly weigh-ins, a lottery incentive program, or a deposit contract that allowed for participant matching, with a weight loss goal of 1 lb (0.45 kg) a week for 16 weeks. Participants were recruited May-August 2007 at the Philadelphia VA Medical Center in Pennsylvania and were followed up through June 2008. Main Outcome Measures: Weight loss after 16 weeks. Results: The incentive groups lost significantly more weight than the control group (mean, 3.9 lb). Compared with the control group, the lottery group lost a mean of 13.1 lb (95% confidence interval [CI] of the difference in means, 1.95-16.40; P=.02) and the deposit contract group lost a mean of 14.0 lb (95% CI of the difference in means, 3.69-16.43; P =.006). About half of those in both incentive groups met the 16-lb target weight loss: 47.4% (95% CI, 24.5%-71.1%) in the deposit contract group and 52.6% (95% CI, 28.9%-75.6%) in the lottery group, whereas 10.5% (95% CI, 1.3%- 33.1%; P=.01) in the control group met the 16-lb target. Although the net weight loss between enrollment in the study and at the end of 7 months was larger in the incentive groups (9.2 lb; t=1.21; 95% CI, -3.20 to 12.66; P=.23, in the lottery group and 6.2 lb; t=0.52; 95% CI, -5.17 to 8.75; P=.61 in the deposit contract group) than in the control group (4.4 lb), these differences were not statistically significant. However, incentive participants weighed significantly less at 7 months than at the study start (P=.01 for the lottery group; P=.03 for the deposit contract group) whereas controls did not. Conclusions: The use of economic incentives produced significant weight loss during the 16 weeks of intervention that was not fully sustained. The longer-term use of incentives should be evaluated.

abstract={Recent theory suggests that animals should switch facultatively among canonical movement modes as a complex function of internal state, landscape characteristics, motion capacity, and navigational capacity. We tested the generality of this paradigm for free-ranging elk (Cervus elaphus) over 5 orders of magnitude in time (minutes to years) and space (meters to 100 km). At the coarsest spatiotemporal scale, elk shifted from a dispersive to a home-ranging phase over the course of 1-3 years after introduction into a novel environment. At intermediate spatiotemporal scales, elk continued to alternate between movement modes. During the dispersive phase, elk alternated between encamped and exploratory modes, possibly linked to changes in motivational goals from foraging to social bonding. During the home-ranging phase, elk movements were characterized by a complex interplay between attraction to preferred habitat types and memory of previous movements across the home-range. At the finest temporal and spatial scale, elk used area-restricted search while browsing, interspersed with less sinuous paths when not browsing. Encountering a patch of high-quality food plants triggered the switch from one mode to the next, creating biphasic movement dynamics that were reinforced by local resource heterogeneity. These patterns suggest that multiphasic structure is fundamental to the movement patterns of elk at all temporal and spatial scales tested. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract={Song is a learned vocal behavior influenced by social interactions. Prior work has suggested that the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), a specialized pallial-basal ganglia circuit critical for vocal plasticity, mediates the influence of social signals on song. Here, we investigate the signals the AFP sends to song motor areas and their dependence on social context by characterizing singing-related activity of single neurons in the AFP output nucleus LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium). We show that interaction with females causes marked, real-time changes in firing properties of individual LMAN neurons. When males sing to females ("directed"), LMAN neurons exhibit reliable firing of single spikes precisely locked to song. In contrast, when males sing alone ("undirected"), the same LMAN neurons exhibit prominent burst firing and trial-by-trial variability. Burst structure and timing vary substantially across repeated undirected trials. Despite context-dependent differences in firing statistics, the average pattern of song-locked firing for an individual neuron is similar across behavioral contexts, suggesting a common underlying signal. Different LMAN neurons in the same bird, however, exhibit distinct firing patterns, suggesting that subsets of neurons jointly encode song features. Together, our findings demonstrate that behavioral interactions reversibly transform the signaling mode of LMAN neurons. Such changes may contribute to rapid switching of motor activity between variable and precise states. More generally, our results suggest that pallial-basal ganglia circuits contribute to motor learning and production through multiple mechanisms: patterned signals could guide changes in motor output while state-dependent variability could subserve motor exploration.

As predicted, unmitigated agency was positively associated with uncontrolled eating, and unmitigated communion was positively related to emotional eating and fasting for at least 24 h in order to control weight. When controlling for depressive symptomatology, unmitigated communion was no longer associated with emotional eating. Whereas unmitigated agentic and communal characteristics were positively associated with problematic eating patterns, agency was negatively associated with fasting and body shape concern.

abstract={Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) in the diet reduce risk of cardiac mortality. Fish oils are a dietary source of LC-PUFAs (EPA, DHA) but intake is low in Western diets. Adding beneficial amounts of LC-PUFAs to foods is limited by their instability and potential to impart off-flavors. Stearidonic acid (SDA), a precursor of EPA in man, is more stable than EPA/DHA in food matrices. SDA is present in fish oils (0.5-4%) and in nutraceuticals (echium, borage oil). Genes for Δ6, Δ15 desaturases were introduced into soybeans that convert linoleic and α-linolenic acid to SDA (15-30% fatty acids). Since addition of SDA soybean oil into human foods increases SDA intake, toxicology studies were undertaken to assess its safety. In a 28-day pilot study, rats were gavaged with SDA soybean oil at dosages up to 3 g/kg body weight/day; no treatment-related adverse effects were observed. A 90-day/one generation rat reproduction study was subsequently conducted where SDA soybean oil was added to diets to provide daily doses of 1.5 and 4 g/kg body weight. There were no treatment-related adverse effects on parental animals or on reproductive performance and progeny development. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this paper I review the contributions of analytic and experimental research on intraguild predation and interspecific competition to our understanding of population regulation in plethodontid salamanders. Henry Wilbur's model of population regulation in amphibians serves as a framework for the arguments. Much of the discussion is based on studies of eastern North American plethodontids that have been the focus of most of the research. Ensembles of plethodontids in this region include species with complex life cycles (i.e., larval development) and simple life cycles (i.e., direct development). Interactions between members of these two life-history categories appear to be weaker than those within categories. Whereas there is no definitive evidence of factors that regulate populations of plethodontid salamanders, interspecific competition and intraguild predation do appear to contribute in some ensembles. Food and space have been identified as limiting resources in interspecific competition. Although predation of larger on smaller salamanders may be relatively rare in nature, the threat of predation appears to promote behavioral responses in members of the smaller species that reduce risks but may lower fitness through other effects. The role of extralimital predators and competitors in regulation of these salamanders is largely untested. Ideally, future research should involve manipulative experiments on unenclosed field plots that examine effects of resources, intraguild competitors and predators, and extralimital predators on populations of key species of plethodontids. © 2008 by The Herpetologists' League, Inc.},

abstract={Aphid predators are a systematically disparate group of arthropods united on the basis that they consume aphids as part of their diet. In Europe, this group includes Araneae, Opiliones, Heteroptera, chrysopids, Forficulina, syrphid larvae, carabids, staphylinids, cantharids and coccinellids. This functional group has no phylogenetic meaning but was created by ecologists as a way of understanding predation, particularly for conservation biological control. We investigated whether trait-based approaches could bring some cohesion and structure to this predator group. A taxonomic hierarchy-based null model was created from taxonomic distances in which a simple multiplicative relationship described the Linnaean hierarchies (species, genera, etc.) of fifty common aphid predators. Using the same fifty species, a functional groups model was developed using ten behavioural traits (e.g. polyphagy, dispersal, activity, etc.) to describe the way in which aphids were predated in the field. The interrelationships between species were then expressed as dissimilarities within each model and separately analysed using PROXSCAL, a multidimensional scaling (MDS) program. When ordinated using PROXSCAL and then statistically compared using Procrustes analysis, we found that only 17% of information was shared between the two configurations. Polyphagy across kingdoms (i.e. predatory behaviour across animal, plant and fungi kingdoms) and the ability to withstand starvation over days, weeks and months were particularly divisive within the functional groups model. Confirmatory MDS indicated poor prediction of aphid predation rates by the configurations derived from either model. The counterintuitive conclusion was that the inclusion of functional traits, pertinent to the way in which predators fed on aphids, did not lead to a large improvement in the prediction of predation rate when compared to the standard taxonomic approach. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={Coordination of animal behavior with reproductive status is often achieved through elaboration of hormones by the gonad. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, adult males explore their environment to locate mates. Mate searching is regulated by presence of mates, nutritional status, and a signal from the gonad. Here we show that the gonadal signal acts via the nuclear receptor DAF-12, a protein known to regulate several C. elegans life-history traits. DAF-12 has both activational and organizational functions to stimulate exploratory behavior and acts downstream of the gonadal signal, outside of the gonad. DAF-12 acts upstream of sensory input from mating partners and physiological signals indicating nutritional status. Mate searching was rescued in germ-line ablated animals, but not if both germ line and somatic gonad were ablated, by a precursor of the DAF-12 ligand, dafachronic acid (DA). The results are interpreted to suggest that the germ line produces a DA precursor that is converted to DA outside of the germ line, possibly in the somatic gonad. As it does in other pathways in which it functions, in regulation of male mate searching behavior DAF-12 acts at a choice point between alternatives favoring reproduction (mate searching) vs. survival (remaining on food).

abstract={With reference primarily to the 'Five Freedoms' defined by the Farm Animal Welfare Council (London, UK), the present chapter reviews the behavioural and physiological welfare requirements of domestic piglets from birth until weaning: (1) comfort and housing requirements; (2) nutrition and welfare; (3) viability and health; (4) behavioural needs; and (5) fear, stress and suffering. The general aim is to evaluate the effects of housing and management practices on the biological responses (behaviour, physiology, health, performance) of piglets in relation to their needs. Suitable and practicable modifications are put forward for the improvement of welfare under commercial production conditions. Whereas serious welfare problems directly caused by nutrition and disease are less prevalent because of their obvious and immediate economic impacts, some welfare impairments still occur that result from psychobiological suffering and insufficient attention to the comfort requirements and behavioural needs of piglets. Some of the aspects that can help to improve the piglet welfare are discussed in this chapter. High mortality of piglets after farrowing is a major problem. This can be countered by ensuring adequate design of the farrowing environment to minimise the risk of crushing, by providing an optimal thermal environment and sufficient and comfortable lying space for all piglets, and by increasing supervision at farrowing and during the suckling period. The detrimental effects of tail docking, teeth resection and castration on welfare can be diminished by modifying or improving the techniques themselves; by using analgesic protocols; and by promoting the development of general and local anaesthetics that alleviate both acute and chronic pain. The abrupt weaning of piglets has been linked to many critical aspects of welfare (e.g. aggression, rearrangement of environment and feed) which can be improved by implementing a more gradual weaning process using sow-controlled systems and/or mixing of piglets prior to weaning. In addition, these alternative housing practices combined with environmental enrichment allow the animals to display more of their natural behavioural repertoire and to experience various stimuli which can help to prevent boredom and behavioural disorders. © Wageningen Academic Publishers, The Netherlands 2008.},

abstract={Rationale: The polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are a group of aliphatic amines that may act as physiological modulators of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a glutamate receptor implicated in memory formation and consolidation. Arcaine is a competitive antagonist of the polyamine binding site at the NMDA receptor, the post-training administration of which impairs memory of various tasks. Objectives: In this study, we investigated whether the administration of arcaine and MK-801 alters the memory of the step-down inhibitory avoidance task, and whether the effects of these NMDA antagonists involve state-dependency mechanisms, in adult male Wistar rats. Results: The administration of arcaine (30 mg/kg, i.p.) or MK-801 (0.03 mg/kg, i.p.) immediately after training impaired inhibitory avoidance performance at testing. Arcaine- and MK-801-induced performance impairment was reversed by the administration of arcaine (30 mg/kg, i.p.) and MK-801 (0.03 mg/kg, i.p.), respectively, 30 min before testing. Response transfer also occurred if arcaine substituted MK-801 at testing, and vice-versa. Conclusion: These results suggest that arcaine and MK-801 induce state-dependent recall and that, probably due to their ability to decrease NMDA receptor function, one drug can substitute for the other at testing, demonstrating a cross-state dependency between arcaine and MK-801. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The relationship of stress to physical illness is generally accepted in dealing with other common (acute and chronic) disease entities such as hypertension and heart attack, stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, and peptic ulcers. In a few instances, behavioral therapy including meditative stress management is commonly accepted, reimbursed and routinely taught as part of the plan of care. The relevance of stress reduction in wound healing is compelling on a cellular level with demonstrated activation of those key dermal immune cells (i.e. lymphocytes and macrophages); and on blood perfusion to the affected area. Improvement of 'self efficacy' and empowerment of the wounded person could also improve perceived quality of life, and affect tissue healing as well as pain. The problem with behavioral therapy is that it requires change. Change is incredibly difficult for people as we re-learned while trying to implement this small project. It is ironic that ulcers on the skin, even when the health care system itself has caused them (often in the case of pressure ulcers), do not yet qualify for the same consideration as other chronic illnesses despite all the evidence. Further research on why and how to integrate holistic care including stress management for persons with chronic ulcers is needed to encourage more mainstream acceptance and use. Though results of this small exploration were inconclusive, extrapolation from the literature suggests good support for the hypothesis that guided relaxation with mindful breathing can help patients with chronic wounds in at least one of three ways: 1) perceived quality of life (decreasing depression/anxiety), 2) relief from pain, and 3) wound tissue repair.. Thoughts and suggestions follow about making small studies such as that of the authors more feasible: Time management: Is formal stress management instruction too complicated for a busy physician-based practice? Roberta Lee et al note that "The complexity of achieving successful treatment in chronic illness remains a challenge for both doctor and patient because it must be addressed in an existing medical system that sustains a narrow focus. The 'healing tools' of time, touch and rapport that constituted a major part of how physicians traditionally cared for chronically ill patients remain undervalued and uncompensated in our current system" (21). Care of chronic wounds requires longer office visits than most chronic illnesses due to the complicated assessment and topical care required, along with multiple co-morbidities which must be addressed during the same visit. Adding stress management instruction in an environment of low reimbursement and tight time pressure is a challenge but the authors believe it can be done with careful time management, and assessment of results. Design of study: A research grant would allow a more formal study. It is possible that a 'hermeneutic phenomenological' study would be a helpful model to use for research on this subject. This model concentrates on the study of consciousness and the objects of direct experience. The recent study done by Kohr et al examines the relational aspects between caregivers and persons with chronic wounds and concluded that »strengthening the therapeutic relationship between patient and nurse may have a positive impact on healthcare providers' pain management practices and patient quality of life«. One of the ways mentioned in this article to address wound pain, in addition to pain medication and appropriate topical care, is stress management instruction both for the patient and for the caregiver. The cited article may be the first of its kind in wound healing. We need evidence, but the problems with implementing classical scientific research in studying issues related to subjective experience and consciousness are recognized. Lee et al point out that conventional research methodology, while often appropriate, »does not easily accommodate multiple variables that cannot be reduced without ... disallowing and dismantling the synergy that is often at the core of integral care«. Patient education: Patients need clearly written information about why stress management is important, in a manner that accommodates differences in individual cognitive function and healing challenges (e.g. personality, level of awareness, depression, anxiety, self esteem); health beliefs and experiences (locus of control, self efficacy); demographics (social situation, education, age, culture, support systems); and complexity of treatments. Kapat-Zinn offers simple explanations that provide a reference to help people understand the physiological processes they need to visualize for effective stress management. Time to think over a possible therapy/instruction with written or other acceptably formatted information is important for gaining adherence in a study. Templates for teaching could be standardized and then quickly tailored and reviewed during each visit with the patient. Patient Assessment: Morison et al offer an excellent comparison of concepts, characteristics and learning implications related to health beliefs, locus of control, and self-efficacy. Ciechanowsky suggests that clinician behavior should be modified to accommodate individual patients' relationship style, which can be assessed using the Relationship Scales Questionnaire (download at http://www.sfu.ca/psyc/faculty/ bartholomew/selfreports.htm) He encourages clinicians to »ask themselves how much they unwittingly co-create 'difficult patients« and suggests that routine screening for depression and anxiety is important because they are »associated with poor collaboration, lower patient satisfaction, a greater number of missed appointments, and less trust in providers...« Appropriate screening at start-of-care will help the clinician and patient plan care productively, and should also foster a more effective and valid study. Location of study: Teaching stress management techniques in the home may not be the optimal approach. Group meetings may be possible with a younger group but not as likely with elderly or disabled homebound. Patient instruction incorporated into the office visit rather than at home might enhance retention. The results of this preliminary study, although inconclusive, are significant in revealing the problems researchers face in studying the effects of mental processes on healing. An efficient screening protocol that would begin at patient start-of-care by assessing quality of life, patient priorities, learning ability and relationship style may make provision of integral care more realistic. This would involve a small but necessary philosophical shift in our care focus, which could begin in small but important ways by helping patients mobilize healthy responses to difficult health challenges such as pressure ulcers in ways that are both practical and effective. These reasonable procedures and recommendations can be suggested from our exploration: Assess, acknowledge and treat ulcer pain appropriately with medication as well as topically with moisture retentive dressings and pain-reducing modalities. Offer a sense of control, empowerment and hope to patients and families through an openly collaborative relationship style. Touch, eye contact, acknowledgement of patient issues and making compromises can all be done during regular clinical care. Develop a contemplative practice of some kind for one's own stress management. Teach a simple deep breathing exercise to the patient and family. A small post-operative spirometer (a form of biofeedback) might help with stress reduction and improved lung capacity, and tissue oxygenation. Provide thorough explanations and images with colorful graphics of cells doing their work during care and while teaching self care. This will help patient involvement in otherwise mysterious processes. Explain the rationale and expected results of a topical or surgical modality to improve chances of success through guided visualization. Seek out and offer options for other simplified versions of cognitive therapy as needed. Develop simple educational material to explain how it works to improve patient willingness to try it. Advise and recommend appropriate food and nutritional supplements based on available integrative medical data. This cannot do harm and might help elevate mood, satisfaction with meals, and healing potential. Refer to and encourage use of integrative practitioners (this is already underway in some hospitals) when possible. Take seriously, the value that Complementary & Alternative Medicine may add to the healing process. Carefully review the patient's medications and use drug therapy for major depression appropriately and judiciously. When possible, try cognitive and behavioral therapy first or adjunctive to pharmacological measures. Recognize the value of the Placebo Effect, and when possible encourage this mysterious inner healing ability. Perhaps we could call it the 'PNI Cascade', or the 'ESH Effect' to avoid the stigma of 'placebo'. In this preliminary study, the authors attempted to find a way to mobilize this 'Enhancement of Self Healing' (ESH) for wound healing and to empower individuals in their quest for optimal wellness. The authors found that it requires continuous self-examination of beliefs, attitudes and approach while providing clinical care. There really is no doubt that the stress cascade retards wound healing; it has been found to be true time and again. Dacher teaches that unless clinicians can figure out how to practice what they want to teach it will not be possible to influence change. Integral practice demands that the practitioner be a teacher and coach as well as diagnostician and interventionist. »We are the tools; our work cannot be reduced to a technique. An integral medical practice changes the practitioner first«.},

abstract={Environmental change can increase the vulnerability of aquatic species to toxic chemicals by challenging an organism's aptitude to respond to chemicals or to repair toxic injury or by modifying animal behaviours like migration or predation. On the other hand, xenobiotics may affect the capacity of aquatic species to adapt to environmental challenges that come with change (e.g., pathogens, temperature). Across Canada we have identified a number of circumstances where chemicals and environmental variability have likely worked together to affect vulnerability of aquatic organisms. For example in the Maritimes, exposure to municipal wastewater or bleached kraft pulp mill effluent altered immune function in bivalves and increased their risk of developing haemocytic neoplasia, a disease known to cause high mortality. Northwest Atlantic cod stocks have experienced large-scale changes in environment and exhibit marked seasonal cycles in energy reserves. The risk associated with subsequent redistribution of persistent chemicals in the body together with nutritional deficiency is presently under evaluation since it could affect the recovery of these endangered stocks. In the Great Lakes, the introduction of an invasive fish species, the alewife, modified the diet of salmonids, which led to a deficiency of the vitamin thiamine in eggs causing early mortality. Contaminants may interact with thiamine deficiency and thus critically impair recruitment of salmonids. Viewing the risks presented by toxic chemicals from the point of view of species vulnerability, offers managers opportunities to mitigate such risks, for example, through habitat, ocean and fisheries management. Further research is needed to develop biomarkers of vulnerability, identify most vulnerable life stages and populations, to understand the interactions between global environmental changes, nutritional status, pathogens and toxic chemicals, and to develop integrated approaches to manage vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems to toxic chemicals. © 2008 NRC Canada.},

abstract={Objective: To review the human and veterinary literature regarding the neurophysiology of dyspnea and to provide evidence for the beneficial effects of several novel therapies aimed at the alleviation of dyspneic sensations. Data Sources Data sources included scientific reviews, case reports, original research publications, and recent research conference proceedings. Human Data Synthesis The use of blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging technology has revealed that the brain regions activated by air hunger in humans are also those activated by fear, pain, and thirst perception. In human subjects, it has been found that agents known to enhance the firing of pulmonary slowly adapting receptors (SARs) can alleviate the sensation of dyspnea without altering central respiratory drive. Several small studies have also shown that nebulized opioids can reduce the sensation of dyspnea apparently via activation of peripheral opioid receptors in the lung. Veterinary Data Synthesis There are several animal models relevant to both small and large animal clinical patient populations. Treatment of rats with a nebulized SAR sensitizing agent (furosemide) enhances SAR firing in response to lung inflation. Behavioral escape responses to airway occlusion are reduced in lightly anesthetized cats when treated with nebulized furosemide. Opioid agonists have been shown to inhibit the release of acetylcholine and other mediators from the airways of dogs and guinea pigs. Studies using a goat model with bilateral destruction of the pre-Bötzinger Complex do not support current paradigms of air hunger origination. Conclusions Veterinary patients may benefit from an approach to dyspnea that incorporates an understanding of the origins of the unpleasant sensations associated with the condition. Several novel therapies have shown promise in alleviating dyspneic sensations without altering respiratory drive. Further study is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of these therapies in veterinary patients. © Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2008.},

abstract={Background: Sensitivity to reward has been implicated as a predisposing factor for behaviors related to drug abuse as well as overeating. However, the underlying mechanisms contributing to reward sensitivity are unknown. We hypothesized that a dysregulation in dopamine signaling might be an underlying cause of heightened reward sensitivity whereby rewarding stimuli could act to normalize the system. Methods: We used a genetic mouse model of increased reward sensitivity, the ΔFosB-overexpressing mouse, to examine reward pathway changes in response to a palatable high-fat diet. Markers of reward signaling in these mice were examined both basally and following 6 weeks of palatable diet exposure. Mice were examined in a behavioral test following high-fat diet withdrawal to assess the vulnerability of this model to removal of rewarding stimuli. Results: Our results demonstrate altered reward pathway activation along the nucleus accumbens-hypothalamic-ventral tegmental area circuitry resulting from overexpression of ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens and striatal regions. Levels of phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (pCREB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and dopamine and cyclic adenosine monophosphate regulated phosphoprotein with a molecular mass of 32 kDa (DARPP-32) in the nucleus accumbens were reduced in ΔFosB mice, suggestive of reduced dopamine signaling. Six weeks of high-fat diet exposure completely ameliorated these differences, revealing the potent rewarding capacity of a palatable diet. ΔFosB mice also showed a significant increase in locomotor activity and anxiety-related responses 24 hours following high-fat withdrawal. Conclusions: These results establish an underlying sensitivity to changes in reward related to dysregulation of ΔFosB and dopamine signaling that can be normalized with palatable diets and may be a predisposing phenotype in some forms of obesity. © 2008 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract={This chapter introduces the basic concepts of genes and genetic studies to clinicians. Some of the relevant methods and issues in genetic epidemiology studies are briefly discussed with an emphasis on single nucleotide polymorphism based association studies which are currently the main focus of clinical and translational genetics. Genetics is the fundamental basis of any organism so understanding of genetics will provide a powerful means to discover hereditary elements in disease etiology. In recent years, genetic studies have shifted from disorders caused by a single gene (e.g. Huntington's disease) to common multi-factorial disorders (e.g. hypertension) that result from the interactions between inherited gene variants and environmental factors, including chemical, physical, biological, social, infectious, behavioral or nutritional factors. A new field of science, Genetic Epidemiology emerged in the 1960s as a hybrid of genetics, biostatistics, epidemiology and molecular biology, which has been the major tool in establishing whether a phenotype (any morphologic, biochemical, physiologic or behavioral characteristic of an organism) has a genetic component. A second goal of genetic epidemiology is to measure the relative size of that genetic effect in relation to environmental effects. Morton and Chung defined genetic epidemiology as a science that deals with the etiology, distribution, and control of disease in groups of relatives, and with inherited causes of disease in populations.1 In the era of a known human genome sequence, genetic epidemiology methods have been instrumental in identifying the contribution of genes, the environment and their interactions to better understanding disease processes. Genomic scientists have predicted that comprehensive, genomic-based care will become the norm, with individualized preventive medicine, early detection of illnesses and tailoring of specific treatments to genetic profile. Practicing physicians and health professionals need to be knowledgeable in the principles, applications, and limitations of genetics to understand, prevent, and treat any biological disorders in their everyday practice. The primary objective of any genetic research is to translate information from individual laboratory specimen and build inferences about the human genome and its influence on the risk of disease. This chapter will focus on the fundamental concepts and principles of genetic epidemiology that are important to help clinicians understand genetic studies. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2008.},

abstract={Noncardiac or unexplained chest pain can be defined as recurrent angina-like or substernal chest pain thought to be unrelated to the heart after a reasonable cardiac evaluation. We examined the personality profiles of patients complaining of noncardiac chest pain (NCCP) and healthy control subjects using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), and determined whether the data acquired were related to the depressive status of the patients. We assessed 70 patients (ages 18-65 years) referred to a cardiology practice with NCCP. Eighty control subjects, matched for age, gender, and education level, were included in the study. Each subject was evaluated with TCI, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The TCI assesses four dimensions of temperament, namely, novelty seeking, harm avoidance, reward dependence and persistence and three dimensions of character, being self-directedness, cooperativeness and self-transcendence. We found higher harm avoidance scores and lower self-directedness and cooperativeness scores in patients group than those in healthy control subjects. High harm avoidance scores were associated with high depression level. However, all the character subdimensions were associated with an elevated level of depression. In the stepwise regression model, the presence of NCCP was determined by harm avoidance and self-directedness levels. These findings suggest state and trait dependence of harm avoidance, and strong state dependence of self-directedness scores in NCCP patients. When interpreting data regarding personality measured by the TCI in NCCP patients, the effects of depressive symptomatology should be taken into account. © Universitätsverlag Ulm GmbH 2008.},

abstract={Background. Whether alexithymia is a personality trait that increases the risk of major depression (MD) is still debated. In this prospective study, alexithymic levels were evaluated before, during and after a depressive episode. Method. The alexithymic levels, the presence of MD and the severity of anxious-depressive symptoms were evaluated at intervals of about 1 month in pregnant women attending the Centers for Prenatal Care, using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS), the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results. Sixteen women affected by MD, 21 affected by subthreshold depression and 112 non-depressed women were included in the study. Women who developed depression, compared to non-depressed women, showed similar TAS and HADS scores during the pre-morbid phase, a significant increase in the scores during depression and a significant decrease after remission, whereas no change was observed in non-depressed women. Conclusions. Our data suggest that in pregnant women alexithymia does not represent a personality trait that increases the risk of developing a depressive episode, and they support the hypothesis that alexithymia is a state-dependent phenomenon in depressed pregnant women. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={Based on the literature we have reviewed here, we offer the following conclusions concerning African American women and their risk for eating disorders. Eating disorders have become increasingly more prevalent due in part to societal pressure on women to be thin in order to be viewed as attractive. However, African American women appear to experience some cultural protection against the pressure for thinness and hence against eating disorders that emphasize weight control (anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa). Within African American culture, one attains beauty through one's personal style, one's personality, and one's pride and self-confidence. Thinness thus plays a far less important role for African American women. Moreover, there is less pressure by the community to fit into a narrow definition of what others consider beautiful. The African American community embraces greater acceptance of the female body, no matter the size, with the result that African American women tend to view their own bodies with greater acceptance and satisfaction. Furthermore, for those women who become members of black Greek sororities, an additional layer of protection is provided. The Greek community encourages its members to develop strong ethnic identities, so members may be less influenced by the pressures of mainstream society. In addition, black Greek sororities encourage their members to be proud of being strong African American women. We believe that this sense of strength in one's identity as a woman reduces one's vulnerability to external definitions of what is ideal or what is attractive. In sum, based on the research on eating disorders within the black Greek community, it appears that this group advocates a healthier outlook toward weight and dieting and a positive outlook toward ethnic identity. Thus, membership in black sororities can only aid in the quest for positive examples of ethnicity, body size, and shape, in turn reducing the risk for eating disorders within the African American community. Black Greek-letter organizations appear to be quite relevant with respect to this important health issue, and one can only hope that they will remain a viable source of support for the next generation of African American college women. Although many researchers have found that disordered eating is generally less prevalent among African American women, this should not be taken to mean that African American women are immune to eating disorders. African American women may be at increased risk for eating disorders that do not emphasize thinness, such as binge eating and obesity. It is an important service to African American women to emphasize these disorders and to point out the lower rates of health-promoting behaviors and exercise among them. At present, we know nothing about African American sororities' impact on the risk for these disorders. Finally, it is essential to recognize that there are some African American women with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Studies have shown that such women are often misdiagnosed or diagnosed late because these disorders are less frequent in African American women. This could have a strong adverse effect on these women, because the longer treatment is delayed, the more severe the eating problem becomes due to the extended process of starvation.64 Therefore, it is crucial to encourage African American women who are experiencing eating disorder symptoms to seek help and be treated.

abstract={Stereotyped behaviors have been routinely used as characters for phylogeny inference, but the same cannot be said of the plastic aspects of performance, which routinely are taken as a result of ecological processes. In this paper we examine the evolution of one of these plastic behavioral phenotypes, thus fostering a bridge between ecological and evolutionary processes. Foraging behavior in spiders is context dependent in many aspects, since it varies with prey type and size, spider nutritional and developmental state, previous experience and, in webweavers, is dependent on the structure of the web. Reeling is a predatory tactic typical of cobweb weavers (Theridiidae), in which the spider moves the prey toward her by pulling the capture thread (gumfoot) to which it is adhered. Predatory reeling is dependent on the gumfoot for its expression, and has not been previously reported in orbweavers. In order to investigate the evolution of this web dependent behavior, we built artificial, pseudogumfoot lines in orbwebs and registered parameters of the predatory tactics in this modified web. Aspects of the predatory tactics of 240 individuals (12 species in 4 families) were measured, and the resulting data were optimized on the phylogeny of Orbiculariae. All species perform predatory reeling with the pseudogumfoot lines. Thus, predatory reeling is homologous for the whole Orbiculariae group. In nature, holes made by insects in ecribellate orbs produce pseudogumfoot lines (similar to our experimentally modified webs), and thus reeling occurred naturally in ecribellates. Nevertheless, outside lab conditions, predatory reeling does not occur among cribellate orbweavers, so that this behavior could not have been selected for in the cribellate ancester of orbweavers. Cribellate spiders are flexible enough as to present novel and adaptive predatory responses (reeling) even when exposed for the first time to conditions outside their usual environment. Thus, the evolution of reeling suggests an alternative mechanism for the production of evolutionary novelties; that is, the exploration of unusual ecological conditions and of the regular effects these abnormal conditions have on phenotype expression.},

abstract={Scatter-hoarding animals transport food away from its source before storing it to maximize the likelihood that the cache will survive for use at a later time. However, the more time animals spend transporting and storing the food the less time they have for food collection. Previous studies suggest that the time animals spend on caching depends to some extent on the availability of food and on the presence of conspecifics at the food source. We tested whether a scatter-hoarding mammal responds flexibly to conspecifics as competitors according to the availability of food or if they respond more directly to them as potential pilferers. We used multiple linear regression to model the time eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) took to return to nut patches of varying quality after collecting a nut for caching when they were alone and when conspecifics were present. The results provide the first evidence that scatter hoarders respond to conspecifics at a food source primarily as competitors rather than as potential pilferers; the squirrels increased the rate at which they returned to the nut patch when conspecifics were present rather than transport the nuts farther away to minimize the risk of pilferage. In contrast, and in line with previous studies, the squirrels responded to a reduction in the availability of food by increasing the distance at which they stored the food from the source. © The Author 2008.

abstract={In the absence of an effective predator, spatial patterns of large herbivores in northern temperate regions are largely influenced by food acquisition and energy conservation during winter, when resources are limited and the energetic cost of movement is high. In these circumstances animals would be expected to minimize movement to avoid unnecessary energy expenditures. With the addition of a top predator such a strategy may not be compatible with avoiding predation risk, therefore animals may increase their movement to avoid detection or escape capture. Such increased movement may occur on relatively fine scales within an animal's home range or may be manifested in broader scale responses such as dispersal or migration. With the reintroduction of wolves (Canis lupus) to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 and 1996, much attention has focused on the behavioral responses of large herbivores to wolf predation risk and the implications of these responses on ecosystem structure and function. Investigations are numerous but evaluations are complicated due partly to a paucity of data on elk (Cervus elaphus) spatial patterns prior to wolf reintroduction. We quantified winter movement patterns of a non-migratory elk herd in the Madison headwaters prior to the reintroduction of wolves, when animals were constrained only by nutritional restrictions, and following wolf colonization and establishment, when elk experienced significant wolf predation. We evaluated changes in home range size and fidelity and described broader scale elk movement patterns such as dispersal and migration. We predicted elk would shift from a winter strategy of being relatively sedentary and occupying areas based on energetic considerations in the absence of wolves, to a more spatially dynamic strategy as elk responded to increased predation risk from wolves. Furthermore, we incorporated our knowledge of landscape characteristics of the system to provide possible explanations for any changes in elk spatial responses. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Large herbivores that inhabit seasonal environments face considerable challenges when trying to balance the conflicting demands of satisfying physiological requirements and avoiding predation. The harsh environment imposes strong nutritional constraints which influence activity patterns and foraging strategies. In addition, the need to evade predators strongly determines the way in which prey behave (Lima and Dill 1990). The traditional view is that prey manage food acquisition and predation risk by trading one behavior at the expense of the other. However, if a range of anti-predator behaviors can collectively be adopted at appropriate temporal scales, then this trade-off may be somewhat reduced (Lind and Cresswell 2005). Plasticity in prey behaviors may balance the need to forage and minimize predation risk, thereby allowing prey to remain in an environment that both provides adequate forage resources but also poses a high threat of predation. We observed the behavior of elk (Cervus elaphus) in the Madison headwaters area of Yellowstone National Park during 15 consecutive winter field seasons, accruing approximately 3100 h of behavioral data before and after wolf (Canis lupus) reintroduction to Yellowstone, when elk were exposed to varying degrees of wolf predation risk. We hypothesized that environmental and temporal factors would play a fundamental role governing the likelihood of winter foraging by elk. We proposed competing hypotheses regarding the effect of wolves. Based on the traditional view of the foraging-vigilance trade-off, we suspected that the addition of wolves to the system would manifest a higher degree of behavioral alertness in elk and reduce the likelihood of foraging. Alternatively, increasing behavioral alertness when wolves were actively hunting at night would manifest increased diurnal foraging. Furthermore, we incorporated our knowledge of the range of other behavioral responses exhibited by elk to determine if they behaviorally compensated to mediate any fitness costs associated with behaviors that reduced predation risk. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Rodents spend a great proportion of their time searching for food. The foraging drive in rats is so strong that the animals readily work for food even when food is freely available. Commonly used ad libitum feeding is associated with a reduced life span, increased incidence of tumours and risk of liver and kidney diseases. It is also considered to be the most poorly controlled variable in rodent bioassays. The aim of this study was to assess whether rats will gnaw wood in order to obtain food hidden in wooden walls, whether this activity has a beneficial effect on controlling weight gain, and whether a typical diurnal activity rhythm is maintained. A total of 18 BN/RijHsd and 18 F344/NHsd male rats were housed in either open or individually ventilated cages (IVC), three rats in each cage. 10 of 36 were fitted with a telemetric transponder. Four groups were used: two groups (diet board and plain board) with a maze made of two crossed aspen boards, the third having a rectangular aspen tube. One maze was of plainboard, but the other included drilled holes snugly loaded with food pellets, the "diet board", such that the rats had to gnaw wood to reach the food. The other two groups - and the controls - were fed ad libitum. The study used a crossover design and the added item was changed every two weeks. Rats, added items, and amount of food left at the end of the two week period were weighed. The statistical assessment showed that in terms of weight gain there was a significant interaction both in IVC- (p = 0.005) and in open cages (p < 0.001) between the strains and the group. In the F344 rats the diet board was more effective in controlling weight, but when combining the strains, all comparisons with diet board were significant (p < 0.05). Use of strain and added item as main effects, and age as covariate, showed that in the IVC-system there was a significant (p < 0.001) interaction between the strain and the group, this effect being rather clear in the F344 rats in terms of amount of food disappearing. In the open cage system, both strain and group were significant (p < 0.001) factors; all three comparisons with diet board were significant (p < 0.001) in the amount of food disappearing. In conclusion, the work-for-food approach appears to be a promising way of avoiding obesity without causing untoward effects on diurnal activity in rats. Hence, the approach may have considerable refinement and reduction potential.},

abstract={Background: Regular self-weighing has been a focus of attention recently in the obesity literature. It has received conflicting endorsement in that some researchers and practitioners recommend it as a key behavioral strategy for weight management, while others caution against its use due to its potential to cause negative psychological consequences associated with weight management failure. The evidence on frequent self-weighing, however, has not yet been synthesized. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the evidence regarding the use of regular self-weighing for both weight loss and weight maintenance. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted using the MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO online databases. Reviewed studies were broken down by sample characteristics, predictors/conditions, dependent measures, findings, and evidence grade. Results: Twelve studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria, but nearly half received low evidence grades in terms of methodological quality. Findings from 11 of the 12 reviewed studies indicated that more frequent self-weighing was associated with greater weight loss or weight gain prevention. Specifically, individuals who reported self-weighing weekly or daily, typically over a period of several months, held a 1 to 3 kg/m2 (current) advantage over individuals who did not self-weigh frequently. The effects of self-weighing in experimental studies, especially those where self-weighing behaviors could be isolated, were less clear. Conclusion: Based on the consistency of the evidence reviewed, frequent self-weighing, at the very least, seems to be a good predictor of moderate weight loss, less weight regain, or the avoidance of initial weight gain in adults. More targeted research is needed in this area to determine the causal role of frequent self-weighing in weight loss/ weight gain prevention programs. Other open questions to be pursued include the optimal dose of self-weighing, as well as the risks posed for negative psychological consequences. © 2008 VanWormer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Habitat choice of herbivores is expected to be a resolution of a trade-off between food and shelter. The resolution of this trade-off may, however, be dynamic within a species because distinct phenotypes may value these factors differently and the value may vary temporally. We studied this hypothesis in the marine herbivore Idotea balthica (Isopoda), by simultaneously manipulating both food and shelter, and investigated whether the resolution of the trade-off differed between sexes, colour morphs and day and night (i.e. high and low predation risk). Isopods chose between exposing and concealing backgrounds in which the quantity or quality of food varied. When choosing between the backgrounds in the absence of food, females preferred the concealment more than males did. However, in a trade-off situation the isopods traded shelter for food, and females more so than males. Thus, males' lower preference for the shelter was not counterbalanced by a stronger preference for food. The microhabitat use also differed between night and day showing adaptation to diurnally fluctuating predation risk. We suggest that microhabitat utilization of females is more strongly tied to variation in risk and resources than that of males, for whom other factors, such as seeking mates, may be more important. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Increasing urbanization and deforestation have enhanced the opportunities of contact between humans and monkeys and the impact of human activities on primate behavior is receiving growing attention. This study explores whether activity budgets and diet of a group of capuchin monkeys (Cebus libidinosus) inhabiting the area of the swimming pools of the National Park of Brasília is affected by the presence of visitors providing food to them. During one year, both in the dry and the wet seasons, we scored capuchins' behavior via scan sampling every ten minutes. Results showed that this group spent less time foraging for wild foods than other comparable groups living in similar habitats. Moreover, capuchins relied more on human food during the dry season, when pulpy fruits were less available, than in the wet season. Our findings confirm other studies on different monkey species that have shown that access to human food decreases the time spent foraging for wild food and the home range size. They also show that capuchins are able to modify their diet, to exploit alternative food sources, and to change their activity budget in response to the availability of new food opportunities and to seasonal food availability.},

abstract={Vertical migration of Daphnia represents the best-studied predator-avoidance behaviour known; yet the mechanisms underlying the choice to migrate require further investigation to understand the role of environmental context. To investigate the optimal habitat choice of Daphnia under fish predation pressure, first, we selected the individuals exhibiting strong migration behaviour. The animals collected from the hypolimnion during the daytime were significantly larger, being more conspicuous, and in turn performed stronger diel vertical migration (DVM) when exposed to fish cue. We called them strong migrants. Second, we provided the strong migrant D. pulex with food at high and intermediate (1 and 0.4 mg C l-1, respectively) levels, which were well above the incipient limiting level and of high quality. They traded the benefits of staying in the warm water layer and moved down to the cold water in response to fish cue indicating fish predation. The availability of food allowed the animals to stay in the cold hypolimnion. However, at the low food level (0.1 mg C l-1), which is an additional constraint on fitness, Daphnia moved away from the cold hypolimnion. Poor food condition resulted in strong migrant Daphnia to cease migration and remain in the upper warmer water layer. Although temperature is known to be a more important cost factor of DVM than food, our results clearly show that this is only true as long as food is available. It becomes clear that food availability is controlling the direction of vertical positioning when daphnids experience a dilemma between optimising temperature and food condition while being exposed to fish cue. Then they overlook the predation risk. Thus, the optimal habitat choice of Daphnia appears to be a function of several variables including temperature, food levels and fish predation. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Within insect and anuran choruses, females are exposed to many male sexual signals overlapping in time. In many species, male call timing influences mate choice, with females preferentially orienting towards males that succeed in calling just before their opponents. The mechanisms through which males actively regulate their call timing to achieve this have been the focus of much interest. However, no study has addressed the problem of the reliability of call leadership as an indicator of male quality, which is crucial to females, since basing their choice of mate on an unreliable criterion could lead them to engage in suboptimal matings, with detrimental effects to their fitness. Addressing this question in the European treefrog, Hyla arborea, we first ascertained that females preferentially orient towards the first of two identical overlapping conspecific calls. We then found that within experimental choruses the males with the highest proportion of leading calls had significantly higher total calling times, a call characteristic encompassing two indicators of signal costliness: call duration and call rate. Although we failed to find a link between call leadership and male body condition, this study provides novel evidence that female preference for leading calls leads to the selection of the males with the highest energetic investment in their sexual display. The handicap principle predicts that this form of female preference should increase the fitness of females by guaranteeing that they select high-quality mates. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Isolated populations of Procolobus kirkii on Uzi Island, Zanzibar, use Rhizophora mucronata-dominated mangrove forest for refuge. Three groups, observed over 14 months, spent up to 85% of total observation time in mangroves with brief excursions to adjacent upland coral rag forest, habitat degraded by human cutting. A large proportion of monkeys' diets consisted of plant parts of five mangrove species. Water drinking was common and 326 water-drinking events were recorded at a rate of up to 0.87 drinks hr-1. Groups used different strategies to obtain water including licking dew, drinking from treeholes, licking rain off leaves and tree trunks, and drinking from coral rock crevices with Cercopithecus mitis albogularis. Drinking frequency increased with time spent in and consumption of mangroves. Strategies for obtaining water were group-specific and likely the result of learning. Drinking appeared to be an acquired behavior in movement-restricted groups living in a habitat with low plant species diversity and limited salty foods. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Although shedding a leg may save an individual's life, it may lower its subsequent fitness by decreasing its ability to obtain food, increasing its vulnerability to predators, or lowering its success in reproduction. We studied the effects of leg loss on common locomotory tasks and activity levels in adult male crab spiders Misumena vatia. Over three field seasons approximately 30% of adult males lost one or more legs, usually among their four large anterior legs. Although M. vatia do not build webs, they use their front legs extensively to traverse lines, their most important means of movement. Field-captured males missing one or more legs moved 38% more slowly across lines and 28% more slowly on surfaces than intact males. Since males must hunt to find unmated females, this reduced mobility suggests a significant fitness cost for males that have lost legs. However, a set of males with experimentally autotomized legs moved as rapidly on lines as intact males. Since individuals that lost a limb in the field weighed significantly less than intact individuals of the same size (carapace width), adjusting for leg mass, the slow rates of movement on lines by the field-caught individuals missing a leg probably resulted from poor body condition, rather than a loss of dexterity. Most studies have explained potential loss in fitness from losing a leg as a direct consequence of leg loss, seldom invoking indirect effects. The potential for leg loss to reduce fitness via impacts on body condition warrants further attention, for it could play an important role in cost of autonomy. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Research conducted with the communities of Igloolik, Ulukhaktok, and Churchill in northern Canada documents increasing exposure to hazards associated with ice use for hunting and travel. This trend is related to changing ice conditions. Instrumental records show later ice freeze-up and earlier breakup since the late 1970s, increasing temperatures, and changes in weather in the case study communities. Elders and mature community members, drawing upon their traditional knowledge, describe similar changes in ice and other climate-related conditions in recent years. These changes are increasing the risks of utilizing the ice for hunting and travel and they are reducing access to traditional food. Change in risk-taking behavior among users of the ice has also been documented in Igloolik and Ulukhaktok over the last few decades and has shaped the implications of more recent changes in ice conditions. Comparison between the communities reveals uneven consequences of changing ice conditions which is linked to the nature of ice use, local physiological setting, and community socio-cultural dynamics. © 2008 Regents of the University of Colorado.},

abstract={Ovarian-based immunological research is currently restricted to proteins of the zona pellucida. This study examined the immunoçontraceptive potential of a novel vesicle-associated protein, VAP1, previously isolated from the vesicle-rich hemisphere of the brushtail possum oocyte. Seven female possums were immunized against recombinant glutathione S-transferase-VAP1 fusion protein. Control animals (n=3) received antigen-free vaccinations. Following immunization, regular blood sampling determined the level and duration of immune response. Animals were monitored daily, pre- and post-immunization, to determine estrous cycling activity and the percentage of reproductive cycles yielding viable young. The reproductive tracts and somatic organs of VAP1-immunized (n=7), control-immunized (n=3) and non-immunized (n=5) animals were collected and examined by histology and transmission electron microscopy. VAP1 immunization caused a strong and sustained immune response. Elevated levels of VAP1 antibody binding were detected in sera following initial injections, and immune titers rose as boosters were administered. Immunization had no adverse effect upon animal behavior or body condition. Immunized females demonstrated no major change in annual estrous cycling activity; however, the percentage of reproductive cycles resulting in pouch young decreased significantly (P<0.05) by 40%. Histological and ultrastructural analyses revealed an abundance of lipid-like degradation bodies within the ooplasm of developing oocytes and the cytoplasm of failing uterine zygotes. Active macrophage invasion of enlarged endometrial glands was observed in the uteri of two females. Reproductive tract changes are discussed in relation to observed fertility decline. The results of this study indicate that VAP1 has exciting potential as an immunocontraceptive target for possum control in New Zealand. © 2008 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.},

abstract={Japanese quail selected for a low-stress (LS), rather than a high-stress (HS), plasma corticosterone response to brief restraint have been shown to possess lower fearfulness and a nonspecific reduction in stress responsiveness. Detrended fluctuation analysis provides information on the organization and complexity of temporal patterns of behavior. The present study evaluated the temporal pattern of ambulation of LS and HS quail in an open field that represented a novel environment. Time series of 4,200 data points were collected for each bird by registering the distance ambulated every 0.5 s during a 35-min test period. Consistent with their known reduced fearfulness, the LS quail initiated ambulation significantly sooner (P < 0.02) and tended to ambulate more (P < 0.09) than did their HS counterparts. Detrended fluctuation analyses showed a monofractal series (i.e., a series with similar complexity at different temporal scales) in 72% of the birds. These birds initiated their ambulatory activity in less than 600 s. Among these birds, a lower (P < 0.03) autosimilarity coefficient (α) was found in the LS quail than in their HS counterparts (α = 0.76 ± 0.03 and 0.87 ± 0.03, respectively), suggesting a more complex (less regular) ambulatory pattern in the LS quail. However, when the patterns of ambulation were reexamined by considering only the active period of the time series (i.e., after the birds had initiated their ambulatory activity), monofractal patterns were observed in 97% of the birds, and no differences were found between the lines. Collectively, the results suggest that during the active period of open-field testing, during which fear responses are likely less strong and other motivations are the driving forces of ambulation, the LS and HS lines have similar ambulatory organization. ©2008 Poultry Science Association Inc.},

abstract={Quantitative biologically-based models describing key events in the continuum from arsenic exposure to the development of adverse health effects provide a framework to integrate information obtained across diverse research areas. For example, genetic polymorphisms in arsenic metabolizing enzymes can lead to differences in target tissue dosimetry for key metabolites causative in toxic and carcinogenic response. This type of variation can be quantitatively incorporated into pharmacokinetic (PK) models and used together with population-based modeling approaches to evaluate the impact of genetic variation in methylation capacity on dose of key metabolites to target tissue. The PK model is an essential bridge to the pharmacodynamic (PD) models. A particular benefit of PD modeling for arsenic is that alternative models can be constructed for multiple proposed modes of action for arsenicals. Genomics data will prove useful for identifying the key pathways involved in particular responses and aid in determining other types of data needed for quantitative modeling. These models, when linked with PK models, can be used to better understand and explain dose- and time-response behaviors. This in turn assists in prioritizing modes of action with respect to their risk assessment relevance and future research. This type of integrated modeling approach can form the basis for a highly informative mode-of-action directed risk assessment for inorganic arsenic (iAs). This paper will address both practical and theoretical aspects of integrating PK and PD data in a modeling framework, including practical barriers to its application.},

abstract={Objective: The objective of this study was to associate questions about specific eating behaviors with weight. Our ultimate goal was to create a clinical screening questionnaire for eating behaviors associated with overweight and obesity. Methods: We developed a questionnaire based on eating behaviors associated with overweight and obesity. After pilot testing and revision, we administered the questionnaire to patients in 2 primary care clinics from the Utah Health Research Network. We analyzed the relationship between measured body mass index, demographic factors, and responses to screening questions about eating behaviors and physical activity. Results: We collected 261 completed questionnaires with weight and height measurements. With regression analysis, questions about consumption of beverages with sugar added, fruits and vegetables, and full portions served at restaurants as well as questions about physical activity were associated with body mass index and being overweight and/or obese. Conclusions: We suggest that future research about eating behaviors focus on the questions regarding typical consumption of beverages with sugar added, fruits and vegetables, and full portions served at restaurants to further develop a tool for clinical screening.},

abstract={Environmental factors influence variation in life histories by affecting growth, development, and reproduction. We conducted an experiment in outdoor mesocosms to examine how diet and a time constraint on juvenile development (pond-drying) influence life-history trade-offs (growth, development, adult body mass) in the caddis fly Limnephilus externus (Trichoptera: Limnephilidae). We predicted that: (1) diet supplementation would accelerate larval growth and development, and enhance survival to adulthood; (2) pond-drying would accelerate development and increase larval mortality; and (3) the relationship between adult mass and age at maturity would be negative. Diet supplementation did lead to larger adult mass under nondrying conditions, but did not significantly alter growth or development rates. Contrary to predictions, pond-drying reduced growth rates and delayed development. The slope (positive or negative) of the female mass-age at maturity relationship depended on interactions with diet or pond-drying, but the male mass-age relationship was negative and independent of treatment. Our results suggest that pond-drying can have negative effects on the future fitness of individuals by increasing the risk of desiccation-induced, pre-reproductive mortality and decreasing adult body size at maturity. These negative effects on life history cannot be overcome with additional nutritional resources in this species. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract={Objective: The surgical treatment of obesity is becoming increasingly popular; yet, little is known about the self-harm characteristics and adjunctive self-regulation difficulties of those seeking such surgery. In the literature, one study has explored presurgery suicide attempts and several studies have explored the prevalence of postsurgical completed suicides. However, beyond suicide attempts and completions, little is known about the broader self-harm/self-regulation profiles of these patients. In this study, we examined the prevalence of 22 such behaviors among a sample of gastric surgery candidates. Method: Using a cross-sectional approach, we examined 121 surgical candidates for 22 self-reported self-harm and self-regulatory behaviors. Results: The studied behaviors with the highest prevalence rates in this cohort were sexual promiscuity (22.3%), torturing oneself with self-defeating thoughts (20.7%), alcohol abuse (19.0%), and engaging in emotionally abusive relationships (16.5%). With regard to suicide attempts, 9.1% of participants acknowledged a history and 9.1% reported past overdoses. Conclusions: These data suggest that (a) adjunctive self-regulatory difficulties may affect a substantial minority of individuals who are seeking gastric surgery for obesity (e.g., promiscuity and alcohol abuse), and (b) the anticipated prevalence rate for past suicide attempts in this population appears to be approximately 10%. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a hypothalamic neuropeptide that has been implicated in energy homeostasis. Pharmacological studies with MCH and its receptor antagonists have suggested additional behavioral roles for the neuropeptide in the control of mood and vigilance states. These suggestions have been supported by a report of modified sleep in the MCH-1 receptor knockout mouse. Here we found that MCH knockout (MCH-/-) mice slept less during both the light and dark phases under baseline conditions. In response to fasting, MCH-/- mice exhibited marked hyperactivity, accelerated weight loss and an exaggerated decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Following a 6-h period of sleep deprivation, however, the sleep rebound in MCH-/- mice was normal. Thus MCH-/- mice adapt poorly to fasting, and their loss of bodyweight under this condition is associated with behavioral hyperactivity and abnormal expression of REM sleep. These results support a role for MCH in vigilance state regulation in response to changes in energy homeostasis and may relate to a recent report of initial clinical trials with a novel MCH-1 receptor antagonist. When combined with caloric restriction, the treatment of healthy, obese subjects with this compound resulted in some subjects experiencing vivid dreams and sleep disturbances. © 2008 IBRO.},

abstract={Phenotypic diversity is shaped by both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that program tissue specific patterns of gene expression. Cells, including neurons, undergo massive epigenetic reprogramming during development through modifications to chromatin structure, and by covalent modifications of the DNA through methylation. There is evidence that these changes are sensitive to environmental influences such as maternal behavior and diet, leading to sustained differences in phenotype. For example, natural variations in maternal behavior in the rat that influence stress reactivity in offspring induce long-term changes in gene expression, including in the glucocorticoid receptor, that are associated with altered histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and NGFI-A transcription factor binding. These effects can be reversed by early postnatal cross-fostering, and by pharmacological manipulations in adulthood, including Trichostatin A (TSA) and l-methionine administration, that influence the epigenetic status of critical loci in the brain. Because levels of methionine are influenced by diet, these effects suggest that diet could contribute significantly to this behavioral plasticity. Recent data suggest that similar mechanisms could influence human behavior and mental health. Epidemiological data suggest indeed that dietary changes in methyl contents could affect DNA methylation and gene expression programming. Nutritional restriction during gestation could affect epigenetic programming in the brain. These findings provide evidence for a stable yet dynamic epigenome capable of regulating phenotypic plasticity through epigenetic programming. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Epidemiological evidence indicates that prenatal nutritional deprivation may increase the risk of schizophrenia. The goal of these studies was to use an animal model to examine the effects of prenatal protein deprivation on behaviors and receptor binding with relevance to schizophrenia. We report that prenatally protein deprived (PD) female rats showed an increased stereotypic response to apomorphine and an increased locomotor response to amphetamine in adulthood. These differences were not observed during puberty. No changes in haloperidol-induced catalepsy or MK-801-induced locomotion were seen following PD. In addition, PD female rats showed increased 3H-MK-801 binding in the striatum and hippocampus, but not in the cortex. PD female rats also showed increased 3H-haloperidol binding and decreased dopamine transporter binding in striatum. No statistically significant changes in behavior or receptor binding were found in PD males with the exception of increased 3H-MK-801 binding in cortex. This animal model may be useful to explore the mechanisms by which prenatal nutritional deficiency enhances risk for schizophrenia in humans and may also have implications for developmental processes leading to differential sensitivity to drugs of abuse. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The increase or decrease in yolk androgens over the laying sequence of a clutch in birds may mitigate or enhance, respectively, the disadvantage of the last-hatched chicks, providing a potentially adaptive tool to adjust brood size to food conditions. This variation may involve a genetic component on which Darwinian selection can act. We found that two lines of a wild bird species selected for bold and shy personalities show, respectively, increased and decreased androgen concentrations over the laying sequence. The line showing the increase laid earlier in the season, when food conditions are normally sufficient to raise the whole brood. The line showing the decrease laid later, when food is normally scarce, which may facilitate brood reduction. The results indicate a correlated response in maternal hormone transfer to genetic selection on personality, which relates to ecological conditions. © 2008 The Royal Society.},

abstract={The purpose of the present study was to examine the impact of nutritional supplementation with essential omega 3 and 6 fatty acids on CA1 neuronal death and recovery of functional impairments following global ischemia. Groups of Wistar male rats were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions determined by the consumed diet and surgical condition. Rats either received a standard diet (SD; Purina 5012) or a 15% PUFA supplemented diet (FO + CO) prepared by adding 11.5% (w/w) fish oil from menhaden fish and 3.5% corn oil to standard rat chow. Diet conditions were initiated in 30 day old rats and maintained for an 18-week period (pre- and post-surgery). Sham or 8-min global ischemic surgeries occurred during the 13th feeding week and behavioral testing took place following reperfusion for an additional 4 weeks, after which all rats were euthanized. Our findings revealed significant loss of pyramidal CA1 neurons 31 days post ischemia in ischemic as compared to sham-operated rats but no difference between ischemic animals fed the SD or PUFA supplemented diets. In the radial arm maze, SD ischemic rats took longer time to complete the task and made significantly more working memory errors than PUFA ischemic and sham-operated animals. Independent of the diet, ischemic animals appeared less anxious in the elevated plus maze, spending considerably more time in the open arms as compared to sham-operated rats. Taken together, these results suggest that fish oil supplemented diet exerts beneficial effect on ischemia-induced spatial memory deficits despite protective effects on CA1 hippocampal neurons. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The pursuit of rewarding experiences motivates everyday human behavior, and can prove beneficial when pleasurable, positive consequences result (e.g., satisfying hunger, earning a paycheck). However, reward seeking may also be maladaptive and lead to risky decisions with potentially negative long-term consequences (e.g., unprotected sex, drug use). Such risky decision making is often observed during adolescence, a time in which important structural and functional refinements occur in the brain's reward circuitry. Although much of the brain develops before adolescence, critical centers for goal-directed behavior, such as frontal corticobasal ganglia networks, continue to mature. These ongoing changes may underlie the increases in risk-taking behavior often observed during adolescence. Further, typical development of these circuits is vital to our ability to make well-informed decisions; atypical development of the human reward circuitry can have severe implications, as is the case in certain clinical and developmental conditions (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). This review focuses on current research probing the neural correlates of reward-related processing across human development supporting the current research hypothesis that immature or atypical corticostriatal circuitry may underlie maladaptive behaviors observed in adolescence. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={Although routine Fe supplementation in pregnancy is a common practice, its clinical benefits or risks are uncertain. Children born to mothers in the Fe group in a trial of Fe supplementation in pregnancy have been found to have a significantly higher risk of abnormal behaviour at 4 years of age than those born to mothers in the placebo group. The objective of the present study therefore was to determine whether Fe supplementation in pregnancy influences child behaviour at early school age. The study was a follow-up of children at 6 - 8 years of age after women (n 430) were randomly allocated to receive a daily Fe supplement (20 mg) or placebo from 20 weeks gestation until delivery. The supplement reduced the incidence of Fe-deficiency anaemia at delivery from 9 % to 1 %. Child behaviour and temperament were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Short Temperament Scale for Children. Of the children, 264 (61 %) participated in the follow-up. Mean behaviour and temperament scores and the proportion of parent-rated and teacher-rated abnormal total difficulties scores did not differ between the Fe and placebo groups. However, the incidence of children with an abnormal teacher-rated peer problems subscale score was higher in the Fe group (eleven of 112 subjects; 8 %) than in the placebo group (three of 113 subjects; 2 %); the relative risk was 3.70 (95 % CI 1.06, 12.91; P = 0.026). We conclude that prenatal Fe supplementation had no consistent effect on child behaviour at early school age in this study population. Further investigation regarding the long-term effects of this common practice is warranted. © The Authors 2007.},

abstract={Social learning involves the transmission of information from demonstrators to conspecifics. The mother is expected to be the main demonstrator in solitary species, whereas several individuals can be demonstrators in group-living species. We studied social learning about novel food in two populations of the African striped mouse, with different social systems: a desert population (group living with paternal care and natal philopatry) and a grassland population (solitary, paternal care in captivity only and natal dispersal). We predicted that both parents would be reliable demonstrators for desert striped mice but only the mother would be a demonstrator for grassland striped mice. Adults and unweaned young were assigned to one of five treatments in captivity: (1) father or (2) mother fed novel food away from young; (3) novel food fed to both adults with young present; and (4) father or (5) mother fed mouse cubes (control) away from young. Juveniles from all treatments individually received novel food after weaning. The responses of juveniles to novel food were greater (shorter latency, more sniffs) when the mother was the demonstrator, regardless of population. Mothers may be more reliable demonstrators than fathers because information can be transmitted using multiple channels (olfaction, lactation). Our study also showed that fathers were more reliable demonstrators and responses to the novel food were greater in desert than grassland striped mice. These population differences reflect the different social organization of the populations and the unpredictable availability of highly nutritious food in the desert. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The present paper describes the main procedures used to slaughter fowl, pigs, calves and adult cattle, sheep, and farmed fish, starting on the farm and ending with the death of the animal at the abattoir. It reviews the currently known causes of stress, indicated by behavioural and physiological measurements on the animal level, and by post-mortem muscle metabolism. During the pre-slaughter period, psychological stress is due to changes of environment, social disturbances and handling, and physical stress is due to food deprivation, climatic conditions, fatigue, and sometimes pain. The exact causes of stress depend, however, on the characteristics of each species, including the rearing system. For fowl, bird catching and crating, duration and climatic conditions of transport and of lairage and shackling are the main known pre-slaughter stress factors. For pigs, stress is caused by fighting during mixing of pens, loading and unloading conditions, and introduction in the restrainer. Handling and novelty of the situation contribute to the stress reactions. For veal calves and adult cattle, disruption of the social group, handling, loading and sometimes unloading conditions, fatigue, novelty of the situation and for calves mixing with unfamiliar animals are known stress factors. Gathering and yarding of extensively reared lambs and sheep causes stress, particularly when shepherd dogs are used. Subsequent transport may induce fatigue, especially if sheep are commercialised through auctions or markets. In farmed fish, stress is predominantly related to environmental aspects such as temperature, oxygen, cleanliness of the water and, to a certain extent, stocking density and removal of the fish from the water. If transport and lairage conditions are good and their durations not too long, they may allow pigs, calves and adult cattle, sheep, and fish to rest. For certain species, it was shown that genetic origin and earlier experience influence reactions to the slaughter procedure. Stunning techniques used depend on the species. Pigs and fowl are mostly electrically or gas-stunned, while most adult cattle are stunned with a captive bolt pistol. Calves and sheep may be electrically stunned or with a captive bolt pistol. Various stunning methods exist for the different farmed fish species. Potential causes of stress associated with the different stunning procedures are discussed. The paper addresses further consequences for meat quality and possible itineraries for future research. For all species, and most urgently for fish, more knowledge is needed on stunning and killing techniques, including gas-stunning techniques, to protect welfare. © The Animal Consortium 2008.},

abstract={Background: Cost-effective interventions to improve diet and physical activity are a public health priority. Alive! is an email-based intervention to increase physical activity, reduce saturated and trans fats and added sugars, and increase fruit and vegetable consumption. It was shown to improve these behaviors in a large randomized controlled trial. Objective: (1) To describe the components and behavioral principles underlying Alive!, and (2) to report effects of the intervention on the secondary outcomes: health-related quality of life, presenteeism, self-efficacy, and stage of change. Methods: The Alive! behavior change model is designed to elicit healthy behaviors and promote their maintenance. Behavioral strategies include assessments followed by individualized feedback, weekly goal-setting, individually tailored goals and tips, reminders, and promotion of social support. Alive! was tested among non-medical employees of Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, who were randomized to either the intervention group or the wait-list control group. After randomization, intervention group participants chose one topic to undertake for the intervention period: increasing physical activity, increasing fruits and vegetables, or decreasing saturated and trans fats and added sugars. Pre-post questionnaires assessed changes in SF-8 health-related quality of life, presenteeism, self-efficacy, and stage of change. Mixed effects multiple linear regression and ordinal logistic regression models were used, with department as a random effect factor. Analyses were by intention to treat: the 30% (238/787) who did not respond to the follow-up questionnaires were assigned change scores of zero. Results: Participants were 19 to 65 years (mean 44.0 +/- 10.6), and 74.3% (585/787) were female. Mean SF-8 Physical quality of life score increased significantly more in the intervention group than in the control group, 1.84 (95% CI 0.96-2.72) vs 0.72 (95% CI -0.15-1.58) respectively, P = .02. SF8 Mental score also improved significantly more in the intervention group than in the control group (P = .02). The odds ratio for improvement in self-assessed health status was 1.57 (95% CI 1.21-2.04, P < .001) for the intervention group compared to the control group. The odds ratio for having a reduction in difficulty accomplishing work tasks because of physical or emotional problems, a measure of presenteeism, was 1.47 (95% CI 1.05-2.05, P = .02) for the intervention group compared to the control group. The odds of having an improvement in self-efficacy for changing diet was 2.05 (95% CI 1.44-2.93) for the intervention vs the control group (P < .001). Greater improvement in stage of change for physical activity (P = .05), fats (P = .06), and fruits/vegetables (P = .006) was seen in the intervention group compared to the control group. Significant effects on diet and physical activity behavior change are reported elsewhere. Conclusions: Cost-effective methods that can reach large populations with science-based interventions are urgently needed. Alive! is a fully automated low-cost intervention shown to effect significant improvements in important health parameters.

abstract={Nicotine has been found to enhance learning in a variety of tasks, including contextual fear conditioning. During contextual fear conditioning animals have to learn the context and associate the context with an unconditioned stimulus (footshock). As both of these types of learning co-occur during fear conditioning, it is not clear whether nicotine enhances one or both of these types of learning. To tease these two forms of learning apart, the authors made use of the context preexposure facilitation effect (CPFE). Acquisition of the CPFE requires that contextual and context-shock learning occurs on separate days, allowing for their individual manipulation. Nicotine (0.09 mg/kg) administered prior to contextual learning and retrieval enhanced the CPFE whereas administration prior to context-shock learning and retrieval had no effect. Thus, nicotine enhances contextual learning but not context-shock associative learning. Finally, the results are discussed in terms of a theory of how nicotine could alter hippocampal-cortical-amygdala interactions to facilitate contextual learning. © 2008 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Objective: Increased dietary fat intake is a precipitating factor for the development of obesity and associated metabolic disturbances. Physically active individuals generally have a reduced risk of developing these unhealthy states, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) on obesity development and fuel homeostasis in male and female mice with a trait for increased physical activity and in their controls. Methods: Male and female mice selectively bred for a high level of wheel running behavior over 30 generations and nonselected controls (background strain Hsd:ICR) were maintained on a standard lab chow high-carbohydrate diet (HCD) or on an HFD (60% fat). Food intake, body weight, indirect calorimetry parameters, spontaneous locomotor activity and several hormones relevant to metabolism and energy balance were measured. Results: On HFD, mice reduced food intake and increased body fat mass and plasma leptin levels, with the notable exception of the selected females, which increased their ingested calories without any effects on body mass or plasma leptin levels. In addition, they had an elevated daily energy expenditure (DEE), increased spontaneous cage activity (∼700% relative to controls) and higher resting metabolic rate (RMR) on the HFD compared with feeding the HCD. The selected males also had a higher DEE compared with controls, but no interaction with diet was observed. On HCD, adiponectin levels were higher in selected male, but not female, mice relative to controls. A marked increase in the level of plasma adiponectin was observed on the HFD in selected females, an effect of diet that was not observed in selected males. Conclusion: Genetically based high locomotor activity renders female, but not male, mice resistant to HFD-induced obesity by alterations in behavioral, endocrine and metabolic traits that facilitate fat utilization rather than limiting HFD intake. © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract={The glassy-winged sharpshooter, Homalodisca vitripennis (Germar), (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), is a xylophagous leafhopper native to the southeastern United States and northern Mexico, with recent introductions into California, Arizona, French Polynesia, and Hawaii. It is a primary vector of the xylem-limited bacterium, Xylella fastidiosa Wells et al., the causative agent of Pierce's disease of grape, citrus variegated chlorosis, phony peach, and numerous leaf scorch diseases. H. vitripennis uses several hundred species of host plants for feeding, development, and reproduction. Variation in host utilization allows H. vitripennis to respond to diurnal and seasonal changes in its nutrient-poor food source, xylem fluid, as well as changing nutritional requirements of each leafhopper developmental stage. Here we provide a conceptual model that integrates behavior, life history strategies, and their associated risks with the nutritional requirements of adult and nymphal stages of H. vitripennis. The model is a useful heuristic tool that explains patterns of host plant use, describes insect behavior and ecology, suggests new associations among the ecological components, and most importantly, identifies and supports the development of suppression strategies for X. fastidiosa aimed at reducing vector populations through habitat manipulation.},

abstract={Animals are often neophobic towards novel foods, but will incorporate them into their diet after interacting with experienced conspecifics. Such social learning is likely to be particularly important for young animals, for which most foods are unfamiliar. It has been suggested that in some species adults actively promote learning about unfamiliar foods by teaching offspring, although firm evidence is lacking. I examined social influences on learning about novel foods among wild meerkats, Suricata suricatta, a species where older group members teach pups prey-handling skills. In two experiments, naïve pups were significantly more likely to eat hardboiled egg, a food item not normally present in the diet, and scorpions, a common prey type, if they had interacted with experienced conspecifics. I then investigated whether helpers teach pups to eat unfamiliar prey by preferentially feeding rare items and through direct feeding, where food items are transferred mouth to mouth. Rare prey items were fed more frequently than common items, although this may reflect nutritional characteristics. Direct feeding was most commonly used by juvenile helpers, which typically contribute relatively little to cooperative activities, and was more frequent if other helpers were nearby. This suggests that direct feeding may be a means of reducing the costs of feeding by improving the efficiency of energy transfer and minimizing the risks of kleptoparasitism. I conclude that learning about novel foods is likely to occur as a by-product of provisioning by helpers. There was little evidence that helpers actively teach pups what to eat. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Previous research has suggested that bipolar disorder is characterized by a state-dependent decrease in the ability to recognize facial affect during mania. It remains unclear, though, whether people who are only vulnerable to the disorder show these changes in facial affect recognition. It is also unclear whether minor shifts in mood affect the recognition of facial emotion. Thus, this study examined the effects of positive mood induction on the facial affect recognition of undergraduates vulnerable to mania. Fifty-two undergraduates completed the Hypomanic Personality Scale, and also completed a measure of their ability to recognize affect in pictures of faces. After receiving false success feedback on another task to induce a positive mood, they completed the facial affect recognition measure again. Although we expected to find a relationship between higher Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS) scores and an impaired ability to recognize negative facial affect after a positive mood induction, this was not found. Rather, there was a significant interaction between HPS scores and happiness level, such that individuals with higher scores on the HPS who also reported higher levels of happiness were particularly adept at identifying subtle facial expressions of happiness. This finding expands a growing literature linking manic tendencies to sensitivity to positive stimuli and demonstrates that this sensitivity may have bearing on interpersonal interactions. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={1. The form of asymmetry in bilateral organs usually follows the same pattern within single populations. However, some exceptions may occur when a population consists of different phenotypes that are from different ontogenic backgrounds and under different selective pressures. We investigated the asymmetric patterns of mandibles of larvae, females, and males in the stag beetle Prosopocoilus inclinatus. 2. Larval mandibles exhibited directional asymmetry both in length and cross direction, whereas female mandibles showed directional asymmetry in cross direction. These asymmetric structures might be more effective in cutting wood fibres. 3. For the relation of male mandible length to body size, a model with a switch point showed a better fit to the data than a convex curve model. This shows that the males are dimorphic with two distinct morphs. 4. The form of asymmetry in male mandible length differed between the morphs. The smaller males exhibited left-biased directional asymmetry in common with larvae, whereas the larger males exhibited fluctuating asymmetry. 5. This is a novel finding of a morph-dependent asymmetry. The morph-dependent asymmetry in males may be as a result of different selection on each morph or a developmental constraint from larval mandibles to adult ones. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={Bird parents can alert predators to the location of their nest. One mitigating option is that parents reduce their nest visitation rate in exchange for a lower predation risk. Here, using field data and experiments, we show that Siberian jay Perisoreus infaustus parents adjust feeding visit rates depending on an interaction of 3 factors: predator activity, nest concealment, and food availability. The rate of nest visits increased with the degree of nest concealment; yet, this relationship was modified by the presence of corvid predators. As the vegetation became more dense, parents at sites with high corvid activity disproportionately increased their feeding visit rates when compared with birds at sites with low corvid activity. We experimentally assessed how nesting cover affects this response of parents to the presence of corvids by using an Eurasian jay Garrulus glandarius model. Parents nesting at open sites ceased nest visits, whereas those nesting in dense forest continued feeding, albeit at a lower rate. Cover may thus not fully compensate for the effect of predator activity on feeding visit rates. However, offspring exposed to high predator activity might still receive the same amount of food because parents may adjust load sizes to compensate. This idea was confirmed by an experiment showing that in areas of high predator activity, food-supplemented birds significantly decreased nest visits when compared with nonsupplemented birds. These results indicate that some bird species can employ multiple nest-defense strategies to reduce predator-attracting nest visits; yet, these strategies may carry fitness consequences through reduced offspring quality. © The Author 2008.

abstract={Food consumption constitutes behaviour that is carried out on a daily basis. The risks and benefits associated with such behaviours are often small, and the time and effort people are, consequently, willing to invest in behavioural decisions are limited. Instead, experience, in the form of an integrated evaluation of past behaviours, may serve as a predictor for future behaviour, allowing reasonable choices to be made with limited effort. This paper discusses the characteristics of daily occurring risks and suggests a model of how prior experience can accumulate and play a role in acting while exposed to daily risk. The core of the approach is a feedback loop that adjusts the current situation until a preset situation is reached. This is based on integrated past experiences and is, thus, continually updated by new experiences. To establish such a feedback mechanism, emotions are argued to play a vital role as an integrator for different types of information, such as perceptual, cognitive and physiological information. This approach may help in understanding how consumers deal with risks in daily (food-handling) practices.},

abstract={The cause of the current increase in obesity in westernized nations is poorly understood but is frequently attributed to a 'thrifty genotype,' an evolutionary predisposition to store calories in times of plenty to protect against future scarcity. In modern, industrialized environments that provide a ready, uninterrupted supply of energy-rich foods at low cost, this genetic predisposition is hypothesized to lead to obesity. Children are also exposed to this 'obesogenic' environment; however, whether such early dietary experience has developmental effects and contributes to adult vulnerability to obesity is unknown. Using mice, we tested the hypothesis that dietary experience during childhood and adolescence affects adult obesity risk. We gave mice unlimited or no access to sucrose for a short period post-weaning and measured sucrose-seeking, food consumption, and weight gain in adulthood. Unlimited access to sucrose early in life reduced sucrose-seeking when work was required to obtain it. When high-sugar/high-fat dietary options were made freely-available, however, the sucrose-exposed mice gained more weight than mice without early sucrose exposure. These results suggest that early, unlimited exposure to sucrose reduces motivation to acquire sucrose but promotes weight gain in adulthood when the cost of acquiring palatable, energy dense foods is low. This study demonstrates that early post-weaning experience can modify the expression of a 'thrifty genotype' and alter an adult animal's response to its environment, a finding consistent with evidence of pre- and peri-natal programming of adult obesity risk by maternal nutritional status. Our findings suggest the window for developmental effects of diet may extend into childhood, an observation with potentially important implications for both research and public policy in addressing the rising incidence of obesity. © 2008 Frazier et al.},

abstract={Groups of rats were chronically exposed to a 1.0-g/L caffeine solution for 5, 10, 15 or 20 days. Upon removal of caffeine, rats were given brief exposure to a novel flavour CS (withdrawal CS) followed by 12 days of plain water and then brief exposure to a second flavour CS (neutral CS). Only rats exposed to 20 days of caffeine strongly preferred the neutral CS to the withdrawal CS in a 2-bottle test. In Experiment 2, groups of rats were chronically exposed to caffeine at one of four concentrations (1.0, 0.5, 0.25, or 0.125 g/L) for 21 days, after which withdrawal and neutral CSs were established. Only rats that drank the highest caffeine concentration, 1.0 g/L, preferred the neutral CS to the withdrawal CS. This suggests that long exposure to a strong caffeine solution is required in order to induce dependence in rats such that a CS associated with the withdrawal of caffeine becomes avoided. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Spinal cord injury typically results in limited functional recovery. Here we investigated whether therapeutic dietary restriction, a multi-faceted, safe, and clinically-feasible treatment, can improve outcome from cervical spinal cord injury. The well-established notion that dietary restriction increases longevity has kindled interest in its potential benefits in injury and disease. When followed for several months prior to insult, prophylactic dietary restriction triggers multiple molecular responses and improves outcome in animal models of stroke and myocardial infarction. However, the efficacy of the clinically-relevant treatment of post-injury dietary restriction is unknown. Here we report that "every-other-day fasting" (EODF), a form of dietary restriction, implemented after rat cervical spinal cord injury was neuroprotective, promoted plasticity, and improved behavioral recovery. Without causing weight loss, EODF improved gait-pattern, forelimb function during ladder-crossing, and vertical exploration. In agreement, EODF preserved neuronal integrity, dramatically reduced lesion volume by > 50%, and increased sprouting of corticospinal axons. As expected, blood β-hydroxybutyrate levels, a ketone known to be neuroprotective, were increased by 2-3 fold on the fasting days. In addition, we found increased ratios of full-length to truncated trkB (receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor) in the spinal cord by 2-6 folds at both 5 days (lesion site) and 3 weeks after injury (caudal to lesion site) which may further enhance neuroprotection and plasticity. Because EODF is a safe, non-invasive, and low-cost treatment, it could be readily translated into the clinical setting of spinal cord injury and possibly other insults. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The mortality risk from hunting/predation should increase animals' vigilance and modify their selection of feeding sites. This risk may thus be costly if vigilance interferes with feeding and/or if animals select poorer but safer feeding sites. We observed the vigilance behaviour of roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, feeding in a fragmented landscape during and outside the hunting season and compared food availability and local landscape features at these feeding sites with random paired sites. Roe deer spent more time vigilant during the hunting season than outside it. During the hunting season, vigilance decreased as the woodland extent within an 800 m radius increased, but this was not the case outside the hunting season. Vigilance decreased with increasing distance to houses, both during and outside the hunting season. When food is abundant, interference with feeding may be low because animals can simultaneously process food (chewing) and be vigilant. During the hunting season, the total time spent vigilant while chewing increased with increasing food abundance to a lesser extent than outside the hunting season, suggesting a higher level of costly exclusive vigilance during the hunting season. Outside the hunting season animals selected feeding sites that provided more food, but during the hunting season, as risk (proximity to houses) was positively correlated with food availability, animals no longer selected feeding sites on the basis of food availability. Taken together, our results indicate that roe deer trade off risk avoidance for food availability in hunted populations. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Spiders alter web architecture in response to many environmental factors. Yet, the functional implications of this behavioural plasticity are poorly understood, especially for spiders that spin long-lasting webs such as cobwebs. The western black widow spins a three-dimensional web that captures terrestrial prey and can persist for many days. However, the shape of the cobweb depends upon changes in the spider's body condition. Starved spiders invest more silk in sticky gumfooted threads, whereas sated spiders invest more silk in supporting threads. We tested the hypothesis that the increased investment in sticky gumfooted threads by starved spiders functions to improve the prey capture of their webs. Regardless of intrinsic foraging motivation, both fed and starved spiders captured more prey, more quickly and more efficiently, when hunting on a web that was spun by a starved spider. Our study shows that cobweb spiders actively manipulate web-spinning behaviours in ways that alter the functions of their webs and that even spiders spinning relatively long-lasting webs may use behavioural plasticity to respond to changing selective pressures in their environment. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Predation is often considered as one of the most important biotic factor determining the success of exotic species. The freshwater amphipod Gammarus roeseli has widely colonized Western Europe, where it is frequently found in sympatry with the native species (Gammarus pulex). Previous laboratory experiments revealed that G. roeseli may have an advantage over G. pulex through differential predation by native fish (brown trout). Morphological anti-predator defences (spines) were found responsible for lower rates of predation on the invasive G. roeseli. Here, using both field surveys and laboratory experiments, we tested if a differential of predation exists with other fish predators naturally encountered by gammarids. The main predators present in our field site were nocturnal benthic feeders (mainly bullheads, Cottus gobio). Fish diet analysis showed that, compared to its global availability in the river, G. roeseli was less consumed than G. pulex. In the field, however, G. roeseli was found mainly in the aquatic vegetation whereas G. pulex was found in all habitat types. Laboratory experiments in microcosms revealed that G. roeseli was less prone to predation by C. gobio only when vegetation was present. Depending on the type of predator, the differential of predation could therefore be mediated by antipredator behaviour, and a better usage of refuges, rather than by morphological defences. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={This study examined critical periods in development to determine when offspring were most susceptible to dietary sodium manipulation leading to amphetamine sensitization. Wistar dams (n = 6-8/group) were fed chow containing low (0.12% NaCl; LN), normal (1% NaCl; NN), or high sodium (4% NaCl; HN) during the prenatal or early postnatal period (birth to 5 wk). Offspring were fed normal chow thereafter until testing at 6 mo. Body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), fluid intake, salt preference, response to amphetamine, open field behavior, plasma adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), plasma corticosterone (Cort), and adrenal gland weight were measured. BW was similar for all offspring. Offspring from the prenatal and postnatal HN group had increased BP, NaCl intake, and salt preference and decreased water intake relative to NN offspring. Prenatal HN offspring had greater BP than postnatal HN offspring. In response to amphetamine, both prenatal and postnatal LN and HN offspring had increased locomotor behavior compared with NN offspring. In a novel open field environment, locomotion was also increased in prenatal and postnatal LN and HN offspring compared with NN offspring. ACTH and Cort levels 30 min after restraint stress and adrenal gland weight measurement were greater in LN and HN offspring compared with NN offspring. These results indicate that early life experience with low- and high-sodium diets, during the prenatal or early postnatal period, is a stress that produces long-term changes in responsiveness to amphetamines and to subsequent stressors.

abstract={We monitored the movements of a starved model predator, the carabid beetle Pterostichus melanarius, in arenas containing test papers upon which beetles had previously walked and unexposed control papers. Significantly, beetles accumulated on the unexposed controls, indicating conspecific avoidance (i.e. behaviour designed to avoid locations previously traversed by individuals of the same species). This finding is novel and important because optimal Lévy-flight (scale-free) search patterns for the location of sparsely and randomly distributed prey resources can emerge from conspecific avoidance. This finding may account for the shortcomings of random-walk (scale-finite) models when used to predict large-scale movement and search patterns by extrapolating from observations made at small scales. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Remarkably, in addition to the fast-aging species, the order Rodentia contains multiple long-lived species with lifespans exceeding 20 years (naked mole-rat, beavers, porcupines, and some squirrels). This diversity opens great opportunities for comparative aging studies. Here we discuss the evolution of lifespan in rodents, review the biology of slow-aging rodents, and show an example of how the use of a comparative approach revealed that telomerase activity coevolved with body mass in rodents. © 2008 American Aging Association.},

abstract={Background: Adults with growth hormone deficiency (AGHD) have an adverse body composition with an increased prevalence of obesity. It is not known whether growth hormone replacement (GHR) results in alterations in energy intake (EI) and/or energy expenditure (EE). The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of GHR on EI and EE. Materials and methods: Nineteen hypopituitary adults (14 males, 5 females, mean age 46.2 years) with severe GHD (peak GH response to glucagon ≤ 9 mU L-1) were studied. All patients self-injected recombinant human GH starting with 0.3 mg s.c. daily. The following were measured before and following 6 months of stable maintenance of GHR: food intake during a test meal, appetite ratings, resting EE (indirect calorimetry) and voluntary physical activity (accelerometry). Results: GHR nearly doubled voluntary physical activity (mean activity units 3319 vs. 1881, P = 0.007) and improved quality of life score (mean score 9.1 vs. 16.5, P &lt; 0.0001). Subjects reported higher fasting hunger ratings (mean 64.8 vs. 49.6, P = 0.02) but ad libitum energy intake remained unchanged. Eating behavioural traits were favourably altered with lower disinhibition (mean 6.0 vs. 7.2, P = 0.02) and lower susceptibility to hunger ratings (4.6 vs. 6.8, P = 0.001) after GHR. Additionally, GHR did not result in significant changes in resting EE, body weight and body mass index. Conclusions: GHR in AGHD significantly improves voluntary physical activity and quality of life. Following GHR, subjects experience greater 'state' (physiological) hunger, reductions in eating disinhibition and hunger susceptibility, but no effects on calorie intake or macronutrient choice were detected. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={The aim of the study was to assess the effects of chronic olanzapine (Ola) administration on feeding behavior. Although atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) have greatly improved the management of schizophrenia and extrapyramidal symptoms, substantial bodies of literature point out that most of these agents are highly related to a major risk of metabolic drawbacks, leading to dyslipidemia and obesity. Among these compounds, Ola is one of the more weight gain-inducing AAPs. In the present study, we analyzed the Behavioral Satiety Sequence (BSS) in female mice given a palatable diet (wet mash) and chronically administered Ola (0.75, 1.5, 3 mg/kg per os) for 36 days. The results showed that administration of the highest dose of Ola postponed the onset of satiation, as suggested by the rightward shift of the BSS. This effect was confirmed by an increase in the actual food intake by the Ola (3 mg/kg) mice. These results suggest that one of the possible mechanisms involved in AAP-induced weight gain is alteration of the hunger-satiety regulation in female mice. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that enhanced food intake and diminished central sensitivity to satiation signaling may cooperate in promoting weight gain and metabolic dysregulation in rodents and patients taking antipsychotic medications. ©2008, Editrice Kurtis.},

abstract={Selenium (Se) supplementation in the nutritionally relevant range counteracts methylmercury (MeHg) toxicity. Since Se tends to be abundant in fish, MeHg exposures alone may not provide an accurate index of risk from fish consumption. Molar ratios of MeHg:Se in the diets and Hg:Se in tissues of exposed individuals may provide a more accurate index. This experiment compared MeHg toxicity in relation to MeHg exposure vs. Hg:Se molar ratios in diets and tissues. Diets were prepared using low-Se torula yeast basal diets supplemented with Na2SeO4 to contain 0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 μmol Se/kg (∼0.01, 0.08, or 0.8 ppm Se), reflecting low-, adequate-, or rich-Se intakes, respectively. Diets contained either low or high (0.5 μmol or 50 μmol MeHg/kg) (∼0.10 or 10 ppm Hg). Sixty weanling male Long Evans rats were distributed into six weight-matched groups (three Se levels × two MeHg levels) that were supplied with water and their respective diets ab libitum for 18 weeks. No Se-dependent differences in growth were noted among rats fed low-MeHg diets, but growth impairments among rats fed high-MeHg were inversely related to dietary Se. After 3 weeks on the diet, growth impairments were evident among rats fed high-MeHg with low- or adequate-Se and after 10 weeks, rats fed low-Se, high-MeHg diets started to lose weight and displayed hind limb crossing. No weight loss or hind limb crossing was noted among animals fed high-MeHg, rich-Se diets. Methylmercury toxicity was not predictable by tissue Hg, but was inversely related to tissue Se (P &lt; 0.001) and directly related to Hg:Se ratios (P &lt; 0.001). Methylmercury-selenocysteine complexes (proposed name; pseudomethionine) appear likely to impair Se bioavailability, interrupting synthesis of selenium-dependent enzymes (selenoenzymes) that provide antioxidant protection in brain. Therefore, selenoenzymes may be the molecular target of methylmercury toxicity. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Object: 1. To present the documentation on eating disturbances in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) including autism and Asperger syndrome with focus on adolescent and adult years. 2. To present studies on autistic features in anorexia nervosa (AN), to be discussed in the context of a suggested link between ASD and AN. Method: Because of the developmental aspects of behaviour in ASD, reports on childhood disturbances have bceu included in this review, which is based on bibliometric literature search in PubMed for the time period 1950 - 2007 with the addition of book chapters, and other articles not included in the PubMed search results. Results: Few population-based studies on eating behaviours in ASD have been reported, none on adults. Of case series only a few include a control group. Concerning some ASD behaviours only case notes exist. Abnormal eating behaviours are overrepresented in ASD including food refusal, pica, rumination, and selective eating. Those disturbances can have detrimental complications and are often resistant to treatment. There is a growing literature on AN as a neurodevelopmcntal disorder. ASD and the eating disorders, especially AN, have common features concerning genetics, cognitive style, and behaviours. With a few exceptions, ASD in AN have not been reported, or indeed researched. However, poor psychosocial functioning and a rigid lifestyle are commonly reported in AN outcome studies. Conclusions: In spite of the impact on wellbeing and health, systematic research on eating behaviours in ASD is scant. In AN research the association with ASD deserves more attention. © 2008 Giovanni Fioriti Editore s.r.l.},

abstract={Flexibility in activity time budgets allows animals to cope with heterogeneous and changing environments. Many marine predators, such as seabirds, exhibit flexibility in their foraging behaviour to buffer reproductive success against periods of low prey availability. Over 3 years, 2004 to 2006, we studied the foraging behaviour of a threatened seabird, the marbled murrelet Brachyramphus marmoratus in southwestern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. An information-theoretic approach was used to compare among factors (temporal, spatial, environmental, and competitors) that may influence diving activity. We also quantified local prey availability by hydroacoustic surveys and regional oceanographic conditions (chlorophyll a concentrations and upwelling indices) to investigate relationships between diving activity, food supply and environmental conditions. Prey indices varied spatially, seasonally, and annually, showing reduced prey availability during incubation and chick-rearing of 2005. Upwelling indices and chlorophyll a concentrations, as an index of primary productivity, were delayed in 2005. Year and breeding phase had the greatest impact on diving activity, with additional variation among sites. Murrelets increased diving activity in years and seasons with scarce prey and poor oceanographic conditions (incubation and chick-rearing 2005) and decreased diving activity at sites with high prey availability. There was a linear relationship between diving activity and food availability, suggesting no clear thresholds in response to decreases in prey. Despite their flexible activity budgets, increased foraging effort by murrelets in 2005 was inadequate to ensure average levels of reproductive success. Thus, flexible foraging behaviour by murrelets may be ineffective to buffer reproductive success when environmental conditions are extremely poor. © Inter-Research 2008.},

abstract={Omega-3 fatty acids (i.e. docosahexaenoic acid; DHA), similar to exercise, improve cognitive function, promote neuroplasticity, and protect against neurological lesion. In this study, we investigated a possible synergistic action between DHA dietary supplementation and voluntary exercise on modulating synaptic plasticity and cognition. Rats received DHA dietary supplementation (1.25% DHA) with or without voluntary exercise for 12 days. We found that the DHA-enriched diet significantly increased spatial learning ability, and these effects were enhanced by exercise. The DHA-enriched diet increased levels of pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mature BDNF, whereas the additional application of exercise boosted the levels of both. Furthermore, the levels of the activated forms of CREB and synapsin I were incremented by the DHA-enriched diet with greater elevation by the concurrent application of exercise. While the DHA diet reduced hippocampal oxidized protein levels, a combination of a DHA diet and exercise resulted in a greater reduction rate. The levels of activated forms of hippocampal Akt and CaMKII were increased by the DHA-enriched diet, and with even greater elevation by a combination of diet and exercise. Akt and CaMKII signaling are crucial step by which BDNF exerts its action on synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. These results indicate that the DHA diet enhanced the effects of exercise on cognition and BDNF-related synaptic plasticity, a capacity that may be used to promote mental health and reduce risk of neurological disorders. © 2008 IBRO.},

abstract={While the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is best known for its role in regulating serum cholesterol, LDLR is expressed in brain, suggesting that it may play a role in CNS function as well. Here, using mice with a null mutation in LDLR (LDLR-/-), we investigated whether the absence of LDLR affects a series of behavioral functions. We also utilized the fact that plasma cholesterol levels can be regulated in LDLR-/- mice by manipulating dietary cholesterol to investigate whether elevated plasma cholesterol might independently affect behavioral performance. LDLR-/- mice showed no major deficits in general sensory or motor function. However, LDLR-/- mice exhibited increased locomotor activity in an open field test without evidence of altered anxiety in either an open field or a light/dark emergence test. By contrast, modulating dietary cholesterol produced only isolated effects. While both C57BL/6J and LDLR-/- mice fed a high cholesterol diet showed increased anxiety in a light/dark task, and LDLR-/- mice fed a high cholesterol diet exhibited longer target latencies in the probe trial of the Morris water maze, no other findings supported a general effect of cholesterol on anxiety or spatial memory. Collectively these studies suggest that while LDLR-/- mice exhibit no major developmental defects, LDLR nevertheless plays a significant role in modulating locomotor behavior in the adult. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Environmental stimuli such as caloric availability during the perinatal period exert a profound influence on the development of an organism. Studies in this domain have focused on the effects of under- and malnutrition while the effects of more mild levels of restriction have not been delineated. Rat dams and their offspring were subjected to one of five dietary regimens: control, CR50% for 3 days preconception, CR25% during gestation, CR25% during lactation, and CR25% during gestation, lactation, and post-weaning (lifelong). The pup retrieval test and maternal observations were conducted during lactation to quantify maternal care. In the pup retrieval test, dams that were concurrently experiencing CR (i.e., from the lactation and lifelong groups) displayed shorter latencies to retrieve all pups than the control and preconception groups and the lactation group constructed better nests than all groups. Adult offspring were tested in three tests of anxiety: the elevated plus maze, open field, and emergence test. No differences were observed in the elevated plus maze; however, in the open field preconception animals made fewer entries and spent more time in the central zone than controls. In addition, preconception offspring exhibited longer latencies to full body emergence, spent less time fully emerged, and spent more time engaged in risk assessment behaviours than all other groups. Offspring from the preconception group were also on average 11% heavier than control rats throughout life and displayed 37% higher serum leptin concentrations than controls. A potential role for leptin in the anxiogenic effect of preconception CR is discussed. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Genetic research has focused on identifying linkages between polymorphisms and phenotypic traits to explain variations in complex biologies. However, the magnitude of these linkages has not been particularly high. Conversely, the ability of developmental plasticity to generate biological variation from one genotype is well understood, while interest has emerged in the clinical significance of epigenetic processes, particularly those influenced by the external environment. Environmental cues in early development may induce responses that provide adaptive advantage later in life. The benefit of such responses depends on the fidelity of the prediction of the future environment. Life history and physiological changes mediated through epigenetic processes then follow, determining the later phenotype. Developmental mismatch, leading to disease, can arise from discordance between the fetal environment, which is relatively constant across generations, and the postnatal nutritional environment, which can change drastically within and between generations. Metabolic disorders represent the outcome of an individual living in an energetically inappropriate environment. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that individual capacity to live in a given energetic environment is influenced by developmental factors acting through epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic biomarkers may be able to identify a risk of developmental mismatch and thus offer the opportunity for nutritional or other intervention. Copyright © 2008 Nestec Ltd., Vevey/S.

abstract={Objective: To discover whether eating behaviour traits show continuity and stability over childhood. Subjects/Methods: Mothers of 428 twin children from the Twins Early Development Study participated in a study of eating and weight in 1999 when the children were 4 years old. Families were contacted again in 2006 when the children were aged 10 years, with complete data on 322 children; a response rate of 75%. At both times, mothers completed the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ) for each child. Continuity was assessed with correlations between scores at the two time points, and stability by changes in mean scores over time. Results: For all CEBQ subscales, correlations between the two time points were highly significant (P-values <0.001). For satiety responsiveness, slowness in eating, food responsiveness, enjoyment of food, emotional overeating and food fussiness, correlations ranged from r=0.44 to 0.55, with lower continuity for emotional undereating (r=0.29). Over time, satiety responsiveness, slowness in eating, food fussiness, and emotional undereating decreased, while food responsiveness, enjoyment of food and emotional overeating increased. Conclusions: Eating behaviours, including those associated with a tendency to overeat, emerge early in the developmental pathway and show levels of individual continuity comparable to stable personality traits. Appetitive traits related to higher satiety tended to decrease with maturation, while those associated with food responsiveness tended to increase. This pattern is consistent with strong tracking of body mass index alongside a progressive increase in the risk of obesity.},

abstract={For prey animals to negotiate successfully the fundamental trade-off between predation and starvation, a realistic assessment of predation risk is vital. Prey responses to conspicuous indicators of risk (such as looming predators or fleeing conspecifics) are well documented, but there should also be strong selection for the detection of more subtle cues. A predator's head orientation and eye-gaze direction are good candidates for subtle but useful indicators of risk, since many predators orient their head and eyes towards their prey as they attack. We describe the first explicit demonstration of a bird responding to a live predator's eye-gaze direction. We present wild-caught European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) with human 'predators' whose frontal appearance and gaze direction are manipulated independently, and show that starlings are sensitive to the predator's orientation, the presence of eyes and the direction of eye-gaze. Starlings respond in a functionally significant manner: when the predator's gaze was averted, starlings resumed feeding earlier, at a higher rate and consumed more food overall. By correctly assessing lower risk and returning to feeding activity earlier (as in this study), the animal gains a competitive advantage over conspecifics that do not respond to the subtle predator cue in this way. © 2008 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Recent evidence suggests that the quality (i.e. nutritional content) of food can have important effects on life history and behaviour. Yet few studies have considered the role of food quality for mating. We tested the effects of diet quality of prey fed to males and females on mating behaviours, sexual cannibalism and egg production in the wolf spider, Pardosa milvina. Diet quality was manipulated through supplementation of the substrate on which Drosophila melanogaster were reared on and prey quantity was held constant. There was no effect of diet quality on the occurrence of mating or the timing of copulatory behaviours. Contrary to our predictions, females on the high-quality diet engaged in more attacks on males before and after mating and were more likely to cannibalize males following mating. Hence, females do not compensate for low-quality diets by increasing attack rates or cannibalism on males. Rather, females on the high-quality diet appear to be more voracious predators, consistent with results of some foraging studies. Egg production of females that matured and mated in the laboratory was not affected by diet quality. However, field-caught adult females produced eggsacs more quickly when reared on the high-quality diet. Our results suggest that the quality of prey can limit the latency to female egg production. These results highlight the need for more research on the role of food quality for mating interactions and the mechanisms responsible for more voracious feeding by females on high-quality diets. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Dispersers often differ in body condition from non-dispersers. The social dominance hypothesis explains dispersal of weak individuals, but it is not yet well understood why strong individuals, which could easily retain their natal site, are sometimes exposed to risky dispersal. Based on the model for dispersal under kin competition by Hamilton and May, we construct a model where dispersal propensity depends on body condition. We consider an annual species that inhabits a patchy environment with varying patch qualities. Offspring body condition corresponds to the quality of the natal patch and competitive ability increases with body condition. Our main general result balances the fitness benefit from not dispersing and retaining the natal patch and the benefit from dispersing and establishing somewhere else. We present four different examples for competition, which all hint that dispersal of strong individuals may be a common outcome under the assumptions of the present model. In three of the examples, the evolutionarily stable dispersal probability is an increasing function of body condition. However, we found an example where, counterintuitively, the evolutionarily stable dispersal probability is a non-monotone function of body condition such that both very weak and very strong individuals disperse with high probability but individuals of intermediate body condition do not disperse at all. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={An analog of the trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine series (LY255582) exhibits high in vitro binding affinity and antagonist potency for the μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptors. In vivo, LY255582 exhibits potent effects in reducing food intake and body weight in several rodent models of obesity. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of LY255582 to prevent the consumption of a highly palatable (HP) diet (a high-fat/ high-carbohydrate diet) both when the food was novel and following daily limited access to the HP diet. Additionally, we examined the effects of consumption of the HP diet and of LY255582 treatment on mesolimbic dopamine (DA) signaling by in vivo microdialysis. Consumption of the HP diet increased extracellular DA levels within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell. Increased DA in the NAc shell was not related to the quantity of the HP diet consumed, and the DA response did not habituate following daily scheduled access to the HP diet. Interestingly, treatment with LY255582 inhibited consumption of the HP diet and the HP diet-associated increase in NAc shell DA levels. Moreover, the increased HP diet consumption observed following daily limited access to the HP diet was completely prevented by LY255582 treatment. LY255582 may be a useful tool in understanding the neural mechanisms involved in the reinforcement mechanisms regulating food intake. Copyright © 2008 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Invasive species may reduce biodiversity in the long term by displacing resident species. Previous studies of geckos have suggested that invasive species can displace residents by monopolizing limited resources, and this competitive advantage may be exacerbated in structurally simple human-altered habitats. Lepidodactylus lugubris is a parthenogenetic gecko that comprises four major clones. On many Pacific islands A-clones have recently become numerically dominant over several other clones. We tested the general hypothesis that A-clones displace B-clones in structurally simple habitats owing to behavioural differences that influence foraging and aggression. Based on previous studies and the pattern of invasion, we predicted that A-clones would consume more insects and show higher levels of aggression and social dominance than would B-clones. We also tested the hypothesis that increasing topographic structure would affect clone behaviour asymmetrically and reduce the advantages of invading A-clones. We found that A-clones consumed more insects and initiated foraging faster compared to B-clones. However, A-clones were not consistently socially dominant over B-clones. Habitat structure affected foraging tactics, reduced aggression and decreased activity, but clones were affected equally and A-clones remained superior foragers in the structurally complex habitat. Although B-clones were more active, they were also more shy. They occupied and defended shelter more, which may partially explain their persistence in forested habitat. We conclude that part of the advantage A-clones have in structurally simple human landscapes stems from their innate boldness, which increases their ability to exploit limited food resources. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The current study examined whether biologically-influenced temperamental traits implicated in the pathogenesis of disordered eating behaviors contribute to their development over and above current negative affect and dietary restraint. Participants (N = 276) were undergraduate psychology women who completed the BULIT-R, BDI-II, STAIS, RS, and the MPQ. Temperamental characteristics, particularly increased Negative Emotionality and decreased Positive Emotionality, were significantly associated with increased levels of bulimic symptomatology. Moreover, these dimensions accounted for small, but statistically significant amounts of the variance of bulimic symptomatology over and above current negative affect and dietary restraint. Contrary to expectations, impulsivity did not predict bulimic symptoms. This study provides evidence that temperamental dimensions related to mood rather than impulsivity are associated with bulimic symptomatology and contribute to bulimic symptoms over and above state mood and dietary restraint. Future empirical studies are needed to clarify relationships between temperament and other risk factors for disordered eating. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study links summer foraging and scatter-hoarding to winter larder-hoarding and winter survival in yellow pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus) by comparing patterns of time allocation and winter larder contents in 2 years with very different levels of resource availability. In 2003, seed production and the number of trees and shrubs producing seeds were high. In 2004 seed crops were small. Chipmunks allocated more time to foraging when food resources were scarce (66% in 2004) compared to when they were abundant (39% in 2003). Increased time allocated to foraging in 2004 corresponded to significant decreases in time allocated to vigilance, resting, and social interactions. When seeds were scarce (i.e., in autumn 2004), chipmunks spent more time searching for cached food items than gathering seeds from plants or the ground surface. Despite the increase in foraging effort, the edible mass and caloric contents of larders were significantly smaller in 2004. In the year with low seed production, the diversity of seed species found in larders increased, and many of these seeds were of species that ripened in summer. When autumnal seed production by Jeffrey pine seeds was high, Jeffrey pine seeds were nearly the exclusive food item found in larders. Larder contents would have provisioned chipmunks for an estimated 116-257 days in 2003 and but only 6-111 days in 2004. It is likely that all chipmunks would have survived the winter of 2003 (duration ∼110-120 days). However, none of the larders recovered in 2004 contained enough food to have provisioned the inhabitant for the ∼148-158 days of winter. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Background: Second generation antipsychotics (SGA) induce substantial weight gain but the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon remain speculative. Objective: To explore eating behaviors among SGA-treated patients and compare them with nonschizophrenic healthy sedentary individuals (controls). Methods and Procedures: Appetite sensations were recorded before and after a standardized breakfast using visual analog scales. Three hours after breakfast, a buffet-type meal was offered to participants to document spontaneous food intake and food preferences. Satiety quotients (SQs) were calculated to determine the satiation of both meals and the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) was used to document eating behaviors. Body composition and abdominal fat distribution were assessed. Results: Compared with controls (n = 20), SGA-treated patients (n = 18) showed greater adiposity indices (P ≤ 0.04). Patients' degree of hunger was also higher following the standardized breakfast (P = 0.03). Moreover, patients had significantly higher cognitive dietary restraint, disinhibition, and susceptibility to hunger scores than the reference group (P ≤ 0.05). Disinhibition in the reference group was positively associated with hunger triggered by external cues (r = 0.48, P = 0.03) whereas internal cues seem to mainly regulate emotional susceptibility to disinhibition in patients (r = 0.56, P = 0.02). Higher strategic restraint behavior in patients was associated with decreased satiation right after the buffet-type meal (r = -0.56, P = 0.02). Discussion: These exploratory findings suggest that patients under SGA seem to develop disordered eating behaviors in response to altered appetite sensations and increased susceptibility to hunger, a factor which may influence the extent of body weight gain triggered by these drugs. © 2008 The Obesity Society.},

abstract={Prevalence of obesity in preschool children has increased dramatically in recent years. The preschool years (age 3-6 years) have been regarded as critical for the programming of energy balance, via the concept of early 'adiposity rebound'. Children who undergo early adiposity rebound are at increased risk of later obesity. Recent evidence suggests that associations between timing of adiposity rebound and later obesity may not reflect programming, but might denote that 'obesogenic' growth trajectories are often established by the preschool period. Studies of objectively-measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour in preschool children show that levels of physical activity are typically low and sedentary behaviour high. The review of evidence presented here is supportive of the hypothesis that physical activity is protective against obesity in the preschool period, and that sedentary behaviour, particularly television viewing, is obesogenic. Definitive evidence on dose-response relationships between physical activity, sedentary behaviour and obesity remain unclear. Dose-response evidence could be obtained fairly readily by intervention and longitudinal observational studies that use accelerometry in preschool children. The generalisability of much of the evidence base is limited and there is a need for research on the influence of physical activity and sedentary behaviour in the preschool years in the aetiology of obesity in the developing world. © The Author 2008.},

abstract={Redshanks Tringa totanus that are preyed upon by Sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus at the Tyninghame Estuary, Firth of Forth, Scotland, provide an example of how the starvation-predation risk trade-off results in mortality. In this trade-off, animals cannot always optimize anti-predation behaviour because anti-predation behaviours, such as avoiding predators, are usually incompatible with foraging behaviours that might maximize intake rates. Therefore, as animals compensate for starvation risk, predation risk increases. Sparrowhawks are the main direct cause of death in Redshanks at Tyninghame. Sparrowhawk attack rate is determined by Redshank vulnerability, and vulnerability decreases as group size and distance to cover increase, and probably as spacing decreases. But reduction of predation vulnerability reduces feeding rate because areas away from cover are less food-profitable and grouping results in increased interference competition. Increased starvation risk in midwinter means Redshanks are forced to feed on highly profitable prey, Orchestia amphipods, the behaviour of which means that Redshanks are forced to feed vulnerably, in widely spaced groups, close to predator-concealing cover. Therefore, it is the constraints that limit the ability of Redshanks to feed in large, dense flocks away from cover that ultimately lead to mortality. We investigate this hypothesis further by testing the prediction that mortality can be predicted directly by cold weather and population density. We demonstrate that the overall number of Redshanks and the proportion of Redshanks killed increase in cold months when controlling for population size. We also demonstrate that the proportion of Redshanks killed increases when there are fewer Redshanks present, because the success rate of hunting Sparrowhawks increases, probably because effective management of predation risk through flocking is constrained by a low population size. Redshanks therefore provide an example of how directly mortality caused by predation arises from starvation risk and other constraints that prevent animals from optimizing anti-predation behaviour. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={1. Marine invertebrates use egg nutrients to develop the functional feeding larva and then enter a facultative feeding period (FFP) when development can proceed without food because larvae are supported by maternal reserves. Facultative feeding reduces starvation risk and so is important for larval success. It may also influence egg size evolution because FFP length correlates with egg size. 2. We quantified energetic lipid (triglyceride, TG) utilisation in unfed and fed larvae as an index of larval nutritive condition in the tropical echinoid Tripneustes gratilla during the FFP to determine if fed larvae would use the buffer provided by endogenous provisions to improve their condition or accelerate development. We predicted that: (i) the condition of unfed and fed larvae should diverge before egg TG is exhausted and/or (ii) that the size of fed larvae should outstrip that of unfed larvae. 3. Temperate echinoplutei exhibit phenotypic plasticity, increasing the length of their food capture apparatus (arms) in nutrient-poor conditions. We examined the generality of this phenomenon in a morphometric analysis of growth in the tropical larva of T. gratilla. We hypothesized that plastic arm growth in starved larvae would occur before the FFP ends as a bet hedging strategy to prepare for hard times ahead when lack of reserves may render this response impossible. 4. We found that fed larvae diverged in condition (higher TG) but not in size compared with starved larvae before egg energetic lipids were exhausted. In addition, unfed larvae showed plastic arm growth before the end of the FFP. 5. Lack of divergence in growth of unfed and fed larvae suggests there may be an imperative to maintain a nutrient storage buffer against starvation due to unpredictable future planktonic food supply. The FFP of T. gratilla exceeds 8 days, considerably longer than that of other echinoids with similarly sized eggs, emphasizing that egg quality may be more important than egg size as a predictor of the FFP in fecundity-time models of egg evolution. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={Objectives: BMI is highly heritable. Yet, trends in obesity highlight environmental influences on body weight. Monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for overweight offer a unique opportunity to examine these factors. Methods: MZ male (n = 8 pairs) and female twins (n = 10 pairs) discordant for overweight (defined as the BMI of one twin being at least 24.5, and the BMI of his/her co-twin being below 24.5 and at least three points lower) were identified from the Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry. Variables were assessed via self-report questionnaires. Results: One overweight and two non-overweight females met criteria for bulimia nervosa. Rates of dieting and binge eating were high among all males and females. Hunger scores were higher among non-overweight females; disinhibition scores were higher among overweight males. Only one non-overweight and three overweight males smoked; 90% of non-overweight and 40% of overweight females smoked. Conclusions: Assessing tobacco use and eating disorders may be important when sampling on the basis of family members who are discordant for BMI. Finally, results suggest possibilities for interventions in individuals at-risk for overweight.},

abstract={The aim of the present study was to analyse outcome, time to remission, and predictors of time to remission in a cohort of Danish eating disorder patients. Seventy-eight patients (35 anorexic, 30 bulimic and 13 unspecified eating disorder patients) were interviewed 2 1/2 years after initial assessment. Method of assessment was Eating Disorder Examination (EDE), Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation of Eating Disorders (LIFE-EAT-II), Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI), Symptom Check List (SCL-90R), Present State Examination (PSE) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Axis-II (SCID-II). Method of analysis was Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival, Log Rank test and Cox regression analysis. In total 48.7% reached remission with mean time to remission at 27 months. A trend difference between the diagnostic groups when measuring time to remission was found, i.e. patients with unspecified eating disorders remitted faster than bulimic (BN) patients who in turn remitted faster than anorexic (AN) patients. Body mass index (BMI) at baseline was the best predictor of time to remission for the total sample. Predictors differed when looking at diagnostic groups separately. Final outcome was comparable with earlier studies while relapse frequency was low. Patients with AN remitted faster than found in earlier survival analysis studies, while the remission rate for BN patients was comparable with earlier studies. Despite the prognostic value of BMI for the total sample, predictor analysis implied more disorder diversity than homogeneity.},

abstract={Prey scarcity compromises population survival, especially for specialist predators. Supplementary feeding is a management tool that can be applied to reverse the decline of food-limited populations. We analyse how a population of Iberian lynx, a threatened food specialist, initially reacted to, and subsequently used, supplementary food. Twenty-seven feeding stations (FS) with domestic rabbits were placed in the Doñana Biological Reserve, SW Spain, between 2002 and 2005. We recorded lynx tracks inside and around stations to analyse spatio-temporal patterns of use, as well as the performance of several station designs. Iberian lynx used 62% of the FS installed, and consumed most of the supplied food. All station designs were used and food provision apparently covered the energetic needs of the lynx inhabiting the reserve. There was spatial aggregation in the use of the FS. Fourteen weeks were needed on average for lynx to become familiar with feeding stations and making a regular use of the supplementary food. Seasonal variations in consumption frequency appeared to be modulated by fluctuations of wild rabbit numbers throughout its annual cycle as well as by variation in energy demand of breeding females. The Iberian lynx responded positively to our supplementary feeding programme. We show that this technique allows the persistence of lynx populations during long periods in areas where wild rabbits are extremely scarce. Supplementary food may be used to sustain lynx whenever rabbit populations need recovery, as well as in the context of lynx restocking or reintroduction programmes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Shoaling behavior protects fishes from avian and piscine predation, but at the same time costs of group living arise due to several mechanisms including increased food competition. Most cave fishes live in an environment in which avian and piscine predators are lacking, and cave environments are often characterized by low food availability, leading to increased food competition. Altogether, this should favor the reduction of shoaling in cave fishes. We compared shoaling behavior (i.e. the tendency to associate with a stimulus shoal) among surface dwelling populations of the Atlantic molly, Poecilia mexicana, and two cave forms of that species. The first cave population of P. mexicana originated from the Cueva del Azufre and was previously recognized as the only cave form of a poeciliid fish. The second cave population examined came from a cave that was discovered only recently (Cueva Luna Azufre). In both cave forms shoaling behavior was reduced compared with surface dwelling mollies. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={With the implementation of the Food Quality Protection Act in 1996, more detailed evaluations of possible health effects of pesticides on developing organisms have been required. As a result, considerable developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) data have been generated on a variety of endpoints, including developmental changes in motor activity, auditory startle habituation, and various learning and memory parameters. One issue in interpreting these data is the level of variability for the measures used in these studies: excessive variability can obscure treatment-related effects, or conversely, small but statistically significant changes could be viewed as treatment related, when they might in fact be within the normal range. To aid laboratories in designing useful DNT studies for regulatory consideration, an operational framework for evaluating observed variability in study data has been developed. Elements of the framework suggest how an investigator might approach characterization of variability in the dataset; identification of appropriate datasets for comparison; evaluation of similarities and differences in variability between these datasets, and of possible sources of the variability, including those related to test conduct and test design. A case study using auditory startle habituation data is then presented, employing the elements of this proposed approach. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE - To assess whether psychological constructs of hostility, anger, type A behavior pattern, and depressive symptom severity 1) were associated with concurrent and prospective fasting glucose levels and 2) whether this association was moderated by marital status. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -Participants were 485 healthy men ([mean ± SD] age 59 plusmn 7 years) without a history of heart disease, diabetes, or taking related medications in the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study. Their fasting glucose levels between 1986 and 1995 were examined. Hierarchical linear regressions were conducted to investigate whether hostility, anger, type A behavior, and depressive symptoms were associated with concurrent fasting glucose levels as well as fasting glucose 9 years later, controlling for standard sociodemographic and biomedical covariates, including baseline fasting glucose, age, education, marital status, BMI, total cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure. RESULTS - Although none of the psychological variables were associated with concurrent fasting glucose, Cook-Medley hostility (β = 0.105), anger (β = 0.091), and type A behavior (β = 0.152) each were associated with prospective fasting glucose 9 years later, controlling for standard covariates. Depressive symptom severity was not associated with either concurrent or follow-up glucose levels. Further analysis showed that marital status moderated the effects of these characteristics on follow-up fasting glucose such that hostility, anger, and type A behavior were significant only among those who were not married (β = 0.348, 0.444, 0.439, respectively; all P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS - Hostility, anger, and type A behavior appear to be independent risk factors for impaired glucose metabolism among unmarried older men. © 2008 by the American Diabetes Association.},

abstract={Eating disorders appear with relative frequency in sports, such as gymnastics, figure skating or resistance sports, in which weight control is important. Their incidence is greater in women, frequently appearing a low self-esteem, a distorted body image in which the body is perceived with an excess of weight, inefficiency, perfectionism and a sense of control loss, with compensatory attempts exerted through food manipulation and the use of inadequate methods of control weight. Frequently, they are associated in female athletes to irregularities of the menstrual cycle, reduction of the bone mineral density and osteoporosis, giving rise to so-called female athlete triad. Cardiovascular problems, a greater incidence of fractures, and muscular power and resistance losses which impair performance, can also develop. Between the risk for their appearance are attempts to lose weight, often by recommendation of the coach, increases of training loads associated to weight losses, characteristics of the personality that take to excessive preoccupation by body image, or injuries and traumatisms. Treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach, with participation of physicians, psychologists/psychiatrists, nutricionists, coaches and family, being specially important the emphasis on preventive measures.},

abstract={Objective: Stress increases the drive to consume calorically dense preferred foods suggesting an exogenous factor that may induce caloric overconsumption and weight gain. As females show heightened stress sensitivity and present with increased rates of obesity, we hypothesized that stress-induced increases in the motivation for preferred foods may be a sex-specific predisposing factor for weight gain. Methods and Procedures: To investigate this hypothesis, we have developed a buried food paradigm that permits the measurement of sex differences and effects of chronic variable stress (CVS) on the latency to uncover and the consumption of a preferred food pellet without the requisite caloric restriction required in traditional operant conditioning tasks. Results: In our studies, females consistently showed latencies that were twice as fast as males to locate the buried pellet in limited access tests. Interestingly, during stress exposure, male latencies decreased to that of control female levels. Male and female mice showed a significant effect of stress, three- and fourfold, respectively, on increased consumption of the preferred food during testing. Discussion: These results support a basal sex difference in behaviors toward a preferred food, and a possible role of stress sensitivity in the drive and intake of such foods. Sex differences in the role stress plays in these behaviors may provide insight into underlying mechanisms related to an increased obesity risk. © 2008 The Obesity Society.},

abstract={This study was designed to further assess cognitive and affective functioning in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the Fmr1tm1Cgr or Fmr1 "knockout" (KO) mouse. Male KO mice and wild-type littermate controls were tested on learning set and reversal learning tasks. The KO mice were not impaired in associative learning, transfer of learning, or reversal learning, based on measures of learning rate. Analyses of videotapes of the reversal learning task revealed that both groups of mice exhibited higher levels of activity and wall-climbing during the initial sessions of the task than during the final sessions, a pattern also seen for trials following an error relative to those following a correct response. Notably, the increase in both behavioral measures seen early in the task was significantly more pronounced for the KO mice than for controls, as was the error-induced increase in activity level. This pattern of effects suggests that the KO mice reacted more strongly than controls to the reversal of contingencies and pronounced drop in reinforcement rate, and to errors in general. This pattern of effects is consistent with the heightened emotional reactivity firequently described for humans with FXS. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Development of the ability to capture prey is crucial to predator survival. Trends in food-capture performance over early ontogeny were quantified for leopard sharks Triakis semifasciata and whitespotted bamboosharks Chiloscyllium plagiosum by measuring suction pressure and flow in front of the mouth during feeding. At any size, C. plagiosum produce greater subambient pressure and ingest more rounded water parcels. Maximum subambient pressure scaled with negative allometry in T. semifasciata and was accompanied by an increase in the time to reach maximum gape. Despite a similar trend in buccal expansion timing, maximum pressure in C. plagiosum scaled with isometry and was accompanied by an earlier onset of hyoid depression and a positive allometric increase in buccal reserve volume. Growth was the primary factor responsible for developmental trends in both species, with size-independent behavioural changes contributing little to overall performance variability. Ontogenetic dietary shifts are predicted for both species as a consequence of size-dependent changes in performance. Chiloscyllium plagiosum becomes anatomically and behaviourally canalized towards suction feeding, limiting the effective range of prey capture and possibly necessitating stalking. Triakis semifasciata, by contrast, retains the flexibility to employ both ram and suction and therefore captures more elusive prey with age. © 2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Previous studies have demonstrated that corticopetal cholinergic lesions applied to the nucleus basalis magnocellularis and substantia innominata (NBM/SI) attenuate operant suppression induced by aversive events. However, these lesions have no effect on open-arm behavior in the elevated plus-maze or changes in startle reactivity induced by bright light. This raises the possibility that NBM/SI corticopetal cholinergic lesions alter operant behavior and/or appetitive state, as opposed to the aversive state operant suppression is supposed to index. To address this concern, the authors documented the effect of NBM/SI corticopetal cholinergic lesions on freezing induced by a component of fox feces (2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline [TMT]), a paradigm that does not involve food deprivation or operant performance. TMT presentation induced freezing behavior, and this effect was attenuated by NBM/SI corticopetal cholinergic lesions. Because predator odor presentation, but not presentation of a predator, induces defense behaviors that are sensitive to anxiolytic drugs, the results of the study suggest that NBM/SI corticopetal cholinergic lesions attenuate anxiety-like states. © 2008 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Abnormalities in serum cholesterol levels of patients with mood disorders have been identified in epidemiological studies. However, evidence for an influence of dietary cholesterol on behavioral models is poor. Here, we investigated the behavioral changes of Wistar male rats fed a 2% cholesterol-enriched diet for 2 months in experimental models of depression and anxiety, such as the forced swim test (FST) paradigm and the novelty-induced grooming sampling test (NGT). The correlation between behavioral depression and impaired cognitive capacity was also examined testing rats in the Morris water maze (MWM) task one day after the FST. Different groups of rats fed various dietary regimens, were subjected to acute or repeated treatment (14 days) with clomipramine hydrochloride (50 or 25 mg/kg), diazepam (1 mg/kg) or with the peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) antagonist, isoquinoline PK11195 (1 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally (i.p.). Rats fed the cholesterol-enriched diet showed a significant decrease of grooming score in the NGT and of immobility time in the FST in comparison to animals fed a standard diet. Furthermore, the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of diazepam and clomipramine were not affected by the different diets. Only after repeated treatment, PK11195 impaired the performance of animals fed a standard diet in the FST, and exhibited an anxiolytic-like profile in animals fed either the cholesterol-enriched or the standard diet. The improved performance in the FST was followed by a better learning performance in the acquisition phase of the MWM. These results suggest that effects of cholesterol-enriched diet on the behavioral reaction of rats in experimental models of mild stress may involve PBRs. They deserve attention in order to clarify the clinical correlation between plasma cholesterol levels and mood disorders in humans. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

A limitation of this conclusion, however, was that honesty was defined in the context of size assessment, neglecting the potential information that displays might transmit about signallers' variable internal states. Recent analyses of signalling in this same species have shown that its displays provide reliable information about the amount of risk crabs are prepared to tolerate, which therefore might enable signallers to use these displays to honestly convey their motivation to take such risks. Here we test this 'honest advertisement of motivation' hypothesis by varying crabs' need for food and analysing their signalling during simulated feeding conflicts against a model. When crabs were starved for 1-5 days, they dropped significantly in weight. Despite this decrement in resource-holding potential and energy reserves, crabs were more likely to perform cheliped extension displays the longer they were food deprived. Longer-starved crabs, whose subjective resource value was greater, also displayed at a higher rate and were more likely to risk seizing the food from the model. We conclude that cheliped extension is a reliable indicator of crabs' internal state and suggest how this honest signal might operate in conflicts over a variety of other resources in addition to food. We propose that future studies detecting apparent dishonesty should analyse many possible signal-state correlations before concluding a signal is actually dishonest. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Moving animal groups provide some of the most intriguing and difficult to characterise examples of collective behaviour. We review some recent (and not so recent) empirical research on the motion of animal groups, including fish, locusts and homing pigeons. An important concept which unifies our understanding of these groups is that of transfer of directional information. Individuals which change their direction of travel in response to the direction taken by their near neighbours can quickly transfer information about the presence of a predatory threat or food source. We show that such information transfer is optimised when the density of individuals in a group is close to that at which a phase transition occurs between random and ordered motion. Similarly, we show that even relatively small differences in information possessed by group members can lead to strong collective-level decisions for one of two options. By combining the use of self-propelled particle and social force models of collective motion with thinking about the evolution of flocking we aim to better understand how complexity arises within these groups. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Collective detection and predation risk dilution are two nonexclusive mechanisms that can allow a reduction in antipredator vigilance in large animal groups. The two mechanisms make remarkably similar predictions in many contexts, and disentangling their relative contribution has proven empirically difficult thus far. We examined a situation where predators are more likely to attack from one side of the group. Provided that all foragers in the group can detect the predator equally well, the collective detection hypothesis predicts that all individuals will adopt the same vigilance level if this mechanism acted alone. In terms of risk dilution, individuals that are on the riskier side of the group, namely those on the attack side, are unlikely to benefit to the same extent as other groupmates from the presence of companions, and should have a higher level of vigilance than more buffered foragers further inside the group. We show that semipalmated sandpipers on the riskier side of flocks were more vigilant and thus pecked at a lower rate than those in the centre of the flocks and those on the less risky side. The proportion of successful pecks did not vary with spatial position within the flocks, suggesting that differences in food availability did not confound the above findings. We conclude that it is unlikely that collective detection acted alone and that risk dilution, acting alone or in combination with collective detection, shaped antipredator vigilance in an avian prey under predation risk. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Behaviour and morphology were both shown to differ between 1+ perch from two lakes that in earlier studies showed differences in size-specific predation risk. As the level of nourishment is known to affect behaviour and morphology, we fed perch of the two lakes in tanks for 40 days with two food levels, to study whether observed differences remain stable with changes in food availability. The perch fed in excess grew significantly, while the perch at the low food conditions lost weight, clearly indicating undernourishment. In aquarium experiments, the starved perch from both lakes were much bolder in the trade-off between foraging and predator avoidance than their well-fed conspecifics. In addition, the shape of perch differed significantly between feeding treatments. At low food levels perch got a more slender body, while at high food levels they developed a deeper body and a relatively smaller head. Independent of feeding level, the comparison between the two lakes revealed a clearly deeper body and a larger head area for one population, a shape difference that remained stable after the feeding period. The results give evidence that the level of nourishment is an important factor that quickly alters risk-taking behaviour. In body morphology, however, more stable shape characteristics must be distinguished from more flexible ones. Consequently, the level of nourishment is a potential factor that may quickly hide other proximate cues and must be considered attentively in studies, in which shape changes and behaviour are related to environmental factors like diet, predation pressure or habitat diversity. © 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard.},

abstract={Objective: To compare the effect of continuous versus bolus feeding on behavioral responses of stress in very low birth weight infants during early postnatal life. Methods: In a randomized, controlled trial conducted at 3 neonatal units, 70 premature infants with gestational age 24 to 29 weeks and birth weight <1200 g were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 feeding methods: continuous nasogastric feeding, bolus nasogastric feeding, and bolus orogastric feeding. Behavioral responses were video recorded during feeding at 7 and 15 days of postnatal age and at 32 weeks of postmenstrual age. The odds ratio (OR) of manifest behavioral stress was calculated by means of logistic regression. Results: A significantly higher risk of a behavioral stress response in bolus-fed infants compared with continuous-fed infants at 15 days of age was observed, [adjusted OR=4.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.1-15.4)]. A similar difference was observed at 32 weeks of postmenstrual age [adjusted OR=4.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.0-17.8)]. In addition, bolus-fed infants showed statistically significant higher need of behavioral and physiologic stabilization during feeding. Discussion: This trial suggests that continuous feeding is associated with lower behavioral stress response as compared with bolus feeding among very low birth weight infants, in early postnatal life. © 2008 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={The objective of the present study was to examine the effects of increasing the number of heifers per concentrate feeding place on performance, behavior, welfare indicators, and ruminal fermentation of feedlot heifers. Seventy-two Friesian heifers were used in a factorial arrangement, with 3 treatments and 3 blocks of similar BW. Treatments consisted of 2 (T2), 4 (T4), or 8 (T8) heifers per each place in the concentrate feeder (8 heifers/pen). Concentrate and straw were fed at 0830 h in individual feeders that allowed ad libitum consumption. During 6 periods of 28 d each, DMI and ADG were measured, and blood and rumen samples were taken. Fecal glucocorticoid metabolites and behavior were measured at periods 1, 3, and 6. Final BW, ADG, and G:F were not affected by treatments. Variability in final BW among heifers sharing the same pen tended to increase (P = 0.06) and concentrate intake decreased linearly as competition increased. The proportion of abscessed livers responded quadratically, being 8, 4, and 20% for T2, T4, and T8, respectively. Concentrate eating time decreased (P = 0.001) and eating rate increased (P = 0.05) linearly, whereas the variability between pen mates in concentrate eating time was greatest in T4 and T8. Increasing competition resulted in a quadratic response (P = 0.02) in daily lying time (greatest in T2), whereas standing time increased linearly (P = 0.02). The number of displacements among pen mates from the concentrate feeders, as well as the total sum of displacements, increased linearly (P < 0.05) with increasing competition. The pen average of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites was not affected by treatments (P ≥ 0.16) but the pen's maximum concentration responded quadratically (P < 0.001), being greatest in T8, with dominant heifers being the most affected. Serum haptoglobin concentration increased linearly (P = 0.05) with competition, particularly within the most subordinate heifers. Increased competition reduced (P < 0.05) ruminal pH only in periods 1 and 2 and increased ruminal lactate (P = 0.02). Increasing competition at the concentrate feeders increased the variability in final BW but performance was not affected. Detrimental effects on animal welfare might be deduced from the altered feeding behavior, reduced resting time, and increased aggression. Ruminal lactate and blood haptoglobin indicate that the risk of rumen acidosis might increase with competition, whereas liver abscesses increased at 8 heifers per feeder. © 2008 American Society of Animal Science.

abstract={The aim was to determine the consequences of multi-generational n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) deficiency on emotional response in rats subjected to maternal separation (MS) as chronic early life stress. Pups fed a control or an n-3 PUFA deficient diet were daily separated for 2 weeks before weaning. In adult rats, reward response was assessed by sucrose consumption and reactivity to novelty using openfield test. Both n-3 PUFA deficiency and MS increased reward response and impulsivity. Moreover, nutritional deficiency and stress acted in synergy to elevate sucrose intake by 80%, compared to control conditions. n-3 PUFA deprivation induced a depletion of docosahexanoeic acid of brain membranes by 70% compensated by increase in 22:5 n-6 and arachidonic acid (AA) levels. The diet-induced AA increase was, however, significantly higher in MS rats. This suggests that n-3 PUFA deficit could be an environmental risk increasing vulnerability to depressive-like response induced by chronic stress. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Context: Increased fruit and vegetable intake can reduce cancer risk. Information from this study contributes to research exploring health disparities in high-risk dietary behavior. Purpose: Changes in fruit and vegetable behavior were evaluated to assess the effects of a low-intensity, physician-endorsed dietary intervention in a rural population. Methods: The study was a randomized trial of 754 patients from 3 physician practices in rural Virginia. Low-literacy nutrition education materials and personalized dietary feedback were administered by mail and telephone. Mixed model analysis of variance was used to determine the effect of the intervention on fruit and vegetable intake behavior, knowledge, intentions, and self-efficacy at 1, 6, and 12 months. Findings: The intervention effect was moderated by age, race, sex, and education. Intake at 1 and 6 months was increased for older and younger participants and those with some college, and further maintained at 12 months by those who did not complete high school. African Americans in the intervention group displayed significantly greater intentions to increase fruit/vegetable intake than whites/others. Knowledge of fruit/vegetable recommendations significantly increased in the intervention group at 12 months, particularly for men. Conclusions: For the rural population, a low-intensity physician-endorsed self-help dietary intervention was successful in initiating fruit and vegetable dietary changes at 1 and 6 months post-intervention, and increasing intentions to change in African Americans. The relationship of the moderating effects of age, race, sex and education need to be further explored in relation to dietary intervention and dietary behavior change for the rural population. © 2008 National Rural Health Association.},

abstract={Children with severe antisocial behavior have an increased risk of showing violently aggressive and other forms of problem behavior in adolescence and adulthood. It is well established that both biological and social factors are involved in the development of antisocial behavior. The primary aim of this paper is to discuss the evidence that specific neurobiological systems are involved in the etiology of childhood-onset antisocial behavior. These factors are responsible for the severity of the behavioral problems observed in antisocial children, but they also play a role in their persistence, because they influence children's interactions with their environment. We will discuss the possible causes of disruptions in neurobiological systems in childhood antisocial behavior and point out the implications of these findings for theory and clinical practice. We will argue that familial factors (e.g., genetic influences, early childhood adversity) are linked to negative behavioral outcomes (e.g., antisocial behavior problems) through the mediating and transactional interplay with neurobiological deficits. An investigation of neurobiological functioning in antisocial children might not only indicate which children are most likely to persist in engaging in severe antisocial behavior, but also guide the development of new interventions. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE:: To compare weight concerns and self-reported body mass index (BMI) of low birth weight (LBW) adolescent boys to those of a normative sample and examine relationships among BMI, weight concerns, self-esteem, and depression in the LBW cohort. METHODS:: LBW boys (n = 260; mean age, 16.0) belong to the Neonatal Brain Hemorrhage Study birth cohort. Normative boys (n = 305; mean age, 16.5) belong to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Both samples were assessed in 2001-2004 with self-report questionnaires. BMI was calculated from self-reported height and weight. Weight perception and weight dissatisfaction were assessed with the Eating Symptoms Inventory. In LBW boys, self-esteem was measured with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and depression with the Beck Depression Inventory. RESULTS:: Based on self-reported height and weight, LBW boys were more likely to be healthy weight or underweight and less likely to be overweight than normative boys. Despite having healthier self-reported BMIs, LBW boys reported more weight concerns than the normative sample. A total of 46.9% of LBW boys perceived their weight as abnormal, and 76.5% desired weight change. Weight concerns in LBW boys mostly reflected a perception of being underweight (31.2% of the cohort) and a desire to gain weight (47.5% of the cohort), although only 6.5% were clinically underweight. Weight concerns, but not BMI, were related to clinical depression and lower self-esteem. CONCLUSIONS:: LBW adolescent boys are at high risk of experiencing weight concerns. Weight concerns rather than BMI are associated with emotional problems in LBW boys. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={A major neuroendocrinological effect of calorie restriction (CR) is induction of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). Aside from its appetite-stimulating effects, NPY is thought to be involved in the modulation of behavioral processes including anxiety and learning and memory. In the present study physical fitness, anxiety, and learning/memory-related tasks were assessed in mice lacking NPY or a functional ARC after dietary manipulation by CR. Physical fitness was improved by CR when measured by inclined screen and rotarod, and this diet effect was not affected by NPY or ARC status. As has been observed previously, the NPY knockout mice displayed heightened anxiety in an open field. This phenotype was not fully recapitulated in the ARC-lesioned model. CR affected neither total locomotor activity in the open field nor thigmotaxic behavior in these models. Neither NPY nor CR had a significant effect on Morris water maze performance; however, ARC-damaged mice were unable to learn the task, and this deficit was not corrected by CR. We conclude that despite established effects of CR on ARC signaling, our results suggest a mechanistic separation between the two where behavior is concerned.},

abstract={Almost all life histories are phenotypically plastic: that is, life-history traits such as timing of breeding, family size or the investment in individual offspring vary with some aspect of the environment, such as temperature or food availability. One approach to understanding this phenotypic plasticity from an evolutionary point of view is to extend the optimality approach to the range of environments experienced by the organism. This approach attempts to understand the value of particular traits in terms of the selection pressures that act on them either directly or owing to trade-offs due to resource allocation and other factors such as predation risk. Because these selection pressures will between environments, the predicted optimal phenotype will too. The relationship expressing the optimal phenotype for different environments is the optimal reaction norm and describes the optimal phenotypic plasticity. However, this view of phenotypic plasticity ignores the fact that the reaction norm must be underlain by some sort of control system: cues about the environment must be collected by sense organs, integrated into a decision about the appropriate life history, and a message sent to the relevant organs to implement that decision. In multicellular animals, this control mechanism is the neuroendocrine system. The central question that this paper addresses is whether the control system affects the reaction norm that evolves. This might happen in two different ways: first, the control system will create constraints on the evolution of reaction norms if it cannot be configured to produce the optimal reaction norm and second, the control system will create additional selection pressures on reaction norms if the neuroendocrine system is costly. If either of these happens, a full understanding of the way in which selection shapes reaction norms must include details of the neuroendocrine control system. This paper presents the conceptual framework needed to explain what is meant by a constraint or cost being created by the neuroendocrine system and discusses the extent to which this occurs and some possible examples. The purpose of doing this is to encourage endocrinologists to take a fresh look at neuroendocrine mechanisms and help identify the properties of the system and situations in which these generate constraints and costs that impinge on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. © 2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Population studies often focus on demographic and genetic consequences of dispersal strategies, generally within an evolutionary framework. Adaptive investment in dispersal is generally assessed from single types of (pre-)dispersal behaviour that are presumed to reliably reflect the dispersal strategy adopted. Various spider families show a striking and quantifiable display, known as tiptoe behaviour that prepares individuals for take-off prior to (passive) aerial dispersal (ballooning). The lack of efficient control mechanisms during ballooning prevents individuals from actively selecting a suitable habitat for landing. Ballooning dispersal is therefore often regarded as a wind lottery preceded by individual-based risk assessment. Our laboratory experiments showed that the duration of tiptoe behaviour can be used as an indicator of silk thread length, which is related to the potential dispersal distance. For two related species, Erigone arctica and E. dentiplapis, tiptoe duration decreased independently of sex after starvation, while more complex reaction norms were observed for tiptoe frequency. Because these two aspects of dispersal behaviours show different responses towards a simple stress-factor (starvation) in two related spider species, we conclude that the level of plasticity in dispersal investment can be subject to selective forces affecting different dispersal properties in different ways. Our results, hence, plead for a more holistic approach when addressing evolutionary and applied questions related to dispersal. © 2007 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.},

abstract={Feeding adult rats with high fat (HF) diets can alter their hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis responsiveness. In the present study, we examined the effect of a high fat diet, applied in rats from weaning to puberty, on their behavior and HPA axis status at puberty onset. Wistar rats of both sexes were fed postweaning with two diets containing either 24% fat (high fat, HF) or 4.3% fat (normal chow) by weight. HF enhanced puberty onset in female rats, without increasing body weight gain in either sex, compared with chow-fed animals. In the forced swim test, HF males exhibited a more active behavioral response on the first day, whereas HF females a more passive response during the second day of the test, as compared with their chow-fed counterparts. In the open field test, HF females showed increased sniffing but reduced rearing, compared with chow-fed females and were less explorative than HF males in the central arena. All animals could learn and recall a water maze task though HF males spent more time in the opposite quadrant than chow-fed males during memory test. The HPA axis status of these animals was investigated under basal conditions. Pubertal fat-fed males had lighter adrenals, while females heavier ones, compared with their counterparts. In addition, plasma corticosterone levels of female rats were increased and glucocorticoid receptor levels in their hypothalamus were reduced due to fat diet, while in males no such changes were detected. We conclude that HF feeding during the prepubertal period can affect behavior and the HPA axis of rats at puberty onset, well before the appearance of the obese state, in a sexually dimorphic manner. Fat diet impacted more the female HPA axis, suggesting that their system is more sensitive to fat-induced nutritional imbalance during adolescence. Present data suggest that the fat-induced nutritional imbalance in young females may lead to neuroendocrine dysfunction that in turn may trigger the appearance of stress-related disorders during adolescence. © 2008 IBRO.},

abstract={Partial migration is a common phenomenon among many animals and occurs in many types of ecosystems. Understanding the mechanisms behind partial migration is of major importance for the understanding of population dynamics and, eventually, ecosystem processes. We studied the effects of food availability on the seasonal partial migration of cyprinid fish from a lake to connected streams during winter by the use of passive telemetry. Fish with increased access to food were found to migrate in higher proportion, earlier in the season, and to reside in the streams for a longer period compared to fish with decreased access to food. Furthermore, fewer unfed migrants returned to the lake, indicating higher overwinter mortality. Our results suggest that individual fish trade off safety from predation and access to food differently depending on their body condition, which results in a condition-dependent partial migration. Hence, our main conclusion is that individual decision-making is based on assessment of own condition which offers a mechanistic explanation to partial migration. Moreover, this may be of high importance for understanding population responses to environmental variation as well as ecosystem dynamics and stability. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Top-down effects of predators on prey behavior and population dynamics have been extensively studied. However, some populations of very large herbivores appear to be regulated primarily from the bottom up. Given the importance of food resources to these large herbivores, it is reasonable to expect that forage heterogeneity (variation in quality and quantity) affects individual and group behaviors as well as distribution on the landscape. Forage heterogeneity is often strongly driven by underlying soils, so substrate characteristics may indirectly drive herbivore behavior and distribution. Forage heterogeneity may further interact with predation risk to influence prey behavior and distribution. Here we examine differences in spatial distribution, home range size, and grouping behaviors of African buffalo as they relate to geologic substrate (granite and basalt) and variation in food quality and quantity. In this study, we use satellite imagery, forage quantity data, and three years of radio-tracking data to assess how forage quality, quantity, and heterogeneity affect the distribution and individual and herd behavior of African buffalo. We found that buffalo in an overall poorer foraging environment keyed-in on exceptionally high-quality areas, whereas those foraging in a more uniform, higher-quality area used areas of below-average quality. Buffalo foraging in the poorer-quality environment had smaller home range sizes, were in smaller groups, and tended to be farther from water sources than those foraging in the higher-quality environment. These differences may be due to buffalo creating or maintaining nutrient hotspots (small, high-quality foraging areas) in otherwise low-quality foraging areas, and the location of these hotspots may in part be determined by patterns of predation risk. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Frequent diet change has been identified as a risk factor for feather pecking in commercial flocks but the mechanism underlying this association is not known. In this experiment we simulated a commercial change of diet between high quality (HQ) 19% protein, and low quality (LQ) 15% protein, diets. Twelve pairs of birds were fed both diets simultaneously for 38 days to determine whether clear preferences for the diets existed. A further 12 triplets of birds were fed either HQ or LQ diets for 38 days to examine any absolute effects of quality on behaviour. The remaining triplets received, on day 29, either a LQ to HQ diet change (n = 12 groups) or an HQ to LQ diet change (n = 12 groups). Half of the groups in these diet change treatments received oregano oil as a potential 'masking' agent to disguise the diet change. No dietary preferences were detected and there were no absolute effects of diet on behaviour. Diet change provoked significant increases in beak-related activity. Specifically, affiliative pecking (allopreening directed towards comb or beak) was increased after diet change. Masking the diet reduced the effects of diet change. Injurious pecking remained at low levels throughout the experiment and was not affected by diet change, but the relationship between affiliative pecking and subsequent injurious pecking requires further investigation. © 2008 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.},

abstract={Ant colonies that undergo long starvation periods have to tune their exploratory and foraging responses to face their food needs. Although the number of foragers is known to increase with food deprivation in the ant Lasius niger, such enhanced food exploitation is not related to a more intense recruitment by successful scouts. We thus suggest that the colony's response to a food shortage could result from changes at the level of the ant recruits, in particular from changes in their spatial organization inside the nest. Since aggregation plays a key role in the social organization of ants, we assume that the colony's response to starvation could be due to changes in the aggregative behaviour of L. niger nestmates.We thus compared the aggregation dynamics of inner-nest workers and foragers having undergone either a short or a long-lasting starvation period. Whatever the ethological group (foragers or inner-nest workers), there was no significant influence of starvation on the aggregation dynamics nor on any feature of the observed clusters. This result shows that an increased foraging response to food shortage cannot be explained by changes in the tendency of nestmates to aggregate within the nest. Finally, we discuss other behavioural mechanisms, in particular changes in behavioural thresholds that could underlie the adaptive changes seen in colony foraging after long starvation periods. © 2008 Birkhaeuser.},

abstract={Maintenance of demographically and genetically self-sustaining populations in captivity can assist conservation of threatened species. Captivity can, however, lead to changes in phenotype, though to date this issue has received little attention in reptiles. We compared phenotypic differences in the now critically-endangered Otago skink (Oligosoma otagense) between wild specimens (Otago, southern New Zealand) and in captivity (North Island). Individuals of this long-lived, viviparous species have been maintained up to three generations in captivity, primarily by private herpetoculturists, but increasingly there is interest in integrating management of captive stocks with conservation in situ. For the same snout-vent length, captive skinks pooled across three colonies had a significantly heavier body mass, wider tail base, longer tail (juveniles only), faster growth rate and much slower sprint speed than in the wild. Captive skinks also lacked ectoparasitic mites and haemogregarine parasites, and experienced warmer temperatures with probably greater access to food. Our study demonstrates the importance of not treating captive management for conservation as a tool of last resort. Important questions, if captive-raised animals are to be released to the wild, are is it better for released skinks to run swiftly or to be heavy-bodied, and what role does reinfestation with native parasites have in determining this balance? We also recommend genetic analysis and studbook management of captive stocks, research to determine implications of heavy body mass for reproduction in captivity, and production of at least some offspring for release inside larger enclosures within the local climate. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={There is a general trend that parasitism risk declines as latitude increases. Host populations breeding at high latitudes should therefore invest less in costly immune defenses than populations breeding in temperate or tropical zones, although it is unknown if such an effect is mediated by environmental (photoperiodic) or genetic factors or both. Acquired immune function (humoral, cell-mediated) and behavioral sickness responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; mimics bacterial infection) were assessed in two subspecies of white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys) that breed at different latitudes in western North America. Zonotrichia l. gambelii (GWCS) is a high-latitude breeder (47-68°N) while Z. l. pugetensis (PWCS) breeds at temperate latitudes (40-49°N). Captive males of each subspecies were acclimated to (1) a short day (non-breeding) photoperiod (8L:16D), (2) the breeding photoperiod of PWCS (16L:8D), or (3) the breeding photoperiod of GWCS (20L:4D). Photoperiod was manipulated because shorter day lengths may enhance immune function. In support of a genetic effect, humoral responses to diphtheria-tetanus vaccination were significantly higher in PWCS compared to GWCS, regardless of photoperiod. There were no differences in cell-mediated responses to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) between subspecies or among photoperiods. For sickness responses to LPS, a significant interaction between photoperiod and subspecies was found, with long day GWCS producing stronger sickness responses (losing more weight, eating less) than short day GWCS and PWCS on all day lengths. However, these effects were influenced by photoperiodic changes in body condition. In conclusion, we find evidence for genetic control of immune responses across latitude, but no support for environmental (photoperiodic) regulation. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

A number of theoretical and empirical studies have shown that a prey's energetic state or the level of its resource should influence this trade-off (i.e., what the optimal activity level at a level of predation risk is). Here, I show that the energetic state of prey may also influence the duration of their antipredator behavioral response. Green frog tadpoles (Rana clamitans) reduced their activity level for a shorter time during exposure to the chemical cue of predatory larval dragonflies (Anax spp.) as their time since last feeding increased (i.e., as their energetic state decreased). Interestingly, the tadpoles strongly reduced their activity level upon cue exposure in all treatments. Thus, the relative activity level of tadpoles at different energetic states varied over time. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

However, few studies have analyzed the effects of chronic donepezil treatment on the cognitive functions of intact animals. Objectives: The cognitive functions of healthy young rats treated chronically with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil were evaluated using a wide behavioral test battery. Results: Chronic treatment with donepezil ameliorated memory functions and explorative strategies, speeded up the acquisition of localizing knowledge, augmented responsiveness to the context, and reduced anxiety levels. However, it did not affect spatial span, modify motivational levels, or influence associative learning. Conclusions: The present findings show the specific profile of donepezil action on cognitive functions in the presence of unaltered cholinergic neurotransmission systems. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Bupropion (BUP) is a dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitor that causes mild weight loss in obese adults. Subchronic (7 day) coadministration of selective DA and NE reuptake inhibitors also causes weight loss in mice. Because weight loss was not associated with decreased caloric intake, subchronic BUP might cause weight loss through increased energy expenditure. Acute studies demonstrate that BUP or DA+NE reuptake inhibitors cause transient hypophagia and increased locomotion; though the effects on temperature are inconsistent. Because subchronic DA+NE reuptake inhibition does not affect appetite, there is clearly a difference between the acute and subchronic effects of DA+NE reuptake inhibitors; however the effects of chronic (or subchronic) BUP on energy balance have never been directly studied in an animal model. Therefore, the acute and subchronic effects of BUP or selective DA and NE reuptake inhibitors on food intake, body weight, locomotor activity, and interscapular temperature were determined in mice. Generally, selective inhibition of DA reuptake (by GBR12783) increased activity while selective inhibition of NE reuptake (by nisoxetine, NIS) decreased activity and temperature. BUP increased activity and temperature but subchronic BUP did not significantly reduce body weight due to a compensatory increase in food intake. Subchronic DA+NE reuptake inhibitor coadministration mimicked the effect of BUP on activity and temperature, but caused weight loss because daily food intake was not increased. The results of this study suggest that the mild weight loss effect of BUP in humans may be due to increased locomotion or heat production. More importantly, inhibition of DA+NE reuptake (with GBR+NIS) increased energy expenditure without a compensatory increase in food intake, supporting a role for novel combination catecholamine reuptake inhibitors in pharmacotherapy for obesity. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study assesses the impact of an eating disorders universal preventive program on a representative sample of Spanish adolescents in the area of Barcelona, Spain. 323 adolescent girls were assigned to three experimental conditions: complete intervention, partial intervention, and non-treatment. The program obtained a significant change in reducing the influences of the aesthetic body ideal and in improving the knowledge of nutrition. Nevertheless, attained post-treatment changes dissipate at the 6 month follow-up. In our opinion, the lack of lasting effects should be attributed to a series of considerations such as format, tests not validated for this age, or insufficient research.},

abstract={Anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are related disorders of unknown etiology that most commonly begin during adolescence in women. AN and BN have unique and puzzling symptoms, such as restricted eating or binge-purge behaviors, body image distortions, denial of emaciation, and resistance to treatment. These are often chronic and relapsing disorders, and AN has the highest death rate of any psychiatric disorder. The lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of this illness has hindered the development of effective interventions, particularly for AN. Individuals with AN and BN are consistently characterized by perfectionism, obsessive-compulsiveness, and dysphoric mood. Individuals with AN tend to have high constraint, constriction of affect and emotional expressiveness, ahendonia and asceticism, whereas individuals with BN tend to be more impulsive and sensation seeking. Such symptoms often begin in childhood, before the onset of an eating disorder, and persist after recovery, suggesting they are traits that create a vulnerability for developing an ED. There is growing acknowledgement that neurobiological vulnerabilities make a substantial contribution to the pathogenesis of AN and BN. Considerable evidence suggests that altered brain serotonin (5-HT) function contributes to dysregulation of appetite, mood, and impulse control in AN and BN. Brain imaging studies, using 5-HT specific ligands, show that disturbances of 5-HT function occur when people are ill, and persist after recovery from AN and BN. It is possible that a trait-related disturbance of 5-HT neuronal modulation predates the onset of AN and contributes to premorbid symptoms of anxiety, obsessionality, and inhibition. This dysphoric temperament may involve an inherent dysregulation of emotional and reward pathways which also mediate the hedonic aspects of feeding, thus making these individuals vulnerable to disturbed appetitive behaviors. Restricting food intake may become powerfully reinforcing because it provides a temporary respite from dysphoric mood. Several factors may act on these vulnerabilities to cause AN to start in adolescence. First, puberty-related female gonadal steroids or age-related changes may exacerbate 5-HT dysregulation. Second, stress and/or cultural and societal pressures may contribute by increasing anxious and obsessional temperament. Individuals with AN may discover that reduced dietary intake, by reducing plasma tryptophan availability, is a means by which they can modulate brain 5-HT functional activity and anxious mood. People with AN enter a vicious cycle which accounts for the chronicity of this disorder because caloric restriction results in a brief respite from dysphoric mood. However, malnutrition and weight loss, in turn, produce alterations in many neuropeptides and monoamine function, perhaps in the service of conserving energy, but which also exaggerates dysphoric mood. In summary, this article reviews findings in brain chemistry and neuroimaging that shed new light on understanding the psychopathology of these difficult and frustrating disorders. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

However, data showing a causal relationship between neurogenesis and spatial memory are controversial. Here, we developed an inducible transgenic strategy allowing specific ablation of adult-born hippocampal neurons. This resulted in an impairment of spatial relational memory, which supports a capacity for flexible, inferential memory expression. In contrast, less complex forms of spatial knowledge were unaltered.

abstract={Panic disorder (PD) is a disabling condition which appears in late adolescence or early adulthood and affects more frequently women than men. PD is frequently characterized by recurrences and sometimes by a chronic course and, therefore, most patients require long-term treatments to achieve remission, to prevent relapse and to reduce the risks associated with comorbidity. Pharmacotherapy is one of the most effective treatments of PD. In this paper, the pharmacological management of PD is reviewed. Many questions about this effective treatment need to be answered by the clinician and discussed with the patients to improve her/his collaboration to the treatment plan: which is the drug of choice; when does the drug become active; which is the effective dose; how to manage the side effects; how to manage nonresponse; and how long does the treatment last. Moreover, the clinical use of medication in women during pregnancy and breastfeeding or in children and adolescents was reviewed and its risk-benefit balance discussed. © 2008 Dove Medical Press Limited.

abstract={Background. Foraging in groups offers animals a number of advantages, such as increasing their likelihood of finding food or detecting and avoiding predators. In order for a group to remain together, there has to be some degree of coordination of behaviour and movement between its members (which may in some cases be initiated by a decision-making leader, and in other cases may emerge as an underlying property of the group). For example, behavioural synchronisation is a phenomenon where animals within a group initiate and then continue to conduct identical behaviours, and has been characterised for a wide range of species. We examine how a pair of animals should behave using a state-dependent approach, and ask what conditions are likely to lead to behavioural synchronisation occurring, and whether one of the individuals is more likely to act as a leader. Results. The model we describe considers how the energetic gain, metabolic requirements and predation risks faced by the individuals affect measures of their energetic state and behaviour (such as the degree of behavioural synchronisation seen within the pair, and the value to an individual of knowing the energetic state of its colleague). We explore how predictable changes in these measures are in response to changes in physiological requirements and predation risk. We also consider how these measures should change when the members of the pair are not identical in their metabolic requirements or their susceptibility to predation. We find that many of the changes seen in these measures are complex, especially when asymmetries exist between the members of the pair. Conclusion. Analyses are presented that demonstrate that, although these general patterns are robust, care needs to be taken when considering the effects of individual differences, as the relationship between individual differences and the resulting qualitative changes in behaviour may be complex. We discuss how these results are related to experimental observations, and how the model and its predictions could be extended. © 2008 Rands et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Risk effects arise when prey alter their behavior in response to predators, and these responses carry costs. Empirical studies have found that risk effects can be large. Nonetheless, studies of predation in vertebrate conservation and management usually consider only direct predation. Given the ubiquity and strength of behavioral responses to predators by vertebrate prey, it is not safe to assume that risk effects on dynamics can be ignored. Risk effects can be larger than direct effects. Risk effects can exist even when the direct rate of predation is zero. Risk effects and direct effects do not necessarily change in parallel. When risk effects reduce reproduction rather than survival, they are easily mistaken for limitation by food supply. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose: The purposes of this qualitative/descriptive study were to (a) explore experiences and decision-making behaviors associated with adoption of a sodium-restricted diet (SRD) among older women with hypertension or heart failure and (b) identify healthcare system and contextual factors that facilitate or impede adherence to SRD. Data sources: Participants were 33 single older women, aged 65-98 years, residing in three congregate living facilities in the high-risk "coronary valley" area of the United States. A semistructured interview format was employed with three focus groups. The audio-taped transcribed data were content analyzed for themes by the researchers with the assistance of ATLAS.Ti computer software. Conclusions: Predominant themes were lack of SRD education by healthcare providers, a desire for more information about sodium, including the use of alternative herbal seasonings, and large-print informational materials. Eating alone with no motivation to cook and share meals was a contextual barrier to healthy nutrition. Implications for practice: To prevent costly hospitalizations and rehospitalization from nonadherence to SRD, clinicians need to provide more structured SRD education supplemented with printed brochures. Exploring the client's nutritional social setting may improve SRD adherence. © 2008 American Academy of Nurse Practitioners.},

abstract={This paper examines the environmental and management factors affecting lamb survival on high-performing sheep farms in New Zealand. Improved lambing percentage is the biggest contributor to higher profits on New Zealand sheep farms. Many sheep breeders have selected and bred ewes for increased fecundity over the last 4 decades. The increased proportion of ewes having triplets is of concern to farmers and to industry because neonatal lamb mortality is highest in triplets. The majority of lamb deaths occur in the first 3 d after birth and range from 5 to 30% for individual sheep flocks. The ability of a lamb to survive to weaning is determined by genetics, behavior, physiology, and the environment, including on-farm management practices. We investigated the effects of dam body condition in pregnancy, weather during lambing, lamb birth weight, and maternal behavior on single, twin, and triplet lamb viability at birth, lamb death risks from dystocia, and starvation exposure and survival through to weaning for 20 industry flocks from 2003 to 2004 (15,821 lambs). Ewes with higher body condition scores in mid pregnancy had heavier lambs at birth (P < 0.01). Lambs weighing 5.5 to 6 kg at birth (P < 0.01) were more likely to be viable at birth and survive to weaning than heavier or lighter lambs. Weather conditions during late pregnancy (P < 0.05) proved more important than conditions during lambing (P < 0.05) in determining lamb viability and survival through to weaning. Older ewes and ewes with triplets require considerably more attention for farmers to realize their production potential. This information can help formulate appropriate management programs to improve lamb survival rates under easy care farming systems.},

abstract={In this study, we investigate association patterns of 249 bottlenose dolphin feeding groups off Sardinia Island (Italy) from January 2000-May 2007 and describe how their association behaviour is related to their response to food patches created by a marine fin fish farm. We also tested the hypothesis that dolphins have different social structures with different feeding activities: Associations should decrease during opportunistic feeding behaviours as it is easier to capture prey, and cooperation is not as necessary. Sixteen individually identified bottlenose dolphins were observed participating in both opportunistic and not opportunistic feeding activities, with a mean of 30±8 times and 9.6±1 times, respectively. Bottlenose dolphins show non-random social behaviour during feeding and this behaviour differs depending on their specific foraging activity. Dolphin associations during feeding can be divided into three categories: acquaintances, affiliates, and feeding associates. Association behaviour during fish farm feeding is consistent with our hypothesis that during opportunistic behaviours, benefits from cooperation decrease, as it is easier to capture prey. Group size homogeneity in both feeding activities demonstrates that the number of dolphins engaging in foraging is not necessarily related with cooperation levels. Moreover, an adult dolphin may prefer to associate with a specific individual, independent of the sex, who shares the same foraging priorities. This study is the first to show how aquaculture is not only directly affecting marine predators but could also indirectly affect their social structure and behaviour. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Resource selection plasticity and behavioral dominance may influence the ability of a species to respond to changes in resource availability, particularly if dominant species have highly specialized resource requirements. We examined the response of several dominant and subordinate cavity-nesting species to a reduction in the availability of an essential resource (nesting cavities) using the novel experimental approach of blocking the entrances to high-quality cavities. We monitored nest abundance on seven treatment and 13 control sites (aspen groves in a grassland matrix) in British Columbia, Canada, for two years pretreatment (2000-2001), two years during treatment (2002-2003), and two years posttreatment (cavities reopened; 2004-2005). At the community level, nest abundance declined by 50% on treatment sites following cavity blocking and returned to pretreatment levels following cavity reopening. Nest abundance of European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), a dominant secondary cavity-nester (SCN), declined by 89% and failed to recover posttreatment. Conversely, nest abundance of Mountain Bluebirds (Sialia currucoides; a subordinate SCN) increased following cavity blocking and remained high following reopening. Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) were unaffected by cavity blocking. We suggest that starlings, while being the dominant SCN, may be limited by availability of suitable nest sites, whereas bluebirds may be limited by starling abundance. We propose that plasticity in nest site preferences of subordinate cavity-nesters may enable them to contend with natural variation in availability of critical resources, such as nest cavities and food, in addition to coping with interspecific competition. This is the first community-level, multiyear study involving manipulation of nest site availability via experimental cavity blocking. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Neonatal lamb mortality represents both a welfare issue (due to the considerable suffering and distress) and an important production inefficiency. In lambs, approximately 80% of mortality can be attributed to the starvation-mismothering-exposure complex and occurs in the first 3 days after birth. It was the object of this review to determine the micronutrient(s) most likely to have a positive effect on neonatal lamb survival when included above the requirement for that micronutrient. Micronutrients discussed were Co, Cu, I, Fe, Mn, Se, Zn, vitamins A and E and n-3 fatty acids. For Co, Fe, Mn and Zn, there was no evidence of positive responses to supplementation. Cu and I had toxicity thresholds that were sufficiently close to requirement that supplementing above requirement presented a risk of inducing toxicity. In the case of vitamin A, while serum concentrations indicated that sub-optimal status did exist, long-term buffering from liver stores (from grazing) makes experimentation difficult and practical benefits to supplementation unlikely. Therefore, the most likely candidates for supplementation were Se, vitamin E and fatty acids. Fatty acid supplementation with fish oils or docosahexaenoic acid-containing algal biomass consistently improved lamb vigour but it is unlikely that supplementation will be economic. Positive responses to Se supplementation throughout gestation were recorded. However, in many studies the Se status of control ewes was marginal and there is a need for more studies where control ewes are clearly adequate in Se. Positive responses to vitamin E supplementation above requirement in the last-third of gestation were observed but the optimum dietary inclusion of vitamin E and period of feeding during pregnancy still require clarification. © 2008 The Animal Consortium.},

abstract={1. All other things equal, predator capture rates are expected to depend on encounter rate with prey, prey escape capability (including prey defences), and on predator agility. Ectotherm predators and their prey both respond to increasing temperature by increased activity, i.e. predators increase their search area and prey may enhance their escape capability. This means that, as temperature changes, the ability of a predator to catch prey will decrease, increase, or remain unchanged depending on the relative effect of temperature on predator and prey. Their responses may further be differentially moulded by light conditions depending on whether the predator is diurnally or nocturnally active. It was hypothesised that flying Diptera are vulnerable to carabid beetles only at low temperatures and over the full temperature range for spiders because carabids, in contrast to spiders, are not built to catch swiftly moving prey. 2. The first experiment examined the spontaneous locomotor activity of the predators and of fruit flies at different temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C) and light conditions (light, dark). A second experiment examined the effect of temperature and light on the predation rate of two carabid beetles (Pterostichus versicolor and Calathus fuscipes) and two spiders (Clubiona phragmitis and Pardosa prativaga) using fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) as prey. 3. All four predators and the fruit fly increased their locomotory activity at higher temperatures. Activity of the carabid beetles peaked at intermediate temperatures; spiders and fruit flies were most active at the highest temperatures. Predation rate of the spiders increased with temperature whereas the beetles caught flies only at low temperatures (5 and 10 °C). 4. Diurnal variation in temperature may bring different prey groups within the set of potential prey at different times of the day or at different seasons. The ability of many carabid beetles to forage at low temperatures may have nutritional benefits and increases the diversity of interactions in terrestrial food webs. © 2008 The Authors.},

Inadequate physical activity and poor dietary habits are two primary causes of obesity that have been noted in West Virginia adolescents. Few existing data describes the decisional balance in performing lifestyle behaviors, nor the perceptions of these youth regarding their beliefs about weight. The purpose of this study was to identify the perceptions of a healthy weight in rural Appalachian adolescents. METHODS: Ninth grade students were recruited from classroom presentations in four high schools throughout West Virginia. Interested parent-caregiver pairs returned forms to indicate interest in participation. Separate focus group interviews were conducted concurrently with adolescent and parents or caregivers to identify the cultural perceptions of a healthy weight. Questions were developed using grounded theory to explore how a healthy weight was defined, what factors dictate body weight, the perceived severity of the obesity issue, and the social or health ramifications of the condition. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed to identify dominant themes, and content analysis provided text segments to describe the themes. This article describes the data obtained from the adolescent focus groups. RESULTS: When asked what defined a healthy weight, the adolescents who participated in the focus groups placed great value on physical appearance and social acceptability. Students believed there was a particular number, either an absolute weight or body mass index value that determined a healthy weight. These numbers were usually conveyed by a physician; however, there was also a general acceptance of being 'thick' or a reliance on 'feeling healthy' as a determinant of maintaining a healthy weight. Despite these beliefs, many teens had unrealistic and unhealthy perceptions of weight. Female participants were more concerned with weight than males, some to the point of obsession. Both males and females expressed a social stigma associated with overweight. Issues of guilt and diminished self-esteem were prevalent. When asked about the extensiveness of the problem of childhood overweight, the students indicated that a degree of familiarity with being overweight has developed and 'you just get used to [seeing] it.' Because of the rising rates of chronic disease in this region, a fear was evident in these youth about the increased risk of developing these conditions in those who are overweight. Experiences with family members with diabetes and cardiovascular disease fueled these concerns, which instilled a fear of becoming overweight in many of the students. Many perceptions of healthy weight and appropriate body size were shaped by the media and entertainment industry. Additionally, some participants admitted to performing unsafe practices to reduce body mass, such as very low calorie diets or fasting. CONCLUSIONS: Youth in rural Appalachia present similar perceptions about weight as other children; however, differences in perceived healthy lifestyle habits and a general acceptance of a higher average body weight present additional challenges to addressing the increasing problem of child overweight. Despite the relative isolation of many of these communities, the media has a profound impact on weight valuation that has been intertwined with school-based health education and cultural values of health. These data will provide valuable information for the development of obesity prevention programs in rural Appalachia.},

abstract={Emotional eating has often been linked to overweight and/or obesity. Multiple group SEM analyses were conducted using cross-sectional data from 517 minority students in Los Angeles County. Results showed no differences in emotional eating between normal weight and overweight students. Perceived stress was indeed a significant correlate of emotional eating, independent of BMI status, as indicated by the lack of a modifying effect of BMI status. Findings highlight the fact that emotional eating is not an issue only for overweight and obese persons. This study shows that some children in this population at increased risk for obesity and related chronic disease have already incorporated emotional eating as a learned response to stress by the time that they enter adolescence. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Background: In school-based samples of children, the Children's Eating Attitudes Test (ChEAT) has a four-factor structure; however, previous studies have not examined its factor structure in samples restricted to overweight youth. Methods: The ChEAT was administered to 220 overweight (BMI ≥ 95th percentile) and 45 at-risk for overweight (BMI 85th-< 95th percentile) children and adolescents. Factors were identified by a principal component analysis with varimax rotation. ChEAT factor scores of children with BMI ≥ 85th percentile were contrasted with those of 152 non-overweight (BMI 5th to < 85th percentile) children and adolescents. Results: Factor analysis generated four subscales described as 'body/weight concern,' 'food preoccupation,' 'dieting,' and 'eating concern.' ChEAT total score, body/weight concern, and dieting subscale scores were positively related to BMI-Z and body fat mass (p's < .05). Compared to non-overweight children, overweight and at-risk for overweight children had higher ChEAT total (9.9 ± 7.4 vs. 6.6 ± 7.8, p < .001), body/weight concern (3.2 ± 3.1 vs. 1.3 ± 3.0, p < .001), and dieting (1.8 ± 2.2 vs. .8 ± 2.3, p < .001) subscale scores. Conclusions: The previously elucidated factor structure of the ChEAT was primarily supported in a sample of overweight children. The emergence of separate body/weight concern and dieting subscales may relate to these children's experiences with attempted weight reduction.},

abstract={Parenting, including nonresponsive feeding styles, has been related to under- or overweight among young children. The relationship between maternal mental health and feeding styles has not been examined. We hypothesized that mothers who report more symptoms of stress, depression, or anxiety report less responsive (e.g. more controlling, indulgent, and uninvolved) feeding styles than mothers who report fewer symptoms of stress, depression, or anxiety. Our analyses included 702 mother-infant pairs from a statewide sample of Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children mothers. We assessed maternal mental health and feeding styles by a telephone survey. After adjusting for potential confounding variables, maternal stress symptomatology was significantly associated with forceful (β = 0.03;95% CI = 0.02, 0.05) and uninvolved (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.1, 1.7) feeding style scores, maternal depression symptomatology was significantly associated with forceful (β = 0.03; 95% CI = 0.004, 0.05), indulgent (β = 0.03; 95% CI = 0.004, 0.06), and uninvolved (OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.001, 2.2) feeding styles scores, and maternal anxiety symptomatology was significantly related to restrictive (β = 0.11;95% CI = 0.01, 0.21), forceful (β = 0.04;95% CI = 0.02, 0.06), and uninvolved (OR = 1.4;95% CI = 1.01, 1.9) feeding style scores. Among mothers who perceived their infant as temperamentally fussy, there was a significant positive relationship between restrictive feeding styles scores and 3 indices of maternal mental health (stress, β = 0.18; 95% CI = 0.07, 0.28; depression, β = 0.21; 95% CI = 0.04, 0.38; and cumulative mental health symptomatology, β = 0.29; 95% CI = 0.10, 0.48). Mothers who report stress, depression, or anxiety symptoms are at risk for nonresponsive feeding styles. These findings provide support for broadening the focus of existing child nutrition programs to include strategies that recognize how issues of maternal mental health can affect feeding styles. © 2008 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Intra-individual variability (IIV) refers to relatively stable differences between individuals in the degree to which they show behavioral fluctuations over relatively short time periods. Using temperament as a conceptual framework the structure, stability, and biological roots of IIV were assessed over the first year of life. Biological roots were defined by maternal and infant nutrition. The sample was 249 Peruvian neonates, followed from the second trimester of pregnancy through the first 12 months of life. Maternal anthropometry, diet, iron status, and fetal growth were assessed prenatally. Neonatal anthropometry and iron status were assessed at birth. Degree of exclusive breastfeeding was assessed at 3 and 6 months, infant anthropometry was assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months, infant dietary intake was assessed at 6 and 12 months and infant iron status was tested at 12 months. Individual differences in IIV at 3, 6, and 12 months were derived from a residual standard deviation score based on infant behaviors measured using the Louisville Temperament Assessment Procedure. Principal components analysis indicated that individual differences in IIV were defined by two components at 3, 6, and 12 months. There was modest stability between IIV components assessed at 3 and 12 months. Reduced levels of IIV at 3 months were predicted by higher maternal weight and higher fetal weight gains in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. Higher levels of IIV at 3 months were predicted by higher levels of maternal hemoglobin during pregnancy and higher levels of neonatal ferritin. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Background. Foraging behaviour is an essential ecological process linking different trophic levels. A central assumption of foraging theory is that food selection maximises the fitness of the consumer. It remains unknown, however, whether animals use innate or learned behaviour to discriminate food rewards. While many studies demonstrated that previous experience is a strong determinant of complex food choices such as diet mixing, the response to simple nutritional stimuli, such as sugar concentrations, is often believed to be innate. Results. Here we show that previous experience determines the ability to track changes in sugar composition in same-aged individuals of a short-lived migratory songbird, the garden warbler (Sylvia borin). Although birds received identical foods for seven months prior to the experiment, wild-caught birds achieved higher sugar intake rates than hand-raised birds when confronted with alternative, differently coloured, novel food types. Hand-raised and wild birds did not differ in their initial colour selection or overall food intake, but wild birds were quicker to adjust food choice to varying sugar intake. Conclusion. Over a period of at least seven months, broader previous experience translates into a higher plasticity of food choice leading to higher nutrient intake. Our results thus highlight the need to address previous long-term experience in foraging experiments. Furthermore, they show that hand-raised animals are often poor surrogates for testing the foraging behaviour of wild animals.},

abstract={It has been proposed that one route of behavioral evolution involves novel regulation of conserved genes. Age-related division of labor in honey bee colonies, a highly derived behavioral system, involves the performance of different feeding-related tasks by different groups of individuals. Older bees acquire the colony's food by foraging for nectar and pollen, and the younger "nurse" bees feed larvae processed foods. The transition from hive work to foraging has been shown to be socially regulated and associated both with decreases in abdominal lipid stores and with increases in brain expression of genes implicated in feeding behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we show that division of labor is influenced by a canonical regulator of food intake and energy balance in solitary species, the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway. Foragers had higher levels of IIS gene expression in the brain and abdomen than did nurses, despite their low lipid stores. These differences are likely nutritionally mediated because manipulations that induced low lipid stores in young bees also up-regulated these genes. Changes in IIS also causally influenced the timing of behavioral maturation: inhibition of the insulin-related target of rapamycin pathway delayed the onset of foraging in a seasonally dependent manner. In addition, pathway analyses of microarray data revealed that nurses and foragers differ in brain energy metabolism gene expression, but the differences are opposite predictions based on their insulin-signaling status. These results suggest that changes in the regulation of the IIS pathway are associated with social behavior. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract={Flavor-flavor and flavor-nutrient associations can modify liking for a flavor CS, while flavor-flavor associations can also modify the sensory experience of the trained flavor. Less is known about how these associations modify behavioral responses to the trained CS. To test this, 60 participants classified as sweet likers were divided into five training conditions with a novel flavor CS. In the flavor-flavor only condition, participants consumed the target CS in a sweetened, low-energy form, with energy (maltodextrin) but no sweetness added in the flavor-nutrient only condition and both energy and sweetness (sucrose) in the combined flavor-flavor, flavor-nutrient condition. Comparison groups controlled for exposure to the CS, and repeat testing. Training was conducted in a hungry state on four non-consecutive days. To test for acquired changes in evaluation and intake, the flavor CS was processed into a low-energy sorbet, which was evaluated and consumed ad libitum on test days before and after training. Liking for the flavor CS increased only in the sucrose-sweetened condition, but intake increased significantly in both high-energy conditions. In contrast, rated sweetness of the sorbet increased in both sucrose-sweetened and aspartame-sweetened conditions. These findings suggest that liking changes were maximal when flavor-flavor and flavor-nutrient associations co-occurred, but that behavioral changes were specific to flavor-nutrient associations. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Purpose - The aim of this paper is to identify consumers' attitudes and behaviour towards organic products in Greece. Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on a non-probability quota sample of 660 respondents to explore the attitudes and behaviour of Greek consumers towards organic food products. Findings - Greek consumers seem to be informed about environmental and health issues. They seek information about the nutritional value of food and demand more products free from chemical residues. The results show that most consumers associate organic consumption mainly with fruit and vegetables. Although demographics seem to affect attitudes towards organics, their value in explaining actual behaviour is minimal. Research limitations/implications - It is recognized that the data gathered in this study focus on the metropolitan area of Thessaloniki, Greece. The specific area though, is considered to be representative of the total Greek population. The results confirm that health, concern for the environment, animal welfare and support of the local economy are drivers of organic consumption. However, there is an indication that the importance of motives and barriers may vary for different product categories and perhaps future research should focus on product segmentation. Practical implications - Although certain similarities in consumers' attitudes towards organic food products have been identified, this paper records the variation in behaviour towards organics among the various consumer groups examined in Greece, and highlights the gap between attitudes and actual behaviour. Given the complexity of consumer decision making, future research should explore the other value trade-offs that consumers make. Originality/value - This paper attempts to provide evidence on the relatively under researched area of organics attitudes and behaviour in Greece. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Background: Performance enhancement (PE) is a natural and essential ingredient of competitive sport. Except for nutritional supplement contamination, accidental use of doping is highly unlikely. It requires deliberation, planning and commitment; and is influenced by a host of protective and risk factors. Hypothesis: In the course of their career, athletes constantly set goals and make choices regarding the way these goals can be achieved. The cycle of choice - goal commitment - execution - feedback on goal attainment - goal evaluation/adjustment has numerous exit points, each providing an opportunity for behaviour change, which may or may not be related to the use of prohibited methods. The interplay between facilitating and inhibiting systemic and personality factors, constantly influenced by situational factors could result in an outcome vector of 'doping attitudes', which combines with subjective norms to influence intentions to choose prohibited PE methods. These influences also vary from one stage of athlete development to the next, making some athletes more vulnerable to engaging in doping practices than others, and more vulnerable at certain time periods - and not others. Testing the hypothesis: Model-testing requires a series of carefully planned and coordinated studies. Correlational studies can establish relationships where the directionality is not-known or not important. Experimental studies with the manipulation of doping expectancies and risk factors can be used to demonstrate causality and evaluate potential intervention strategies. The final model can be tested via a behavioural simulation, with outcomes compared to those expected from literature precedence or used as a simulated computer game for empirical data collection. Implications: A hypothesized life-cycle model of PE identifies vulnerability factors across the stages of athlete development with the view of informing the design of anti-doping assessment and intervention. The model suggests that, instead of focusing on the actual engagement in prohibited PE practices, deterrence strategies are likely to be more effective if they target the influencing factors at the appropriate stage and identify groups of athletes and their respective career stages, which pose particular risks of engagement in doping practices. This enables a more effective intervention approach by targeting specific risk factors and expectancies. © 2008 Petróczi and Aidman; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the leading genetic cause of obesity. After initial severe hypotonia, PWS children become hyperphagic and morbidly obese, if intake is not restricted. Short stature with abnormal growth hormone secretion, hypogonadism, cognitive impairment, anxiety and behavior problems are other features. PWS is caused by lack of expression of imprinted genes in a ∼4 mb region of chromosome band 15q11.2. Our previous translocation studies predicted a major role for the C/D box small nucleolar RNA cluster SNORD116 (PWCR1/HBII-85) in PWS. To test this hyoothesis, we created a ∼150 kb delection of the >40 copies of Snord116 (Pwcr1/MBII-85) in C57BL/6 mice. Snord116del mice with patemally derived deletion lack expression of this snoRNA. They have early-onset postnatal growth deficiency, but normal fertility and lifespan. While pituitary structure and somatotrophs are normal, liver lgf1 mRNA is decreased. In cognitive and behavior tests, Snord116del mice are deficient in motor learning and have increased anxiety. Around three months of age, they develop hyperphagia, but stay lean on regular and high-fat diet. On reduced caloric intake, Snord116del mice maintain their weight better than wild-type littermates, excluding increased energy requirement as a cause of hyperphagia. Normal compensatory feeding after fasting, and ability to maintain body temperature in the cold indicate normal energy homeostasis regulation. Metabolic chamber studies reveal that Snord116del mice maintain energy homeostasis by altered fuel usage. Prolonged mealtime and increased circulating ghrelin indicate a defect in meal termination michanism. Snord116del mice, the first snoRNA deletion animal model, reveal a novel role for a non-coding RNA in growth and feeding regulation. © 2008 Ding et al.},

abstract={Trading-off food and safety is considered a predominant component of foraging behavior. We examined whether predators' response to potential prey is state-dependent, and suggest that risk of injury while pursuing the prey affects the predators' foraging behavior in a similar manner as predation risk affects prey foraging behavior. We examined how the daring of steppe buzzards Buteo buteo vulpinus in pursuing their prey varied with body condition. We measured the time it took juvenile buzzards to attack a mouse placed in a Bal-Chatri cage trap and related it to their body condition. We found that buzzards in poorer body condition tended to hesitate less before pursuing their prey than did buzzards in better body condition. We suggest that behavioral decisions of buzzards are state-dependant and are influenced by the risk of injury involved in pursuing their prey. © Journal of Avian Biology.},

abstract={Sexual segregation in ungulates has important conservation and theoretical implications, but despite numerous studies, the impetus for this behavioral pattern remains a topic of debate. Sexual segregation hypotheses can be broadly grouped into social and ecological explanations, but only ecological explanations can adequately describe why sexes use different areas and habitats. The reproductive strategy hypothesis (RSH) and forage selection hypothesis (FSH) are leading ecological explanations, and although both have received support in the literature, neither the collective basis for that support nor overlap between these hypotheses has been adequately evaluated. This review analyzed seasonal sex comparisons of habitat forage quantity (n = 66), quality (n = 67), and diet (n = 63) from peer-reviewed studies of north temperate ruminants to test predictions of each hypothesis. Empirical data supported predictions of the RSH, but did not support two of three key predictions of the FSH. Males used habitats with greater forage quantity significantly more than females. But, contrary to predictions of the FSH, females did not use habitats with superior forage quality nor consume higher-quality diets more than males. Sexes typically used habitats and consumed diets of similar quality, and when differences were reported, males used higher-quality habitats significantly more than females. Results refute FSH arguments that differences in dietary requirements associated with sexual dimorphism are a universal explanation for sexual segregation in ungulates, but the physiological mechanism on which the FSH is predicated may explain why males consume poorer-quality diets when high-quality forage is scarce. The FSH, therefore, operates at a proximate level because it explains diet and habitat selection by males under certain environmental conditions, but multiple environmental factors may influence sexual segregation, and no single proximate explanation adequately describes this behavioral pattern. The RSH explains sexual segregation as the evolutionary response to differences in reproductive strategies: males choose habitats to maximize energy gains in preparation for rut, and females select habitats with combinations of resources that contribute to offspring survival. Consequently, the RSH provides an ultimate explanation that can be used to explain and interpret studies of sexual segregation in ungulates. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={The demographic responses of reef fish to their environment can be complex and in many cases, quite strong. Growth, mortality, longevity, and even reproductive effort have been demonstrated to vary for the same species of reef fish over scales of 100s to 1,000s of kilometers due to physiological and ecological interactions. Though few studies have explicitly documented it, this sort of habitat-mediated demography can also exist at very local scales. Here we present the results of a 2-year study of the bicolor damselfish, Stegastes partitus, in the Florida Keys, USA. We measured density and distribution, calculated key demographic rates (growth, survival, and fecundity), and characterized the environment (resident fish assemblage, substrate type and complexity, and food availability) of populations living in two adjacent but different habitats, the continuous fore reef and patchy back reef. Fish on the fore reef had an elevated growth rate and asymptotic size, increased mortality, and higher fecundity than fish on the back reef. We identified four potential causative mechanisms for these differences: food availability; competition; intraspecific density-dependent effects; and predation risk. Our data did not support an effect of either food availability or intraspecific density-dependence, but rather suggested that demographic responses are affected by both competition and predation risk. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

abstract={Global warming impels species to track their shifting habitats or adapt to new conditions. Both processes are critically influenced by individual dispersal. In many animals, dispersal behaviour is plastic, but how organisms with plastic dispersal respond to climate change is basically unknown. Here, we report the analysis of interannual dispersal change from 16 years of monitoring a wild population of the common lizard, and a 12-year manipulation of lizards' diet intended to disentangle the direct effect of temperature rise on dispersal from its effects on resource availability. We show that juvenile dispersal has declined dramatically over the last 16 years, paralleling the rise of spring temperatures during embryogenesis. A mesoscale model of metapopulation dynamics predicts that in general dispersal inhibition will elevate the extinction risk of metapopulations exposed to contrasting effects of climate warming. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={We investigated how Arctic charr young respond behaviourally to olfactory cues from skin-damaged conspecifics, charr-fed pikeperch, and the combination of food-deprived pikeperch and skin-damaged conspecific cues in a two-channel Y-maze fluviarium test arena. Significant antipredator responses were found to skin-damaged conspecifics in three behavioural traits, to charr-fed pikeperch in two traits and to the combination of pikeperch and skin-damaged conspecific cues in all six behaviours investigated. The combination of predator and conspecific cues significantly increased spatial avoidance and cautiousness to approach the source of scent compared with odours from charr-fed predators. The results suggest that damage-released alarm cues exist in charr, and they strengthen the antipredator responses in conspecifics. As the charr used different behaviours and levels of response in the presence of different cues, they seem to have sophisticated skills to distinguish between different odour combinations and be able to adjust their behaviour according to the current predation risk level. © 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard.},

abstract={The presence of the caregiver around feeding favors the development of a human-animal relationship. To understand the underlying mechanism, we tested various temporal associations between food distribution and human presence: from an early age, a person was repeatedly present for 2 min just before milk distribution ("Forward"), during milk distribution ("Simultaneous"), and 20 min afterwards ("Delayed"). The "Control" group received no human contacts. During the treatments, "Forward" and "Delayed" lambs had more physical contacts with the person than "Simultaneous" lambs. When tested in unfamiliar environments, they stood longer near the person than did "Control" or "Simultaneous" lambs, which did not differ. Only "Forward" and "Delayed" lambs bleated when separated from the person. Fasting before testing had no effect. "Forward" and "Delayed" seemed to produce the same human-animal relationship, showing that this did not rely only on a conditioning process associating the caregiver with food. The caregiver may acquire properties for social support through other mechanisms (attachment and/or postingestive effects). © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Choline availability in the maternal diet has a lasting effect on brain and behavior of the offspring. To further delineate the impact of early nutritional status, we examined effects of prenatal-choline supplementation on timing, emotion, and memory performance of adult male and female rats. Rats that were given sufficient choline (CON: 1.1 g/kg) or supplemental choline (SUP: 5.0 g/kg) during embryonic days (ED) 12-17 were trained with a differential reinforcement of low-rate (DRL) schedule that was gradually transitioned through 5-, 10-, 18-, 36-, and 72-sec criterion times. We observed that SUP-females emitted more reinforced responses than CON-females, which were more efficient than both groups of males. In addition, SUP-males and SUP-females exhibited a reduction in burst responding (response latencies <2 sec) compared with both groups of CON rats. Furthermore, despite a reduced level of burst responding, the SUP-males made more nonreinforced responses prior to the DRL criterion as a result of maintaining the previous DRL criterion following transition to a new criterion. In summary, long-lasting effects of prenatal-choline supplementation were exhibited by reduced frustrative DRL responding in conjunction with the persistence of temporal memory in SUP-males and enhanced temporal exploration and response efficiency in SUP-females. © 2008 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract={Caching behavior frequently occurs within a social context that may include heterospecific cache pilferers. All else equal, the value of cacheable food should decline as the probability of cache recovering declines. We manipulated gray squirrels' (Sciurus carolinensis) estimate of the probability of cache recovery using experimental playbacks of the vocalizations of a potential cache robber, the blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata). We used giving-up densities (GUDs) to quantify relative changes in squirrels' valuation of cacheable and noncacheable foods. We collected GUDs during playback experiments to test whether squirrels (1) eavesdrop on vocalizations to detect jay presence, (2) devalue cacheable food in the (perceived) presence of jays (i.e., perceive jays as cache pilferers), and (3) are sensitive to distant effects (i.e., lower devaluation of cacheable food at sites far from the perceived location of jays). Consistent with our predictions, squirrels decreased the value of cacheable hazelnuts by two nuts, on average, during jay playbacks, but only at foraging stations near the jay playback sites. We conclude that through eaves-dropping, squirrels assess site-specific risks of cache pilfering and alter their caching behavior to reduce the likelihood of pilferage.

abstract={Aim: Because individuals high on hostility may be at risk for alcohol abuse due to serotonergic dysfunction and greater reactivity to stress, we examined the effects of acute dietary tryptophan enhancement and stress on mood and craving for alcohol in low-hostile (LoH) and high-hostile (HiH) individuals. Methods: Thirty-four LoH and 33 HiH heavy social drinkers [selection based on the Hostility scale from the Buss and Perry Aggression Questionnaire (1992)] received either tryptophan-enriched or control diet and underwent a stress-induction procedure. Trait differences between the two hostile groups were explored using personality, anxiety, and depression questionnaires. Mood, craving for alcohol, and salivary cortisol levels (CORT) were measured before and after tryptophan and after stress-induction. Heart rate (HR) was measured during stress-induction. Results: HiHs compared to LoHs scored higher on the depression and anxiety trait scales as well in the character dimension Harm Avoidance and reported more of stress exposure over the past month. They also showed more negative mood and higher craving for alcohol. Diet alone did not produce any subjective or physiological effects. Stress increased CORT, HR, negative mood, and craving for alcohol. HiHs displayed higher CORT increase and lower cardiovascular reactivity in response to stress compared to LoHs. Opposite to the predictions, tryptophan enhancement selectively facilitated stress-induced increase in craving in the HiHs. Conclusion: Among heavy drinkers HiHs report higher craving for alcoholand show greater reactivity to stress as measured by CORT and negative mood. The effects of stress on craving in HiHs may be mediated by a serotonergic mechanism. © The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Medical Council on Alcohol.},

abstract={Spatial heterogeneity among microhabitat patches in aquatic ecosystems creates refuges (e.g., substrate interstices) that protect organisms against a variety of environmental constraints. Aquatic insects have evolved the ability to alter their life-history traits in response to environmental variability. Our objective was to determine whether differences in hydraulic and substrate conditions cause phenotypic plasticity in nymphs of the stonefly Nemoura cinerea Retzius. We experimentally manipulated near-bed current velocities (3 and 9 cm/s) and substrate types (medium sand and coarse gravel) in indoor artificial channels. Changes in the head capsule width, mesothoracic wing pad length, total body length, body mass, and behavior were studied over a 4-wk period. Morphometric and behavioral differences were primarily associated with the mechanism of refugium use (although confounded by substrate size), which reduced energy expenditure. Growth (body size and mass) was reduced in sand (absence of refugia) relative to growth in gravel, regardless of current velocity, and nymphs made almost no investment in body length (variation in allometry). The effect of current velocity on behavior was less marked in sand than in gravel because of a possible confounding effect of direct exposure of nymphs to flow on sand (i.e., no available refugia). In sand, individuals were located mainly on the food source (erect leaf discs) at current velocities of 3 cm/s, but feeding was depressed. Therefore, nymphal development was slow on sand. In gravel, nymphs followed different developmental trajectories depending on current velocity because hydraulic stress seemed to trigger accelerated development. Our study shows that physical factors associated with habitat structure can result in adaptive phenotypic plasticity among aquatic insect populations, and that a lack of shelter might have a strong impact on stonefly fitness. © 2008 by The North American Benthological Society.},

abstract={The functional role of GluR3 AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5- methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid) receptor subunits has remained elusive. In vitro studies of genetic knockout mice have not yielded significant alterations in synaptic communication. However, behavioural approaches utilizing knockout mice have shown that the subunit may be involved in exploration and motor coordination, suggesting that in vivo methodologies may be more forthcoming. We tested the hypothesis that GluR3 subunits are involved in the modulation of neural network activity. We used a freely behaving mouse model to examine the effect of GluR3-/- on field potential recordings of electroencephalogram, vital functions (i.e. breathing and heart rate) and muscle tone across natural sleep and wakefulness states. We found that GluR3 -/- mice virtually lack electroencephalographic signatures of NREM sleep (n = 9) as demonstrated by reduction in electroencephalogram power in the low-frequency bands (δ1, δ2 and θ). In addition, three of nine GluR3-/- mice expressed seizure activity during wakefulness and sleep, suggesting that deletion of the GluR3 gene may predispose to seizure. GluR3 gene knockout also produced state-dependent respiratory modulation, with a selective reduction in breathing rate during behavioural inactivity. These findings show that GluR3 subunits have diverse neurophysiological impact, modulating oscillatory networks for sleep, breathing and seizure generation. Finally, this is the first study to demonstrate the feasibility of direct diaphragm electromyogram recordings in freely behaving mice. © The Authors(2008).},

abstract={Rationale: Early environment can shape the development and function of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system and represents a possible risk factor for adult pathologies. One critical variable in the early environment is nutrition, and exposure to high fat (HF) in adulthood is known to change this DA system. Objectives: We tested whether perinatal HF intake in rats could have long-term effects on DA function and behavior in adult offspring. Materials and methods: Rat dams were fed either a control (5% fat, CD) or high fat (30% fat, HF) diet during the last week of gestation and lactation, and adult offspring were tested (PND 56-90) after weaning on CD. Locomotor responses to acute and repeated doses of d-amphetamine (AMP, 0.75 mg/kg bw) were determined as were indices of DA function in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Results: Adult HF offspring displayed increased tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the VTA and NAc and significant increases in DA and DOPAC content in the NAc, suggesting an elevated DA tone in this target field. In the NAc, there were no significant changes in D1, D2 receptors, or DA transporter (DAT) levels between diet groups. Perinatal HF feeding reduced AMP-induced locomotion and behavioral sensitization to AMP, suggesting that early diet might have caused long-lasting desensitization of postsynaptic receptor mechanisms in the NAc. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that both synthetic activity in VTA neurons and the responsiveness of accumbens DA neurons is altered by maternal nutrition. These effects subside long after termination of exposure to the HF diet. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Rates of pediatric obesity have increased dramatically over the past decade. This trend is especially alarming because obesity is associated with significant medical and psychosocial consequences. It may contribute to cardiovascular, metabolic, and hepatic complications, as well as to psychiatric difficulties. The development of obesity appears to be influenced by a complex array of genetic, metabolic, and neural frameworks, along with behavior, eating habits, and physical activity. Numerous parallels exist between obesity and addictive behaviors, including genetic predisposition, personality, environmental risk factors, and common neurobiological pathways in the brain. Typical treatments for pediatric obesity include behavioral interventions targeting diet or exercise. These treatments have yielded mixed results and typically have been examined in specialty clinic populations, limiting their generalizability. There are limited medication options for overweight children and adolescents, and no approved medical intervention in children younger than 16 years old. Bariatric surgery may be an option for some adolescents, but due to the risks of surgery, it is often seen as a last resort. The parallels between addiction and obesity aid in developing novel interventions for pediatric obesity. Motivational enhancement and cognitive-behavioral strategies used in addiction treatment may prove to be beneficial. © 2008 President and Fellows of Harvard College.},

abstract={The anatomic and physiological changes resulting from bariatric surgery can affect both nutrition and psychological attitudes. Modifications of the gastrointestinal tract lead to a diminished ability to absorb nutrients, electrolytes, and bile salts, as well as deficiencies in iron, calcium, and other vitamins and minerals. Dehydration, lactose intolerance, and protein calorie malnutrition are other common sequelae. Alterations in bone metabolism increase long-term risk for osteopenia and osteoporosis. Noncompliance with postsurgical nutritional regimens has been estimated to occur in from one third to almost two thirds of cases and can exacerbate these complications. Psychological issues are often present in patients with morbid obesity and can affect surgical outcomes. These issues include mood and personality disorders, destructive eating behaviors, and poor body image. Nearly one third of patients undergoing bariatric surgery also have a history of substance abuse disorder. The literature suggests that although the mental health of patients improves as a result of bariatric surgery, the benefits may be transient, and problems such as negative personality profiles, detrimental eating patterns, and negative body image persist to some extent. Identification of presurgical psychiatric problems can help identify those patients more likely to achieve lasting weight loss when surgery is combined with long-term follow-up to minimize medical and psychological complications. © 2008 American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, Inc.},

abstract={Two factors have been shown to contribute to rejection or acceptance of fruits and vegetables: food neophobia and 'picky/fussy' eating. Food neophobia is generally regarded as the reluctance to eat, or the avoidance of, new foods. In contrast, 'picky/fussy' eaters are usually defined as children who consume an inadequate variety of foods through rejection of a substantial amount of foods that are familiar (as well as unfamiliar) to them. Through understanding the variables which influence the development or expression of these factors (including age, personality, gender, social influences and willingness to try foods) we can further understand the similarities and differences between the two. Due to the inter-relationship between 'picky/fussy' eating and food neophobia, some factors, such as pressure to eat, personality factors, parental practices or feeding styles and social influences, will have similar effects on both magnitude and duration of expression of these behaviours. On the other hand, these constructs may be differentially affected by factors such as age, tactile defensiveness, environment and culture. The effects of these variables are discussed within this review. Behavioural interventions, focusing on early life exposure, could be developed to attenuate food neophobia and 'picky/fussy' eating in children, so promoting the ready acceptance and independent choice of fruits and vegetables. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Although a variety of risk factors for mobility limitation in older adults have been examined, a collective review of relevant literature has not been reported. The purposes of this review are to report the intrapersonal, interpersonal, environmental, and organizational risk factors related to mobility limitation using a social ecological perspective and to discuss the direction of future clinical practice consistent with current literature on mobility limitation of community-dwelling older adults. Intrapersonal risk factors related to mobility limitation include advanced age, female gender, low socioeconomic status, comorbidity, lack of motivation (i.e., dependent personality, decreased self-efficacy), lifestyle factors (i.e., sedentary lifestyle, smoking, obesity), and physiological factors (i.e., vitamin D deficiency, inflammation, poor nutritional status). Interpersonal risk factors related to mobility limitation include weak social networks and limited social activities. Geriatric clients may also experience a decline in mobility when they encounter environmental challenges such as an inconvenient home environment and lack of availability of services in their community, as well as lack of organizational resources stemming from social policy. Potential intervention strategies focused on modifiable risk factors may include lifestyle modifications, social networking programs, and enhancing awareness of environmental and organizational resources in the community for older adults at risk for mobility limitation. © 2008 Mosby, Inc.

abstract={The environmental stress theory (EST) suggests that stress-induced biochemical changes will make an organism more susceptible to predation relative to unstressed individuals. Bleaching represents a stress response in marine invertebrate host-zooxanthellae symbiont associations, including those species that rely on chemical defenses to reduce predation pressure. We examined the EST in the context of a natural soft coral bleaching event, and then by use of a 3 mo transplant/shading field experiment that also resulted in bleaching. Feeding experiments using an omnivorous pufferfish indicated that extracts of bleached soft corals were more palatable to predators than were those from unbleached individuals. Two biochemical constituents were significantly reduced in naturally- and experimentally-bleached soft corals: lipid and defensive metabolite (pukalide) concentration. While a sunscreen (palythine) was significantly lower immediately after a natural bleaching event, it recovered and even exceeded pre-bleached levels in experimentally-bleached soft corals. Feeding assays with pukalide and lipid at concentrations representative of unbleached and bleached soft corals indicate that pufferfish are not deterred by bleached levels of the defensive metabolite, but that pufferfish are less attracted to food with bleached levels of lipid. Nonetheless, field observations of up to 4 times higher predation on bleached soft corals suggest that defensive metabolite concentration may have a greater influence on predation than food quality. This study indicates that a stress response (bleaching) has an indirect effect on predator deterrence in the soft coral Sinularia maxima due to changes in biochemical constituents that affect food quality. © Inter-Research 2008.},

abstract={There have been many trials describing the effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on fecundity, neonatal development, and maternal behavior in humans, but few controlled studies in rodents. We examined the effects of a maternal diet high in omega 3 (N-3) or omega 6 (N-6) PUFA on NIH Swiss mice. Female mice were ad libitum fed one of three complete and balanced diets (N-3, enriched in menhaden oil; N-6, enriched in corn oil; C, control diet, Purina 5015) from age 4 wk until the end of the study. Mice were bred at ∼19 wk and 27 wk of age, providing a total of 838 pups from 129 litters in two experiments. After weaning their pups from parity 1, behavior of dams was assessed on elevated-plus and open-field mazes. Although the fraction of male pups from the N-3 and C groups was not different from 0.5, dams on the N-6 diet birthed more daughters than sons (213 vs. 133; P < 0.001). Although maternal stress has been reported to favor birth of daughters, the behavior of N-6 dams was not different from controls. By contrast, the N-3 dams displayed greater anxiety, spending less time in the open arms and more time in the closed arms of the elevated maze and traveling less distance and exhibiting less exploratory behavior in the open field (P < 0.05). N-3 dams tended to produce smaller litters than C dams, and N-3-suckled pups gained less weight (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the N-3 diet had negative effects on murine fecundity and maternal behavior, whereas the N-6 diet favored birth of daughters. © 2008 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.},

abstract={We propose a novel method to dissociate incentive motivation from memory and motor processes in instrumental performance. Components of a multiple fixed-ratio schedule of food reinforcement were adjusted to envelop the range of response requirements that maintained lever pressing by rats. We sought to manipulate motivation for food rewards with acute administrations of various doses (0-10 mg/kg) of fluoxetine, a 5-HT reuptake inhibitor that reduces food intake. A quantitative model of fixed-ratio performance derived from Killeen's (1994) Mathematical Principles of Reinforcement (MPR) provided an adequate account of data from individual rats. Decreases in response rate resulting from fluoxetine were reflected in changes in estimates of activation, indexed by MPR parameter a; estimates of working memory capacity and lever pressing duration were not systematically affected. These results support the use of MPR parameter a to index incentive motivation using multiple fixed-ratio schedules that are adjusted to individual performance. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.},

abstract={The ecological constraints model (ECM) was formulated to predict how different ecological factors affect cooperative-breeding vertebrates. Within these groups some individuals help raise nondescendent young because of constraints that limit their own reproduction (e.g. limited foods, reproductive opportunities and nesting sites). Despite similarities between cooperative-breeding vertebrates and facultatively social insects, few studies have explicitly and experimentally determined how the ECM applies to social insects. In this study, we examined the potential effects of predation, density and nest site limitation as well as differences in nest site quality on the alternative nesting tactics of the paper wasp Mischocyttarus mexicanus. Accurate field estimates of density were possible because multiple nests are initiated in isolated Sabal palmetto trees. Results from a 17-month census showed more solitary nesting when density was low and nest sites were plentiful. In addition, females appeared to prefer nests initiated on unoccupied east-facing fronds. We then examined the potential effect of density and nest site limitation in a field experiment by adding or removing fronds from S. palmetto and forcing all females to renest. The percentage of haplometrotic females decreased when fronds were removed (increased density treatment), increased when fronds were added (decreased density treatment), and showed a mixed response when frond number remained unchanged (control density treatment). Nest site limitation did not appear to affect renesting females: the percentage of available unoccupied fronds was not affected by treatment. Mischocyttarus mexicanus females responded primarily to their social environment within palm groves and to variation in nest site quality, instead of constraints that typically affect cooperative-breeding vertebrates. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Male copepods must swim to find females, but swimming increases the risk of meeting predators and is expensive in terms of energy expenditure. Here I address the trade-offs between gains and risks and the question of how much and how fast to swim using simple models that optimise the number of lifetime mate encounters. Radically different swimming strategies are predicted for different feeding behaviours, and these predictions are tested experimentally using representative species. In general, male swimming speeds and the difference in swimming speeds between the genders are predicted and observed to increase with increasing conflict between mate searching and feeding. It is high in ambush feeders, where searching (swimming) and feeding are mutually exclusive and low in species, where the matured males do not feed at all. Ambush feeding males alternate between stationary ambush feeding and rapid search swimming. Swimming speed and the fraction of time spent searching increase with food availability, as predicted. This response is different from the pattern in other feeding types. The swimming speeds of non-feeding males are predicted and observed to be independent of the magnitude of their energy storage and to scale with the square root of body length in contrast to the proportionality scaling in feeding copepods. Suspension feeding males may search and feed at the same time, but feeding is more efficient when hovering than when cruising. Therefore, females should mainly be hovering and males cruising, which is confirmed by observations. Differences in swimming behaviour between genders and feeding types imply different mortality rates and predict well the observed patterns in population sex ratios. Sex ratios may become so female-biased that male abundances limit population growth, demonstrating that behaviours that are optimal to the individual may be suboptimal to the population. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Genomic loci bearing stress-related phenotypes were dissected in recombinant congenic strains (RCS) of mice with C57BL/6J (B6) and A/J progenitors. Adult male mice from 14 A/J and 22 B6 background lines were evaluated for emotional reactivity in open-field (OF) and elevated plus-maze tests. Core temperature was monitored by radio telemetry during immobilization and on standard as well as salt-enriched diets. In addition, urinary electrolytes were measured. Genome-wide linkage analysis of the parameters revealed over 20 significant quantitative trait loci (QTL). The highest logarithm of odds (LOD) scores were within the previously-reported OF emotionality locus on Chr 1 (LOD = 4.6), in the dopa decarboxylase region on Chr 11 for the plus-maze (LOD = 4.7), and within a novel region of calmodulin 1 on Chr 12 for Ca++ excretion after a 24-h salt load (LOD = 4.6). RCS stress QTL overlapped with several candidate loci for cardiovascular (CV) disease. In silico evidence of functional polymorphisms by comparative sequence analysis of progenitor strains assisted to ascertain this convergence. The anxious BcA70 strain showed down regulation of Atp1a2 gene expression in the heart (P &lt; 0.001) and brain (P &lt; 0.05) compared with its parental B6 strain, compatible with the enhanced emotionality described in knock out animals for this gene, also involved in the salt-sensitive component of hypertension. Functional polymorphisms in regulatory elements of candidate genes of the CV/inflammatory/immune systems support the hypothesis of genetically-altered environmental susceptibility in CV disease development. © The Author 2007.

abstract={Anxious and depressed humans typically view circumstances more pessimistically than non-depressed individuals. Here, we explore the proposal that such cognitive biases also exist in non-human animals, and could be used as novel measures of animal welfare. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that wild-caught captive European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) are more optimistic in their interpretation of ambiguous stimuli when they are housed in cages designed to promote greater welfare compared with when they are housed in standard laboratory cages. Starlings were trained using a choice procedure to discriminate between two temporal stimuli (2 s versus 10 s duration light stimulus) associated with outcomes of a different value (instant or delayed food). Next, the birds' responses to ambiguous, unreinforced stimuli of intermediate duration ranging from 2 to 10 s were examined under two housing regimes designed to manipulate the birds' welfare: big enriched cages versus standard cages (smaller and unenriched). The birds' probability of classifying an intermediate stimulus as that associated with the instant food outcome was significantly higher in the enriched cage compared with the standard cage. Thus, the birds displayed greater optimism in the face of uncertainty under housing conditions in which other measures indicate better welfare. These findings support the use of cognitive bias-based tasks as a novel, non-invasive technique for assessing affective state in non-human animals. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Exploration is one of the basic behavioural responses giving animals the capacity to solve many needs during the continuous interaction with its environments. It represents the opportunity where animals can learn and benefit from the acquired knowledge, and using it in the demanding environment where they live. Many of these complex behavioural functions have been interpreted in terms of motivating behaviour. It has traditionally been accepted that "motivated" behaviour corresponds to a well known relationship between a primary stimulus and the corresponding behavioural response in animals. Thus, in response to hunger, comes feeding-motivated behaviour; in response to thirst, comes drinking-motivated behaviour, and so on. Several terms such as reinforcement, instrumental behaviour and homeostatic equilibrium, have often been employed to define such type of motivated behaviour. Despite increasing evidence in its favour, very little attention has been given to interpret exploration as another motivated behaviour. It is discussed that motivated exploration can responds to "incentive stimuli", input of complex information to the brain, analysis in determined brain structures, and appropriate effector responses to execute approaching behavioural responses. In this review, exploratory mechanisms are considered under the context of a single, basic function of a specialised neuronal circuit responding to the "incentive" proprieties of an environmental stimulus. Present evidence suggests that the "neural analysing" unit in the brain involves at least the prefrontal cortex, the nucleus accumbens, the hippocampus, and the amygdaloid complex. Histamine and glutamic acid are some of the neurotransmitters for which the evidence implies a role in exploratory motivation processes. The present review discusses the main brain structures and their putative roles on exploratory motivation, and the neurochemistry of some of the neurotransmitters with special emphasis on histaminergic and glutamatergic neuronal systems. © GCNN Limited.

abstract={In this minireview we focus on how males may exploit female's sensitivity to predation risk in the context of mating. It has been shown in studies on guppies and jumping spiders that in response to altered female behaviors, which are adaptations to the unfavorable environment and a consequence of females' higher sensitivity to predator's presence as well as females' higher predation risk, males can adopt condition-dependent mating tactics. It appears that in such cases males do not modify their reproductive behavior directly in response to their own perception of predation risk, but indirectly in response to changes in female behavior induced by predator presence. It has also been recently shown in crabs that males can exploit female behavior by creating safer habitat spots, which increases the male mating success. Hence all the evidence suggests that males not only respond to female sensitivity to the natural variation in predation risk, but that males can also exploit female behavior by altering the environment. As a logical extension of these findings, we present a hypothesis that in certain conditions males can manipulate the environment in order to increase the predation risk and to induce female behaviors that enhance the male's mating success with the increased predation risk. We propose that such a manipulation to increase predation risk is expected to evolve in males of species with a strong sexual conflict and female-biased predation risk. Although empirical evidence has not been yet shown, initial observations in a water strider species in Korea, Gerris gracilicornis, seem to support this hypothesis.},

abstract={The effect of group size and the number of helpers on reproductive success is crucial to understand the evolution and maintenance of cooperative breeding. In northern Spain, carrion crows form kin-groups (three to nine individuals) where up to five individuals contribute to rearing the young. Using data from 99 different territories, followed over 10 years, we showed that group size was positively correlated with the annual number of fledglings produced, after controlling for the potential confounding effect of territory quality. This occurred through: (1) an increased probability for larger groups of renesting after early nest failure; (2) a higher probability of nest success; and (3) a higher number of fledglings produced in successful attempts. Video-recorded observations at the nests showed that chicks received more food in larger groups during the first 10 days of life, when the risk of starvation is highest, suggesting a role of allofeeding by additional carers in augmenting the reproductive success of a group. In crows, indirect and direct benefits through increased production of young are therefore available to nonbreeding group members. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={This experiment was designed to test the effect of polymorphism in the cholesterol 7-α hydroxylase (CYP7) gene locus and dietary cholesterol (C) on cerebrum C in neonatal pigs fed sow's milk formulas. Thirty-six pigs (18 male and 18 female) genetically selected for high (HG) or low (LG) plasma total C were weaned at 24-36 h after birth and assigned in a 2x2x2 factorial arrangement of treatments with 2 diets (0 or 0.5% C), 2 sexes, and 2 genotypes (HG and LG). Individually housed pigs consumed diets ad libitum for 42 d. Open-field behavior was tested at wk 2 and 4. All pigs were killed at 42 d of age, the cerebrum was weighed, and C content and concentration measured. All data were analyzed by general linear model ANOVA. Cerebrum weight was greater in HG than LG pigs (P<0.03) but was not affected by diet or sex. Pigs fed C tended to have a higher cerebrum C concentration than those deprived (P = 0.12). At 2 wk, LG pigs explored a novel open-field environment less often (P < 0.001) than did HG pigs. At 4 wk, some LG pigs explored the open field but fewer (P < 0.001) vs. HG pigs retreated back to the safe area. There were no genotype x diet, genotype x sex, or diet x sex interactions affecting cerebrum weight, or C content or concentration. Polymorphism in the CYP7 gene locus affected cerebrum weight and behavior and dietary C tended to increase cerebrum C concentration in neonatal pigs. These findings in neonatal pigs have considerable potential importance in human infant nutrition and behavioral development. © 2008 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={A central question in behavioral ecology has been why animals live in groups. Previous theories about the evolution of sociality focused on the potential benefits of decreased risk of predation, increased foraging or feeding efficiency, and mutual aid in defending resources and/or rearing offspring. This paper argues that access to mutualistic endosymbiotic microbes is an underappreciated benefit of group living and sets out to reinvigorate Troyer's hypothesis that the need to obtain cellulolytic microbes from conspecifics influenced the evolution of social behavior in herbivores and to extend it to nonherbivores. This extension is necessary because the benefits of endosymbionts are not limited to nutrition; endosymbionts also help protect their hosts from pathogens. When hosts must obtain endosymbionts from conspecifics, they are forced to interact. Thus, complex forms of sociality may be more likely to evolve when hosts must repeatedly obtain endosymbionts from conspecifics than when endosymbionts can be obtained either directly from the environment, are vertically transmitted, or when repeated inoculations are not necessary. Observations from a variety of taxa are consistent with the ideas that individuals benefit from group living by gaining access to endosymbionts and the complexity of social behavior is associated with the mode of acquisition of endosymbionts. Ways to test this theory include (a) experiments designed to examine the effects of endosymbionts on host fitness and how endosymbionts are obtained and (b) using phylogenetic analyses to examine endosymbiont-host coevolution with the goal of determining the relationship between the mode of endosymbiont acquisition and host sociality. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Fetal programming encompasses the role of developmental plasticity in response to environmental and nutritional signals during early life and its potential adverse consequences (risk of cardiovascular, metabolic and behavioural diseases) in later life. The first studies in this field highlighted an association between poor fetal growth and chronic adult diseases. However, environmental signals during early life may lead to adverse long-term effects independently of obvious effects on fetal growth. Adverse long-term effects reflect a mismatch between early (fetal and neonatal) environmental conditions and the conditions that the individual will confront later in life. The mechanisms underlying this risk remain unclear. However, experimental data in rodents and recent observations in humans suggest that epigenetic changes in regulatory genes and growth-related genes play a significant role in fetal programming. Improvements in our understanding of the biochemical and molecular mechanisms at play in fetal programming would make it possible to identify biomarkers for detecting infants at high risk of adult-onset diseases. Such improvements should also lead to the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Objectives: To investigate the previous dieting experiences and expectations of individuals enrolled in a randomized trial of four commercial weight loss programmes and post-intervention to compare experiences across the diet groups. Aim: The purpose of this study was to enhance the understanding of why subjects volunteered to take part in a weight loss trial and also to ascertain their views on each of the diets tested. Methods: Focus groups containing both men and women were undertaken at baseline prior to randomization, and diet specific focus groups were held post-intervention. All group discussions were recorded and transcribed verbatim and analysed for emerging themes using the long-table approach. Results: The main intrinsic motivators to enroling in the study were a current lack of self-esteem and confidence. The opportunity to take part in an academic study was also a motivator. Motivation and increasing efficacy were cited commonly among those who had successfully lost (or at least not gained) weight. The 'pros' identified for each of the commercial diets tested in the trial were in line with each of the diet's promotional materials; the 'cons' varied between groups. Conclusion: In this study, reducing health risks was not the main motivator for people deciding to lose weight. Increasing intrinsic sense of worth gained by losing weight and continued motivation appear to be related to success. The differing experiences of people undertaking each of the four diets suggest that matching diet regimen to individual is important. © 2007 The British Dietetic Association Ltd.},

abstract={Developmental exposure to the organophosphorus pesticides chlorpyrifos and diazinon (DZN) alters serotonergic synaptic function at doses below the threshold for cholinesterase inhibition, however there are some indications that the two agents may differ in several important attributes. Previously, we found that low-dose chlorpyrifos exposure in neonatal rats causes lasting changes in emotional response and in the current study we did a comparable evaluation for DZN. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rat pups (N = 10-12 of each sex per treatment group) were given 0, 0.5 or 2 mg/(kg day) of DZN s.c. daily on postnatal days (PND) 1-4. These doses bracket the threshold for barely-detectable cholinesterase inhibition. Starting on PND 52, these rats began a battery of tests to assess emotional reactivity. In the elevated plus maze, there was a slight decrease in the time spent in the open arms for DZN-exposed males, while DZN-exposed females were not different from control females. In the novelty-suppressed feeding test, DZN-exposed males had significantly shorter latencies to begin eating than did control males, reducing the values to those normally seen in females. DZN-exposed rats of either sex showed reduced preference for chocolate milk in the anhedonia test that compared the consumption of chocolate milk to water. These findings show that neonatal exposures to DZN at a dose range below the threshold for cholinesterase inhibition nevertheless evokes specific, later alterations in emotional behaviors, particularly in males. The effects show not only some similarities to those of chlorpyrifos but also some differences, in keeping with neurochemical findings comparing the two agents. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Background. Economists believe that barter is the ultimate cause of social wealth - and even much of our human culture - yet little is known about the evolution and development of such behavior. It is useful to examine tho circumstances under which other species will or will not barter to more fully understand the phenomenon, Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are an interesting test case as they are an intelligent species, closely related to humans, and known to participate in reciprocal interactions and token economies with humans, yet they have not spontaneously developed costly barter. Methology/Principle Findings. Although Chimpanzees do engage in noncostly barter, in which otherwise value-less tokens are exchanged for food, this lack of risk is not typical of human barter. Thus, we systematically examined barter in chimpanzees to ascertain under what circumstances chimpanzees will engage in costly barter of commodities, that is, trading food items for other food items with a human experimenter. We found that chimpanzees do barter, relinquishing lower value items to obtain higher value items (and not the reverse), However, they do not trade in all beneficial situations, maintaining possession of less preferred items when the relative qains they stand to make are small. Conclusions/Significance. Two potential explanations for this puzzling behavior are that chimpanzees lack ownership norms, and thus have limited opportunity to benefit from the gains of trade, and that chimpanzees' risk of defection is sufficiently high that large gains must be imminent to justify the risk. Understanding the conditions that support barter in chimpanzees may increase understanding of situations in which humans, too, do not maximize their gains. © 2008 Brosnan et al.},

abstract={We compared symptom patterns, severity of illness, and comorbidity in individuals with eating disorders with and without impulse control disorders (ICD), and documented the temporal pattern of illness onset. Lifetime ICD were present in 16.6% of 709 women with a history of eating disorders. The most common syndromes were compulsive buying disorder and kleptomania. ICD occurred more in individuals with binge eating subtypes, and were associated with significantly greater use of laxatives, diuretics, appetite suppressants and fasting, and with greater body image disturbance, higher harm avoidance, neuroticism, cognitive impulsivity, and lower self-directedness. In addition, individuals with ICD were more likely to have obsessive-compulsive disorder, any anxiety disorder, specific phobia, depression, cluster B personality disorder, avoidant personality disorder, and to use psychoactive substances. Among those with ICD, 62% reported the ICD predated the eating disorder and 45% reported the onset of both disorders within the same 3-year window. The presence of a lifetime ICD appears to be limited to eating disorders marked by binge eating and to be associated with worse eating-related psychopathology, more pathological personality traits, and more frequent comorbid Axis I and II conditions. Untreated ICD may complicate recovery from eating disorders. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Objectives: This study investigated whether anxiety characteristics independently predicted the onset of myocardial infarction (MI) over an average of 12.4 years and whether this relationship was independent of other psychologic variables and risk factors. Background: Although several psychosocial factors have been associated with risk for MI, anxiety has not been examined extensively. Earlier studies also rarely addressed whether the association between a psychologic variable and MI was specific and independent of other psychosocial correlates. Methods: Participants were 735 older men (mean age 60 years) without a history of coronary disease or diabetes at baseline from the Normative Aging Study. Anxiety characteristics were assessed with 4 scales (psychasthenia, social introversion, phobia, and manifest anxiety) and an overall anxiety factor derived from these scales. Results: Anxiety characteristics independently and prospectively predicted MI incidence after controlling for age, education, marital status, fasting glucose, body mass index, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure in proportional hazards models. The adjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval [CI]) of MI associated with each standard deviation increase in anxiety variable was 1.37 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.68) for psychasthenia, 1.31 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.63) for social introversion, 1.36 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.68) for phobia, 1.42 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.76) for manifest anxiety, and 1.43 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.75) for overall anxiety. These relationships remained significant after further adjusting for health behaviors (drinking, smoking, and caloric intake), medications for hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes during follow-up and additional psychologic variables (depression, type A behavior, hostility, anger, and negative emotion). Conclusions: Anxiety-prone dispositions appear to be a robust and independent risk factor of MI among older men. © 2008 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

The B-deficient diet decreased body weight and food intake but increased water ingestion.

However, vitamin-B-deficient mice were not impaired on sensorimotor coordination and spatial learning tests, swimming to a visible platform even faster than either control group.

abstract={Concentrations of organochlorine contaminants (OCs) and associations between OCs and fitness components were examined in great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus) in three colonies along the coast of northern Norway. In one of the colonies, data were collected in two subsequent seasons. Concentrations of four OCs (HCB, oxychlordane, DDE and PCB) were measured in blood (n = 260) and fitness components (reproductive variables and adult return rate between breeding seasons) were recorded. In the first year, in two of the colonies, body condition and reproductive performance among the gulls were poor compared to the third colony, suggesting spatial variation in environmental conditions, especially food availability. However, in the third colony, body condition and reproductive performance were even better in the second season; i.e. environmental conditions varied temporally. OC residues were higher in the colonies where environmental conditions were poor, but much of this variation was explained by differences in body condition among colonies. Moreover, concurrent with improved body condition from one season to the next, the concentrations of OCs were halved. In the two colonies where environmental conditions were poor, female OC residues were negatively related to egg-laying date, egg size and nesting success, and in the colony where the concentrations of OC were highest, gulls with elevated DDE residues had low probability of returning between breeding seasons. In comparison, in the colony where environmental conditions were better in the first year, other types of adverse relationships between OCs and fitness components were found; i.e. chicks from females with high OC concentrations were in poor condition at hatching, suggesting maternal transfer of OCs to the eggs, and males with high OC residues had poor nesting success and chick survival, suggesting OC-mediated behavioural changes. With improved environmental conditions and lower OC concentrations in the second season, no significant adverse relationships between OCs and fitness components were found. This study thus suggests that there are complex interrelationships between both concentrations and ecological effects of OCs, and the environment, indicating that effects of OCs in nature may only be assessed after considering environmental variation. © 2007.},

abstract={Aging and age-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are usually accompanied by oxidative stress as one of the main mechanisms contributing to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Aging canines develop cognitive dysfunction and neuropathology similar to those seen in humans, and the use of antioxidants results in reductions in oxidative damage and in improvement in cognitive function in this canine model of human aging. In the present study, the effect of a long-term treatment with an antioxidant-fortified diet and a program of behavioral enrichment on oxidative damage was studied in aged canines. To identify the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these treatment effects, the parietal cortex from 23 beagle dogs (8.1-12.4 years) were treated for 2.8 years in one of four treatment groups: i.e., control food-control behavioral enrichment (CC); control food-behavioral enrichment (CE); antioxidant food-control behavioral enrichment (CA); enriched environment-antioxidant-fortified food (EA). We analyzed the levels of the oxidative stress biomarkers, i.e., protein carbonyls, 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), and the lipid peroxidation product, 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), and observed a decrease in their levels on all treatments when compared to control, with the most significant effects found in the combined treatment, EA. Since EA treatment was most effective, we also carried out a comparative proteomics study to identify specific brain proteins that were differentially expressed and used a parallel redox proteomics approach to identify specific brain proteins that were less oxidized following EA. The specific protein carbonyl levels of glutamate dehydrogenase [NAD (P)], glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), α-enolase, neurofilament triplet L protein, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and fascin actin bundling protein were significantly reduced in brain of EA-treated dogs compared to control. We also observed significant increases in expression of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase C, creatine kinase, glutamate dehydrogenase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The increased expression of these proteins and in particular Cu/Zn SOD correlated with improved cognitive function. In addition, there was a significant increase in the enzymatic activities of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and total superoxide dismutase (SOD), and significant increase in the protein levels of heme oxygenase (HO-1) in EA treated dogs compared to control. These findings suggest that the combined treatment reduces the levels of oxidative damage and improves the antioxidant reserve systems in the aging canine brain, and may contribute to improvements in learning and memory. These observations provide insights into a possible neurobiological mechanism underlying the effects of the combined treatment. These results support the combination treatments as a possible therapeutic approach that could be translated to the aging human population who are at risk for age-related neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Bacteria have evolved multiple mechanisms for the efficient evolution and spread of antimicrobial resistance. Modern food production facilitates the emergence and spread of resistance through the intensive use of antimicrobial agents and international trade of both animals and food products. The main route of transmission between food animals and humans is via food products, although other modes of transmission, such as direct contact and through the environment, also occur. Resistance can spread as resistant pathogens or via transferable genes in different commensal bacteria, making quantification of the transmission difficult. The exposure of humans to antimicrobial resistance from food animals can be controlled by either limiting the selective pressure from antimicrobial usage or by limiting the spread of the bacteria/genes. A number of control options are reviewed, including drug licensing, removing financial incentives, banning or restricting the use of certain drugs, altering prescribers behavior, improving animal health, improving hygiene and implementing microbial criteria for certain types of resistant pathogens for use in the control of trade of both food animals and food. © 2008 Expert Reviews Ltd.},

abstract={INTRODUCTION: Discourses around men's health refer to greater risk-taking behaviour, the social construct of masculinity and differences between men's and women's rates of death and disease. These ways of describing 'men's health' may be inadequate, but many men, particularly rural men, experience health disadvantage. Objective: To determine the reported eating, drinking and exercise behaviours of rural men and relationships between reported behaviours and attitudes to health and body image, age and occupation. METHOD: A written postal survey was used to collect demographic data, eating behaviours using the Food Habit Score, alcohol use, physical activity behaviours using an adaptation of the Pilot Study of the Fitness of Australians and attitudes to health and body image. Subjects and Setting: The survey was sent to 2000 randomly selected men in two New South Wales Riverina federal electorates in June 2004, with 529 returns (27% response). Main outcome measures: Food Habit Scores; regularity of physical activity; frequency and amount of alcohol use; degree of agreement with statements about attitudes to health and body image. Statistical analyses: Descriptive statistics using frequencies and cross tabulations were performed with further univariate analyses conducted at a level of significance of 5%. RESULTS: Approximately one-third of the men achieved a poor Food Habit Score (< or =10 out of 20). Age was not significantly associated with diet quality, but those in higher skilled occupations had a better diet, compared with those in less skilled occupations (p<0.01). Eighty-seven percent of the respondents drank alcohol and of those, almost half consumed only one or two alcoholic drinks at each session. Nearly a quarter of the men reported that they had more than four drinks on each drinking occasion. Almost half the men did no 'vigorous' exercise, but 42% did heavy labouring/gardening at least three times a week. The men with poor dietary habits were more likely to agree with less desirable attitudes to health, such as needing a health scare before changing lifestyle behaviours (p<0.001). The low response rate (27%) limits the ability to generalise these results to the whole male population in the Farrer and Riverina federal electorates. CONCLUSION: This study describes the eating and physical activity behaviours of a sample of rural men and highlights the attitudes that are associated with poor lifestyle behaviours among this hard to reach group. Implications: Health promotion programs targeting men, especially rural men, should address existing attitudes to health which may impact on lifestyle behaviours.},

abstract={The evolution of the chemical senses has resulted in a sensory apparatus for high taste and smell acuity in mammals and birds to ensure self-nourishment. Such peripheral chemosensory systems function as a code to unfold the nutritional value of feedstuffs. Food ingestion simultaneously evokes odor, taste and thermo-mechanical (somatosensing) sensations. Olfaction represents the capacity to identify feed volatiles that are predominantly derived from essential nutrients in plants. Comparative biology of olfaction shows that primates and chickens have a smaller olfactory epithelium and fewer olfactory receptor (OR) genes than non-primate mammals studied to date including farm and companion animals, such as the pig, the cow, the dog, the cat and the horse. A significant proportion of the total OR genes in mammals and birds have lost their functionality (pseudogenes) in a process that seems to reflect a decrease in the animal's reliance on the sense of smell, particularly in humans and cows. The taste system allows animals to recognize a diverse repertoire of nutrient (sugars, amino acids, salts, acids and fats) or toxic related chemical entities that provide valuable information about the quality of food. Taste senses non-volatile molecules in the oral cavity through taste receptors (TR). The TR are expressed in the sensory cells forming the taste buds of the tongue's papillae. Taste cells are linked to a network of solitary chemosensory cells diffused through many non-taste tissues involved in metabolic homeostasis. The number of functional taste receptor genes (TASR) in humans is equivalent to that in other mammals and superior to that in chickens. The TASR family 1 (TAS1R coding for umami and sweet TR) is conserved, in number and type, across the species evaluated, with the exception of the sweet receptor in chicken and feline species. The TASR family 2 (TAS2R coding for bitter TR) shows a strong adaptive capacity to dietary sources and digestive physiology across vertebrates. Pseudogenization (loss of gene functionality) in the TAS2R family seems to be a frequent strategy. The implications of oronasal nutrient sensing related to comparative animal feeding strategies and behaviors such as neophobia, feed refusal and hedonic preferences are discussed. Feed palatability and appetence might be one of the main driving forces in short-term feed consumption. Finally, practical applications relevant to animal production are outlined.},

abstract={We used novel techniques for assessing resource value to investigate what additions to a barren cage female laboratory rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus, value. We tested motivation to reach two resources that are potentially practical enrichments: a platform (providing a partly enclosed space and a raised area) and limited social contact with another rabbit through wire mesh and compared these to food and an empty space. To reach these resources, rabbits had to pay entry costs (pushing through weighted doors) which increased every 2 days. With rising costs, rabbits generally rescheduled their behaviour, often reducing visit number and increasing visit length. Measures from economics and behavioural ecology ranked the relative importance of resources similarly (food ≥ social contact ≥ platform > empty cage). 'Travel cost consumer surplus' (the area under a demand curve of price versus number of visits) ranked food and social contact similarly, but higher than the platform; 'aggregate consumer surplus' (the area under a plot of weight against the number of rabbits paying each price level for the resource) placed food higher than both social contact and the platform; 'reservation price' (maximum weight pushed) did not discriminate between the three resources; and 'expenditure rate' (weight × visits/days) again ranked food and social contact similarly, but higher than the platform. Overall, rabbits' motivation for access to limited social contact thus came close to that for food, suggesting that they value this highly. Rabbits were almost as strongly motivated to be near a platform, but rarely used it, suggesting it might serve a 'bolt hole' function. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={A variety of refugia were offered to different instars of brown recluse spiders, Loxosceles reclusa Gertsch and Mulaik, and a South American recluse spider, L. laeta (Nicolet), to determine whether they preferred certain types of refugia spaces. Variables included (1) crevice widths ranging from 3.2 to 21 mm, (2) horizontal and vertical orientations, and (3) new refugia or refugia that had silk deposited by a previous conspecific resident. An additional 30-d assay with similar-sized refugia studied each species' propensity for site fidelity or movement among refugia. L. reclusa preferred crevice widths ≥9 mm with no correlation of body size to crevice width, whereas L. laeta preferred crevice sizes ≥6.4 mm with a marginally significant correlation between crevice width and body size. Both species preferred (1) vertical instead of horizontal-oriented refugia and (2) refugia with conspecific silk compared with previously uninhabited refugia. There was no significant difference between the species in their propensity to move among refugia in the 30-d trial; however, both species had individuals that were always found in the same refugium for the entire assay and individuals changing refugia every 2-3 d. The propensity to switch refugia was not affected by the degree of starvation for the period tested as was initially hypothesized. The possible implications of this research toward developing novel control measures for Loxosceles spiders are discussed. © 2008 Entomological Society of America.},

abstract={To elucidate the potential for colony growth and the dispersal of aphids in relation to the ant attendance, the mobility, tolerance of starvation, colony growth, and dispersal were examined in the ant-tended Aphis craccivora Koch and the non-ant-tended Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris under the absence of predators and ants. The increase of the dispersal rate with density was more conspicuous in Ac. pisum than Ap. craccivora. The success rate of dispersal was higher in Ac. pisum than Ap. craccivora. These results would be derived from the higher ability of dispersal by walking in Ac. pisum than Ap. craccivora. The longer legs, higher walking speed, and stronger tolerance of starvation in Ac. pisum might result in a higher ability of dispersal by walking. These traits may have developed in relation to non-ant attendance, because Ac. pisum aphids frequently escape from natural enemies by dropping from the host plant. On the other hand, Ap. craccivora have not developed morphological and behavioral traits concerning dispersal by walking, because increasing colony size without dispersal is likely to be advantageous for ant attraction. Escaping behaviors of Ap. craccivora from natural enemies have not been well developed due to the ant's defense against natural enemies. The proportion of alatae in Ap. craccivora was higher than in Ac. pisum instead of a lesser ability for dispersal by walking in Ap. craccivora. The differences in ant attendance have been influenced in the development of morphological and behavioral traits concerning the dispersal ability, and then, different potentials for reproduction and dispersal have developed in ant-tended aphids and non-ant-tended aphids. © 2007 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer.},

abstract={Reasons for performing the study: L-tryptophan is a common ingredient in equine calmative products, but its effectiveness has not been demonstrated in horses. Hypothesis: To determine whether a commercial dose of L-tryptophan increases plasma tryptophan and alters behaviour in horses fed a roughage or concentrate meal. Methods: L-tryptophan (6.3 g) or placebo (water) was administered per os in a cross-over design, to 12 Thoroughbred horses (503 ± 12.1 kg bwt), just before a meal of lucerne hay or oats. Plasma tryptophan was measured by gas chromatography. Horse behaviour was observed in an empty enclosure, then in the presence of an unfamiliar person and a novel object. Results: Total plasma tryptophan increased 3-fold in both studies, peaking 1.5-2 h after dosing. After the peak, tryptophan remained high for several hours if the horses had been fed hay, but fell sharply if fed oats, consistent with the glycaemic responses to these meals. However, the ratio of tryptophan to 4 large neutral amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine and isoleucine) increased in the tryptophan-treated horses to a similar extent and for a similar duration, with both diets. The presence of a stranger or novel object increased heart rate (P<0.05), but caused no behavioural effects that were altered by tryptophan, regardless of the diet. Conclusions: Plasma tryptophan increases when tryptophan is administered at a dose used in some commercial products, but this is not reflected by marked behavioural changes in the horse. Potential relevance: Further work is required to refine behavioural tests and identify an effective dose of L-tryptophan in the horse.},

abstract={Predators can affect individual fitness and population and community processes through lethal effects (direct consumption or 'density' effects), where prey is consumed, or through non-lethal effects (trait-mediated effects or interactions), where behavioural compensation to predation risk occurs, such as animals avoiding areas of high predation risk. Studies of invertebrates, fish and amphibians have shown that non-lethal effects may be larger than lethal effects in determining the behaviour, condition, density and distribution of animals over a range of trophic levels. Although non-lethal effects have been well described in the behavioural ecology of birds (and also mammals) within the context of anti-predation behaviour, their role relative to lethal effects is probably underestimated. Birds show many behavioural and physiological changes to reduce direct mortality from predation and these are likely to have negative effects on other aspects of their fitness and population dynamics, as well as affecting the ecology of their own prey and their predators. As a consequence, the effects of predation in birds are best measured by trade-offs between maximizing instantaneous survival in the presence of predators and acquiring or maintaining resources for long-term survival or reproduction. Because avoiding predation imposes foraging costs, and foraging behaviour is relatively easy to measure in birds, the foraging-predation risk trade-off is probably an effective framework for understanding the importance of non-lethal effects, and so the population and community effects of predation risk in birds and other animals. Using a trade-off approach allows us to predict better how changes in predator density will impact on population and community dynamics, and how animals perceive and respond to predation risk, when non-lethal effects decouple the relationship between predator density and direct mortality rate. The trade-off approach also allows us to identify where predation risk is structuring communities because of avoidance of predators, even when this results in no observable direct mortality rate. © 2007 The Author.},

abstract={Introduction Response rates for the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) have declined in recent years. The response rate in 1993 was approximately 72%; in 2006, the response rate was approximately 51%. To assess the impact of this decline on the quality of BRFSS estimates, we compared selected health and risk factor estimates from BRFSS with similar estimates from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Methods We reviewed questionnaires from the 3 surveys and identified a set of comparable measures related to smoking prevalence, alcohol consumption, medical conditions, vaccination, health status, insurance coverage, cost barriers to medical care, testing for human immunodeficiency virus, and body measurements (height and weight). We compared weighted estimates for up to 15 outcome measures, including overall measures and measures for 12 population subgroups. We produced design-appropriate point estimates and carried out statistical tests of hypotheses on the equality of such estimates. We then calculated P values for comparisons of NHIS and NHANES estimates with their BRFSS counterparts. Results Although BRFSS and NHIS estimates were statistically similar for 5 of the 15 measures examined, BRFSS and NHANES estimates were statistically similar for only 1 of 6 measures. The observed differences for some of these comparisons were small, however. Conclusion These surveys produced similar estimates for several outcome measures, although we observed significant differences as well. Many of the observed differences may have limited consequences for implementing related public health programs; other differences may require more detailed examination. In general, the range of BRFSS estimates examined here tends to parallel those from NHIS and NHANES, both of which have higher rates of participation.},

abstract={Individuals with migraine headaches who are obese or overweight may be at elevated risk for experiencing more frequent migraines and for developing chronic migraine. This makes it imperative that clinicians consider including weight management as part of a migraine treatment plan in situations where the patient is overweight or obese. Weight loss and weight maintenance therapy should employ a combination of behavioral strategies, in particular nutritional education, dietary intervention, and exercise counseling, as a first line intervention. Weight loss medications are considered a secondary treatment; however, when weight loss medications are used, it is vital to monitor the influence of the medication on headache. Similarly, a clinician considering migraine prophylaxis needs to consider whether the pharmacologic agent being considered influences weight gain or loss. © 2008 the Authors.},

abstract={The "cost-benefit" hypothesis states that avian body organs show mass changes consistent with the trade-off between their functional importance and maintenance cost, which may vary throughout the annual cycle. Flightless moulting common scoter Melanitta nigra in Danish marine waters select rich undisturbed offshore feeding areas lacking predators, suggesting active feeding during moult. We tested four predictions relating to organ size during flightlessness in moulting male common scoter under this hypothesis. Namely that (i) pectoral muscles would show atrophy followed by hypertrophy, but that there would be no change in (ii) leg muscles and heart (the locomotory architecture required to sustain diving for food), (iii) digestive organs and liver (required to process food), or (iv) fat deposits (because birds could fulfil daily energy requirements from locally abundant food resources). Dissection of scoters collected at different stages during wing moult south of the Danish island of Læsø provided data on organ size that were consistent with these predictions. Pectoral muscle mass showed a c.23% atrophy during the middle of the flightless period relative to that at the end of moult. There was no significant loss in leg muscle, heart, digestive organs (except gizzard mass), liver, fat reserves or body mass with remigial growth. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that common scoter moult in a rich feeding area, and rely on their diet to meet the nutritional requirements of remigial moult. These results differ in detail from those of a similar study of terrestrial feeding moulting greylag geese Anser anser, but because of the widely differing ecology of the species concerned, both sets of findings provide strong support for the hypothesis that variations in phenotypic plasticity in size of fat stores, locomotor and digestive organs can be interpreted as evolutionary adaptations to meet the conflicting needs (feather growth, nutritional challenges and predator avoidance) of the flightless moult period in different Anatidae species. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={Although variation in individual lifestyle and genotype are important factors in explaining individual variation in the risk of developing obesity in an obesogenic environment, there is growing evidence that developmentally plastic processes also contribute. These effects are mediated at least in part through epigenetic processes. These developmental pathways do not directly cause obesity but rather alter the risk of an individual developing obesity later in life. At least two classes of developmental pathway are involved. The mismatch pathway involves the evolved adaptive responses of the developing organism to anticipated future adverse environments, which have maladaptive consequences if the environment is mismatched to that predicted. This pathway can be cued by prenatal undernutrition or stresses that lead the organism to forecast an adverse future environment and change its developmental trajectory accordingly. As a result, individuals develop with central and peripheral changes that increase their sensitivity to an obesogenic environment. It provides a model for how obesity emerges in populations in rapid transition, but also operates in developed countries. There is growing experimental evidence that this pathway can be manipulated by, for example, postnatal leptin exposure. Secondly, maternal diabetes, maternal obesity and infant overfeeding are associated with a greater risk of later obesity. Early life offers a potential point for preventative intervention. © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Objective: The authors detail the public health need for depression prevention research and the decisions made in designing an experiment testing problem solving therapy as "indicatedg" preventive intervention for high-risk older adults with subsyndromal depression. Special attention is given to the recruitment of African Americans because of well-documented inequalities in mental health services and depression treatment outcomes between races. Methods: A total of 306 subjects (half white, half African American) with scores of 16 or higher on the Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression Scale, but with no history of major depressive disorder in the past 12 months, are being recruited and randomly assigned to either problem solving therapy-primary care or to a dietary education control condition. Time to, and rate of, incident episodes of major depressive disorder are to be modeled using survival analysis. Level of depressive symptoms will be analyzed via a mixed models approach. Results: Twenty-two subjects have been recruited into the study, and to date eight have completed the randomly assigned intervention and postintervention assessment. Four of 22 have exited after developing major depressive episodes. None have complained about study procedures or demands. Implementation in a variety of community settings is going well. Conclusion: The data collected to date support the feasibility of translating from epidemiology to RCT design and implementation of empirical depression prevention research in later life. © 2008 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.},

abstract={Introduction: Previous studies have demonstrated an association between low total serum cholesterol and suicidal behavior. The aim of the present study was to determine the possible variation in serum cholesterol concentration among patients with different psychiatric disorders. Material and methods: The study sample consisted of 677 psychiatric patients grouped according to ICD-10 diagnoses (F10, F20, F23, F25, F32, F43, F60, X61 and X70). Fasting total cholesterol concentration was determined by a standard method on the second day of admission to Sveti Ivan Psychiatric Hospital for treatment. The study was conducted from January 1, 2005 till April 1, 2005. Results: Serum cholesterol concentration was statistically significantly lower in nonviolent suicide attempters; than in those without suicidal attempts but suffering from schizophrenia (P = 0.039), schizoaffective disorder (P = 0.019), depressive disorder (P = 0.002), stress reaction (acute and posttraumatic) (P = 0.019) and personality disorder (P = 0.011). There was no statistically significant difference in cholesterol concentration between patients with dependence syndrome (P = 0.100) or psychotic disorder (P = 0.179) and nonviolent suicide attempters. Conclusion: Serum cholesterol concentration varies among psychiatric patients with different diagnoses, and is significantly lower in patients with nonviolent suicidal attempts as compared with patients suffering from schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, depression, stress reaction and personality disorder. Study results confirmed the hypothesis on the association of low total cholesterol and suicidal behavior in psychiatric patients.},

abstract={It has been recently shown that Roman high- (RHA) and low- (RLA) avoidance rats show behavioural divergence in successive negative contrast (SNC) induced in one-way avoidance learning [Torres C, Cándido A, Escarabajal MD, de la Torre L, Maldonado A, Tobeña A, et al. Successive negative contrast effect in one-way avoidance learning in female roman rats. Physiol Behav 2005;85:377-82]. A 2-experiment study was conducted with the goal of analyzing whether these differences in SNC can also be extended to a different experimental paradigm. Food-deprived RHA and RLA female rats were exposed to a straight alley, recording the latency (DV) between leaving the start box and reaching the food available in the goal box at the end of the alley. To induce the SNC effect the amount of reinforcement received went from 12 pellets in the pre-shift phase to 1 pellet (Experiment 1) or 2 pellets (Experiment 2) in the postshift phase. The SNC effect appeared in both strains in Experiment 1, but only in RLA rats in Experiment 2. These results are discussed within the framework of SNC theories that account for this effect by using emotional mechanisms, as related to the differences in emotional reactivity seen between the RHA and RLA strains in a number of behavioural tests of fear/anxiety. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Zebrafish has been a favourite of developmental biologists and numerous genetic tools have been developed for this species. In recent years, zebrafish has become an increasingly popular subject of neuroscientists and behavioural scientists. One of the typical characteristics of zebrafish is shoaling, individuals forming a tight group in which fish swim together. The biological mechanisms of social behaviours are complex and not well understood in vertebrates, and zebrafish, due to its highly social nature and the genetic tools developed for it, may represent an excellent animal model with which these mechanisms may be studied. Improvement of behavioural quantification methods would facilitate research in this area. We describe a custom software application that allows the precise quantification of several parameters of group cohesion in zebrafish. We also present three experimental examples to illuminate the use of our methodology, and show how group cohesion changes in response to manipulations of the environment. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The need for reevaluation of the psychodynamic factors operative during treatment is emphasized. According to the view presented, the dynamic axis of psychoanalytic therapy is the corrective emotional experience which the patient obtains in the transference. The significant factor is not only that the patient relives his original conflicts in his relationship with the analyst, which in itself is so different from that of the parents. His reactions should correct the pathogenic effects of the parental attitudes. The objective, understanding attitude of the analyst in itself is so different from that of the parents that this alone necessitates a change in the patient's original attitudes. If the analyst succeeds in reconstructing precisely the original pathogenic parental attitude, he may facilitate the occurrence of intensive corrective emotional experiences by assuming an attitude toward the patient opposite to that of the most relevant pathogenic attitude which prevailed in the past. This does not consist in artificial play acting but in creating an emotional atmosphere which is conductive to undoing the traumatic effects of early family influences. The corrective emotional experience is the most powerful factor in making the patient's original ego defenses unnecessary and thus allowing the mobilization and emergence into consciousness of repressed material. It helps the patient's ego to assume a modified attitude toward hitherto repressed or inhibited impulses. Other important technical measures serve to keep the transference on an optimal level, such as changing the frequency of interviews according to the state of the analysis, correctly timed interruptions, and encouraging the required kind of extra-therapeutic experiences. Our experience in the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis is that with the consistent observance of these principles and technical measures the treatment becomes more effective and economical (Alexander 1946). Although the total duration of the treatment as a rule is not spectacularly shortened, the actual number of interviews can be substantially reduced in the great majority of cases. The principle which is stressed is that of flexibility in preference to routine. Briefness, in so far as the total duration of the treatment is concerned, does not characterize this approach. Naturally the personality of the analyst and his sex are of great importance for creating the kind of emotional atmosphere and experiences in the transference which are most conducive to reversing the adverse influences in the patient's past. The selection of an analyst for each patient is an involved problem and requires special consideration. Reasons are submitted for the urgent need for a careful reexamination of the therapeutic process.},

abstract={Organisms populating the Earth are under the steady influence of daily and seasonal changes resulting from the planet's rotation and orbit around the sun. This periodic pattern is most prominently manifested by the light-dark cycle and has led to the establishment of endogenous circadian timing systems that synchronize biological functions to the environment. This is the basis of predictive homeostasis (Moore-Ede 1986), evolving as an adaptation to anticipate predictable changes in the environment, such as light and darkness, temperature, food availability or predator activity. Therefore, the circadian clock is one of the most indispensable biological functions for living organisms that acts like a multifunctional timer to adjust the homeostatic system, including sleep and wakefulness, hormonal secretions and various other bodily functions, to the 24-h cycle (Buijs, van Eden, Goncharuk, and Kalsbeek 2003; Collins and Blau 2006; Hastings, Reddy, and Maywood 2003). In mammals, the circadian system is composed of many individual, tissue-specific cellular clocks. To generate coherent physiological and behavioral responses, the phases of this multitude of cellular clocks are orchestrated by a master circadian pacemaker residing in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

abstract={Background: Tailor-made strategies for assessing and improving cancer morbidity, malnutrition, a complex multifactorial syndrome, need to identify patients' characteristics or individuality. Method: Postoperative cancer patients (n=103), gastric, colorectal or breast, TNM stage I-III, and doctors/nurses (n=102) completed the EPQ-25, which measures individual characteristics on personality scores of extraversion (E), neuroticism (N), psychoticism (P) and conformity (L). Malnutrition parameters were obtained by the QOL-20 items and blood sample analysis. Explanation about disease severity from doctors, patient-family relationship, surgical procedure (total or partial gastrectomy), nutritional support (normal oral intake, hyperalimentation, fluid therapy) and radiation therapy of patients were recorded. Results: Patients' personality of less E, P and L and greater N predicted (P<0.05-0.001) higher anorexia, asthenia, pain, stress (impeding factors of food intake) or sodium, and lower quality of life (QOL), total protein, triglyceride, total-cholesterol, potassium or lymphocyte level [suggesting a risk of malnutrition], after controlling for tumor site, stage, age, sex, blood type and birth season. Doctors'/nurses' personality interacting with patients' personality, not either personality alone, significantly predicted QOL, nutritional, anemic and immune status, prognosis of patients after surgery, with doctors' explanation about disease, family relationship, total gastrectomy and oral nutrient intake as differential factors. Intercorrelations (convergent validity) as a function of personality suggested: malnourished patients have a poor QOL, protein-energy undernutrition, muscle tissue depletion and bodily fluid imbalabces; their stress-related immune function, and anemia responsible for reduced energy metabolism, are influenced by personality. Conclusion: Cancer patients' personality score was an easy, rapid, non-invasive and cost-effective diagnostic tool for identifying which patient is at risk of developing malnutrition. Doctors'/nurses' personality, congenial to patients' personality, may alleviate this risk, with explanation about disease, family relationship, partial gastrectomy and oral nutrition.},

There are large individual differences in age-related cognitive changes. Seeking the determinants of cognitive ageing is a research priority. A limitation of many studies is the lack of a sufficiently long period between cognitive assessments to examine determinants. Here, the aim is to examine influences on cognitive ageing between childhood and old age. Methods/Design. The study is designed as a follow-up cohort study. The participants comprise surviving members of the Scottish Mental Survey of 1947 (SMS1947; N = 70,805) who reside in the Edinburgh area (Lothian) of Scotland. The SMS1947 applied a valid test of general intelligence to all children born in 1936 and attending Scottish schools in June 1947. A total of 1091 participants make up the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. They undertook: a medical interview and examination; physical fitness testing; extensive cognitive testing (reasoning, memory, speed of information processing, and executive function); personality, quality of life and other psycho-social questionnaires; and a food frequency questionnaire. They have taken the same mental ability test (the Moray House Test No. 12) at age 11 and age 70. They provided blood samples for DNA extraction and testing and other biomarker analyses. Here we describe the background and aims of the study, the recruitment procedures and details of numbers tested, and the details of all examinations. Discussion. The principal strength of this cohort is the rarely captured phenotype of lifetime cognitive change. There is additional rich information to examine the determinants of individual differences in this lifetime cognitive change. This protocol report is important in alerting other researchers to the data available in the cohort. © 2007 Deary et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Processes of seed predation and dispersal are crucial for tree regeneration and forest dynamics. To understand the role of the dung beetle, Thorectes lusitanicus (Col., Scarabaeoidea, Geotrupidae) as secondary seed disperser in Mediterranean oak forests, its food preference was investigated in the field and in the laboratory. This paper had for objectives (1) to explore the feeding preferences for acorns of the two species available in the field: Quercus suber and Quercus canariensis, and (2) to study the olfactory and palatability response of T. lusitanicus to different food resources (oak acorns and dung) under laboratory conditions. The number of beetles in the field was curvilinearly related to the number of acorns, being higher when the number of acorns was intermediate. The maximum values of T. lusitanicus density corresponded to those plots located under Q. suber trees with the highest total weight of acorns. Bioassays with a four-armed olfactometer showed that T. lusitanicus was clearly attracted to volatiles of Q. suber acorns more than to of dung. Palatability bioassays also showed significant preferences for acorns of Q. suber in comparison with the typical food previously described for this beetle species (dung). According to our results, we suggest that a diet based on acorns (due to their high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids) probably satisfies the nutritional requirements of T. lusitanicus during winter, larval development, and metamorphosis. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The objectives of the current study were to determine how intermittent suckling (IS) affects nursing behavior, litter activity, and general behavioral patterns during lactation, and whether IS during an extended lactation period results in behavioral patterns associated with piglet distress. Intermittent suckling was applied either with 6-h separation intervals (IS6) or with 12-h separation intervals (IS12) and was compared with the conventional treatment (CT). In the CT (n = 17 litters), sows were continuously present until weaning (d 21, d 0 = farrowing). In both IS6 and IS 12, sows were separated from their litter for 12 h/d, beginning at d 14 and lasting until weaning (d 43 ± 1 d). In IS6, litters (n = 14) and sows were separated from 0800 to 1400 and from 2000 to 0200; in IS12 litters (n = 14) and sows were separated between 0800 and 2000. In IS litters, the activity pattern over the 24-h cycle was markedly changed by IS; litter activity was lower (P < 0.001) during sow absence and greater (P < 0.001) during sow presence compared with the unweaned CT litters. Moreover, both total nursing frequency (P < 0.001) and the percentage (P < 0.002) of successful nursings were reduced by IS. Although total nursing frequency was greater in IS6 compared with IS12 (on d 21 and 28), no differences in the frequency of successful nursings existed between IS6 and IS12 from d 14 onward. Eating behavior was increased shortly after the onset of IS (d 17) in both IS6 (P = 0.059) and IS12 (P < 0.001) compared with the unweaned CT litters. The IS 12 litters showed more eating behavior compared with IS6 and their exploratory behavior increased in time (P < 0.001), whereas IS6 showed more nursing behavior. Aggressive or manipulative behavior of both IS treatments was similar compared with the unweaned CT, and remained relatively unaltered with time in IS12 and IS6. Weaning in the CT resulted in more manipulative (P < 0.001) and aggressive (P = 0.004) behavior compared with preweaning values. Intermittent suckling may contribute to adaptation to the postweaning state by stimulating eating behavior, without causing obvious behavioral distress. ©2007 American Society of Animal Science.

abstract={The concept of farm animal welfare can, for practical purposes, be translated into the so-called Five Freedoms.1 Organic farming aims to meet animal welfare needs and should therefore comply with these Freedoms. The first Freedom, from hunger and thirst, is met in any system properly managed to organic standards. The Freedom from thermal and physical discomfort is challenged as organic husbandry systems face more climatic extremes. However, they also provide more 'control' to the animal by offering a choice when seeking warmth or a cool place to lie. The Freedom from pain, injury and disease is the most complicated one. Organic farming virtually bans mutilations (e.g. debeaking, tail docking), although some are still allowed and practised (e.g. castration). Organic animals are more exposed to wildlife and at risk of contracting infectious diseases. However, it is possible (although not proven) that organically managed animals are more resistant to illness. The Freedom to express normal behaviour is met through environmental enrichment and group housing. The Freedom from fear and distress is supported by e.g. extra (social) space. In conclusion, if animal health can be maintained, organic farming is very well placed to provide good animal welfare. © 2007 Society of Chemical Industry.},

abstract={The mesolimbic dopaminergic (ML-DA) system has been recognized for its central role in motivated behaviors, various types of reward, and, more recently, in cognitive processes. Functional theories have emphasized DA's involvement in the orchestration of goal-directed behaviors and in the promotion and reinforcement of learning. The affective neuroethological perspective presented here views the ML-DA system in terms of its ability to activate an instinctual emotional appetitive state (SEEKING) evolved to induce organisms to search for all varieties of life-supporting stimuli and to avoid harms. A description of the anatomical framework in which the ML system is embedded is followed by the argument that the SEEKING disposition emerges through functional integration of ventral basal ganglia (BG) into thalamocortical activities. Filtering cortical and limbic input that spreads into BG, DA transmission promotes the "release" of neural activity patterns that induce active SEEKING behaviors when expressed at the motor level. Reverberation of these patterns constitutes a neurodynamic process for the inclusion of cognitive and perceptual representations within the extended networks of the SEEKING urge. In this way, the SEEKING disposition influences attention, incentive salience, associative learning, and anticipatory predictions. In our view, the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse are, in part, caused by the activation of the SEEKING disposition, ranging from appetitive drive to persistent craving depending on the intensity of the affect. The implications of such a view for understanding addiction are considered, with particular emphasis on factors predisposing individuals to develop compulsive drug seeking behaviors. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Clinical and epidemiological studies provide strong data for a relationship between prenatal ethanol exposure and the risk for abuse in adolescent and young adult humans. However, drug-acceptance results in response to fetal exposure have differed by study, age at evaluation, and experimental animal. In the present study, the authors tested whether voluntary ethanol intake was enhanced in both the infantile and adult rat (15 and 90 days of age, respectively), as a consequence of chronic fetal drug experience. Experimental rats were exposed in utero by administering ethanol to a pregnant dam in a liquid diet during gestational Days 6-20. Compared with those for isocaloric pair-fed and ad lib chow control animals, the results for experimental animals demonstrated that fetal exposure significantly increased infantile affinity for ethanol ingestion without affecting intake patterns of an alternative fluid (water). Heightened affinity for ethanol was absent in adulthood. Moreover, the results argue against malnutrition as a principal factor underlying the infantile phenomenon. These data add to a growing literature indicative of heightened early postnatal acceptance patterns resulting from maternal use or abuse of ethanol during pregnancy. © 2007 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={The success of solid organ transplantation rests heavily on the major advances in immunosuppressive therapy. The early years of organ transplantation were plagued with high failure rates and frequent eipsodes of acute rejection. With the introduction of improved immunosuppressive agents, successful organ transplantation has become the norm. The emphasis of immunosuppressive therapy has shifted from preventing rejection to balancing acceptable rates of rejection with moderation in adverse effects of the immunosuppressive agents. Among the many possible adverse effects of immunosuppressive therapy is the potential for these agents to affect the nutrition status of the transplant recipient. Given the fact that many patients undergoing transplantation are catabolic and nutritionally vulnerable, it is particularly important for those involved in the care of these patients to be familiar with the nutrition implications of immunosuppressive drugs. In this article, we review the different classes of immunosuppressive medications used in transplantation and emphasize their interactions with the nutrition status of the transplant recipient.

abstract={□ Cancer is one of the most frequent causes of death in Germany. The reasons of various cancer diseases still remain uncertain. There is a long-standing discussion about associations between personality, depression, stress, and stressful life events, respectively, and the development of malignant neoplasms. Evidence for a role of psychosocial factors in development of cancer is not unequivocal despite many years of research on the subject. Current prospecvertive investigations do not support the conventional wisdom of a direct influence for personality in the development of cancer. Much of the research has been impaired by methodological flaws such as inadequate sample size, failure to adjust for potential confounders, lengths of follow-up, use of a variation of different measurements of cancer, and psychosocial variables. Furthermore, specific personality traits and various life events are associated with certain health-related behavior and lifestyle factors, e.g., smoking or an unhealthy nutrition. These unhealthy habits can increase cancer risk. Psychological parameters may alter immune and endocrine function and it has long been hypothesized that, through this pathway, psychosocial factors may affect cancer incidence. □ In conclusion, study results to substantiate the role of psychosocial factors in the development of various cancers are inconclusive. Contradictory results may be explained by methodological shortcomings. Further studies are required to pursue this question further. © 2007 Urban & Vogel.},

abstract={The role played by cerebellar circuits in visuo-motor associative learning is still unclear. The aim of the present study was to analyse cerebellar involvement using a visuo-locomotor associative learning paradigm that did not require spatial competences. Hemicerebellectomized (HCbed) and Control rats were tested in a visual discrimination task. First, both groups of rats had to learn that a reward was associated with an object that had a specific colour and shape (Experiment 1). Then, the shape but not the colour of the rewarded object was modified to verify whether the animals were able to transfer the rule of rewarding or whether they had to acquire a new association (Experiment 2). In the first sessions of the Experiment 1, HCbed animals displayed a tendency toward peripheral circling and a delay of about three sessions in reaching the criterion of correct choices compared to Controls. This delay has to be correlated to the need to overcome the procedural impairment elicited by the HCb. Once the HCbed animals put efficient procedural abilities into action, they exhibited a similar increase in percentages of successes from the fourth session onward as Controls. The results of Experiment 2 confirm the intact associative abilities of HCbed animals, as demonstrated by their progressive increase in successful associative responses, which, at the end of the transfer phase, were not significantly different from those of the Control group. The present findings indicate that the presence of a cerebellar lesion delays but does not prevent visuo-locomotor associative learning and that stimulus generalisation is performed without difficulty even in the presence of a cerebellar lesion. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Experiments to assess the impact of ocean acidification on abyssal animals were performed off Central California. The survival of caged megafauna (Benthoctopus sp., Pachycara bulbiceps, Coryphaenoides armatus) exposed to CO2-rich and normal (control) seawater varied among species. Benthoctopus sp. and P. bulbiceps survived control conditions and month-long episodic exposure to acidic, CO2-rich waters (pH reductions of ∼0.1 U). All C. armatus in both treatments died, potentially due to cage-related stress, predation, and exposure to acidic waters. High survival by P. bulbiceps and Benthoctopus under month-long exposure to CO2-rich waters indicates a physiological capacity to cope, at least temporarily, with stresses that will accompany expected future changes in ocean chemistry. The abundance of free-ranging scavengers was not correlated with variation in pH levels near fish cages. Incidental observations of abyssal scavengers collected using time-lapse cameras during these experiments were used secondarily to evaluate the hypothesis that macrourid fishes avoid the odor of dead conspecifics. Caged macrourids in view of time-lapse cameras died within 2 to 3 d, eliciting a strong response from the regional scavenger assemblage which aggregated near the cage. The pattern of scavenger visits suggests avoidance among taxa and a succession of scavengers. Macrourids, a dominant abyssal scavenger, either did not respond to the death of their congener or possibly avoided the area. Lack of a response by macrourids may be due to (1) avoidance of sites of dead or dying congeners, (2) high sensitivity to ocean acidification, (3) low nutritional value or weaker odor plumes from carcasses of abyssal versus shallow-water taxa, or (4) rapid departure from sites where a carcass is inaccessible. Camera systems were not deployed in view of carcasses at control sites (away from CO2 pools) during each experiment, and we therefore cannot exclude the possibility that the pattern of scavenger visits was influenced by elevated carbon dioxide levels. © Inter-Research 2007.},

abstract={Measures of arousal were used to study effects of estradiol and food restriction, and their potential interactions, in ovariectomized female C57Bl/6 mice. It was hypothesized based on a proposed theoretical equation [Pfaff, D.W., 2006a. Brain Arousal and Information Theory. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Pfaff, D.W., (Ed.), 2006b. Knobil and Neill's The Physiology of Reproduction, 3rd edition. Elsevier/Academic Press, San Diego] that each treatment would increase arousal-related behaviors and that their combination would further increase arousal behavior. Following baseline testing, animals (n = 28) were divided into 3 groups that, in different experimental phases, received either estradiol (in subcutaneous capsules), restricted diet (a liquid diet providing 60% of daily caloric requirements) or a combination of those two. An automated arousal behavior monitoring system was used to measure home cage voluntary motor activity and sensory responsiveness, these being components of a new operational definition of 'generalized arousal'. Key findings: (1) During the light, all treatments reduced voluntary activity. (2) In the dark, estrogens increased, while estrogens in combination with restricted diet decreased, horizontal activity. (3) In the dark, restricted diet alone had little effect on voluntary activity, but reduced it when combined with estrogen treatment. (4) All treatments reduced responses to the olfactory stimulus. The dependence of results on time of day was unexpected. Further, different patterns of results for the three treatments suggest that estrogens and food restriction did not have equivalent or additive effects on arousal. While contrary to the main prediction, these findings are discussed in terms of the animals' adaptive preparations for reproduction [Schneider, J.E., 2006.

abstract={We studied individual variation in the antipredator response of the fishing spider, D. triton, in a variety of developmental and behavioural contexts. We examined our data with respect to two general hypotheses: (1) startled spiders should modulate their boldness according to context-specific variables (e.g. developmental stage, feeding opportunities, mating opportunities, parental investment, body condition, etc.), and/or (2) an individual spider's boldness will be consistent (i.e. positively correlated) across contexts such that boldness in any given context is well predicted by boldness in other contexts. We found some support for the former, context-specific hypothesis and strong support for the latter, 'behavioural-syndromes' hypothesis. While spiders were significantly bolder in the presence versus absence of prey, boldness did not fluctuate with developmental stage, mating opportunities, parental investment or condition in the manner predicted. Instead, boldness in adult spiders was well predicted by a syndrome of positively correlated bold behaviours across functional contexts. We suggest that animal behaviour most often reflects a combination of context-specific behavioural optimization and context-general expression of behavioural syndromes, as was seen in this experiment. We further suggest that disentangling the relative magnitude of these two general mechanisms in a wide variety of taxa, covering many behavioural-ecological contexts, will provide great insights into (1) population ecology (e.g. the success of invasive/pest species and the failure of threatened species), (2) community ecology (e.g. species coexistence, trophic dynamics), and (3) evolutionary ecology (e.g. evolution of the multivariate behavioural phenotype). © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Obesity is a serious medical problem that disproportionately affects people with severe mental illness. Behavioral strategies aimed at lifestyle modification have proven effective for weight loss in general population but have not been studied adequately among persons with schizophrenia. We have conducted a randomized controlled pilot trial of an established weight loss program, modified for this specific population, and supplemented with a novel food replacement program, as well as practical, community based teaching of shopping and preparing healthy food. The program not only arrested weight gain, and produced meaningful weight loss, but also weight loss continued 6 months after the intervention is completed. Cognitive impairment had no bearing to the extent a participant benefited from the program. As a conclusion, well designed simple behavioral programs can produce lasting weight loss for patients with schizophrenia and comorbid obesity, improve metabolic indices, and possibly decrease significant medical risks associated with obesity. © 2007.},

abstract={Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of eating problems and to investigate personality traits associated with disturbed eating behaviours among Italian high school students. Method: Cross-sectional study involving 992 students from six high schools in Turin, Italy. Students completed the Eating Attitudes Test-40 (EAT-40), the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ); their weight and height were measured. Results: 5.5% of the whole sample and 7.4% of girls scored above the EAT-40 cutoff value. A higher Body Mass Index (BMI) correlates with higher EAT scores. Low scores on Self-Directedness and Reward Dependence together with high Persistence emerged in subjects with eating problems. Discussion: Dieting and higher BMI are confirmed as correlates of eating problems. Personality traits measured with the TCI emerge for the first time as correlates of eating problems. Longitudinal studies should clear whether these are risk factors or not. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.},

abstract={Large group sizes have been hypothesized to decrease predation risk and increase food competition. We investigated group size effects on vigilance and foraging behaviour during the migratory period in female Tibetan antelope Pantholops hodgsoni, in the Kekexili Nature Reserve of Qinghai Province, China. During June to August, adult female antelope and yearling females gather in large migratory groups and cross the Qinghai-Tibet highway to calving grounds within the Nature Reserve and return to Qumalai county after calving. Large groups of antelope aggregate in the migratory corridor where they compete for limited food resources and attract the attention of mammalian and avian predators and scavengers. We restricted our sampling to groups of less than 30 antelopes and thus limit our inference accordingly. Focal-animal sampling was used to record the behaviour of the free-ranging antelope except for those with lambs. Tibetan antelope spent more time foraging in larger groups but frequency of foraging bouts was not affected by group size. Conversely, the time spent vigilant and frequency of vigilance bouts decreased with increased group size. We suggest that these results are best explained by competition for food and risk of predation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Neuropeptide S (NPS) affects appetite-related processes in mammals. However, its role in avian biology is unreported. We hypothesized that intracerebroventricular (ICV) NPS would cause anorexigenic effects in chicks (Gallus gallus). To evaluate this, Cobb-500 chicks were centrally injected with multiple doses (0, 0.313, 0.625 and 1.250 μg) of NPS. NPS-treated chicks responded with decreased feed and water intake. The effect on water intake was secondary to feed intake, because fasted NPS-treated chicks did not reduce water intake. ICV NPS injection also reduced plasma corticosterone concentration. We monitored behavior and found decreased ingestive and exploratory pecking, jumping, locomotion, and increased time spent in deep rest. We hypothesized that the anorexigenic effects were hypothalamic in origin and quantified c-Fos reactivity in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) after NPS treatment. NPS was associated with decreased c-Fos reactivity in the LH, increased reactivity in the PVN and had no effect in the VMH. When NPS was injected directly into the LH and PVN, chicks responded with decreased feed and water intake, suggesting that effects were directly mediated by these nuclei. We conclude that ICV NPS causes anorexigenic effects in chicks, without directly affecting water intake, and the hypothalamus is involved. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Allocation trade-offs of carotenoids between their use in the immune system and production of sexual ornaments have been suggested as a proximate mechanism maintaining honesty of sexual signals. To test this idea, we experimentally examined whether carotenoid availability in the diet was related to variation in antibody response to novel antigens in male greenfinches (Carduelis chloris aurantiiventris), a species with extensive carotenoid-dependent plumage colouration. We also measured the cost of mounting a humoral response in terms of circulating carotenoids. Finally, we examined the relationship between plumage colour, immune response and circulating carotenoids. We found that males with carotenoid-supplemented diets showed stronger antibody response than non-supplemented birds. We also found that activation of the immune system significantly reduced circulating carotenoids (24.9% lower in immune-challenged birds than in control birds). Finally, intensity (chroma) of ventral plumage colouration of males, a character directly related to concentration of total carotenoids in feathers, was negatively correlated with the immune response and circulating carotenoids in winter. These results support the idea that carotenoids are a limiting resource and that males trade ornamental colouration against immune response. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Although there is accumulating evidence of growth-rate optimization by natural selection, the coevolution of growth rate and risk-taking behavior has not been sufficiently documented. The Atlantic silverside fish, Menidia menidia, displays countergradient variation in growth across a latitudinal gradient: genotypes from Nova Scotia (NS), for example, grow in length twofold faster than those from South Carolina (SC). Past work has established that fast growth is adaptive in northern climates, but the trade-off is poorer swimming performance and higher susceptibility to predators. We compared escape behavior and willingness to forage under threat of predation among growth genotypes reared and tested under common-garden conditions. When chased with a predator model, NS fish occupied shelter more quickly than SC fish. When food was supplied after a chase, NS fish reemerged from the shelter much more quickly than SC fish and immediately commenced feeding, whereas many SC fish displayed timid behavior and did not feed. When food was absent following a chase, however, NS fish remained in the shelter longer than did SC fish and both displayed timid behavior. Hence, the fast-growing NS genotype was bolder than SC fish in the presence of food, but shyer in the absence of food. These behaviors are adaptive given the physiological constraints intrinsic to each genotype. Experiments on captive populations of silversides that had been artificially selected for fast or slow growth confirmed that foraging behavior is genetically correlated with intrinsic growth rate, although in these trials the fast-growth genotype was always more bold, regardless of food availability, as would be expected in the absence of predators. We conclude that risk-taking foraging behavior coevolves adaptively with intrinsic growth rate in M. menidia. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Increased perception of predation risk can cause changes in activity, feeding and reproductive behavior in a wide range of taxa. Many small mammals in the temperate zone exhibit fluctuations in body mass in response to changing photoperiod. Bank voles lose body mass in winter which they regain when photoperiod increases in the spring. To determine if predation risk affects seasonal changes in body mass (BM), bank voles were exposed to two concentrations (low: LC and high: HC) of weasel feces. Food intake (FI) and daily energy expenditure (DEE) were measured to establish if differences in body mass were due to adjustment in energy intake or expenditure. Fecal corticosterone (CORT) was measured to assess whether the voles had detected and responded to predator feces as a physiological stressor. Voles of both sexes had higher levels of fecal CORT in the groups exposed to weasel feces compared to controls. Voles responded to the predator feces in a sex- and concentration-dependent manner. Males responded to LC feces by gaining less mass following the change in photoperiod. This was mediated by reduced FI and higher DEE. Female voles also gained less BM in response to HC feces, but increased both FI and DEE. We hypothesize that males may gain a short-term advantage by lowering BM in response to predation risk, which may be regained without affecting reproductive success. The consequences of mass loss in females may be more significant as this may delay the onset of breeding or reduce the size or number of young, thereby negatively affecting breeding success. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={This study has been carried out to "identify highly sensitive behavior on healthy nutrition (orthorexia nervosa-ON)" in residence medical doctors (MD) in the Faculty of Medicine. Diagnoses of ON was based on the presence of a disorder with obsessive-compulsive personality. The study is a cross-sectional research, which reached out to the entire 318 MD. The ORTO-15 test was used to propose a diagnostic proceeding and to try verify the prevalence of ON. Those subjects who were classified below 40 from the ORTO-15 test are accepted to have ON. Chi-square test, ANOVA (univariate) analysis and logistic regression were used for analyses of the data. Mean score of the participants from the ORTO-15 test is 39.8±0.22, and there is no statistical difference between women and men. A total of 45.5% of the residence MD involved in the research scored below 40 in the ORTO-15 test. Those who do their food shopping themselves, skip a meal with a salad/fruit, care about the quality of the things they eat, think that eating outside is healthy, look at the content of what they eat and the content of food is important in selection of a product score lower in their average marks in ORTO-15 and the difference among the groups is statistically significant. Food selection of 20.1% of the male participants and 38.9% of the female participants among the residence MD is influenced by the programs on nutrition/health in mass-media. The difference between the groups is statistically significant (p<0.05). Female medical doctors are more careful than men of their physical appearance and weight control and consume less caloric food, which is statistically significant. Since those who exhibit "healthy fanatic" eating habits may have a risk of ON in the future, it would be useful to conduct studies that identify the prevalence of ON in the public. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Early nutrition shapes life history. Parents should, therefore, provide a diet that will optimize the nutrient intake of their offspring. In a number of passerines, there is an often observed, but unexplained, peak in spider provisioning during chick development. We show that the proportion of spiders in the diet of nesding blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, varies significantly with the age of chicks but is unrelated to the timing of breeding or spider availability. Moreover, this parental prey selection supplies nesdings with high levels of taurine particularly at younger ages. This amino acid is known to be both vital and limiting for mammalian development and consequently found in high concentrations in placenta and milk. Based on the known roles of taurine in mammalian brain development and function, we then asked whether by supplying taurine-rich spiders, avian parents influence the stress responsiveness and cognitive function of their offspring. To test this, we provided wild blue tit nestlings with either a taurine supplement or control treatment once daily from the ages of 2-14 days. Then pairs of size- and sex-matched siblings were brought into captivity for behavioural testing. We found that juveniles that had received additional taurine as neonates took significantly greater risks when investigating novel objects than controls. Taurine birds were also more successful at a spatial learning task than controls. Additionally, those individuals that succeeded at a spatial learning task had shown intermediate levels of risk taking. Non-learners were generally very risk-averse controls. Early diet therefore has downstream impacts on behavioural characteristics that could affect fitness via foraging and competitive performance. Fine-scale prey selection is a mechanism by which parents can manipulate the behavioural phenotype of offspring. © 2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Dolphins live in complex social groupings with a wide variety of social strategies. In this chapter we investigate the role that differing habitats and ecological conditions have played in the evolution of delphinid social strategies. We propose a conceptual framework for understanding natural patterns of delphinid social structure in which the spatial and temporal predictability of resources influences the ranging patterns of individuals and communities. The framework predicts that when resources are spatially and temporally predictable, dolphins should remain resident in relatively small areas. Predictable resources are often found in complex inshore environments where dolphins may hide from predators or avoid areas with high predator density. Additionally, available food resources may limit group size. Thus, we predict that there are few benefits to forming large groups and potentially many benefits to being solitary or in small groups. Males may be able to sequester solitary females, controlling mating opportunities. Observations of inshore populations of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) and island-associated spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) seem to fit this pattern well, along with forest-dwelling African antelope and primates such as vervets (Cercopithicus aethiops), baboons (Papio sp.), macaques (Macaca sp.) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). In contrast, the framework predicts that when resources such as food are unpredictable, individuals must range further to find the necessary resources. Forming groups may be the only strategy available to avoid predation, especially in the open ocean. Larger home ranges are likely to support a greater number of individuals; however, prey is often sparsely distributed, which may act to reduce foraging competition. Cooperative foraging and herding of prey schools may be advantageous, potentially facilitating the formation of long-term bonds. Alternately, individuals may display many short-term affiliations. These large groups make it difficult for a male or a small group of males to sequester a female, and polygynandry is the most likely mating strategy. While it is difficult to study wide-ranging delphinids to examine these predictions, this ranging and behavioural pattern has been suggested for dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), coastal bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) and mixed species of dolphins in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. These patterns also resemble the ranging and social strategies of open savannah African antelopes and desert-dwelling macropods. Resource availability exists in a range of complex distributions and we predict that delphinid ranging patterns will also vary. At intermediate-ranging patterns, the framework predicts that individuals should form mid-sized groups balancing intra-group competition with predation protection. Humpback dolphins (Sousa sp.) appear to fit this pattern, with some site fidelity over relatively large ranges. They display fluid associations with other individuals. Predation pressure is not sufficiently high to cause large groups to form, and individuals probably reduce predation pressure more by hiding whenever possible. This pattern is likely to prevent the formation of long-term complex bonds. In contrast, killer whales (Orcinus orca) also display intermediate-ranging patterns, but have extremely strong social bonds within familial groups. Cooperative and altruistic behaviour in killer whales facilitate the formation of life-long bonds, similar to those observations in sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) and elephants (Loxodonta africana). This conceptual framework remains largely untested, and for many species it is not currently possible to describe ranging behaviours, anti-predator tactics or social behaviour in sufficient detail for appropriate examination of these ideas. Few studies on dolphins have been conducted to explicitly test this type of framework; however, existing observations of delphinid social strategies and communities are used throughout this chapter to examine this framework. Additionally, we anticipate that the present framework may provide a starting point to test hypotheses regarding the evolution of social strategies of delphinids. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Despite extensive theoretical and empirical research into offspring food solicitation behaviour as a model for parent-offspring conflict and communication, the adaptive value of parental responsiveness to begging has never been tested experimentally. Game theory models, as well as empirical studies, suggest that begging conveys information on offspring state, which implies that parental investment can be better translated to fitness by responding to begging when allocating resources rather than by ignoring it. However, this assumption and its underlying mechanisms have received little or no attention. Here we show by experiments with hand-raised house sparrow (Passer domesticus) nestlings that a 'responsive parent' will do better than a hypothetical 'non-responsive' mutant (that provides similar food amounts, but irrespective of begging). This is neither because food-deprived nestlings convert food to mass more efficiently, however, nor because responsiveness reduces costly begging. Rather, responsiveness to begging is adaptive because it reduces two opposing risks: one is wasting time when returning too soon to feed already satiated nestlings and the other is repeatedly overlooking some nestlings as a result of the stochastic nature of a random, non-responsive strategy. This study provides the first experimental evidence for the adaptive value of parental responsiveness to offspring begging. © 2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Vasopressin affects behavior via its two brain receptors, the vasopressin 1a and vasopressin 1b receptors (Avpr1b). Recent work from our laboratory has shown that disruption of the Avpr1b gene reduces intermale aggression and reduces social motivation. Here, we further characterized the aggressive phenotype in Avpr1b -/- (knockout) mice. We tested maternal aggression and predatory behavior. We also analyzed the extent to which food deprivation and competition over food increases intermale aggression. We quantified defensive behavior in Avpr1b -/- mice and later tested offensive aggression in these same mice. Our results show that attack behavior toward a conspecific is consistently reduced in Avpr1b -/- mice. Predatory behavior is normal, suggesting that the deficit is not because of a global inability to detect and attack stimuli. Food deprivation, competition for food and previous experience increase aggression in both Avpr1b +/+ and -/- mice. However, in these circumstances, the level of aggression seen in knockout mice is still less than that observed in wild-type mice. Defensive avoidance behaviors, such as boxing and fleeing, are largely intact in knockout mice. Avpr1b -/- mice do not display as many 'retaliatory' attacks as the Avpr1b +/+ mice. Interestingly, when territorial aggression was measured following the defensive behavior testing, Avpr1b -/- mice typically show less initial aggressive behavior than wild-type mice, but do show a significant increase in aggression with repeated testing. These studies confirm that deficits in aggression in Avpr1b -/- mice are limited to aggressive behavior involving the attack of a conspecific. We hypothesize that Avpr1b plays an important role in the central processing that couples the detection and perception of social cues (which appears normal) with the appropriate behavioral response. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This experiment aimed at testing the hypothesis that exposing hens to stress increases their corticosterone secretion and leads to elevated corticosterone concentrations in their eggs. Furthermore, exposure to stress and the associated changes in egg hormone content was predicted to alter offspring behaviour. Parental hens were 40 White Lohmann Selected Leghorns, half of which were exposed to an unpredictable feed restriction treatment. After application of the treatment, birds in the treatment group had higher concentrations of faecal corticosterone metabolites than birds in the control group. The treatment had no effect on the weight of treated birds or on the concentration of corticosterone in the yolk or albumen of their eggs. Sixty progeny (30 per treatment) were tested for effects on growth and behaviour. No effects of the treatment on the hatchability of eggs or progeny body weight were registered, but treated birds had a higher duration of tonic immobility in response to manual restraint and spent less time eating, when competing with birds from the control group for access to feed in a novel environment. These results confirm that pre-hatch stress may influence behavioural development in chickens. The lack of an effect on the concentration of corticosterone in eggs suggests that other steroid hormones in addition to or rather than corticosterone may mediate the effects of pre-hatch stress in chickens. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Avoidant coping style was tested as a moderating variable for the effect of ego threat on chronic dieters' (restrained eaters) risk for disinhibited eating. Young women (n=146) were randomly assigned to a speech threat or to a no threat condition and then participated in a bogus ice cream taste test. Analyses of covariance revealed that restrained eaters who scored higher on a standardized measure of avoidant coping consumed significantly more ice cream than restrained eaters who scored lower on avoidant coping regardless of the threat condition to which they were assigned. The findings suggest that dieters prone to using avoidant coping strategies may be particularly vulnerable to overeating and, therefore, could be at risk for lapses in dietary restraint. Hence, dietary relapse prevention programs might target dieters who tend to use avoidant coping strategies for cognitive-behavioral therapy to teach them adaptive coping skills. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Species with elaborate parental care often also show intense sibling competition over resources provided by parents, suggesting joint evolution of these two traits. Despite this, the evolution of elaborate parental care and the evolution of intense sibling competition are often studied separately. Here, we examine the interaction between parental food provisioning and sibling competition for resources through the joint manipulation of the presence or absence of parents and brood size in a species with facultative parental care: the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. The effect of the interaction between the presence or absence of parents and brood size was strong; brood size had a strong effect on growth when parents provided care, but no effect when parents were absent. As in previous studies, offspring grew faster when parents were present than when parents were absent, and offspring grew faster in smaller broods than in larger broods. Our behavioral observations showed that brood size had a negative effect on both the amount of time parents spent providing resources to individual offspring and the offspring's effectiveness of begging, confirming that the level of sibling competition increased with brood size. Furthermore, offspring in larger broods shifted more from begging toward self-feeding as they grew older compared to offspring in small broods. Our study provides novel insights into the joint evolution of parental care and sibling competition, and the evolution of offspring begging signals. We discuss the implications of our results in light of recent theoretical work on the evolution of parental care, sibling competition, and offspring begging signals. © 2007 The Author(s).},

abstract={Ascites, the most common complication of cirrhosis, is associated with a poor quality of life, an increased risk of infection, and renal failure. Twenty percent of cirrhotic patients have ascites at the time of diagnosis, while 30% and 50% will develop ascites by 5 and 10 years, respectively. There are several factors that contribute to ascites formation in cirrhotic patients, these include splanchnic vasodilatation, arterial hypotension, high cardiac output, and decreased vascular resistance. These factors lead to ineffective intravascular volume (hyperdynamic state), impairment of renal function, and subsequent water and sodium retention, all of which lead to dilutional hyponatremia (serum sodium <130 mEq/L), one of the most important prognostic factors in these patients. In conclusion, the therapeutic objective is to improve sodium balance and circulatory function through non-pharmacological measures, such as dietary sodium and water restriction as well as bed rest. Spironolactone (100-400 mg/day) is the initial drug of choice, while loop diuretics (like furosemide, 40-60 mg/day) are frequently used as adjuvants. Recently, agents that interfere with the renal effects of vasopressin by inhibiting water reabsorption in collecting ducts and producing free water diuresis have been used. These agents are called aquaretics and can be useful in the treatment of ascites unresponsive to conventional therapy.},

abstract={In social insects, decisions are usually predicted to be more accurate than individual decisions, because individual preferences are amplified at the group level. Although social caterpillars, as individuals, possess considerable 'nutritional wisdom' and have the capacity to regulate their nutrient intake: does this mean that the collective nutritional decisions made by colonies are better? We investigated individual feeding responses and collective decisions when caterpillar colonies were faced with different food sources. Forest tent caterpillars, Malacosoma disstria, had to choose between nutritionally balanced and unbalanced food sources placed at opposite ends of a bridge. At the individual level, caterpillars showed a clear preference for the balanced food source. In contrast, at the collective level, colonies of caterpillars randomly chose one of the two, and then became trapped for at least 24 h as a result of trail following behaviour. If the first caterpillar found the unbalanced food, it was followed by the others and the colony was unable to reverse this choice. This study provides evidence for a novel potential cost to group living, and shows that group feeding behaviour cannot always be simply predicted from individual preferences.

abstract={In theory, survival rates and consequent population status might be predictable from instantaneous behavioural measures of how animals prioritize foraging vs. avoiding predation. We show, for the 30 most common small bird species ringed in the UK, that one quarter respond to higher predation risk as if it is mass-dependent and lose mass. Half respond to predation risk as if it only interrupts their foraging and gain mass thus avoiding consequent increased starvation risk from reduced foraging time. These mass responses to higher predation risk are correlated with population and conservation status both within and between species (and independently of foraging habitat, foraging guild, sociality index and size) over the last 30 years in Britain, with mass loss being associated with declining populations and mass gain with increasing populations. If individuals show an interrupted foraging response to higher predation risk, they are likely to be experiencing a high quality foraging environment that should lead to higher survival. Whereas individuals that show a mass-dependent foraging response are likely to be in lower quality foraging environments, leading to relatively lower survival. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract={The n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) status of the neonatal brain has been associated with cognitive capability in mice. Previously, transgenic mice expressing the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) n-3 fatty acid (FA) desaturase gene under the control of a lactation-induced mammary gland promoter were found to produce milk containing significantly elevated levels of α-linolenic (ALA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acid. In this study, the preweaning growth rate and development of mouse pups consuming elevated n-3 PUFA milk produced by transgenic dams were evaluated using the Wahlsten observational test battery and the object novelty preference test. Brains were collected at weaning and analyzed for FA composition. Pups nursed on transgenic dams had earlier eye opening, higher visual placement scores, and 1.6-fold more docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in their brains compared with pups raised on wildtype dams. There was no significant effect of milk treatment (transgenic versus control) on other developmental parameters or novelty preference behavior. The pups consuming the elevated n-3 PUFA transgenic milk had slower preweaning growth rates such that pups reared on wildtype dams producing control milk were heavier than pups reared on transgenic dams producing high n-3 PUFA milk by postnatal day 18. This transgenic model enables the provision of a high n-3 PUFA lactational environment independent of maternal diet or gestational FA status. © International Pediatrics Research Foundation, Inc. 2007.

abstract={Background: Although recommendations about the treatment of obesity have been well documented, there is little research into how obese individuals view the outcomes of dietary treatment. It has been suggested that patient involvement in evaluating treatment outcomes may help target issues to assist with the ongoing improvement of dietetic services. The aim of this qualitative study was to collect patients' views on the dietetic service, the treatment outcomes in terms of lifestyle change and the impact that attending the dietetic service had on their lives in order to improve dietetic treatment, and to assist in the selection of appropriate outcome measurements in the future. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 obese patients attending dietetic clinics in Ayrshire, West of Scotland for weight management (advice on healthy eating and physical activity to achieve an energy deficit). Patients' views were transcribed, grouped and coded using content analysis. Results: Views included the importance of attending the dietitian for support to achieve weight management and a need to 'feel accountable to someone'. Interviewees valued information provided regarding diet, physical activity, behavioural strategies and the risks of obesity. Patients described the impact of obesity on their lives and identified changes to their lifestyles and health since attending the dietitian. They also identified barriers to change, e.g. feeling frustrated and overwhelmed about the changes necessary. Conclusion: This study extends the current knowledge of patients' views of their treatment outcomes, which may be important in helping dietitians devise appropriate patient-centred outcome measures. However, as this is a small sample, further long term research into a wider range of current and discharged patients' views is required. © 2007 The Authors.

abstract={The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system is the primary central mediator of stress-like states, coordinating behavioral, endocrine, and autonomic responses to stress. Although induction of anorexia is a well documented effect of CRF receptor agonist administration, the central sites and behavioral processes underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. The present studies addressed this question by examining the neuroanatomical, behavioral, and pharmacological mechanisms mediating decreases in feeding produced by the CRF1/CRF2 receptor agonist urocortin. Separate groups of food-restricted male Sprague Dawley rats were given infusions of urocortin (0, 50, 125, 250 ng/0.5 μl) into the lateral septum (LS) and immediately afterward were rated on a wide array of behaviors (locomotion, rearing, grooming, stereotypies) including a microstructural analysis of ingestive behavior. Intra-LS urocortin infusion dose-dependently reduced feeding and drinking while concomitantly increasing grooming, stereotypies, and ethological plus traditional measures of anxiety-like responses in the elevated plus-maze. Urocortin infusion into neighboring sites (lateral ventricle, medial caudate) had no effects. Coinfusion into the LS of the mixed CRF 1/CRF2 receptor antagonist D-Phe-CRF(12-41) (0, 100, 1000 ng/0.5 μl) or the novel selective CRF2 receptor antagonist Astressin2B (0, 500, 1000 ng/0.5 μl) blocked urocortin-induced effects, but the CRF1-selective antagonist NBI27914 (0, 500, 1000 ng/0.5 μl) had no effect, although it completely reversed the behavioral sequelae of CRF when infused into the basolateral amygdala. These results indicate that one of the modes through which the CRF system promotes anorexia is the recruitment of stress-like states after stimulation of CRF2 receptors within the LS.

All animats live and evolve in this shared environment, they are self-maintaining and engage in a series of vital activities - nutrition, growth, communication - with the ultimate goals of survival and reproduction. The main objective of Symbiosis is to study the behavior of ecosystem members, especially in terms of the emergent learning mechanisms and the effect of co-evolution on the evolved behavioral strategies. In this direction, several indicators are used to assess individual behavior, with the overall effectiveness metric depending strongly on the animats net energy gain and reproduction rate. Several experiments have been conducted with the developed simulator under various environmental conditions. Overall experimental results support our original hypothesis that co-evolution is a driving factor in the animat learning procedure. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={In studies of refuge use as a form of antipredator behavior, where prey hide in response to a predator's approach, factors such as foraging costs and the perceived risk in a predator's approach have been shown to influence the hiding behavior of prey. Because few studies of waiting games have focused on mammals, we studied the hiding behavior of the yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris), a ground-dwelling rodent. We tested the prediction that marmots vary hiding time as a function of predator approach speed and presence and absence of food outside their refuge and that marmots hide differently depending on their relative condition. We conducted "fast approaches" and "slow approaches" in the presence and absence of extra food and evaluated hiding times. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that the interaction between the approach speed and the presence and absence of food influenced hiding behavior; body condition had a smaller, but nonsignificant effect. We then developed a state-dependent dynamic model to explore potential fitness consequences of these decisions. The model suggested that the overall survival of a population is substantially reduced when individuals make suboptimal decisions. Our research builds on previous studies, indicating that animals integrate both costs and benefits of hiding when determining their hiding times. © The Author 2007.

abstract={The fitness costs and benefits at different positions in fish shoals, bird flocks, and insect swarms can be asymmetric; a group's edge may provide more feeding opportunities, but also greater predator risk. Animals make trade-offs between these selection pressures based on individual differences in traits including satiation level, ability to avoid predators, and sex. Previous studies did not evaluate the impact of sex on group positioning in these types of nonhierarchical, nonmating groups called congregations. A controlled laboratory experiment was conducted, using marked whirligig beetles (Coleoptera: Gyrinidae), to test for sexual segregation and why different sexes might choose different positions. Soon after a disturbance, males often were found at the periphery and females at the center of groups. There was also an overlying influence of feeding on position; satiated individuals moved toward the center and hungry individuals toward the periphery. Several minutes after a disturbance, sexual segregation disappeared, but segregation due to hunger persisted. Sexual segregation in this study was best explained by the predator avoidance hypothesis, not the energy needs hypothesis. Females weighed less than males; this may make them more at risk to predation because of reduced swimming speed or less mechanical protection from their exoskeleton. No difference between the sexes was found in the volume of their defensive chemicals. This is one of the first studies to show that sex influences position of individuals within simple nonmating groups (congregations) and suggests that more attention should be given to positional sex differences within shoals, flocks, herds, and swarms. © The Author 2007.

abstract={The fact that rats emit different types of ultrasonic vocalizations in a variety of contexts has received increasing experimental attention, since such calls might serve as indices of the animal's subjective state, and/or as social signals in various types of interactions with other rats. Here, we present two experiments in adult male Wistar rats where we tested several different situations and conditions with respect to the occurrence of high-frequency (50-kHz) and low-frequency (22-kHz) calls. These experiments showed that rats emitted high-frequency calls when tested singly in a housing cage, which was situated in a room with no other rats present. Calling did not habituate with repeated testing, and occurred in the animal's own home cage, or a fresh housing cage, and irrespective of whether the animal's motivational status was high or low, that is, irrespective of whether they were food-deprived or fed ad libitum. Furthermore, high- and low-frequency calls were observed when applying a standardized new tickling procedure, which provided evidence for effective types of tickling. Most, but not all, young adult rats still accepted this stimulation as play. Therefore, this procedure might be a useful method to elicit high-frequency calls in adult rats. Overall, substantial evidence for inter-individual variability and intra-individual stability in vocalization was provided both, within and between housing cage and tickle tests. This variability seems to depend at least partly on dispositions or traits, which can be gauged by specific screening tests, like measuring risk-assessment in the elevated plus-maze, since animals with more risk-assessment were more likely to emit high-frequency calls during cage and tickle tests. These findings are discussed with respect to the major hypotheses concerning the functional significance of ultrasonic vocalizations, namely the social/communicatory and the motivational/emotional hypothesis. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The abundance and behaviour of mammalian prey species such as the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are known to be regulated by the availability of both food for maintenance and reproduction and shelter for protection against predators and harsh weather. However, the effect of vegetation structure and temporal variations in food availability on habitat selection and spatial behaviour are still poorly understood. The present study investigated the relationship between rabbit spatial ecology and vegetation structure and food quality and quantity in three neighbouring areas in SW Spain that differed in the distribution and amount of refuge sites and food patches. In all, 35 rabbits were radiotracked in the three study areas and home range and core area sizes in different seasons and at different times of the day estimated. Spatial behaviour was then compared with parameters of vegetation cover and food quantity and quality. Lastly, rabbit habitat selection at two levels was studied: home range selection and selection within home ranges. Home range size varied from one study area and season to another, but was not dependent on either sex or the availability or quality of food. We suggest that differences in home range size between study areas respond to differences in vegetation cover, with smaller home ranges in areas with higher proportion of sheltering vegetation. It was found that habitat selection patterns varied between the three areas in terms of the need for rabbits to exploit to a maximum the scarcest resource in each situation, thereby optimising access to both feeding and refuge patches. This pattern was manifest at the home range level of habitat selection but not at the level of selection within home ranges. Findings were consistent with the high behavioural plasticity of the European rabbit in its native habitats and provide useful information for habitat management. © 2006 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.},

abstract={Ecological conditions and food quality have influence on age and size at metamorphosis of organisms with complex life cycles. However, little is known about the foraging behaviour and how diet choice is influenced by the ecological conditions. The present study poses two major questions: (1) how do different diets (high protein, low protein and both diets together) influence larval performance, and (2) how does diet choice change with ecological conditions (interference competition, predation and pond drying)? To address the second question, we offered both types of food to tadpoles under the different circumstances. We measured food consumption of the two food types, along with the growth rate and developmental stage of tadpoles. We expected that under unfavourable growth conditions, larvae would select high-protein food, which would promote development and allow individuals to escape these high-risk environments. High-protein food promotes development, but results in smaller tadpoles, whereas low-protein food promotes growth with slower development. The mixture of the two is better only in terms of growth rate. Our study of tadpoles showed that diet selection may not be constant but can vary depending on the ecological context in predictable ways. When exposed to interference competition and drying ponds, tadpoles fed on food that enhanced development, whereas in the control group and in predation treatments, they fed selectively on food that favoured growth. Our data indicate that diet selection by tadpoles may confer adaptive responses to ecological changes. Such selection/responses would increase growth, development, and survival. © 2006 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.},

abstract={Individuals have to trade-off energy intake against the risk of predation when foraging. However, in group-living species, social interference will limit the range of choices for subordinate individuals. The trade-off between foraging and predation risk may be even more complex in species that associate in family groups because relatives can provide benefits to each other that are withheld from nonrelatives. As a consequence, nonrelatives may be forced to take greater risks to gain similar amounts of energy as relatives. Here, I investigate how the energy-risk trade-off varies among individuals in a social, group-living species, the Siberian jay, Perisoreus infaustus. Groups in this species consist of a breeding pair, together with retained offspring and/or nonrelated immigrants. I manipulated food quality at feeding sites that differed in their visibility to predators and observed the differences in foraging patterns between different group members. Adults and their offspring fed more often at the protected feeding site when it contained high-quality food, but switched to the more exposed site when this site offered higher quality food than the protected site. In contrast, immigrants spent a similar amount of time at each feeding site, independent of food quality. Birds generally spent more time waiting for access to the high-quality food source and protected feeding site, and family members generally harassed immigrants that tried to access these sites. None the less, all birds had a similar overall food intake, suggesting that immigrants pay substantially higher costs than other members to attain the equivalent level of energy intake. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={1. A predictive framework of community and ecosystem dynamics that applies across systems has remained elusive, in part because non-consumptive predator effects are often ignored. Further, it is unclear how much individual-level detail community models must include. 2. Previous studies of short-lived species suggest that state-dependent decisions add little to our understanding of community dynamics. Body condition-dependent decisions made by long-lived herbivores under risk of predation, however, might have greater community-level effects. This possibility remains largely unexplored, especially in marine environments. 3. In the relatively pristine seagrass community of Shark Bay, Australia, we found that herbivorous green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas Linnaeus, 1758) threatened by tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier Peron and LeSueur, 1822) select microhabitats in a condition-dependent manner. Turtles in poor body condition selected profitable, high-risk microhabitats, while turtles in good body condition, which are more abundant, selected safer, less profitable microhabitats. When predation risk was low, however, turtles in good condition moved into more profitable microhabitats. 4. Condition-dependent use of space by turtles shows that tiger sharks modify the spatio-temporal pattern of turtle grazing and their impacts on ecosystem dynamics (a trait-mediated indirect interaction). Therefore, state-dependent decisions by individuals can have important implications for community dynamics in some situations. 5. Our study suggests that declines in large-bodied sharks may affect ecosystems more substantially than assumed when non-lethal effects of these top predators on mesoconsumers are not considered explicitly. © 2007 The Authors.},

abstract={Efficient predator avoidance has to be balanced with other fitness-related behaviours such as foraging. Many aquatic animals coexisting with predators can recognise them through chemical cues and respond adaptively. Invasive or introduced species may lack this ability which may result in competitive disadvantage in the presence of predation risk. We investigated behavioural responses of predator-naïve juveniles of two co-occurring crayfish species to chemical cues of European eel (Anguilla anguilla). The native noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) has a long coevolutionary history with eel in Finland and the introduced signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) a short one. We found that in the presence of odours from food deprived eels, noble crayfish increased shelter use and reduced nocturnal foraging activity. In contrast, signal crayfish reduced shelter use and increased their foraging activity when exposed to eel odours. These results indicate that signal crayfish would face a stronger risk of predation in waters with eel but the risk is reduced by their overall higher tendency to stay in shelter at night.},

abstract={Place cells are hippocampal pyramidal neurons that discharge strongly in relation to the rat's location in the environment. We recently reported that many place cells recorded from rats performing place or cue navigation tasks also discharged when they were at the goal location rather than in the primary firing field. Furthermore, subtle differences in discharge timing were found in the two navigation tasks, with activity occurring later in the place task compared to the cue task. Here we tested the possibility that such delayed firing in the place task may reflect the differential involvement of time estimation, which would allow the rat to predict forthcoming reward delivery. More specifically, we reasoned that failure to obtain a reward after a fixed 2s delay in the place task reliably reflected the rat's misplacement relative to the correct location, thus making time a valuable cue to help the rat perform the task. To test this hypothesis, well-trained rats were run on a partial extinction procedure in place and cue navigation tasks so that no feed-back signal was provided about their actual accuracy during extinction periods. Although the time estimation hypothesis predicts that only in the place task will the rat make correction movements at the end of goal periods during extinction, we found that such movements occurred in all rats, indicating correct time estimation in both place and cue tasks. We briefly discuss the results in the light of current computational theories of hippocampal function. © 2007 Imperial College Press.},

abstract={Sediment dwelling macrofauna (infauna) are important vectors for the transfer of sediment-associated contaminants to higher trophic levels. Sedimenting organic matter constitutes an important food source for all benthic organisms and changes seasonally in terms of quantity and quality. Sediment organic matter (SOM) quality affects organism activity and feeding behaviour, and is therefore also likely to affect contaminant fate in benthic systems. We investigated the impact of SOM quality (enrichment with either labile Tetraselmis sp. or refractory lignin) on the accumulation and metabolism of sediment-associated pyrene in Nereis diversicolor (Annelida) and Amphiura filiformis (Echinodermata), as well as the combined effect of SOM quality and infaunal bioturbation on pyrene distribution and metabolism in the sediment. After 45 d of exposure, SOM quality almost doubled pyrene bioaccumulation in both species, while pyrene metabolism remained unaffected. Metabolites comprised ∼80% of the total tissue pyrene in N. diversicolor and ∼40% in A. filiformis. A. filiformis arms contained one fifth of the disk pyrene concentration. Approximately 20% of the pyrene found in A. filiformis arms was found to be covalently bound to, e.g. DNA, RNA or proteins, thus reducing pyrene bioavailability to arm-cropping predators. The sedimentary pyrene distribution and metabolism was species-dependent, but correlated poorly with prevailing knowledge on species-specific bioturbation patterns. This was attributed to the comparably high biodegradability of the contaminant thus altering its sorptive characteristics and function as inert tracer. Subduction of pyrene and metabolites occurred, and the fraction of pyrene covalently bound to SOM increased with depth, thereby removing pyrene from the bioavailable pool. Our results imply that bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of sediment-associated PAH should increase following fresh organic matter input, e.g. after sedimentation of phytoplankton blooms. We stress the importance of considering behavioural characteristics of infauna and the trophic situation of the system when assessing fate and effects of sediment-associated contaminants. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The ex situ population of maned wolves is not self-sustaining due to poor reproduction, caused primarily by parental incompetence. Studies have shown that environmental enrichment can promote natural parental behaviors in zoo animals. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of environmental enrichment on behavioral and physiological responses of maned wolves. During an 8-week experimental period, daily behavior observations and fecal sample collection were conducted on four adult wolves (2.2) individually housed in environments without enrichment. After 2 weeks, the wolves were chronologically provided with 2-week intervals of hiding dead mice around the exhibit, no enrichment, and introduction of boomer balls. Responses of the wolves to enrichment were assessed based on activity levels and exploratory rates, as well as the level of corticoid metabolites in fecal samples collected daily throughout the study period. Providing wolves with environmental enrichment significantly increased exploratory behaviors (P < 0.05), especially when mice were hidden in the enclosure. Fecal corticoid concentrations were increased during periods of enrichment in males (P < 0.05), but not in females. Overall, there were no correlations between behavioral responses to enrichment and fecal corticoid levels. Behavioral results suggest that environmental enrichment elicits positive effects on the behavior of captive maned wolves. There is evidence suggesting that providing animals with ability to forage for food is a more effective enrichment strategy than introducing objects. There is need for a longer term study to determine the impact of environmental enrichment in this species. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={In cannibalistic species, small individuals often shift habitats to minimize risk of predation by larger conspecifics. The availability of diverse size-structured habitats may mediate the incidence of cannibalism by larger individuals on smaller individuals and increase fitness of smaller individuals. We tested these hypotheses in a series of laboratory studies with Gammarus pulex, a freshwater amphipod inhabiting substrates with varying interstitial pore space sizes. In the absence of larger, potentially cannibalistic individuals, small Gammarus actively used all pore space sizes offered. They used only substrates containing food and preferred food items that provided cover to food items that did not. In the presence of larger G. pulex, small individuals almost exclusively used smaller pore spaces from which larger individuals were excluded. Small individual survival was significantly lower in the presence of larger Gammarus than in controls without larger individuals regardless of substrate size, but availability of mixed pore sizes significantly increased survival. Food consumption and growth per individual were not affected by the presence of larger individuals or substrate composition. Our results suggest that the distribution and availability of complex and high-quality habitats may affect the occurrence and significance of cannibalism in size-structured populations. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={With one billion people overweight worldwide, the need to identify risk factors and treatments for obesity is urgent. The present study determined whether rats genetically prone to diet-induced obesity (DIO) show preexisting differences in meal microstructure and are sensitive to central anorectic effects of corticotropin-releasing factor type 2 (CRF2) receptor stimulation. Male, selectively bred DIO rats and their diet resistant (DR) counterparts (n = 9/genotype) were weaned onto low-fat chow and compared as young adults for spontaneous or intracerebroventricular urocortin 2 administration-induced (0, 0.3, 1, 3 μg) differences in ingestion. DIO rats were hyperphagic selectively at the dark cycle onset, showing shorter latencies to initiate feeding, faster returns to eating following meal completion, and a lower satiety ratio than DR rats. At other times, DIO rats had briefer postmeal intervals, but ate smaller and briefer meals, resulting in normal intake. DIO rats also ate faster than DR rats. Urocortin 2 was less potent in DIO rats, ineffective at the 0.3 μg dose, but produced CRF2 antagonist-reversible anorexia at higher doses. Though heavier, chow-maintained DIO rats were proportionately as or more lean than DR rats. Thus, DIO rats showed signs of a preexisting, heritable deficit in the maintenance of postmeal satiety and a reduced sensitivity to anorectic CRF2 agonist stimulation. The meal patterns of DIO rats temporally resemble human 'snacking' behaviour, which predicts adult obesity. Because central CRF2 stimulation retains full anorectic efficacy at higher doses in the DIO model, manipulating this neuropeptidergic system might yield new therapeutic approaches for diet-induced obesity. © 2007 The Authors.

abstract={The life and work of the eminent ethologist and Nobel laureate Nikolaas Tinbergen (1907-1988) played an essential role in the introduction of a new approach that is transforming the scientific understanding of animal behaviour, human nature and evolution. This article focuses on an extremely well-written biography of him, Niko's Nature, by Hans Kruuk, one of Tinbergen's former students. Niko's Nature is more than a biography: it is a presentation and an evaluation of the main lines of European ethology and behaviour research in the 20th century up to the 1980s. Tinbergen suffered from depression most of his adult life, and if he had been a child today, he probably would have been diagnosed as hyperactive (ADHD). Tinbergen fits into a pattern of lifelong fatty-acid deficiency. I also discuss other possible causes of his problems (like protein intolerance, vitamin deficiency, genetics and novel environmental factors) and speculate how Tinbergen would have approached such issues if he were alive today. © SAGE Publications 2007.},

abstract={Epigenetic and life history approacnes to child growth are centered on the relationship between the organism and its environment. However, defining and operationalizing the concept of environment is challenging, in light of the multiple variables that influence growth. Moreover, the concept of adaptation as it applies to child growth is seldom considered in the developed country context. This paper presents a study of children living in three neighborhoods in the City of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Two of the communities are considered adverse environments on the basis of low socioeconomic status, and their inner city, industrial location. In contrast to children living in the higher socioeconomic status area, children in these adverse environments display negative growth indicators, i.e., somewhat constrained linear growth in one and risk for overweight and obesity in both. Although both these inner city neighborhoods constitute adverse environments, they differ in ways that have a significant impact on children's growth. We argue for a definition of "adverse environment" that is broadly based, incorporating a range of physical, social, and temporal factors that are highly localized and sensitive to community-level influences on growth and health. As well, we consider whether higher prevalence of overweight and obesity is adaptive in any way to these adverse environments and conclude that they are more likely to be deleterious than adaptive in either the long or short term. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={There is now much evidence that early life undernutrition elevates risk of diseases like cardiovascular disease. Less clear is whether the underlying developmental plasticity in metabolism and physiology evolved to serve an adaptive function, beyond these effects on pathophysiology. This review builds from principles of life history theory to propose a functional model linking early environments with adult biology. An organism has metabolic potential in excess of survival requirements, called productivity, that supports growth before being shunted into reproduction after growth ceases. This concept from inter-specific studies leads to the prediction that plasticity in growth rate will be positively correlated with components of future adult reproductive expenditure. Consistent with this idea, evidence is reviewed that early nutrition or growth rate predict offspring size in females, and increased somatic investment related to reproductive strategy in males. Thus, population birth weight and sexual size dimorphism are predicted to increase in response to improvements in early nutrition. A striking feature of the continuity of metabolic production is its perpetuation not merely during the life-cycle but across generations: in females, growth rate predicts future nutritional investment in reproduction, which in turn determines fetal growth rate in the next generation. Growth and reproduction serve as mutually-defining templates, thus creating a phenotypic bridge allowing ecologic information to be maintained during ontogeny and transmitted to offspring. Resetting of metabolic production in response to maternal nutritional cues may serve a broader goal of integrating nutritional information within the matriline, thus providing a more reliable basis for adjusting long-term strategy. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Background: The preservation of autonomy and the ability of elderly to carry out the basic activities of daily living, beyond the therapeutic care of any pathologies, appears as one of the main objectives of care during hospitalization. Objectives: To identify early clinical markers associated with the loss of independence in elderly people in short stay hospitals. Methods: Among the 1,306 subjects making up the prospective and multicenter SAFEs cohort study (Sujet Agé Fragile: Évolution et suivi-Frail elderly subjects, evaluation and follow-up), 619 medical inpatients, not disabled at baseline and hospitalized through an emergency department were considered. Data used in a multinomial logistic regression were obtained through a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) conducted in the first week of hospitalization. Dependency levels were assessed at baseline, at inclusion and at 30 days using Katz's ADL index. Baseline was defined as the dependence level before occurrence of the event motivating hospitalization. To limit the influence of rehabilitation on the level of dependence, only stays shorter than 30 days were considered. Results: About 514 patients were eligible, 15 died and 90 were still hospitalized at end point (n = 619). Two-thirds of subjects were women, with a mean age of 83. At day 30 162 patients (31%) were not disabled; 61 (12%) were moderately disabled and 291 severely disabled (57%). No socio-demographic variables seemed to influence the day 30 dependence level. Lack of autonomy (odds ratio (OR) = 1.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2-3.6), walking difficulties (OR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.3-5.6), fall risk (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.3-6.8) and malnutrition risk (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.5-7.6) were found in multifactorial analysis to be clinical markers for loss of independence. Conclusions: Beyond considerations on the designing of preventive policies targeting the populations at risk that have been identified here, the identification of functional factors (lack of autonomy, walking difficulties, risk of falling) suggests above all that consideration needs to be given to the organization per se of the French geriatric hospital care system, and in particular to the relevance of maintaining sector-type segregation between wards for care of acute care and those involved in rehabilitation © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Despite mixed evidence that G × E contributes to psychopathology, some promising and consistent findings are emerging. Evidence is reviewed in relation to depression, antisocial behavior, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Although findings from various research designs have different meaning, interestingly much of the evidence with regard to the contribution of G × E that has arisen from twin and adoption studies has been for antisocial behavior and depression. It is for these same forms of psychopathology that molecular genetic evidence of G × E has also been most convincing. Finally, current and anticipated methodological challenges and implications for future research in this area are considered.},

abstract={To survive, food-deprived animals may be forced to forage under hostile conditions. We attempt to use genetically tractable Drosophila melanogaster as a model to elucidate molecular and neural mechanisms that drive a forager to engage in risk-prone food acquisition. Here we describe a paradigm for assessing hunger-driven food acquisition by fly larvae at a deleteriously cold temperature. Genetic analyses reveal that the neural activity of NPFR1, a receptor of neuropeptide F (NPF, the sole fly homolog of neuropeptide Y or NPY), was required for cold-resistant feeding behavior of fasted larvae. Conversely, NPFR1 overexpression in fed larvae was sufficient to trigger cold-resistant feeding activity normally associated with fasted larvae. Furthermore, the fly insulin-like system, implicated in the transduction of hunger signals to the CNS, regulated negatively larval cold-resistant food acquisition. The results from this and our previous studies suggest that the fly NPY-like system is a central mediator of hunger-elicited resistance to diverse stressors that can be of thermal, gustatory or mechanical form. © 2007 IBRO.},

By using animal-mounted instruments simultaneously recording movements, diving behavior, and in situ oceanographic properties, we studied the behavioral and physiological responses of southern elephant seals to spatial environmental variability throughout their circumpolar range. Improved body condition of seals in the Atlantic sector was associated with Circumpolar Deep Water upwelling regions within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, whereas High-Salinity Shelf Waters or temperature/salinity gradients under winter pack ice were important in the Indian and Pacific sectors. Energetic consequences of these variations could help explain recently observed population trends, showing the usefulness of this approach in examining the sensitivity of top predators to global and regional-scale climate variability. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract={Background. Males of many species adjust their reproductive tactics with regard to their condition and status. For example, large males may develop weapons and fight for access to females, whereas small or undernourished males do not express costly weapons or ornaments and sneak copulations. Different condition-dependent reproductive tactics may be associated with unequal average fitness, but the tactic chosen by a given male under given circumstances is thought to result in the highest possible fitness return. The ant species Cardiocondyla obscurior exhibits an environment-controlled polymorphism of docile, winged males and aggressive "ergatoid" males. Ergatoid males, which can replenish their sperm supply throughout their lives, engage in lethal fighting, and attempt to monopolize all female sexuals available in their nests, were previously assumed to gain higher lifetime reproductive success than the peaceful, winged males, which disperse to mate away from the nest and whose spermatogenesis is limited to the first days of adult life. However, precise data on male mating success have as yet not been available. Here, we compare the average mating success of the two male morphs, taking the high mortality rate of immature ergatoid males into account. Because individuals in insect societies may have opposing interests about their own development, we also investigate whether the interests of male larvae coincide with those of the workers and the rest of the society. Results. When the survival probability of males is taken into account, winged males are more likely to mate multiply and in consequence have a higher estimated average mating success than ergatoid males. Therefore, male larvae are expected to prefer developing into winged instead of ergatoid adults. Conclusion. Though male larvae can expect a higher average mating success when developing into winged males, most colonies produce only ergatoid males under standard conditions. This might point at a novel type of potential kin conflict within the social insect colony. Because workers in insect societies usually control male larval development, ergatoid male production under normal conditions probably reflects the optimal allocation strategy of workers to maximise their inclusive fitness. © 2007 Schrempf et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Antarctic krill Euphausia superba are key to most Antarctic ecosystems, particularly at South Georgia, where penguins and seals rely on them for their breeding success each summer. Changes in krill behaviour and local-scale distribution during this time can have large consequences for these predators; however, we currently have little understanding of the behaviour of Antarctic krill in response to changing conditions of predation and food. We used a stochastic dynamic programming model to investigate the behaviour of krill within a region close to South Georgia that is known to be heavily foraged by penguins and seals. In the model, krill responded to changing conditions by adjusting their depth, density of swarm and swimming behaviour. We have shown the optimal behaviour of krill in 3 biologically distinct regions: the on-shelf region, shelf-break region and off-shelf region. We predict significantly higher concentrations of krill will result at the shelf-break region from krill choosing to swim slower and turn more often in a favourable zone. In addition, we predict a diel pattern in swarm density in most conditions of the model, with small krill generally forming lower density swarms than large krill, particularly on-shelf. This work is the first prediction of the effects of krill swarming and swimming behaviour on local-scale distribution. © Inter-Research 2007.},

abstract={Decision makers who minimize costly errors should flexibly adjust the way they trade off competing demands, depending on their current state. We explore how state (amount of hoarded food) affects willingness to take extra predation risk to obtain larger food rewards, particularly in animals that may overemphasize safety. Assuming a sigmoid fitness function, we explore how a supplement in state influences this willingness trade danger for food energy. Above a threshold, the model predicts the supplement will weaken this willingness. Incremental increases in state in the deceleratory phase yield smaller fitness gains, so it pays to increase emphasis on safety after receiving a supplement. Below this threshold, the model makes the opposite prediction because incremental increases in state yield bigger fitness gains and so it pays to decrease emphasis on safety. We use the model to explain why hoarding gray jays (Perisoreus canadensis) were induced by an experimental subsidy to accept greater danger. This formerly puzzling finding makes sense if the jays' effective hoard was relatively small, due to theft and decomposition. We discuss adaptive state-dependent choice as a general explanation for apparently irrational behavior. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Flexible time budgets allow individual animals to buffer the effects of variable food availability by allocating more time to foraging when food density decreases. This trait should be especially important for marine predators that forage on patchy and ephemeral food resources. We examined flexible time allocation by a long-lived marine predator, the Common Murre (Uria aalge), using data collected in a five-year study at three colonies in Alaska (USA) with contrasting environmental conditions. Annual hydroacoustic surveys revealed an order-of-magnitude variation in food density among the 15 colony-years of study. We used data on parental time budgets and local prey density to test predictions from two hypotheses: Hypothesis A, the colony attendance of seabirds varies nonlinearly with food density; and Hypothesis B, flexible time allocation of parent murres buffers chicks against variable food availability. Hypothesis A was supported; colony attendance by murres was positively correlated with food over a limited range of poor-to-moderate food densities, but independent of food over a broader range of higher densities. This is the first empirical evidence for a nonlinear response of a marine predator's time budget to changes in prey density. Predictions from Hypothesis B were largely supported: (1) chick-feeding rates were fairly constant over a wide range of densities and only dropped below 3.5 meals per day at the low end of prey density, and (2) there was a nonlinear relationship between chick-feeding rates and time spent at the colony, with chick-feeding rates only declining after time at the colony by the nonbrooding parent was reduced to a minimum. The ability of parents to adjust their foraging time by more than 2 h/d explains why they were able to maintain chick-feeding rates of more than 3.5 meals/d across a 10-fold range in local food density. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={I examined the role of vision in social foraging by contrasting group size, vigilance, spacing, aggression and habitat use between day and night in many species of birds and mammals. The literature review revealed that the rate of predation/disturbance was often reduced at night while food was considered more available. Social foraging at night was prevalent in many species suggesting that low light levels at night are not sufficient to prevent the formation and cohesion of animal groups. Group sizes were similar or larger at night than during the day in more than half the bird populations and in the majority of mammal populations. Factors such as calls, feeding noises or smells may contribute to the formation and cohesion of groups at night. Larger numbers of foragers at night may also facilitate the aggregation of more foragers. Vigilance levels were usually lower at night perhaps as a response to the lower predation risk or to the decreased value of scanning for predators that are difficult to locate. Low light levels may also make visual cues that promote aggression less conspicuous, which may be a factor in the lower levels of aggression documented at night. Spacing varied as a function of time of day in response to changes in foraging mode or food availability. Habitats that are avoided during the day were often used at night. Foraging at night presents birds and mammals with a new set of constraints that influence group size, time budgeting and habitat use. © 2007 Cambridge Philosophical Society.},

abstract={If changes in animal behavior resulting from direct human disturbance negatively affect the persistence of a given species or population, then these behavioral changes must necessarily lead to reduced demographic performance. We tested for the effects of human disturbance on Olympic marmots (Marmota olympus), a large ground-dwelling squirrel that has disappeared from several areas where recreation levels are high. We assessed the degree to which antipredator and foraging behavior and demographic rates (survival and reproduction) differed between sites with high recreation levels (high use) and those with little or no recreation (low use). Compared with the marmots at low-use sites, marmots at high-use sites displayed significantly reduced responses to human approach, which could be construed as successful accommodation of disturbance or as a decrease in predator awareness. The marmots at high-use sites also looked up more often while foraging, which suggests an increased wariness. Marmots at both types of sites had comparable reproductive and survival rates and were in similar body condition. Until now, the supposition that marmots can adjust their behavior to avoid negative demographic consequences when confronted with heavy tourism has been based on potentially ambiguous behavioral data. Our results support this hypothesis in the case of Olympic marmots and demonstrate the importance of considering demographic data when evaluating the impacts of recreation on animal populations. © 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={Although disordered eating behaviors and obligatory exercise are relatively common among undergraduate females, many questions about their etiology remain unanswered. In the current study, structural equation modeling was used to investigate whether a model of personality, exercise attitudes, and exercise behavior that was previously developed with a clinical sample [Davis, C., Katzman, D.K., & Kirsh, C. (1999). Compulsive physical activity in adolescents with anorexia nervosa: A psychobehavioral spiral of pathology. The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 187, 336-342.] would also fit for a sample of non-clinical college females (n = 599). Further, a second model extended the first model to predict exercise behavior and eating/weight restriction. Results indicated that the original structural model fit the non-clinical sample extremely well. Specifically, addictiveness and obsessive-compulsiveness were associated with obligatory attitudes toward exercise, which was then associated with exercise behavior. In the second model, obligatory attitudes toward exercise were equally associated with eating/weight restriction as it was with exercise behavior. In a third model, bootstrapping analyses demonstrated that while obligatory exercise was directly associated with eating and weight restriction, this association was partially mediated by weight-related reasons for exercise. These data suggest that the aforementioned variables are predictive of obligatory exercise and eating pathology in non-clinical samples, and that reasons for exercise is important in understanding the complex relations among disordered eating and exercise attitudes and behaviors. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The complex interplay between neural and endocrine responses following food intake regulates ingestive behaviour and ultimately determines subsequent energy intake. These processes include cognitive, gastrointestinal-derived and metabolic mechanisms. Such physiological responses to the ingestion of food initiate short- to medium-term inhibition of intake (satiety). However, in clinical states in which systemic inflammation is evident there is a more profound satiety response and a clear absence of motivation to eat that is evident as loss of appetite. These negative influences on energy intake can contribute to poor nutritional status, and consequently poor physical function, and impact on rehabilitation and recovery. Cytokine mediators of the inflammatory response directly influence feeding behaviour at the hypothalamic nuclei and may explain the lack of motivation and desire for food. However, additional detrimental effects on appetite are brought about because of alterations in intermediary metabolism present in inflammation-induced catabolism. This process forms part of the host response to inflammation and may explain symptoms, such as early satiety, frequently reported in many patient groups. In clinical states, and cancer in particular, pharmacological strategies have been employed to ameliorate the inflammatory response in an attempt to improve energy intake. Some success of this approach has been reported following administration of substrates such as EPA. Novel strategies to improve intake through administration of anti-cytokine drugs such as thalidomide may also be of benefit. However, drugs that oppose the actions of neurotransmitter pathways involved in central induction of satiety, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine, have failed to improve intake but appear to enhance enjoyment of food. Such findings indicate that therapeutic nutritional targets can only be achieved where novel pharmacological therapies can be supported by more innovative and integrated dietary management strategies. Many of these strategies remain to be elucidated. © 2007 The Authors.},

abstract={The authors examined automatic emotional reactions to smoking cues among 35 smokers and 25 nonsmokers (32 women and 28 men), using a novel implicit measure, the Affect Misattribution Procedure. Associative-learning theories of addiction suggest that smokers develop positive responses to cues linked to the rewarding effects of nicotine. Prior research, however, has yielded mixed evidence for whether smokers have favorable or unfavorable automatic responses to smoking cues. These findings may depend on the methods used to measure implicit responses. Using the Affect Misattribution Procedure, the authors found that nonsmokers responded to smoking cues with clear negative affect, whereas smokers' responses depended on individual differences in current smoking withdrawal. Smokers having withdrawal symptoms and those most motivated to smoke showed favorable emotional responses to smoking cues, but those with no withdrawal or low motivation to smoke showed negative responses. These results help integrate previous studies finding that smokers have negative automatic responses to cigarettes with those studies finding that smokers' responses were relatively positive. The results are important for theories that emphasize the role of cue conditioning in maintaining addiction because these theories assume, consistent with the current findings, that smoking cues can take on positive reward value. © 2007 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Background. In honeybees, differential feeding of female larvae promotes the occurrence of two different phenotypes, a queen and a worker, from identical genotypes, through incremental alterations, which affect general growth, and character state alterations that result in the presence or absence of specific structures. Although previous studies revealed a link between incremental alterations and differential expression of physiometabolic genes, the molecular changes accompanying character state alterations remain unknown. Results. By using cDNA microarray analyses of >6,000 Apis mellifera ESTs, we found 240 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between developing queens and workers. Many genes recorded as up-regulated in prospective workers appear to be unique to A. mellifera, suggesting that the workers' developmental pathway involves the participation of novel genes. Workers up-regulate more developmental genes than queens, whereas queens up-regulate a greater proportion of physiometabolic genes, including genes coding for metabolic enzymes and genes whose products are known to regulate the rate of mass-transforming processes and the general growth of the organism (e.g., tor). Many DEGs are likely to be involved in processes favoring the development of caste-biased structures, like brain, legs and ovaries, as well as genes that code for cytoskeleton constituents. Treatment of developing worker larvae with juvenile hormone (JH) revealed 52 JH responsive genes, specifically during the critical period of caste development. Using Gibbs sampling and Expectation Maximization algorithms, we discovered eight overrepresented cis-elements from four gene groups. Graph theory and complex networks concepts were adopted to attain powerful graphical representations of the interrelation between cis-elements and genes and objectively quantify the degree of relationship between these entities. Conclusion. We suggest that clusters of functionally related DEGs are co-regulated during caste development in honeybees. This network of interactions is activated by nutrition-driven stimuli in early larval stages. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that JH is a key component of the developmental determination of queen-like characters. Finally, we propose a conceptual model of caste differentiation in A. mellifera based on gene-regulatory networks. © 2007 Barchuk et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Breastfeeding behaviour is multifactorial, and a wide range of socio-cultural and physiological variables impact on a woman's decision and ability to breastfeed successfully. An association has been reported between maternal obesity and low breastfeeding rates. This is of public health concern because obesity is rising in women of reproductive age and the apparent association with increased artificial feeding will lead to a greater risk of obesity in children. The aim of this paper is to examine the relationship between maternal overweight and obesity and breastfeeding intention and initiation and duration. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in January and February 2007, using the following databases: Medline, CINAHL and the Australian Breastfeeding Association's Lactation Resource Centre. Studies which have examined maternal obesity and infant feeding intention, initiation, duration and delayed onset of lactation were tabulated and summarised. Results: Studies have found that obese women plan to breastfeed for a shorter period than normal weight women and are less likely to initiate breastfeeding. Of the four studies that examined onset of lactation, three reported a significant relationship between obesity and delayed lactogenesis. Fifteen studies, conducted in the USA, Australia, Denmark, Kuwait and Russia, have examined maternal obesity and duration of breastfeeding. The majority of large studies found that obese women breastfed for a shorter duration than normal weight women, even after adjusting for possible confounding factors. Conclusion: There is evidence from epidemiological studies that overweight and obese women are less likely to breastfeed than normal weight women. The reasons may be biological or they may be psychological, behavioral and/or cultural. We urgently need qualitative studies from women's perspective to help us understand women in this situation and their infant feeding decisions and behaviour. © 2007 Amir and Donath; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Arctic Cervids face considerable challenges in sustaining life in a harsh and highly seasonal environment, and when to forage is a key component of the survival strategy. We predict that a cervid maximizes net intake of energy to change the duration of feeding-ruminating cycles depending on season, and pays no attention to light or other activity-entraining cues. Still, in periods of bad weather it may pay energetically to reduce exposure and heat loss. We investigated environmental impact on the seasonal and daily activity pattern of a food-limited, predator-free arctic deer, the Svalbard reindeer. We found that the reindeer indeed had season-dependent feeding-rumination intervals, with no distinct peaks in activity at sunrise and sunset, as would be expected if animals maximize energy intake rates in predator-free environments. However, they temporarily reduced activity when exposed to low temperature and increased precipitation during winter, possibly to conserve energy. We provide insight into the behavioural strategy of Svalbard reindeer which enables them to cope with such an extreme environment. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Obesity is the more frequent metabolic disease in developed countries. With the increase of the amount and variety of available food, obesity has become an epidemic. Environmental and social factors determine the consumption habits, the preference of a particular kind of food and the perception of it. Physical and chemical characteristics of food influence the brain areas that control appetite stimulating hungry or satiety behaviours and interactions of these brain areas with cognitive neuronal networks. It is known the role of many peptides in the gastrointestinal function regulation. And, furthermore, there is evidence of its influence on feeding behaviour. Plentiful of signals act on the neurological areas that regulate intake and, in addition, they modify the physical and psychological status of the individuals. There is a relationship between obesity, social influences and psychological alterations that reflects the specific association of anthropometrics, personality disabilities, hormones and metabolism. The neuronal mechanisms in control of hedonistic and addictive components of intake are starting to be understood. This review analyses a multifactor model for obesity causality and remarks the psychological and behavioural knowledge.},

abstract={In the present study, the multidimensional Trait and State Food Cravings Questionnaires (FCQ-T and FCQ-S), as developed by Cepeda-Benito, Gleaves, Williams, and Erath, [2000. The development and validation of the State and Trait Food Cravings Questionnaires. Behavior Therapy, 31, 151-173], were modified in order to construct an index of general food craving instead of specific food craving. The factor structure, validity and reliability of the modified questionnaires, renamed as the Trait and State General Food Cravings Questionnaires (G-FCQ-T and G-FCQ-S), were investigated in three separate studies. Firstly, exploratory factor analyses were conducted, which yielded a G-FCQ-T with a four-factor structure, that was considerably shorter as compared to the original (nine-factor) FCQ-T, and a G-FCQ-S of which the factor structure was highly comparable to the original FCQ-S. Secondly, in an attempt to replicate the factor structures of the G-FCQ-T and the G-FCQ-S as found in Study 1, confirmative factor analyses were performed. Results indicated adequate fits for both questionnaires. In addition, the test-retest reliability of both versions was satisfactory and an analysis of the construct validity generally revealed the expected results. In Study 3, the validity of the state version of the G-FCQ was further investigated by relating scores on this questionnaire to indices of food deprivation and satiation. Results indicated that the G-FCQ-S indeed measures food craving as a variable state, which is influenced by situational and temporal variables. Altogether, it can be concluded that the G-FCQ-T and G-FCQ-S are both reliable and valid measures of general trait-like and state-dependent food craving. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Recent studies have pointed to olfactory system beta oscillations of the local field potential (15-30 Hz) and their roles both in learning and as specific responses to predator odors. To describe odorant physical properties, resultant behavioral responses and changes in the central olfactory system that may induce these oscillations without associative learning, we tested rats with 26 monomolecular odorants spanning 6 log units of theoretical vapor pressure (estimate of relative vapor phase concentration) and 10 different odor mixtures. We found odorant vapor phase concentration to be inversely correlated with investigation time on the first presentation, after which investigation times were brief and not different across odorants. Analysis of local field potentials from the olfactory bulb and anterior piriform cortex shows that beta oscillations in waking rats occur specifically in response to the class of volatile organic compounds with vapor pressures of 1-120 mmHg. Beta oscillations develop over the first three to four presentations and are weakly present for some odorants in anesthetized rats. Gamma oscillations show a smaller effect that is not restricted to the same range of odorants. Olfactory bulb theta oscillations were also examined as a measure of effective afferent input strength, and the power of these oscillations did not vary systematically with vapor pressure, suggesting that it is not olfactory bulb drive strength that determines the presence of beta oscillations. Theta band coherence analysis shows that coupling strength between the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex increases linearly with vapor phase concentration, which may facilitate beta oscillations above a threshold.

abstract={Allocation of resources into the development of sexual displays is determined by a trade-off between the competing demands of current reproduction and self-maintenance. When reproduction overlaps with acquisition of sexual ornamentation, such as in birds with a yearly post-breeding moult, such a trade-off can be expressed in elaboration of sexual traits used in subsequent matings. In turn, selection for elaboration of sexual ornaments should favour resolution of this trade-off through a modification of the ornaments' development, resulting in variable and life history-dependent development of sexual displays. Here we examined a novel hypothesis that the trade-off between current reproduction and development of sexual ornamentation in the house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus) can be mediated by the shared effects of prolactin - a pituitary hormone that regulates both parental care and moult in this species. We compared developmental variation in sexual ornamentation between breeding, nonbreeding, and juvenile males and examined the relative contribution of residual levels of prolactin and individual condition during moult to the acquisition of sexual ornamentation. Males that invested heavily in parental care entered post-breeding moult in lower condition and later in the season, but their higher plasma prolactin was associated with shorter and more intense moult ultimately resulting in equal or greater elaboration of sexual ornamentation compared with nonparental males. Elaboration of sexual ornamentation of nonparental males that entered moult in greater condition, but with lower prolactin, was produced by longer and earlier moult and by lesser overlap in moult between sexual ornaments. Ornamentation of juvenile males that acquire sexual ornamentation for the first time was closely associated with physiological condition during moult. We discuss the implications of such context-dependent ontogenies of sexual ornamentation and resulting differences in condition-dependence of sexual traits across life history stages on the evolution of female preference for elaborated sexual displays. © 2007 The Authors.},

abstract={Background: Adolescence is a period of elevated alcohol consumption in humans as well as in animal models. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that adolescent Sprague-Dawley rats consume approximately 2 times more ethanol on a gram per kilogram basis than adult animals in a 2-bottle choice free-access situation. The purpose of the present study was to examine the time course and pattern of elevated ethanol intake during adolescence and the adolescent-to-adult transition, contrast this intake with ontogenetic patterns of food and water intake, and determine whether adolescent access to ethanol elevates voluntary consumption of ethanol in adulthood. Methods: Adolescent [postnatal day (P)27-28] and adult (P69-70) male Sprague-Dawley rats were singly housed with continuous access to both water and 1 of 3 experimental solutions in ball-bearing-containing sipper tubes: unsweetened ethanol (10% v/v), sweetened ethanol (10% v/v+0.1% w/v saccharin), and saccharin alone (0.1% w/v). Results: Ethanol consumption plateaued at approximately 7.5 g/kg/d during the first 2 weeks of measurement (i.e., P28-39) in early adolescence, before declining sharply at approximately P40 to levels that were only modestly elevated compared with adult-typical consumption patterns that were reached by approximately P70. In contrast, intake of food and total calories showed a more gradual decline into adulthood with no distinguishable plateaus in early adolescence. When adolescent-initiated and adult-initiated animals were tested at the same chronological age in adulthood, animals drank similar amounts regardless of the age at which they were first given voluntary access to ethanol. Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggest that the elevated ethanol intake characteristic of early-to-mid adolescence is not simply a function of adolescent-typical hyperphagia or hyperdipsia, but instead may reflect age-related differences in neural substrates contributing to the rewarding or aversive effects of ethanol, as well as possible modulatory influences of ontogenetic differences in sensitivity to novelty or in ethanol pharmacokinetics. Voluntary home cage consumption of ethanol during adolescence, however, was not found to subsequently elevate ethanol drinking in adulthood. Copyright © 2007 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.},

abstract={Competition is predicted to affect the expression of inducible defenses, but because costs of behavioral and morphological antipredator defenses differ along resource gradients, its effects on defenses may depend on the traits considered. We tested the predictions from different defense models in tadpoles of the common frog Rana temporaria, which exhibit both types of defenses. In an outdoor experiment, we exposed the tadpoles to nonlethal predators (Aeshna dragonfly larvae) and to a gradient of intraspecific competition. Morphological responses did not follow any of the expected patterns, since investment in defense was not affected by resource level. Instead, tail depth decreased in the absence of predators. Behavioral defenses followed a state-dependent model. Overall, the defense strategy of the tadpoles revealed a shift from morphological and behavioral defenses at low tadpole density to morphological defense only at high density. This difference probably reflects the different efficiency of the defenses. Hiding is an effective means of defense, but it is unsustainable when resources are scarce. Morphological responses become more important with increasing density to compensate for the increase in behavioral risk-taking. Our results indicate that competition can strongly affect reaction norms of inducible defenses and highlight the importance of integrating ecological parameters that affect the cost-benefit balance of phenotypic plasticity. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Objective: To describe menstrual disturbance in eating disorders (ED). Method: We describe menstrual history in 1,705 women and compare eating, weight, and psychopathological traits across menstrual groups. Results: Menstrual dysfunction occurred across all eating disorder subtypes. Individuals with normal menstrual history and primary amenorrhea reported the highest and lowest lifetime body mass index (BMI), respectively. Normal menstruation and oligomenorrhea groups reported greater binge eating, vomiting, and appetite suppressant use. Amenorrhea was associated with lower caloric intake and higher exercise. Harm avoidance, novelty seeking, perfectionism, and obsessionality discriminated among menstrual status groups. No differences in comorbid Axis I and II disorders were observed. Conclusion: Menstrual dysfunction is not limited to any eating disorder subtype. BMI, caloric intake, and exercise were strongly associated with menstrual function. Menstrual status is not associated with comorbidity. Menstrual irregularity is an associated feature of all ED rather than being restricted to AN only. © 2007 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Obesity is frequently associated with consumption of high amounts of sugar and/or fat. Studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of overweight and obesity associated or not with increase rates of psychiatry disorders, in particular mood and anxiety disorders. Recent works have demonstrated an association between specific genes involved in oxidative stress metabolism and anxiety-like behavior. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a highly palatable diet enriched with sucrose in body fat mass composition, anxiety behavior and brain oxidative status. Twenty male Wistar rats received two different diets during four months: standard chow (SC) and highly palatable (HP). Metabolic parameters, behavioral tests and oxidative stress status were evaluated. Body fat mass, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance were altered in the HP group (p < 0.01). The same group spends less time in light compartment and had a lower risk assessment behavior (p < 0.05) but no differences were observed in the open field test habituation (p > 0.05). Protein degradation, DCF and TBARS levels were not different in the hippocampus between groups; however, there were higher levels of protein degration in frontal cortex of HP groups (p < 0.05), although DCF and TBARS levels don't differ from the SC group (p > 0.05). In conclusion, our data suggest that the consumption of HP diet leads to an obese phenotype, increases protein oxidation in frontal cortex and appears to induce anxiety-like behavior in rats. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Food availability can strongly affect predator-prey dynamics. When change in habitat condition reduces the availability of one prey type, predators often search for other prey, perhaps in a different habitat. Interactions between behavioural and morphological traits of different prey may influence foraging success of visual predators through trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs), such as prey activity and body coloration. We tested the hypothesis that foraging success of stream-dwelling cutthroat trout (Onchorhyncus clarki) on cryptically coloured, less-active benthic prey (larval mayfly; Paraleptophebia sp.) can be enhanced by the presence of distinctly coloured, active prey (larval stonefly shredder; Despaxia augusta). Cutthroat trout preyed on benthic insects when drifting invertebrates were unavailable. When stonefly larvae were present, the trout ate most of the stoneflies and also consumed a higher proportion of mayflies than under mayfly only treatment. The putative mechanism is that active stonefly larvae supplied visual cues to the predator that alerted trout to the mayfly larvae. Foraging success of visual predators on cryptic prey can be enhanced by distinctly coloured, active benthic taxa through unidirectional facilitation to the predators, which is a functional change of interspecific interaction caused by a third species. This study suggests that prey-predator facilitation through TMIIs can modify species interactions, affecting community dynamics. © 2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract={The use of bright coloration to warn predators of toxic prey, termed aposematism, is a defensive strategy well studied in terrestrial ecosystems. Some marine animals have contrasting color patterns and chemical defenses but few studies have tested the behavior of marine predators in response to aposematic coloration. In this study we tested fish feeding behavior in response to different types of cues including contrasting color patterns and sponge and nudibranch chemical extracts in the field at 2 reefs on Guam. Using agar-based food to keep food quality consistent, chemical extracts and 2 out of 5 contrasting color patterns reduced feeding by natural assemblages of reef fish at both reefs. Phyllidia varicosa (from Palau), P. elegans (Guam) and Phyllidiella pustulosa (Palau) crude extracts deterred feeding by fish, but P. pustulosa extracts from Guam did not. To determine if a chemical extract can act as an olfactory defense we videotaped fish behavior as they approached food containing nonpolar extracts of Acanthella cavernosa, the dietary sponge of Phyllidiella granulates. Fish approached and then tasted the food with the chemical extract significantly less often than the control and the crude extract of another sponge Stylissa massa. In feeding assays with a contrasting color pattern combined with the chemical extract at natural concentrations, fish were deterred by the extract regardless of the color pattern. At half natural concentration only the chemical extract and the contrasting color pattern together significantly decreased fish feeding. Reef fish can use multi-modal signals including visual, taste and olfactory cues to avoid marine benthic invertebrates. © Inter-Research 2007.},

abstract={In newborns, hypoxia elicits defensive behaviors including awakening from sleep, body movements and crying. An inability to produce this defense response is a risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome and other respiratory control disorders. In this study, we examined the possibility that the defense response to hypoxia in newborns is partly determined by early exposure to hypoxia. We explored this possibility in 6-day-old mice, which resemble human preterm infants of approximately 25-30 weeks' gestational age. Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) were recorded as a marker for the defense response to hypoxia. In a conditioning experiment, newborn mice were exposed to two artificial odors (conditioned stimuli, CS). For acquisition (two trials), pups were exposed to one odor (CS+) in a hypoxic gas mixture (10% O2, which was the unconditioned stimulus, US) and to another odor (CS-) in air. Then, the pups were exposed to each odor while breathing air. Newborn mice produced significantly more USVs when exposed to the odor previously paired with hypoxia than to the control odor. Thus, associative learning may shape the defense response to hypoxia in newborns. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={As adult humans, we are continuously faced with decisions in which proper weighing of the risk involved is critical. Excessively risky or overly cautious decision making can both have disastrous real-world consequences. Weighing of risks and benefits toward decision making involves a complex neural network that includes the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), but its role remains unclear. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation studies have shown that disruption of the DLPFC increases risk-taking behavior. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) allows upregulation of activity in the DLPFC, and we predicted that it might promote more cautious decision making. Healthy participants received one of the following treatments while they performed the Balloon Analog Risk Task: (1) right anodal/left cathodal DLPFC tDCS, (2) left anodal/ right cathodal DLPFC tDCS, or (3) sham tDCS. This experiment revealed that participants receiving either one of the bilateral DLPFC tDCS strategies adopted a risk-averse response style. In a control experiment, we tested whether unilateral DLPFC stimulation (anodal tDCS over the right or left DLPFC with the cathodal electrode over the contralateral supraorbital area) was sufficient to decrease risk-taking behaviors. This experiment showed no difference in decision-making behaviors between the groups of unilateral DLPFC stimulation and sham stimulation. These findings extend the notion that DLPFC activity is critical for adaptive decision making, possibly by suppressing riskier responses. Anodal tDCS over DLPFC by itself did not significantly change risk-taking behaviors; however, when the contralateral DLPFC was modulated with cathodal tCDS, an important decrease in risk taking was observed. Also, the induced cautious decision-making behavior was observed only when activity of both DLPFCs was modulated. The ability to modify risk-taking behavior may be translated into therapeutic interventions for disorders such as drug abuse, overeating, or pathological gambling.

abstract={Animals show specific morphological, physiological and behavioural adaptations to diurnal or nocturnal activity. Cathemeral species, i.e. animals with activities distributed over the 24-h period, have to compromise between these specific adaptations. The driving evolutionary forces and the proximate costs and benefits of cathemerality are still poorly understood. Our goal was to evaluate the role of predator avoidance, food availability and diet quality in shaping cathemeral activity of arboreal mammals using a lemur species as an example. For this, two groups of collared lemurs, Eulemur collaris, were studied for 14 months in the littoral forest of southeastern Madagascar. Data on feeding behaviour were collected during all-day and all-night follows by direct observation. A phenological transect containing 78 plant species was established and monitored every 2 weeks to evaluate food availability during the study period. Characteristics of food items and animal nutritional intake were determined via biochemical analyses. The ratio of diurnal to nocturnal feeding was used as response variable in the analyses. The effects of abiotic environmental variables were removed statistically before the analyses of the biotic variables. We found that diurnal feeding lasted longer during the hot-wet season (December-February), whereas nocturnal feeding peaked during the hot-dry and cool-wet seasons (March-August). Although the lemurs foraged mostly in lower forest strata during daylight and used emergent trees preferably at night, the variables which measured animal exposure to birds of prey failed to predict the variation of the ratio of diurnal/nocturnal feeding. Ripe fruit availability and fiber intake are the two variables which best predicted the annual variation of the lemur diurnality. The data indicate that feeding over the whole 24-h cycle is advantageous during lean periods when animals have a fibre-rich, low-quality diet. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={In this review we evaluate whether universal behavioral and metabolic mechanisms exist, which permit marine proto- and metazooplankton to persist in continuously food-limited environments such as the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and other oligotrophic ocean systems. We re-visit the issue of what processes account for low steady-state abundance of the dominant groups of planktonic grazers: phagotrophic protists and copepods, by examining evidence for the four processes proposed by Strom et al. (2000): grazing thresholds, behavioral response to prey patchiness, top-down control of grazers, and mixotrophy (combination of photosynthesis and phagotrophy in protists) and/or omnivory (switching between alternate prey types). Published observations reveal that grazing thresholds, below which feeders reduce their feeding efforts and, with that, their metabolic expenditures, do exist. There are also studies suggesting that both protistan and small metazoan plankton feeders may take advantage of patchiness of food particles and are frequently mixotrophic and/or omnivorous. Predator patchiness in response to prey patches may facilitate top-down control of grazers. Finally, we discuss processes, which may lead to low quasi steady-state abundances of food particles and feeders. © 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Prolonged high-fat diets have been shown to affect an organism's stress responsiveness at the neuroendocrine level. In the present study, the authors used a 7-day protocol of fat administration in adult rats of both sexes to investigate the early behavioral impact of a moderately fat (20%) diet, often used by Western societies, on rats' reaction to acute stress and novelty. Their results show that this diet can reduce the rats' active behavioral responses to subsequent stressors and influence their corticosterone secretion. Fat-fed male rats adopted a less active behavior to cope with forced swimming stress, whereas their exploratory behavior in the open field environment was rather increased compared with chow-fed males. Fat-fed female rats exhibited a less active behavioral response to both stress paradigms compared with their chow-fed counterparts. Fat diet abolished facilitation in corticosterone secretion following a subsequent stressor in both sexes. However, only in males did fat diet exaggerate corticosterone response to novelty, irrespective of the previous stress history of the rat. These data indicate that a short-term metabolic stress can modify the rats' stress coping strategy in interaction with the gender. © 2007 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Both sexes of the turquoise-browed motmot, Eumomota superciliosa, display their long-racketed tail in an exaggerated side-to-side wag display in two contexts. In the first, the wag display is performed in the presence of predators (predator-elicited wag display), and evidence supports the hypothesis that the signal functions as a pursuit-deterrent signal (Murphy 2006, Behavioral Ecology, 17, 547-553). In the second, the wag display is performed in the apparent absence of predators immediately before feeding nestlings (prefeeding wag display). I tested four hypotheses on the adaptive significance of the prefeeding wag display: (1) a dishonest, preemptive, pursuit-deterrent signal given in case predators are present; (2) a nonfunctional misfire of the predator-elicited wag display; (3) a signal that alerts nestlings to the delivery of food; (4) a sexually selected signal that advertises parental quality to potential mates. There was no support for the hypotheses that the prefeeding wag display was directed to nestlings or potential mates. The wag display was generally performed where nestlings could not detect the signal and the display did not vary with the sex of the displaying bird, the presence of the mate, or the size of the food carried in the signaller's bill. Evidence presented in this paper is most consistent with the hypothesis that the predator-elicited wag display and the prefeeding wag display are performed as a response to the presence or the potential presence of a predator. I discuss the possibility that the prefeeding wag display functions as a dishonest, pursuit-deterrent signal. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={A large number of studies investigated the link between psychosocial risk factors and atherosclerosis or cardiac events. They found that emotional factors and chronic stressors strongly influence the course of coronary artery disease, by promoting the same pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for atherosclerosis. Thus, cardiologists often find in cardiac practice patients that presents psychosocial risk factors, needing the development of interventions aimed to management of these factors. Some of these interventions are the same that are traditionally used in clinical practice, such as exercise training and nutritional counselling, while others are more specific, and require the presence of psychologists (behavioral strategies, relaxation training, social support, etc.). Behavioral cardiology is an emerging field of clinical practice based on the recognition that psychosocial risk factors can promote atherosclerosis and adverse cardiac events. It requires the development of practical solutions aimed at the management of adverse lifestyle behaviours, emotional factors, and chronic stress.},

abstract={Personality traits seem to have an important role in the development, clinical expression, course, and treatment response in eating disorders (EDs). We investigated the effects of an inpatient cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) on the measures of temperament and character (Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI)) in 149 consecutive patients with EDs. Baseline assessment included anthropometry, the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the TCI. Treatment was based on the transdiagnostic cognitive behavior theory and treatment of ED, adapted for an inpatient setting. Treatment effects were tested by paired ANOVA, adjusted for covariates. No effects were found on Novelty Seeking, Reward Dependence, and Cooperativeness. Harm Avoidance (F=18.17, p<0.001), Persistence (F=7.71, p=0.006), Self-Directedness (F=27.55, p<0.001), and Self Transcendence (F=16.38, p<0.001) significantly changed after treatment. Changes in TCI scores were wholly dependent on the changes in BDI and EDE, and independent of ED diagnosis and behavior and of BMI changes. We conclude that in ED, a few scales of both temperament and character are significantly modified by CBT, in relation to changes in psychopathology and depression, independently of nutrition. These results are relevant for future studies based on TCI. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={It is well recognized that investigation into the relationship between early life programming and subsequent neurological disorders may have powerful implications for understanding the human vulnerability to psychopathology. The present article will propose that schizophrenia may be adaptively programmed by early environmental adversity permitting physiological and behavioral characteristics that would have created a fitness advantage in the ancestral environment under conditions of nutritional scarcity and severe environmental stress. This proposition will be analyzed in terms of phenotypic plasticity theory which explains how and why specific environmental stressors can alter normal gene expression resulting in an alternative phenotype that is better suited for an adverse environment. The primary neurophysiological symptoms of schizophrenia can be induced in animals through exposure to prenatal and postnatal stressors, and that schizophrenia itself is known to be associated with exposure to stress during development, supports the view that the "disorder" may represent a predictive, adaptive response to adversity. In fact, maternal malnutrition, maternal stress, multiparity, short birth interval and stress provoking postnatal events are well recognized epidemiological risk factors for schizophrenia that may represent cues for the initiation of epigenetic programming. Behavioral and physiological characteristics of schizophrenia will be analyzed and interpreted as protective in the context of environmental hardship. For instance, the hypometabolic areas of the schizophrenic brain - the hippocampus and the frontal lobes - are the same areas that are known to become adaptively hypometabolic in response to starvation, stress and variations in ecological rigor in birds and mammals. Individuals with schizophrenia are also highly genetically inclined to develop the metabolic syndrome, which is widely thought to allow developmentally deprived mammals to conserve energy under poor circumstances. It is well known that schizophrenia features an up-regulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and an exaggerated stress response - both alterations thought to represent predictive, adaptive responses to stress in mammals - which may have increased attentiveness to the environment and created a defensive, vigilance-based behavioral strategy. The habituation deficits characteristic of schizophrenia - which can be induced in other mammals through stress - may represent a cognitive strategy that alerts the organism to salient, potentially informative stimuli and that permits it to be more impulsive and vigilant. Inability to calm instinctual drives, ignore arousing stimuli, and inhibit transient desires are all core characteristics of the disorder, which predict social and vocational disabilities in modern times, but may have amounted to a robust, selfish strategy in prehistoric times. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={People with serious mental illnesses have higher rates of morbidity and premature mortality compared with the general population. This population loses from 13 to over 20 years of life compared with their nonpsychiatric cohorts. A multitude of factors contribute to this silent tragedy. A major problem is that multiple barriers exist, making it difficult for individuals with serious mental illness to access quality health care. Additionally, compared with the average American, people with serious mental illness are more likely to engage in unhealthy lifestyle practices, such as lack of regular physical activity, poor nutrition and overeating, smoking and other substance abuse, irregular and inadequate sleep, and failure to visit health care practitioners regularly. These unhealthy behaviors and the added burden of antipsychotic medication side effects increase the risk for cardiac and metabolic diseases. However, best-practice models exist that provide the knowledge and tools to assist people with serious mental illness in making informed decisions about healthier lifestyle behaviors, including addressing tobacco use and excess weight. The challenge is how to integrate these practices effectively into routine behavioral health care. The growing problem of premature death calls for urgent public action to transform the current mental health care system into a more integrated system of care. Because of their holistic training and approach to care, nurses are well prepared to work collaboratively with both mental and physical health care providers and systems. In the new mental health care system, both psychiatric and physical health care providers will need to broaden their treatment paradigm to address the whole person. An integral part of behavioral health services will be to ensure that the health status of all individuals is assessed, that there are medical monitoring protocols in place for people taking antipsychotic medication, that each individual has a primary care provider, and that there is an effective mechanism in place for communication between behavioral health and primary care providers. A transformation of the existing mental health care system toward a system that utilizes a coordinated, multidisciplinary, holistic approach not only may effectively bridge the existing gap between mental and physical health, but also may ultimately save lives.},

abstract={This study investigates state-dependent learning employing atropine. The reaction of rats to (1) the presentation of novel stimuli, (2) habituation to intermittent presentations of the same stimulus at the same local, (3) spatial change at the site of stimulus presentation, and (4) a visual stimulus change, was investigated in the straight alleyway test, controlling for the possible development of behavioral and/or pharmacological tolerance. Our findings reveal that rats habituated to stimulus presentation at a specific location, when under an atropine effect, do react to stimulus presentation at another location, or to a different stimulus, when under an atropine effect, indicating that this drug does not interfere with the acquisition of spatial or visual information. Differently, however, rats habituated to stimulus presentation at a specific location in the absence of an atropine effect are unable to react to spatial change when under the atropine effect, but do react to a visual stimulus change. This suggests that atropine interferes either with the retrieval of previously acquired spatial information or with the comparison of previously acquired spatial information with current information, but does not interfere with visual recognition. These findings reveal that atropine interferes with the use of spatial information acquired in the absence of a drug effect. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Larvae of the salt marsh moth Estigmene acrea (Dru.) feed on a variety of herbaceous plants including some that contain secondary plant substances called pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). The salt marsh moth uses PAs in defense against predators and parasites and as pheromone precursors while non-PA plants are used for general nutrition. This study focuses on the development of their androconial organs, coremata, and on the role of pyrrolizidine alkaloids as morphogens stimulating corematal growth. During the pupal period, the development of the coremata can be divided into five discrete stages. Dietary PAs fed to laboratory raised final instar larvae were found to accelerate corematal development in stages four and five, to increase the number of corematal scales and to enhance corematal size compared to larvae without a FA dietary supplement. As part of the developmental process, dietary PAs stimulated the formation of a network of stellate cellular inclusions in the secretory cells at the base of each androconial scale. In addition, dietary PAs shortened the duration of the pupal stage for males but not females. The effects of PAs as morphogens in E. acrea are compared to those for the South Asian arctiines Creatonotus gangis and C. transiens in which the developmental role of PAs was first discovered.},

abstract={Seabirds are important predators in marine ecosystems and are commonly used to monitor the productivity of their marine environments. However, different measures of seabird breeding success differ in their sensitivity to environmental conditions. Here, we present an analysis of provisioning rates and chick growth as well as hatching and fledging success, in thin-billed prions Pachyptila belcheri at New Island, Falkland Islands between 2003 and 2005 and relate these patterns to ocean climate. During the study period, SST were rising within and between breeding seasons and were negatively correlated with provisioning frequencies of thin-billed prions. Chick mass was reduced and begging intensities increased at low feeding frequencies, but overall breeding success and fledging success were not affected, because most chicks in survived to fledging despite poor provisioning rates. Chick numbers and survival therefore may not be sensitive indicators of environmental conditions in all seabird species and ranges of food abundance. Monitoring behavioural buffering mechanisms, such as feeding rates, may be more effective in some ranges of food abundance and time scales and provide an earlier warning of ecological change. As a novel technique, the use of begging intensities as indicator of chick body condition is proposed in species where repeated handling causes disturbance. The present data suggest that begging rates can serve as a non-invasive method to monitor chick condition. © Journal of Avian Biology.},

For example, it is unclear whether predator-induced changes in gastropod shell morphology represent an active physiological response or a by-product of reduced feeding. We address this question by manipulating feeding and growth of intertidal snails, Littorina obtusata, using two approaches: (i) exposure to predation cues from green crabs Carcinus maenas and (ii) reduced food availability, and quantifying growth in shell length, shell mass, and body mass, as well as production of faecal material and shell micro-structural characteristics (mineralogy and organic fraction) after 96 days. We demonstrate that L. obtusata actively increases calcification rate in response to predation threat, and that this response entails energetic and developmental costs. That this induced response is not strictly tied to the animal's behaviour should enhance its evolutionary potential. © 2007 The Authors.},

abstract={Food abundance and distribution have played a central role in the conceptual theory of primate socioecology [Janson, Behaviour 105:53-76, 1988; Isbell, Behavioral Ecology 2:143-155, 1991; Sterck et al., Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 41:291-309, 1997; van Schaik, In: Standen V, Foley RA, editors, Comparative Socioecology. Oxford: Blackwell. p 195-218, 1989]. This theory predicts that agonistic ("contest") competition should occur when food is distributed in discrete, defensible patches; in contrast, when food sources are distributed uniformly or randomly, non-agonistic ("scramble") competition is expected. Primatologists usually measure resource density and patchiness from a botanical perspective, ignoring the biology of the animal being studied. Such an approach may be irrelevant in terms of how animals view the dispersion of resources. Using a novel focal-tree method that measures resource availability on a scale that is both spatially and temporally relevant to the animal under investigation, we take a cost-benefit approach to predict the frequency of food-related agonism in white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus) from 11 ecological and social variables. We retained four variables in the regression model: two representing the opportunity for aggression (i.e., feeding bout length and the number of feeding adult females), and two representing opportunity costs (i.e., fruit abundance and the number of potential feeding sites in the focal tree). The results of this study indicate that the amount of food-related aggression in white-faced capuchins can be predicted by variables representing the costs and benefits of contesting a food resource. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={The ability to change body coloration is widely used in the context of visual camouflage to hide from predators or prey. Although experimental evidence from human vision shows that background and prey eye colours may trigger adaptive colour change in crab spiders, no study has addressed this hypothesis in the perceptual colour space of either predator or prey. I simultaneously tested the effects of reflected light and prey eye colours on background matching of female crab spiders, Misumena vatia. Using spectroradiometric measurements and modelling of perceptual colour space of the most frequent prey, I tested whether individual spiders were able to match white and yellow light reflected by artificial backgrounds when fed either white- or red-eyed fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster. The colour of light reflected by the visual background triggered adaptive camouflage as seen by Hymenopteran prey. In addition, there was a significant effect of prey eye colour within each light colour experiment, with spiders fed white-eyed flies better matching light reflected by the white background, and spiders fed red-eyed flies better matching the yellow reflected light. However, only spiders exposed to yellow reflected light and fed red-eyed flies could approach the colour detection threshold calculated for Hymenoptera. These results provide insights into how colour change is triggered in crab spiders, and indicate that ommochrome pigments ingested with prey eyes not only are used by crab spiders to adjust their adaptive coloration, but also may indicate the hunting ability of females to potential mates. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Predator-generated variation in prey energy intake remains the dominant explanation of adaptive response to predation risk in prey life history, morphology and physiology across a wide range of taxa. This "behavioural hypothesis" suggest that chemical or visual signals of predation risk reduce prey energy intake leading to a life history characterized by a small size and late age at maturity. However, size-selective predation can induce either smaller size-early age or large size-late age life history. The alternative "physiological hypothesis" suggests that size-selective cues decouple the relationship between energy and life history, acting instead directly on development. Here we use a series of experiments in a fish-daphnid predator-prey system to ask whether size-selective predator cues induce a physiological mediation of development, overshadowing behaviourally based changes in food intake. We found fish chemical cues reduce the net energy intake in Daphnia magna, suggesting a behaviourally mediated reduction in energy. Experimental manipulation of food levels show further that reductions in food lead to later but smaller size at maturity. However, in line with the physiological hypothesis, we show that D. magna matures earlier and at a smaller size when exposed to fish predation cues. Furthermore, our data shows that they do this by increasing their development rate (earlier maturity) for a given growth rate, resulting in a smaller size at maturity. Our data, from a classic size-selective predation system, indicate that predator-induced changes in this system are driven by physiological mediation of development rather than behavioural mediation of energy intake. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Early humans were obligately social, living in nested kin groups or close associations of related individuals. Theoretical and empirical research has demonstrated that group life is characterized by both costs (e.g. increased likelihood of disease transmission) and benefits (e.g. enhanced predator defense). This paper addresses the evolution of exploitation in humans (e.g. slavery, infanticide) as a response to within-group competition for limiting resources (e.g. food, mates), a potential cost of living in groups. Exploitation is defined as one individual's use of another for selfish ends, in particular, the acquisition and/or use of another's resources for the optimization of inclusive fitness. It is argued that exploitation is most likely to occur in relationships characterized by asymmetries such as dependence, intimacy, and/or differential access to resources. A simple mathematical treatment assesses exploitation as a facultative response to local competition among relatives, providing insights into the conditions favorable and adverse to exploitation of conspecifics. Possible applications of the formulations are discussed, including the conditions under which intraspecific exploitation may be beneficial to both actor and recipient(s). Constraints on the evolution of exploitation in humans are identified, and suggestions are made for testing hypotheses related to the differential costs and benefits of exploitation to conspecifics. Future studies may promote the mitigation of exploitation's deleterious effects in Homo sapiens, a body of research which may apply, as well, to other social mammals. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Verlag.},

abstract={Childhood obesity is growing rapidly worldwide. Although there have been enormous advances in the genetic underpinnings of obesity in recent years, the pathways that lead to obesity are still not completely understood. One of the ongoing challenges is the lack of a comprehensive definition of the obese phenotype that encompasses intermediary phenotypic expressions of biological and behavioral nature. Interactions between genetic and environmental factors, including nutrient exposures and dietary behaviors, can influence the development of the obese phenotype. Specifically, genes play a decisive role in the etiology of childhood obesity under the permissive circumstances of an obesogenic environment (increase in energy intake with a decrease in physical activity). Like many diseases, the causes of obesity are complex and their investigation requires novel approaches. Given the many contributors to obesity (weight gain, weight loss, weight maintenance, variability in body composition), as well as the dynamic nature of this issue, genomic tools must continue to be employed to evaluate all dimensions of the obesity phenotype, such as biochemical characteristics, susceptibility markers, nutrient intake, feeding practices and gene-environment interactions. Fundamental knowledge of the types of genes involved and available gene-diet interaction studies in children's obesity are reviewed. Although there is a paucity of existing literature in this specific domain of childhood obesity, ongoing investigations utilizing large cohorts have potential for providing the knowledge needed for targeted interventions in the future. © 2007 Future Medicine Ltd.},

abstract={Animals use behavioural plasticity to cope with conflicting selective pressures. We investigated how prey availability affects the spinning of cobwebs, whose architecture influences both prey capture and defence. Fed western black widows spun cobwebs containing more silk than did fasted spiders. However, fed spiders invested relatively less silk in the sheets and sticky gumfooted threads of webs and relatively more silk in supporting threads than did fasted spiders. The material properties of silk spun by fed and fasted spiders were relatively similar, but silk threads spun by fed spiders were twice as thick as those of fasted spiders, increasing web strength by 225%. Finally, spiders fed late in the experiment did not reproduce, even though they received the same amount of food as spiders fed earlier, 43% of which reproduced. The reallocation of silk in cobwebs away from sheets and sticky gumfooted threads, which function in prey capture, to supporting threads, which surround spiders with defensive clouds of silk, is consistent with reduced foraging effort and increased predation risk avoidance by fed spiders. Furthermore, this behavioural shift occurs as spiders are reproducing, when spiders can most afford the costs of reduced prey capture and would most benefit from enhanced protection. Our results contrast with those of previous studies on orb-weaving spiders, which found reductions in the sizes of webs as spiders caught more food. Thus, the architectures of spider webs reflect many selective pressures, the effects of which may vary with physiological state. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The spider crab Inachus phalangium is common in the sublitoral fringe of the Mediterranean Sea and north-eastern Atlantic Ocean, where it can be found in association with the snakelocks sea anemone Anemonia viridis. Studies concerning its activity patterns and the role of the host sea anemone are lacking. Our study aimed at investigating activity rhythms and resources utilization of I. phalangium reared in captivity. The main behavioral traits exhibited by I. phalangium are performed mostly at night. Two experiments were designed, one examined the time budget of various behavioral acts and the degree of association with the sea anemone, the other analyzed the behavioral response to algae and anemones. We showed that algae have a crucial role in the biology of I. phalangium and that crabs are ready to leave the protection of their host to obtain them. Algae represent both the major component of the diet and one of the most utilized sources of masking material of I. phalangium, which provide, together with specialized cryptic behaviors, protection against predators. Although our data suggest that the association with A. viridis is not obligatory, but the role of the snakelocks sea anemone in the life of I. phalangium is still central, both as an anti-predatory defense and as a nutritional source. The association of I. phalangium with algae and the anemone is a facultative biotrophic commensalistic symbiosis. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Previous findings demonstrate the involvement of the cholinergic NBM in the acquisition of the social transmission of food preference (STFP), a relational associative odor-guided learning task. There is also evidence that muscarinic receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex, an important NBM target area, may modulate olfactory associative memory. The present experiment determined the consequences of blocking muscarinic cholinergic receptors in a component of the medial prefrontal region (the prelimbic cortex) on the STFP task. Adult male Wistar rats were bilaterally infused with scopolamine (20 μg/site) prior to training and showed a severe impairment in the expression of the task measured in two retention sessions, both immediately and 24 h after training. Local scopolamine injections in the prelimbic cortex did not affect other behavioral measures such as olfactory perception, social interaction, motivation to eat, neophobia, or exploration. Results suggest that muscarinic transmission in the prelimbic cortex is essential for the STFP, supporting the hypothesis that ACh in a specific prefrontal area is important for this naturalistic form of olfactory relational memory. Current data are discussed in the context of disruption of learning as a result of interferences in PLC functions such as behavioral flexibility, attention, and strategic planning. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Iron deficiency anemia in early childhood causes developmental delays and, very likely, irreversible alterations in neurological functioning. One primary goal for the present study was to determine whether the effects of late gestational iron deficiency on brain monoamine metabolism, iron content, and behavioral phenotypes could be repaired with iron intervention in early lactation. Young pregnant rats were provided iron-deficient or control diets from mid-gestation (G15). At postnatal d 4 (P4), pups from iron-deficient dams were out-fostered either to other ID dams or control dams while pups of control dams were similarly fostered to other control dams. Dietary treatments continued to adulthood (P65) when brain iron and regional monoamines were evaluated. P4 iron repletion normalized body iron status, brain iron concentrations, monoamine concentrations, and monoamine transporter and receptor densities in most brain regions. Dopamine transporter densities in caudate and substantia nigra were lower in ID rats but were normalized with iron repletion. Serotonin transporter levels in most brain regions and open-field exploration were also normalized with iron repletion. The success of this approach of early postnatal iron intervention following iron deficiency in utero contrasts to a relative lack of success when the intervention is performed at weaning. These data suggest that a window of opportunity exists for reversing the detrimental effects of iron deficiency in utero in rats and provides strong support of intervention approaches in humans with iron deficiency during pregnancy. © 2007 American Society for Nutrition.},

More pups were born in the high-fat chow group and they were significantly larger from birth through day 21 than in the other groups.

In contrast, the control group explored an open field significantly sooner and longer and than either spinach-group. The control group also sniffed the open field and the object in it significantly more frequently and with a shorter latency than did the spinach-fed groups.

abstract={Foragers tend to exploit patches to a lesser extent farther away from their central place. This has been interpreted as a response to increased risk of predation or increased metabolic costs of prey delivery. Here we show that migratory Bewick's swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii), though not incurring greater predation risks farther out or delivering food to a central place, also feed for shorter periods at patches farther away from their roost. Predictions from an energy budget model suggest that increasing metabolic travel costs per se are responsible. Establishing the relation between intake rate and exploitation time enabled us to express giving-up exploitation times as quitting harvest rates (QHRs). This revealed that net QHRs were not different from observed long-term net intake rates, a sign that the birds were maximizing their long-term net intake rate. This study is unique because giving-up decisions were measured at the individual level, metabolic and predation costs were assessed simultaneously, the relation with harvest rate was made explicit, and finally, short-term giving-up decisions were related to long-term net intake rates. We discuss and conceptualize the implications of metabolic traveling costs for carrying-capacity predictions by bridging the gap between optimal-foraging theory and optimal-migration theory. © 2007 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={Florida's critically eroded beaches pose a myriad of social and environmental concerns, prompting an effort to explore alternatives to more traditional sand sources. One alternative involves the use of recycled glass cullet as coastal beach fill in erosional "hot spots." To determine the biological suitability of glass cullet in marine applications, invertebrate survivability and colonization was assessed through a biological assay program. Experimental bioassays were divided into five, three-container series (n = 15), with each series testing 23 kg of proportioned natural sand/glass cullet mixtures. Macro- and microscopic organisms were introduced to each bioassay and analyzed through direct observations. Experimental macrofauna displayed normal active behavior and recorded a mean success rate of 78% ± 3%. Mortality was attributed to predator-prey interactions rather than sediment contamination. Colonization of interstitial microfauna was successful within the cullet mixtures, and active transport between the cullet grains was documented without adverse effects. Abiotic parameters monitored in conjunction with the biological testing showed that temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH did not differ significantly among each test series. In addition, ammonia, nitrites, nitrates, and organic phosphates all recorded low risk factor levels. Small amounts of hydrogen sulfide precipitate began to form in the absence of wave action, but when wave simulations were introduced, no microbial zonation was detected. These experiments indicate that recycled glass cullet is a biologically benign material that can be used to mitigate development of erosional hot spots in nourished beaches. By doing so, a proactive recycling program can be initiated to protect one of Earth's most valuable resources, the coastline.},

abstract={There is now considerable evidence that elements of the heritable or familial component of disease susceptibility are transmitted by nongenomic means, and that environmental influences acting during early development shape disease risk in later life. The underlying mechanisms are thought to involve epigenetic modifications in nonimprinted genes induced by aspects of the developmental environment, which modify gene expression without altering DNA sequences. These changes result in life-long alterations in gene expression. Such nongenomic tuning of phenotype through developmental plasticity has adaptive value because it attempts to match an individual's responses to the environment predicted to be experienced. When the responses are mismatched, disease risk increases. An example of such mismatch is that arising either from inaccurate nutritional cues from the mother or placenta before birth, or from rapid environmental change through improved socioeconomic conditions, which contribute substantially to the increasing prevalence of type-2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence suggests that the effects can be transmitted to more than the immediately succeeding generation, through female and perhaps male lines. Future research into epigenetic processes may permit us to develop intervention strategies. © International Pediatrics Research Foundation, Inc. 2007. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Sandeels are known to be negatively affected by climate change in a number of ways. This study investigated whether these changes are affecting the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), a species which consumes sandeels. Porpoise diet was examined in spring (March-May), a critical time of year for survival when sandeels are important prey, from 1993 to 2001 to provide baseline information on the proportion of sandeels consumed. When data from spring 2002 and 2003 were compared to these baseline data, the diet was found to be substantially different, with a significant and substantially smaller proportion of sandeels being consumed in March and May. There were also differences in the number of porpoises starving between the two time periods (33% in spring 2002 and 2003 died of starvation, but only 5% in the baseline period). This suggests that a lower proportion of sandeels in the diet of porpoises in spring increases the likelihood of starvation. Therefore, we suggest that the negative effects of climate change on sandeel availability may have serious negative effects on harbour porpoise populations in the North Sea by increasing the likelihood of starvation in spring. © 2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Different emotions are accompanied by different bodily states and it is unclear which brain structures are involved in both, the cerebral representation of the bodily change and the representation of its perception. Structures connecting bodily signals and interoceptive awareness could trigger, in a feedforward manner, behavioral responses appropriate to maintain a desired state of the cardiovascular system. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study aimed at identifying brain structures that are mutually activated during interoceptive awareness of heartbeats and during cardiovascular arousal. Additionally, we searched for brain regions connecting interoception with feelings. During the interoceptive task (directing attention towards heartbeats in relation to an exteroceptive task) the thalamus, the insula, the medial frontal/dorsal cingulate and the inferior frontal gyrus, as well as the somatomotor cortex were activated. The conjunction of the interoceptive awareness of heartbeats and cardiovascular arousal revealed structures presumably connecting both conditions, i.e. the right thalamus, insula, somatomotor cortex, and the dorsal cingulate as well as medial frontal gyrus. Furthermore, the degree of interoceptive awareness predicted the degree of activation of both the insula and the medial frontal/dorsal cingulate gyrus. Negative feelings correlated with the BOLD response of the interoceptive awareness condition in the dorsal cingulate gyrus extending into the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. We provide evidence that the insula, the dorsal cingulate gyrus, and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex are specifically involved in processing cardiac sensations. The dorsal cingulate gyrus and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex presumably represent the neural substrates of experiencing negative emotions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The general consensus is that brain serotonin (5-HT) inhibits feed intake in teleost fishes and other vertebrates. Dietary manipulations with the 5-H precursor tryptophan (TRP) have, however, yielded contradictory effects on feed intake, while studies of the endocrine response to stress indicate that the effects of TRP-enriched feed are context dependent. A characteristic behavioural response to stress is a reduction in feed intake, and in the present study we investigated whether pre-treatment with TRP-enriched feed affected stress-induced changes in feeding behaviour in brown trout (Salmo trutta). After acclimatisation in observation aquaria, isolated fish were fed control or TRP-supplemented feed for 7 d, whereupon they were transferred to a novel environment, in which all fish were fed control feed. Transfer to a new environment resulted in decreased feeding in both the TRP pre-treated and the control-treated group. However, this decrease was more pronounced in the control-treated group. Previous experiments have concluded that stimulation of brain 5-HT systems by TRP enhancement does not affect feed intake in salmonid fishes, but in these studies food intake was observed in unstressed animals only. The present study suggests that pre-treatment with dietary TRP attenuates stress-induced anorexia. Hence, it appears that the effect of dietary manipulations of TRP on feeding behaviour is dependent on the stress levels experienced by experimental animals. These behavioural data are discussed in the context of the involvement of 5-HT in appetite regulation. © The Authors 2007.},

abstract={The current study evaluated whether difficulties regulating emotions explained unique variance in binge eating and examined which types of emotion regulation difficulties are most strongly associated with binge eating. The Eating Disorders Diagnostic Scale and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale were completed by 695 undergraduates. Hierarchical regression results indicated that difficulties regulating emotions accounted for a significant amount of the variance in binge eating over and above sex, food restriction, and over-evaluation of weight and shape. Results also indicated that greater difficulty identifying and making sense of emotional states, and limited access to emotion regulation strategies were primarily responsible for the link between emotion regulation difficulties and binge eating. This supports a model of binge eating that includes emotional vulnerability and a deficit of skills to functionally modulate negative moods. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We investigated responses toward novel foods and novel objects by wild capuchins that routinely exploit visitors' foods in Brasília National Park. Given the capuchins' daily exposure to human foods and objects, we expected them to be more explorative toward novel foods and objects compared to capuchins that are not habituated to visitors. However, since the safety and palatability of potential foods have to be learned, we also expected the capuchins to be cautious about eating novel foods, as has been reported for wild and captive capuchins. Stimuli were presented on a platform in four experimental conditions: familiar food (FF), novel food (NF), familiar food plus novel object (FF+O), and novel food plus novel object (NF+O). Latencies to approach and contact the platform, and to approach and to ingest food did not differ across conditions. Nevertheless, the capuchins were significantly more responsive (measured in terms of interest, manipulation, etc.) toward familiar foods than novel foods, and ate significantly more of the former. In other words, their explorative response toward novel foods led to little consumption. Our results do not support the "readiness to eat" hypothesis, according to which a lower readiness to eat and food neophobia are the consequences of the presence of a distracting novel object. The finding that capuchins explore novel stimuli but remain cautious about eating novel foods supports the view that neophilia and neophobia are motivationally independent responses. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Many different physiological changes have been observed in wild waterfowl during the flightless stage of wing moult, including a loss of body mass. We aimed to determine whether captive barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) would show the characteristic decrease in body mass during their wing moult, even though they had unlimited and unrestricted access to food. Fourteen captive geese were weighed at 1-2-week intervals for two complete years. During the flightless period of the moult, body mass decreased by approximately 25% from the premoult value. To understand the basis of this change, the rate of oxygen consumption was measured during daytime and nighttime at six points in the second year, and at three points (before, during and after wing moult) behavioural observations were made. Measurements of the rate of oxygen consumption showed an 80% increase above that of the nonmoulting periods of the year. We propose that metabolism was increased during moult because of the cost of feather synthesis. Although food was available, the captive birds chose not to forage and instead increased the proportion of time spent resting. It is likely that this behaviour in response to wing moult is a strategy to avoid predation in the wild. Thus, the innate nature of this behaviour has potential survival value for wild birds of this species. We conclude that the increase in metabolism led to the use of endogenous energy reserves because the birds reduced rather than increased their food intake rates, and as a result, the barnacle geese lost body mass during wing moult.},

abstract={The feeding behavior of bream (Abramis brama) yearlings kept before the experiment (four months post hatch) under different conditions has been studied. Three variants of conditions, varied in their levels of informational richness, were modeled for keeping young fish prior to the experiments: 1-minimal richness, mimicking conditions of standard commercial hatchery containers; 2-the conditions enriched by a water current; 3-the conditions enriched by modeled impact of predation and feeding by live food. In the following experiments, the conditions were similar for all three groups. It was revealed that the fish grown under the conditions of Variant 1 had a lower learning ability, higher extent of schooling behavior, and lower efficiencies of feeding and defensive behaviors. Similar traits were described in literature as being typical for the fish grown at standard fish farms. The Variant 2 fish had the shortest adaptation period and most efficient feeding behavior but were lacking the skills of defensive behavior. The fish from the 3rd variant had a medium duration of adaptation period and efficient feeding behavior and possessed well-developed skills of defensive behavior. The results have shown that the level of environmental information richness during fish early life stages plays a crucial role in further development of the most important adaptive forms of behavior. Maintaining the young fish in containers with water current facilitates swimming performance and development of feeding behavior. However, such fish, in fact, lack the skills of defensive behavior. © 2007 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract={Uncommonly observed behaviors were systematically recorded in a troop (n = 9 individuals) of black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) inhabiting a small forest fragment (1.7 ha) in Leona Vicario, Balancán, Tabasco, Mexico. Between February 2002 and January 2003 (n = 499 h), we observed behaviors such as ground travel (85 occasions, total = 269 min/10.8% of total locomotion time), ground foraging (eight occasions, total = 50 min/0.84% of total feeding time) and drinking water pooled in tree holes (20 times, total = 93 min/0.31% of total activity time). Total time (412 min) for these non-resting behaviors (feeding and locomotion on the ground) is almost equivalent to time devoted to social activities (420 min). These behaviors indicate that howler monkeys may be responding to pressures imposed by the small size of the fragment by adopting diverse strategies to cover their basic nutritional needs in this environment. They accomplish this while exposing themselves to potential predation by coyotes (Canis latrans), as was observed once during the study. It is likely that these behaviors are occurring at an increasing rate among monkeys in fragmented landscapes. © Japan Monkey Centre and Springer 2006.},

Young tiger snakes were raised either on a high or low food diet and exposed to a predation threat while foraging. Under these circumstances, lower condition snakes (low food diet) were prone to take additional feeding/foraging risks: food was accepted at a much higher rate compared with the higher condition animals (high food diet) that were less inclined to risk feeding under a predation threat. This study provides the first direct example of predation risk-associated foraging decisions in snakes. © 2007 Brill Academic Publishers.},

abstract={Gestational and early postnatal iron deficiency occurs commonly in humans and results in altered behaviors suggestive of striatal dysfunction. We hypothesized that early iron deficiency alters the metabolome of the developing striatum and accounts for abnormalities in striatum-dependent behavior in rats. Sixteen metabolite concentrations from a 9-11 mL volume within the striatum were serially assessed in 10 iron-deficient and 10 iron-sufficient rats on postnatal days 8, 22 (peak anemia), and 37 (following recovery from anemia) using 1H NMR spectroscopy at 9.4 tesla. Chin-elicited bilateral forelimb placing and vibrissae-elicited unilateral forelimb placing were also assessed on these days. Iron deficiency altered metabolites indexing energy metabolism, neurotransmission, glial integrity, and myelination over time (P &lt; 0.05). Successful development of behaviors was delayed in the iron-deficient group (P ≤ 0.01). Alterations in creatine, glucose, glutamine, glutamate, N-acetylaspartate, myoinositol, and glycerophosphorylcholine + phosphorylcholine concentrations accounted for 77-83% of the behavioral variability during peak anemia on postnatal day 22 in the iron-deficient group. Correction of anemia normalized the striatal metabolome but not the behaviors on postnatal day 37. These novel data imply that alterations in the metabolite profile of the striatum likely influence later neural functioning in early iron deficiency. © 2007 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Predation plays a key role in shaping mammalian communities through prey killed and through the decisions and choices of both predators and prey. We used an extensive data set from observed hunts of a diurnal large African carnivore, the cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus, in combination with analysis techniques originally developed in the field of economics (discrete choice models) to examine predation decisions within the context of the immediate environment and the reproductive and hunger status of individuals. This is one of the first attempts at an integrated understanding of the suite of ecological and behavioural factors that influence hunting decisions in a large carnivore. The decision of a cheetah to hunt or not was influenced by the abundance of their main prey, the reproductive status of the cheetah and the presence of competitors and predators, but not by the hunger level of the cheetah. Given that the decision to hunt is taken, prey choice is then driven by the time of year, the sex of the predator, the abundance of prey and the presence of competitors. We believe that discrete choice models may provide a new step forward in our ability to understand the decisions that animals make in their natural environment. © 2007.},

abstract={Increased dietary intake of choline early in life improves performance of adult rats on memory tasks and prevents their age-related memory decline. Because neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus also declines with age, we investigated whether prenatal choline availability affects hippocampal neurogenesis in adult Sprague-Dawley rats and modifies their neurogenic response to environmental stimulation. On embryonic days (ED) 12-17, pregnant rats ate a choline-supplemented (SUP-5 g/kg), choline sufficient (SFF-1.1 g/kg), or choline-free (DEF) semisynthetic diet. Adult offspring either remained in standard housing or were given 21 daily visits to explore a maze. On the last ten exploration days, all rats received daily injections of 5-bromo-2- deoxyuridine (BrdU, 100 mg/kg). The number of BrdU+ cells was significantly greater in the dentate gyrus in SUP rats compared to SFF or DEF rats. While maze experience increased the number of BrdU+ cells in SFF rats to the level seen in the SUP rats, this enriching experience did not alter cell proliferation in DEF rats. Similar patterns of cell proliferation were obtained with immunohistochemical staining for neuronal marker doublecortin, confirming that diet and exploration affected hippocampal neurogenesis. Moreover, hippocampal levels of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were increased in SUP rats as compared to SFF and DEF animals. We conclude that prenatal choline intake has enduring effects on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, possibly via up-regulation of BDNF levels, and suggest that these alterations of neurogenesis may contribute to the mechanism of life-long changes in cognitive function governed by the availability of choline during gestation. © The Authors (2007).},

abstract={This review, intended for a broad scientific readership, summarizes evidence relevant to whether a causal relation exists between dietary iron deficiency with (ID+A) or without (ID-A) anemia during development and deficits in subsequent cognitive or behavioral performance. An overview of expert opinion and major evidence in humans and animals is provided. Cognitive and behavioral effects observed in humans with ID-A and in animals with ID±A are provided in tables. The degree to which 5 conditions of causality are satisfied and whether deleterious effects of ID-A might be expected to occur are discussed. On the basis of the existing literature, our major conclusions are as follows. Although most of the 5 conditions of causality (association, plausible biological mechanisms, dose response, ability to manipulate the effect, and specificity of cause and effect) are partially satisfied in humans, animals, or both, a causal connection has not been clearly established. In animals, deficits in motor activity are consistently associated with severe ID+A, but adverse effects on performance in tests that target cognitive function have not been clearly shown. Resistance to iron treatment was observed in most trials of children <2 y of age with ID+A, but not in older children. Similar observations were made in rodents when ID+A occurred before rather than after weaning. In children >2 y of age and in adolescents with ID-A, evidence suggests cognitive or behavioral deficits; however, the surprisingly small number of studies conducted in either humans or animals prevents a thorough assessment. © 2007 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Introduced disease is a major mortality factor in some populations of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). Epizootics of infectious keratoconjunctivitis (IKC) and contagious ecthyma occurred in bighorn sheep in the Silver Bell Mountains of south-central Arizona, USA, from 1 December 2003 to 31 March 2004. Our objectives were to 1) investigate the influence of the epizootic on abundance and demographics and 2) examine how IKC affected the mortality, behavior, and movements of clinically affected animals. Morbidity was 39%, and all sex and age classes were affected. The population declined 23%, with most mortality in the adult female (1 M, 11 F) segment of the population. Of the diseased animals that were marked (n = 27), 44% recovered and 44% died. Predation (50%) and starvation (33%) were the primary causes of mortality of diseased bighorn sheep. Bighorn sheep that were infected spent less time feeding and moved less than noninfected animals during the epizootic. Managers might be able to minimize losses of infected animals through predator control. To minimize losses to starvation, managers should refrain from any activity that disturbs infected animals (including treatment) because disturbances increase energy expenditures and expose infected animals to injury.},

abstract={Nonoptimal fetal growth, leading to a small-for-gestational-age body size at birth, is commonly followed by compensatory growth after birth. This pattern of growth is associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, especially when the compensatory phase begins around 3 to 4 years of age. Genetic factors are of major importance for the development of type 2 diabetes, but despite extensive research, the identification of the underlying genes has not been particularly fruitful. This article focuses on interactions between intrauterine growth and genes in relation to adult health outcomes based on findings from the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study. We have shown that the effects of the Pro12Pro and Pro12Ala polymorphisms of the PPAR-γ 2 gene depended on the body size at birth. Those individuals who had a small body size at birth and were carriers of the Ala allele seemed to be protected against insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in later life. These findings reflect gene-early environment interactions and can be attributed to the phenomenon of developmental plasticity. © 2007 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Background: Two instruments commonly used in primary care research to measure depressive severity are the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-20 (HSCL-20). However, there is little information regarding the relationship between clinical information derived from these scales. The present study investigates the psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 and HSCL-20, determines the degree of instrument concordance, and describes the factor structure of the HSCL-20. Methods: A secondary data analysis from a randomized controlled trial was performed. A total of 405 primary care patients with major depressive disorder and/or dysthymia were administered the PHQ-9 and the HSCL-20 when recruited for the study. Results: Good internal consistency reliability estimates were obtained for both scales (PHQ-9 α = 0.803; HSCL-20 α = 0.837). All PHQ-9 inter-item and corrected item-total correlations showed that no item detracted from overall scale functioning. HSCL-20 items assessing overeating, poor appetite, and sexual interest were poorly correlated with other items and with the total scale score. A positive, moderate strength relationship was found between the instruments (r = 0.54, p < 0.0001). Exploratory factor analysis of the HSCL-20 yielded a six-factor structure, which accounted for almost 63% of the variance in total score. The largest contribution to common variance in the scale was provided by an "anxiety and self-reproach" factor. Conclusions: PHQ-9 and HSCL-20 total scores were moderately correlated. Although the HSCL-20 is utilized as a measure of depression severity, it may lack sufficient specificity to be an accurate reflection of depression status per se. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Eating disorders are extremely common and carry a high degree of medical and psychiatric morbidity. These disorders are challenging to treat because many patients deny their symptoms, have poor motivation to change, and can become frustrating to the clinician. Case identification based upon suggested screening questions and ongoing management of medical consequences are important roles for the obstetrician/gynecologist involved in the care of these patients. This chapter discusses the benefits and limitations of contemporary treatment, special populations at risk (e.g. athletes, diabetics), and screening guidelines for office practice. Signs, symptoms, laboratory abnormalities, and the perils of associated psychiatric illness are briefly reviewed. Patients do respond to a comprehensive, integrated treatment plan that includes nutritional stabilization, psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy. Collaboration between all professionals involved in the patient's care is essential for state-of-the-art care. Those patients who become pregnant or wish to become pregnant pose certain additional treatment considerations. Ongoing and future research aimed at understanding how eating disorders develop - and may be prevented by early identification and education - will result in enhanced knowledge of these life-threatening and often chronic illnesses in the 21st century. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated how age, age-standardized body mass index (z-BMI), body dissatisfaction, body esteem, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms contributed to disordered eating status in 152 girls. Girls scoring at/above the ChEAT clinical cut-off reported significantly greater body dissatisfaction and depressive symptoms and lower body esteem than did girls who scored below the cut-off. We then investigated whether age moderated the discriminant ability of the ChEAT threshold and found that the ChEAT was significantly more sensitive when our sample was limited to 10- to 12-year-olds. An abbreviated 6-item ChEAT scale, based on marker items distinguishing at-risk and non-clinical status, was subsequently developed. Findings indicate that this abbreviated ChEAT scale has improved sensitivity with older girls (10- to 12-year-olds). However, sensitivity was unacceptable for younger girls (8- and 9-year-olds) for both the ChEAT and abbreviated ChEAT scale, regardless of cut-off. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Antipredator strategies adopted by animals need to compensate for temporal changes. Many orb-web spiders add silk decorations to their webs, which principally attract prey but may attract some predators. To identify their influence on antipredator behaviour in adult female St Andrew's cross spiders (Argiope keyserlingi) we measured: spider body condition, web characteristics (area, spiral length and decoration building), environmental variables (air temperature, humidity, wind speed, relative prey abundance) and antipredator responses (remaining at the hub, dropping, shifting to the web periphery, or pumping the web) at three distinct periods (July-August, September-October and January-February) in the field. We developed path models from multiple regression analyses to distinguish between factors having direct and indirect effects. We found that even though both antipredator responses and decoration building change over time, antipredator responses and decoration investment are independent. Body condition and wind speed are directly positively associated with pumping frequency, and decoration building is negatively associated with the frequency of remaining at the hub because the likelihood that an object approaching the web is a predator increases if decorations are added. Wind speed is positively associated with antipredator behaviour and decoration building, due to an increased rate of feeding affecting body condition. © CSIRO 2007.},

abstract={Background. The aim of the study was to compare and evaluate psychological traits of eating behaviour assessed using the Eating Inventory (EI) known also as the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) and their relationship to body adiposity, health and social characteristic in a quota sample of Czech adults. Methods and Results. The sample included 1624 women and 1429 men who were interviewed individually by instructed investigators. The sample was quota representative - for gender, age, size of residential location, region and socioeconomic status in Czech adults. Anthropometric data were obtained together with socioeconomic and lifestyle information. Subjects filled out the El. Health status was evaluated according to the data reported by GPs. Our results show, that women had higher restraint but lower disinhibition and hunger scores than men. Hunger and disinhibition were always strongly associated, whereas restraint was negatively related to the other two factors in men, and to hunger in women. In both men and women an educational level positively correlated with dietary restraint and negatively with hunger. However, significant negative relationship between educational level and disinhibition was revealed only in men. In backward stepwise regression analysis both dietary restraint and disinhibition predicted BMI and waist circumference. BMI and waist circumference were negatively related to restraint, but positively to disinhibition. Restraint and disinhibition were associated with prevalence of comorbidities in men, while disinhibition and hunger were in women. Individuals with high scoring in disinhibition score (upper quartile) exhibited significantly higher prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and hyperlipidaemia than those who scored low (lower quartile). These relationships were most marked in middle-aged subjects. Conclusions. Psychological traits of eating behaviour seem to have an important role in the development and clinical expression of body adiposity. Especially disinhibition is significantly associated with BMI and waist circumference and prevalence of several pathologies.},

abstract={Strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors are expressed in many adult forebrain regions, yet the biological function of these receptors outside the spinal cord/brainstem is poorly understood. We have recently shown that rat lateral/basolateral amygdala neurons express strychnine-sensitive glycine-gated currents whose pharmacological and molecular characteristics are consistent with those established for classic ligand-gated chloride channels. The current studies were undertaken to establish the behavioral role, if any, of these strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors. Adult Long-Evans male rats were implanted with guide cannulae targeted at the lateral amygdala and were microinjected with standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid with or without various doses of strychnine or taurine. Anxiety-like behaviors were assessed with the elevated plus maze or the light/dark box. In the elevated plus maze, strychnine decreased closed-arm time and increased open-arm time, suggestive of an anxiolytic effect. Similarly, strychnine produced a modest anxiolytic effect in the light/dark box. Post hoc analysis of 'open-arm' time and 'light-side' time indicated that aCSF-treated animals were distributed into two apparent groups that displayed either high or low amounts of anxiety-like behavior in a given apparatus. Surprisingly, the pharmacological effects of both strychnine and taurine in these assays were dependent upon a given animal's behavioral phenotype. Together, these findings are significant because they suggest that the basal 'emotional state' of the animal could influence the behavioral outcome associated with drug application directly into the lateral/basolateral amygdala. Furthermore, our findings also suggest that compounds acting at amygdala strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors may actively modulate this basal anxiety-like state. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Resource polymorphisms, intraspecific variation in morphology due to differential resource use, are common across a wide range of animal taxa. The focus in studies of such polymorphisms has been on external morphology, but the differential use of food resources could also influence other phenotypic traits such as the digestive performance. In the present study, we experimentally demonstrate that Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) display adaptive plasticity in gut length when exposed to different food types. Perch fed a less digestible food type developed relatively longer guts compared to fish fed a more easily digested food type. This divergence in gut length was also apparent under natural conditions because perch inhabiting the littoral and pelagic habitats of a lake differed in resource use and relative gut length. Despite that the digestive system in perch is plastic, we found that individuals switching to a novel food type might experience an initial fitness cost of the diet switch in the form of a temporary reduction in body condition. These results show the importance of gut length plasticity for an ontogenetic omnivore but also a cost that might prevent diet switching in polymorphic populations. © 2007 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract={In amphibians and fishes, evidence is increasing that chemical cues from injured conspecifics can play a role in the chemical labelling and learned recognition of unfamiliar predators. In this laboratory study, we tested the prediction that prior chemical exposure to a non-native predator feeding on conspecific tadpoles will subsequently allow tadpoles of the common toad (Bufo bufo) to recognize the chemical cues specifically released by this starved predator. Furthermore, we investigated the vulnerability of this chemically-mediated process to herbicide contamination. With these aims in view, groups of tadpoles were kept either unexposed or exposed for ten days to chemical cues from Turkish crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus) previously fed on tadpoles, both in uncontaminated water and in the presence of four sublethal concentrations of amitrole (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg.l-1). We then assessed the effects of the six conditioning treatments on general activity and behavioural response to chemical cues from starved crayfish. Larval treatments did not affect the general activity of the tadpoles. By contrast, the treatments had significant effects on the behavioural response to the test solution prepared form starved crayfish. The only tadpoles to show an antipredator behavioural response to the chemical stimulation from starved crayfish belonged to the groups derived from chemical exposure to tadpole-fed crayfish in uncontaminated water and in contaminated water with the lowest concentration of amitrole (0.01 mg.l-1). Conversely, this chemical stimulation produced no behavioural change in the control group or in the groups derived from exposure to tadpole-fed crayfish in contaminated water containing 0.1, 1 and 10 mg.l-1 of amitrole. This study demonstrates that chemical cues released during the predator's feeding activity can subsequently be used by common toad tadpoles in the recognition of an unfamiliar predator. In addition, our results show that the presence of sublethal amitrole concentrations can impair this recognition process. Such a pesticide effect might be especially detrimental for amphibian populations threatened by invasive predators. © 2006 Birkhäuser Verlag.},

abstract={This study examined the effect of the novel psychostimulant modafinil (Provigil) on a variety of cognitive and behavioral measures including associative learning, sustained attention, inhibitory control, and reaction time. Middle-aged female rats (18-20 months old) were administered oral doses of modafinil (0, 8, 32, and 64 mg/kg) and tested in a 3-choice visual discrimination and sustained attention task. Modafinil produced a dose-dependent pattern of improved response accuracy and impulse control (fewer premature responses) and shorter response latencies, without affecting omission errors, motivation or motor control. Although the biochemical mechanism of modafinil is unknown, these results suggest a profile differing from typical psychostimulants (e.g., amphetamine). The implications of these findings for treatment of narcolepsy, ADHD, and various arousal-related disorders are considered. Further research is needed to examine the relative safety, effectiveness, and addictive potential of modafinil, as well as, its effects in comparison with other performance-enhancing drugs (e.g., caffeine, nicotine, and amphetamines). © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={New World monkeys exhibit a color vision polymorphism. It results from allelic variation of the single-locus middle-to-long wavelength opsin gene on the X chromosome. Females that are heterozygous for the gene possess trichromatic vision. All other individuals possess dichromatic vision. The prevailing hypothesis for the maintenance of the color vision polymorphism is through a consistent fitness advantage to heterozygous trichromatic females. Such females are predicted to be more efficient than dichromats when detecting and selecting fruit. Recent experiments with captive callitrichid primates provided support for this hypothesis by demonstrating that color vision phenotype affects behavioral responses to contrived food targets. Yet, the assumptions that trichromatic females acquire more calories from fruit, or that number of offspring is linked to caloric intake, remain untested. Here, we assess if, in the wild, heterozygous trichromatic individuals in a group of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) enjoy an energetic advantage over dichromats when foraging on fruit. Contrary to the assumptions of previous theoretical and experimental studies, our analysis of C. capucinus foraging behavior shows that trichromats do not differ from dichromats in their fruit or energy acquisition rates. For white-faced capuchins, the advantage of trichromatic vision may be related to the detection of predators, animal prey, or fruit under mesopic conditions. This result demonstrates the importance of using a fitness currency that is relevant to individual animals to test evolutionary hypotheses. © The Author 2006.

abstract={Vigilance increases fitness by improving predator detection but at the expense of increasing starvation risk. We related variation in vigilance among 122 radio-tagged overwintering grey partridges Perdix perdix (L.) across 20 independent farmland sites in England to predation risk (sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus L., kill rate), use of alternative antipredation behaviours (grouping and use of cover) and survival. Vigilance was significantly higher when individuals fed in smaller groups and in taller vegetation. In the covey period (in early winter when partridges are in flocks), vigilance and use of taller vegetation was significantly higher at sites with higher sparrowhawk predation risk, but tall vegetation was used less by larger groups. Individuals were constrained in reducing individual vigilance by group size and habitat choice because maximum group size was determined by overall density in the area during the covey period and by the formation of pairs at the end of the winter (pair period), when there was also a significant twofold increase in the use of tall cover. Over the whole winter individual survival was higher in larger groups and was lower in the pair period. However, when controlling for group size, mean survival decreased as vigilance increased in the covey period. This result, along with vigilance being higher at sites with increasing with raptor risk, suggests individual vigilance increases arose to reduce short-term predation risk from raptors but led to long-term fitness decreases probably because high individual vigilance increased starvation risk or indicated longer exposure to predation. The effect of raptors on survival was less when there were large groups in open habitats, where individual partridges can probably both detect predators and feed efficiently. Our study suggests that increasing partridge density and modifying habitat to remove the need for high individual vigilance may decrease partridge mortality. It demonstrates the general principle that antipredation behaviours may reduce fitness long-term via their effects on the starvation-predation risk trade-off, even though they decrease predation risk short-term, and that it may be ecological constraints, such as poor habitat (that lead to an antipredation behaviour compromising foraging), that cause mortality, rather than the proximate effect of an antipredation behaviour such as vigilance. © 2006 The Authors.},

Children's social looking toward adults, affect, and wary or hesitant behavior in response to novelty were assessed in a semistructured paradigm during an inhome play observation. Affect and behavior were compared as a function of iron status: IDA (n = 74) vs. nonanemic (n = 164). Compared with nonanemic preschoolers, preschoolers with IDA displayed less social looking toward their mothers, moved close to their mothers more quickly, and were slower to display positive affect and touch novel toys for the first time. These results indicate that IDA in the preschool period has affective and behavioral effects similar to those reported for IDA in infancy. © 2007 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Obesity is considered a public health crisis. In order to tackle this, an enhanced appreciation of what drives some consumers to overeat is required. It is clear that several features of the modern environment encourage over-consumption in many people, at least some of the time. However, there is variation in the extent to which this translates into weight gain. Understanding whether susceptibility is dispositional or learned will shape prevention and treatment programmes. This review identifies situational cues that promote overeating and dispositional traits, such as impulsivity and sensitivity to reward, which make some individuals specifically vulnerable to overeating. These traits are likely to contribute to the development of the obese state, but also present barriers to weight management. Personalised nutrition and behavioural strategies may provide a novel and innovative approach, as these take account of individual differences in vulnerability to overeating. © 2007 The Author.

abstract={The Human Genome and HapMap projects have provided the tools and information that will aid in understanding how nutrients alter the expression of an individual's genetic information and why individuals differ in metabolism of foods at the molecular level. The study of how genes and gene products interact with dietary chemicals to alter phenotype and, conversely, how genes and their products metabolize nutrients is called nutritional genomics or "nutrigenomics." This new field has received considerable attention in the last 6 years, most of which has been on the promise rather than on scientific results from nutrigenomic experiments. Funding for nutrigenomics research focused primarily on individual laboratory projects in the 1990s and early 2000s. The novelty of combining nutrition and genetics limited that funding to a relatively small number of laboratories. Only in the past 3 years have centers been funded to foster collaborations and conduct large-scale projects that are studying nutrient-gene interactions. The increase in interest and funding is beginning to generate the critical mass to realize the promise of nutritional genomics. © 2007 by Walter de Gruyter.},

abstract={Prey often respond to predation risk by increasing refuge use, but this strategy may entail a loss of body condition. Factors responsible for this loss of body condition remain unclear. Also how prey deal with refuge use to cope with predation risk without incurring costs of body condition, and how initial body condition affects refuge use remain barely known. We analyzed in the field whether adult Iberolacerta cyreni lizards modify their escape strategies and refuge use in areas with different levels of habitat deterioration and ecotourism pressure, which represent different levels of predation risk, and the consequences of changes in antipredator behavior to body condition. Lizards inhabiting deteriorated areas, where risk is higher, remained closer to refuges, but decreased time spent hidden in refuges after attacks, probably to maintain similar body condition than lizards inhabiting natural areas. We performed two laboratory experiments to isolate potential costs of refuge use that might affect the body condition of male lizards: a) a decrease of the efficiency of digestion due to low temperatures inside refuges and/or b) a reduction in food intake. Results suggest that refuge use is costly in terms of body condition due to reduced food intake, but the loss of efficiency of digestion seems unimportant. Lizards modified refuge use in relation to their body condition, with lizards with worse condition decreasing time hidden after predatory attacks. We concluded that lizards compensated for increased predation risk with flexible antipredatory strategies, coping with risk without incurring costs for body condition. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Some animals give specific calls when they discover food or detect a particular type of predator. Companions respond with food-searching behaviour or by adopting appropriate escape responses. These signals thus seem to denote objects in the environment, but this specific mechanism has only been demonstrated for monkey alarm calls. We manipulated whether fowl (Gallus gallus) had recently found a small quantity of preferred food and then tested for a specific interaction between this event and their subsequent response to playback of food calls. In one treatment, food calls thus potentially provided information about the immediate environment, while in the other the putative message was redundant with individual experience. Food calls evoked substrate searching, but only if the hens had not recently discovered food. An identical manipulation had no effect on responses to an acoustically matched control call. These results show that chicken food calls are representational signals: they stimulate retrieval of information about a class of external events. This is the first such demonstration for any non-primate species. Representational signalling is hence more taxonomically widespread than has previously been thought, suggesting that it may be the product of common social factors, rather than an attribute of a particular phylogenetic lineage. © 2006 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Reactions to stress vary between individuals, and physiological and behavioral responses tend to be associated in distinct suites of correlated traits, often termed stress-coping styles. In mammals, individuals exhibiting divergent stress-coping styles also appear to exhibit intrinsic differences in cognitive processing. A connection between physiology, behavior, and cognition was also recently demonstrated in strains of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) selected for consistently high or low cortisol responses to stress. The low-responsive (LR) strain display longer retention of a conditioned response, and tend to show proactive behaviors such as enhanced aggression, social dominance, and rapid resumption of feed intake after stress. Differences in brain monoamine neurochemistry have also been reported in these lines. In comparative studies, experiments with the lizard Anolis carolinensis reveal connections between monoaminergic activity in limbic structures, proactive behavior in novel environments, and the establishment of social status via agonistic behavior. Together these observations suggest that within-species diversity of physiological, behavioral and cognitive correlates of stress responsiveness is maintained by natural selection throughout the vertebrate sub-phylum. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={We analyzed whether habitat deterioration due to ski slopes affected lizards' behavior, and whether these changes in behavior had consequences for the body condition and health state of lizards. Results suggested that habitat deterioration in ski slopes not only implied a loss of optimal habitat for lizards, but also led to an increase in perceived risk of predation. Males seemed to adjust their movement patterns to differences in risk, increasing their movement speed during their displacements across risky areas within ski slopes, but as a consequence, they incurred loss of body condition. A laboratory experiment supported that fleeing at high speeds in areas without refuges can be a factor responsible for reduced body condition. However, changes in body condition did not affect sprint speed of lizards. Our study provides new evidence that behavioral strategies to cope with increased predation risk, due to human-induced habitat deterioration, may affect body condition of lizards. Our results have applications for the design of conservation plans for this endangered lizard species. Environmental impact studies should be performed before opening new ski slopes, but taking into account not only the presence of lizards but also their body condition. An effective way to decrease the effects of habitat loss may be the artificial restoration of some refuges to create safe corridors for movement. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A field experiment was conducted to examine the effect of perceived predation risk on the use of foraging areas by juvenile and adult primates under different conditions of local food abundance. Wild squirrel monkeys, Saimiri sciureus, were observed in an experiment conducted during the dry and the wet seasons at a site in Eastern Amazonia, Brazil. Animals were presented with feeding platforms that differed in food quantity and exposure to aerial predators through varying vegetative cover. In the dry season, juveniles and adults chose platforms based solely on food quantity. However, in the wet season, juveniles foraged preferentially on high-reward platforms only if cover level also was high (i.e., potentially offered greater concealment from predators). In contrast, adults showed the same pattern of platform use regardless of season. These results indicate that age and local resource availability based on seasonally affect whether primates forage in a predator-sensitive manner. Juveniles may be more sensitive to predation risk when foraging, and individuals may take fewer risks when resource abundance is high in their environment. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Despite the isolation of placental folate receptors 25 y ago and progress in defining the mechanism of folate delivery, considerable gaps remain in the literature for each level of the maternal-placental-fetal unit. Although a critical role of placental folate receptors in maternal-to-fetal folate transport was shown by use of the isolated perfused-placental cotyledon model a decade ago, in vivo confirmation is still needed. Knockout of folate receptors in mice, and knock-down of folate receptors by delivery of antisense oligonucleotides at gestation day 8 or antibodies to folate receptor, results in profound developmental abnormalities in the fetus, ranging from neural tube defects to neurocristopathies such as cleft-lip and cleft-palate, cardiac septal defects, and eye defects. These abnormalities can be prevented by ensuring the entry of folate into cells via alternative pathways. Controlled dietary folate restriction studies also identified adverse effects on reproductive performance, implantation, and fetal growth and other subtler (microscopic) defects in murine fetal development. Longitudinal follow-up showed that gestational folate deficiency results in behavioral changes - an anxiety phenotype - during adulthood in these mice, which supports the Barker hypothesis. The extent to which these findings are relevant to humans is unclear, however. Nevertheless, the high incidence of neural tube defects among North Indian women, who chronically subsist on one-third to one-half of the optimum folate needed to prevent birth defects, underscores the magnitude of the public health problem and emphasizes the urgent challenge to define the most efficient way to ensure adequate dietary folate for hundreds of millions of such women at risk in developing countries. © 2007 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Decreased risk of predation is a key benefit of group living, and selfish herd theory predicts competition for the relative safety of central positions. Spatial position also affects behaviour, as individuals trade-off their feeding and vigilance to mitigate the risk of predation. Female eiders, Somateria mollissima, often pool their broods and share brood rearing, and anti-predatory vigilance is a core parental care activity. Females are assumed to trade-off vigilance and feeding, as efficient recovery of condition is crucial for energetically stressed postincubating females. Evidence shows that a female's own ducklings are closer to her than unrelated young in amalgamated broods and that predation of ducklings by gulls is edge biased, so a female's spatial position should correlate with the survival prospects of her brood. We identified determinants of female spatial position (aggression, structural size, body weight, age, clutch size) within multifemale brood-rearing coalitions, and explored whether spatial position affected female activities. Female aggression frequency was the only significant predictor of centrality in brood-rearing coalitions, and female age was positively associated with aggression. Investment in vigilance, but not investment in feeding, increased with spatial centrality; instead, central females devoted less time to other activities (resting, preening and moving). We conclude that central eider females do not need to trade-off vigilance and feeding. Heavy body weight did not guarantee a favourable position in brood-rearing coalitions, which may help explain our previous finding that female eiders in best body condition when their brood hatches tend their brood alone. © 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) is a widespread, opportunistic species showing spatial and seasonal variations in diet according to local availability of prey. Although previous research has been conducted on the foraging strategies of this small rorqual whale, in terms of prey aggregation and assimilation, relatively little has been published on the foraging association of this species with coastal seabirds. Over the past five years, minke whales occurring along the outer coastline of the southern Moray Firth in north-east Scotland during the summer and autumn months have been recorded foraging in the presence of seabirds, such as kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), herring gulls (Larus argentatus), guillemots (Uria aalge) and shearwaters, which form dense feeding rafts at the water's surface. The formation of bird rafts notably occurs independently of the presence of B. acutorostrata, believed instead to be the successive result of prey concentrated at the surface by predatory schooling fish from below rather than by activities of the whales themselves. In this area of the North Sea, schooling mackerel (Scomber scombrus) constitute the most significant component of the summer fish biomass and are believed to perform the role of compacting targeted sandeel (Ammodytes spp.) prey into concentrated bait balls almost exclusively. The resulting ball of prey is consequently available to the foraging whale, which can be seen opportunistically utilizing successive bird rafts rather than expending unnecessary energy corralling the Ammodytes prey by traditional, active entrapment methods. The role of the mackerel in increasing both the rate and density of sandeel ball formation (as indicated by the presence and activity of associated bird rafts) is therefore thought to be very significant in this inshore Scottish location. Changes in oceanographic variables such as water temperature have been directly correlated with the migration of S. scombrus. The observed inter-annual variability in B. acutorostrata distribution in the outer Moray Firth may subsequently be related to the respective distribution and abundance of these migratory, pelagic fish species. © 2007 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.},

abstract={Environmental enrichment programs provide benefits to both captive animals and the facilities that house them, but cost time and resources to design, implement, and maintain. As yet, there have been few theoretically based guidelines to assist animal care staff in establishing cost-efficient enrichment methods that both elicit the desired behavioral changes and maintain their success over time. We describe several well-studied principles from the field of experimental analysis of behavior, including intrinsic reinforcement, extrinsic reinforcement, habituation, extinction, and schedules of reinforcement that could be very useful for evaluating the short- and long-term effectiveness of enrichment. We use this theoretical framework to generate testable hypotheses and provide examples of enrichment studies relevant to our predictions. In particular, we suggest that enrichment devices that offer extrinsic reinforcement (food, social access, etc. as a result of performing behaviors) should produce greater and more prolonged changes in behavior than devices that rely on the behavior itself being reinforcing to the animal. For techniques that provide no extrinsic reinforcement, using stimuli that are novel, are more different from the environment, have been withheld or altered in some way, or are presented less frequently may help reduce habituation. For techniques that provide extrinsic reinforcement, making reinforcement more difficult to obtain and providing more or higher quality reinforcers may increase the long-term success of the enrichment program. In addition, enrichment may be more effective if animal care staff avoid continuously reinforcing behaviors after they are established, enriching immediately after feeding, and exposing animals to enrichment when reinforcement is no longer available. While the current enrichment literature supports the application of behavior analytic theory, empirical evaluation of many of our predictions is still needed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Decades of research have produced substantial data on elk (Cervus elaphus) diets in winter, when foraging conditions are most likely to affect population dynamics. Using data from 72 studies conducted in western North America between 1938 and 2002, we collated data on elk diets and environmental variables. We used these data to quantify diet selection by elk and to test whether variation in elk diets is associated with habitat type, winter severity, period of winter, human hunting, and study method. Graminoids (grasses and grass-like plants such as sedges) dominated elk diets and consistently occurred at a higher proportion in the diet than in elk foraging habitats, indicating preference. Forbs commonly made up ≤5% of the diet, with no evidence for preference; we conclude that forb use is largely incidental to grazing for graminoids. Browse was consumed in proportion to its availability, implying that the amount of browse in the diet was primarily determined by habitat use rather than selection. Comparing the diets of elk and sympatric ruminants, elk consistently selected graminoids more strongly than sympatric ruminants with the exception of bison (Bison bison), suggesting that elk are not environmentally forced to adopt the graminoid-biased diet that they normally select. The proportion of open meadows and grasslands on winter ranges was strongly and positively associated with graminoid consumption by elk. The proportion of graminoids in the diet was significantly lower in elk experiencing severe winter conditions or predation risk from human hunting. The period of winter (early, middle, and late) had only small effects on elk diets, as did the method by which the diet was determined. Overall, variation in elk diets is well-explained by a consistent tendency to select graminoids if available, modified by winter habitat type, predation risk, and winter severity, which can constrain habitat selection and access to grazing opportunities. To fully understand variation in foraging behavior, biologists should recognize these broad patterns when interpreting resource selection data. Managers should recognize that inconspicuous behavioral responses to environmental stimuli can alter the diet in ways that probably carry nutritional consequences.},

abstract={The effect of l-stepholidine (SPD), a novel alkaloid extract of the Chinese herb Stephania with partial dopamine D1 receptor agonistic and D2 receptor antagonistic dual actions, on morphine conditioned place preference (CPP) was studied. Daily injection of morphine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) for 6 days induced CPP in rats, and daily treatment with SPD at 10 or 20 mg/kg before morphine injection dose-dependently attenuated morphine-induced CPP. On the day following acquisition of morphine CPP, a single administration of SPD at 10 or 20 mg/kg failed to block the expression of CPP. However, daily administration of SPD at 20 mg/kg for 7 days attenuated the maintenance of CPP. Morphine-induced CPP extinguished after a 21-day saline training and then a single injection of morphine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) induced re-acquisition of morphine CPP; however, pretreatment with SPD at 10 or 20 mg/kg 30 min before morphine injection dose-dependently blocked morphine (3 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced re-acquisition of morphine CPP. Furthermore, our data indicate that SPD had no effect on food-induced CPP or state-dependent learning, suggesting that the observed effect of SPD does not result from an inhibition of general learning ability. These results demonstrate that SPD can inhibit acquisition, maintenance, and re-acquisition of morphine conditioned place preference and suggest its potential for treatment of opioid addiction. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Soy and derivative diets deliver large doses of isoflavones to human and animals throughout their lifespan, including gestation. Epidemiologic and experimental data suggest that the consumption of soybean containing foods may protect against cardiovascular disease and decrease breast, prostate and endometrial cancer risk. Based on animal and in vitro studies, however, concerns have been raised that consumption of isoflavones may cause potential adverse effects on the reproductive tract and behavior. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of chronic consumption of a soy meal containing diet or soy isoflavones supplement on the morphology of reproductive organs, semen quality, age that males reached puberty, and sexual behavior of male rabbits. With this purpose, 16 female rabbits were randomly assigned to receive: (1) a soy- and alfafa-free diet; (2) a soy- and alfafa-free diet supplemented with 5 mg/kg body wt./day of soy isoflavones; (3) a soy- and alfafa-free diet supplemented with 20 mg/kg body wt./day of soy isoflavones; (4) a diet containing 18% of soy meal, throughout the gestation and lactation. After weaning, male offspring received the same diet, which was given to the respective mother. The age that males reached puberty, semen characteristics and sexual behavior were evaluated in these animals. At 33 weeks of age, the reproductive organs were submitted to histological evaluation. Rabbits, which received large amounts of isoflavones (20 mg/kg body wt./day) had a lesser food intake, body weight and semen volume. Spermatogenesis, morphology of male genital organs and sexual behavior did not differ significantly from the control group. We conclude that chronic dietary treatment with soy based diet or soy isoflavones have no adverse effects on the observed reproductive patterns of male rabbits. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Abstract: The descriptive epidemiology of type 2 diabetes suggests that gene-lifestyle interactions are critical to the development of the condition. However, unravelling the molecular detail of these interactions is a complex task. The existing literature is based on small intervention studies or cross-sectional observational quantitative trait studies. Our systematic review of the literature identified some evidence of interactions, most notably for a common variant in the PPAR-gamma gene which appears to interact with the nature of dietary fat intake. Other interactions have been reported for adrenoceptors, uncoupling proteins, fatty acid binding proteins, apolipoproteins and lipoprotein lipase. There are, to date, no reports based on the ideal study design which is a case-control study nested within a cohort. To limit the likelihood of false discovery, such studies would need to be large and the search for interaction should be restricted to a priori biologically driven hypotheses. Additional study designs that examine differential response to lifestyle change or test interaction in the context of quantitative trait studies would complement the nested case-control approach, but the emphasis here should be on precision of measurement of both phenotype and lifestyle behaviour. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The brain takes a primary position in the organism. We present the novel view that the brain gives priority to controlling its own adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration. It fulfils this tenet by orchestrating metabolism in the organism. The brain activates an energy-on-request system that directly couples cerebral supply with cerebral need. The request system is hierarchically organized among the cerebral hemispheres, the hypothalamus, and peripheral somatomotor, autonomic-visceromotor, and the neuroendocrine-secretomotor neurons. The system initiates allocative behavior (i.e. allocation of energy from body to brain), ingestive behavior (intake of energy from the immediate environment), or exploratory behavior (foraging in the distant environment). Cerebral projections coordinate all three behavioral strategies in such a way that the brain's energy supply is guaranteed continuously. In an ongoing learning process, the brain's request system adapts to various environmental conditions and stressful challenges. Disruption of a cerebral energy-request pathway is critical to the development of obesity: if the brain fails to receive sufficient energy from the peripheral body, it compensates for the undersupply by increasing energy intake from the immediate environment, leaving the body with a surplus. Obesity develops in the long term. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: Although biographical narratives and work involving the meaning of biographical episodes is a central focus in any psychotherapy, there remains a lack of psychometric instruments for measuring the autobiographical construction as such. We will be presenting a theoretical model of an autobiographical construction of life themes and the Interview of Retrospective Exploration of Life themes (IREL) will be used as the basis of a psychometric instrument. The IREL takes about 90-120 min. The interrater reliability and test-retest reliability will be examined. Methods: Two samples of 21 and 23 mentally healthy subjects were recruited. In addition to the IREL, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and SCID were also used to control for psychopathological status and depressive mood. Results: According to our data, biographical events can be explored objectively and reliably using the IREL. Minor test-retest variability of the affective valence of life themes is not state-dependent. Conclusions: Setting aside limitations due to the small sample sizes, the results suggest that the proposed interview is an objective and reliable instrument for measuring central issues within the subjective biographical construction (life themes).

abstract={Events in early life are associated with changes in the risk of disease in later life. There is increasing evidence that these associations are mediated by permanent transcriptional changes in metabolic pathways, in some cases linked to epigenetic alterations. We have proposed that this phenomenon of 'developmental induction' is not a manifestation of pathophysiological processes but rather represents the consequence of developmental decisions made during fetal and early postnatal life to maximize subsequent fitness. However, this fitness advantage is lost if the early and later environments are mismatched. Rats undernourished in utero by maternal underfeeding develop features of the metabolic syndrome, especially if fed on a high-fat diet, but transient neonatal treatment with leptin reverses induction of this adverse metabolic phenotype. This observation demonstrates that developmental programming is reversible and provides strong support for the match-mismatch or predictive model for the origins of developmental programming.

abstract={PURPOSE OF REVIEW: An adverse prenatal environment may induce long-term metabolic consequences, in particular obesity and insulin resistance. Although the mechanisms are unclear, this 'programming' has generally been considered an irreversible change in developmental trajectory. Recent work has highlighted the importance of the hormone leptin during critical windows of development in the pathogenesis of programming related disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Maintaining a critical leptin level during development may allow the normal maturation of tissues and pathways involved in metabolic homeostasis and a period of relative hypo or hyperleptinemia may induce some of the metabolic adaptations which underlie developmental programming. Furthermore, nutritional or therapeutic intervention in postnatal life can ameliorate the consequences of developmental malprogramming and, at least in the rodent, developmental programming is potentially reversible by intervention with leptin late in the phase of developmental plasticity. SUMMARY: Inappropriate growth during pregnancy or lactation can result in individuals with an increased risk of later obesity and related metabolic sequelae. Taken together, recent studies highlight the importance of leptin in disorders manifest as a consequence of developmental programming and offer exciting new strategies for therapeutic intervention, whether it be maternal or neonatal intervention or targeted nutritional manipulation in postnatal life. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.},

abstract={Obestatin is a peptide hormone that is derived from the same polypeptide precursor (preprogrelin) as ghrelin, but it acts in opposing way on ingestive behavior. Our previous studies showed that ghrelin affects memory and anxiety. Here, we studied the possible effects of icv obestatin injection in rats upon memory retention (using two different paradigms), anxiety like behavior (plus maze test), and food intake. Obestatin induces an increase in the percentage of open arms entries (Obestatin 3.0 nmol/rat: 61.74 ± 1.81), and percentage of time spent in open arms (Obestatin 3.0 nmol/rat: 72.07 ± 4.21) in relation to the control (33.31 ± 1.54; 25.82 ± 1.68), indicating an anxiolytic effect. The two doses of obestatin increased latency time in a step down test and the percentage time of novel object exploration, suggesting that the peptide influences learning and memory processes that involve the hippocampus and the amygdala. This report provides evidence indicating that obestatin effects are functionally opposite on anxiety and hunger to the ghrelin effects, while both these related peptides increase memory retention. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Antagonistic sexual coevolution stems from the notion that male and female interests over reproduction are in conflict. Such conflicts appear to be particularly obvious when male genital armature inflicts damage to the female reproductive tract resulting in reduced female longevity. However, studies of mating frequency, genital damage and female longevity are difficult to interpret because females not only sustain more genital damage, but also receive more seminal fluid when they engage in multiple copulations. Here, we attempt to disentangle the effects of genital damage and seminal fluid transfer on female longevity in the beetle Callosobruchus maculatus (Coleoptera: Bruchidae). Males copulating for the sixth time in succession inflicted greater levels of genital damage, but transferred smaller ejaculates in comparison with virgin males. The number of copulations performed by males was negatively related to female fecundity and positively related to female longevity, suggesting a trade-off between fecundity and longevity. However, inclusion of fecundity as a covariate revealed sperm and/or seminal fluid transfer to have a negative impact on female longevity above that caused by the fecundity-longevity trade-off. The consequences of multiple copulations on female longevity were examined. Females that mated twice laid more eggs and died sooner than those that mated once. However, incorporation of fecundity as a covariate into our statistical model removed the effect of female mating frequency on female longevity, indicating that double-mated females suffer greater mortality owing to the trade-off between fecundity and longevity. Males of this species are known to transfer very large ejaculates (up to 8% of their body weight), which may represent a significant nutritional benefit to females. However, the receipt of large ejaculates appears to carry costs. Thus, the interpretation of multiple mating experiments on female longevity and associated functional explanations of polyandry in this species are likely to be complex. © 2006 The Royal Society.},

abstract={We studied individual and herd level behavioural responses of elk to spatial and temporal variation in the risk of predation by wolves over three winters in the Upper Gallatin drainage, Montana, U.S.A. Within a given drainage, elk of both sexes moved into or closer to protective cover (timber) in response to wolf presence. Cow elk responded to elevated risk by increasing vigilance in exchange for foraging, and large mixed (cow, calf, spike) herds substantially decreased in size. In contrast, when wolves were present, bulls did not increase vigilance levels, or decrease feeding, and small bull-only groups slightly increased in size. As a consequence, small bull-only herds and large mixed-sex herds converged on a similar size when wolves were present. We think this response is a balancing of the benefits of risk dilution with increased detectability or attractiveness of larger herds to wolves. Based on proportions in the population, wolves overselected bulls and underselected cows as prey. Thus, bulls showed weaker antipredator responses than cows, despite facing a greater risk of predation. Using marrow fat content from elk killed by wolves as an indicator of body condition, bulls were in significantly worse body condition than cows throughout the winter, and condition deteriorated for both sexes as winter progressed. Overall, we conclude that antipredator behaviours carry substantial foraging costs, that bulls, because of their poorer body condition, are less able to pay these costs than cows, and that differences in ability to pay foraging costs probably explain sex-specific differences in antipredator behaviours. © 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Recent food scares have increased consumer concern about meat safety. However, the Greek 'traditional' meat supply chain from producers to local butchers does not seem to realise the pressing consumer demand for certified meat quality. Or is it that, in such food chains, this demand is not so pressing yet? The present paper seeks to answer this question based on a survey conducted in the Athens area, involving a sample of 268 participants responsible for food purchasing decisions. The survey mainly aims to develop an integrated model of factors that affect consumer-perceived meat quality and to develop the profile of different consumer segments in relation to these perceptions. The substantial findings of the survey include the fact that, despite their enormous per capita consumption, the majority of consumers are not particularly involved in the meat-purchasing process. Rather they attach importance to visual intrinsic quality cues evaluated in a pre-purchasing context. In this respect, intrinsic quality cues are assigned a role similar to that of quality certification; coupled with the choice of traditional channels and the resulting personal relation with the butcher, they can be understood as efforts to decrease risk of the purchasing decision. Moreover, consumers with such behaviour seem to relate domestic country of origin of meat mostly with perceptions of general safety. Finally, a small, but promising trend with substantial marketing implications of frequent purchases of chicken and pork at supermarkets should not be ignored. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={OBJECTIVE: While restrained eating is one of the most well-established risk factors of eating disorders in females, its role for eating disturbances in males remains largely unclear. The present study investigates eating behaviour in response to food cues and negative cognitions in male restrained eaters. METHODS: Twenty-four restrained eaters and 21 unrestrained eaters volunteered in a cue reactivity experiment consisting of two exposure trials with and without response prevention. Food and macronutrient intake were monitored, and negative cognitions were assessed using a self-report cognition inventory. RESULTS: Male restrained eaters consumed a larger amount of food, specifically carbohydrates, than unrestrained eaters. This greater food intake was predicted by negative cognitions about self-esteem and occurred in restrained eaters who had reported binge eating episodes in the diagnostic interview. DISCUSSION: Results suggest marked cue reactivity in male restrained eaters with an increased risk of overeating in those who experience low situational self-esteem and who are binge eaters. ©2007, Editrice Kurtis.},

abstract={Postnatal manipulation studies involving human handling suggest that rats adjust the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system in response to environmentally induced variations in maternal behaviour but adverse environmental conditions can constrain this potentially adaptive mechanism. We studied whether other variations in postnatal maternal environment have similar effects on maternal behaviour and the offspring's behavioural and HPA responses to stressors. We housed Lister hooded dams and their litters in systems made of a nest cage (NC) and an exploration cage (EC) connected by a tunnel and varied access to food either spatially or temporally until postnatal day 8. Dams received food ad libitum in the NC (NC-fed dams) or EC (EC-fed dams) or intermittently during nine 30-min periods each day (IEC-fed dams). Although EC-fed dams spent more time in the EC and less time at the nest site than NC-fed dams, EC-fed dams nursed in longer bouts which may indicate a more active nursing style. Intermittent feeding resulted in reduced food intake, but did not affect maternal behaviour. Compared to NC-fed offspring, EC-fed offspring showed reduced HPA reactivity and fearfulness, whereas IEC-fed offspring showed increased HPA reactivity compared to EC-fed offspring. These findings support the view that moderately challenging maternal environments may down-regulate the offspring's HPA system, possibly by altering maternal behaviour, while adverse environmental conditions (e.g. food restriction) may exert opposing effects, independent of maternal behaviour. © 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Contingencies have also been arranged to directly influence operant response variability. These include lag reinforcement schedules, differential reinforcement of novel behavior, differential reinforcement of less frequent behavior, and percentile reinforcement schedules. These procedures are discussed in terms of practicality and implications for use in applied settings. Contingencies and treatment packages that indirectly influence response variability are addressed in terms of response allocation, response generalization, and response covariation. Studies on the effects of a variety of other variables on response variability are also reported, such as levels of food deprivation and drugs. Finally, directions for applied research in response variability are suggested.},

abstract={Measures of animal behavior can be used in a variety of situations to make inferences about the environment and population status. Work by our research group shows that migratory shorebirds adjust their usage of, and behavior at, stopover sites in response to environmental conditions. Motivated by this, we built an individual-based model of migrating shorebirds moving through a sequence of alternating small and large stopover sites. Birds at larger sites are safer from predators, but we assumed that less food is available than at small sites. In the model, both predation risk and food intake are density-dependent, and the behavior of migrants is controlled by two rules: one that determines whether a bird will depart a stopover site, and one that controls the individual's foraging versus vigilance intensity. The optimal behavior is calculated by maximizing a payoff function that depends on arrival date and arrival energy stores at the final site. We used this model to predict mass gain, foraging intensity, and usage by migrants of small and large sites under various conditions. We examined the effects of a flyway-wide reduction in the amount of food, a flyway-wide increase in predation danger, and the effects of lowering the overall population size. The mass action of many individuals, each optimizing its migration timing and routing, leads to the emergence of distinctive patterns of behavior and site choice under these differing environmental conditions. When food availability is reduced throughout the flyway, our model predicts that foraging intensity increases at every stopover site, thereby forcing birds to accept greater danger to maintain the fitness benefit of a timely arrival to the breeding area. A flyway-wide increase in predation danger results in fewer migrants choosing (and/or migrants staying a shorter time at) small stopover sites, balanced by a higher usage of large sites. These effects contrast with what is observed under true population declines, when the usage of both small and large sites declines.},

abstract={A Japanese minnow, Pseudorasbora parva, was exposed simultaneously to multiple dangers in experimental tanks. The study aimed to quantify to what extent the risk of predation coinciding with an adverse environmental factor, high flow velocity, affects prey in terms of growth and energy expenditure. In this experiment, two measures of growth (i.e., body weight and length), condition, feeding, swimming cost and behavioral responses were analyzed. The results showed that in such an environment, prey showed lowered growth and were in a poorer condition. As the prey shifted to the shallow area with high flow velocity, the prey consumed a lower ration and incurred multiple costs for swimming locomotion that might reduce the allocation of energy to biomass and energy storage. Reduction in activity might decrease the cost of locomotion, but it did not have a considerable effect on overall swimming energy expenditure. In stream ecosystems, the high swimming energy expenditure appears to magnify the effects of predation risk by causing lowered growth and a poorer condition and, hence, fitness. The present study shows that high flow velocity is one of the environmental factors that determine the energetic responses of a potential prey to the presence of predators. © 2006 The Ecological Society of Japan.},

abstract={Objective: Perfectionism has been reported as a specific risk factor for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, but not binge eating disorder. This study examined whether these differences are due to differential associations between perfectionism and specific eating disorder behaviors. Method: Participants (N = 2.482) completed the eating disorders inventory perfectionism scale and a questionnaire assessing eating disorder symptoms. Results: Perfectionism was associated with an array of disordered eating behaviors in women. However, associations were strongest for fasting and purging. Further, the association between binge eating and perfectionism was statistically mediated by lasting. In men, perfectionism was significantly associated only with fasting, and this association was greater than associations with other disordered eating behaviors. Conclusion: Results explain why previous studies have reported weak or inconsistent associations between perfectionism and binge eating and may inform etiological models of EDNOS characterized by fasting or purging. © 2006 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={The field of omega-3 fatty acid deficiencies as reversible risk factors in major psychiatric disorders has flourished in the last decade. Treatment recommendations of the American Psychiatric Association may be considered for application to more normative states of psychiatric health. Considered here is the proposition that an increased risk of personality disorders, and an increased sense of despair in normative populations, might be considered as symptoms of deficiencies of omega-3 fatty acids. The major changes in the essential fatty acid composition of the food supply, including increased availability of the omega-6 linoleic acid, may be correlated not only with increased risks of homicide, but also increased risks of suicide and suboptimal social cohesion. © 2007 A B Academic Publishers.},

abstract={Some water fleas Daphnia change their head morphology to reduce predation risk in response to chemical substances (kairomones) released from larvae of the invertebrate predator Chaoborus (Insecta: Diptera). We tested for evidence of the costs associated with elongation of the head spine in Daphnia galeata and the consequences of these costs on the inducibility of head spine elongation in predictable and unpredictable environments. We exposed D. galeata in outdoor experimental ponds to conditions under which predation pressure by Chaoborus larvae and the concentration of kairomones from this predator were controlled for about 70 days. In the laboratory, we then used Daphnia clones collected from the outdoor ponds to investigate the inducibility of head spine formation in response to Chaoborus kairomones. The inducibility of head spine formation increased in D. galeata from the ponds that had contained both predators and kairomones, whereas in water fleas from the ponds containing only kairomones the plasticity (inducibility) of head spine formation decreased compared with that in the control ponds. These results suggest that the production of a defensive head spine, its phenotypic plasticity, or both entail some costs. Contrary to our predictions, exposure to Chaoborus kairomones in the laboratory resulted in head lengths that were not significantly different among any of the clones from the three outdoor treatments. We found no evidence for costs associated with head spine elongation in terms of fecundity, time to maturity, or intrinsic rate of natural population increase. Average within-clone partial correlations calculated for head length and intrinsic rate of natural population increase, corrected for body length, were not significantly negative, indicating no cost of defence. This was probably because food conditions in the laboratory were so good that the costs of defence could not be detected. Furthermore, community-level changes, such as changes in food conditions caused by manipulation of the predation regime in the outdoor ponds, might have worked as selection pressures and confounded the results.},

abstract={The subjective expected utility (SEU) model rests on very strong assumptions about the consistency of decision making across a wide range of situations. The descriptive validity of these assumptions has been extensively challenged by behavioral psychologists during the last few decades, and the normative validity of the assumptions has also been reappraised by many statisticians, philosophers, and economists, motivating the development of more general utility theories and decision models. These generalized models are characterized by features such as imprecise probabilities, nonlinearly weighted probabilities, source-dependent risk attitudes, and state-dependent utilities, permitting the pattern of the decision maker’s behavior to change with the decision context and to perhaps satisfy the usual SEU assumptions only locally. Recent research in the emerging field of neuroeconomics sheds light on the physiological basis of decision making, the nature of preferences and beliefs, and interpersonal differences in decision competence. These findings do not necessarily invalidate the use of SEU-based decision analysis tools, but they suggest that care needs to be taken to structure preferences and to assess beliefs and risk attitudes in a manner that is appropriate for the decision and also for the decision maker. © Cambridge University Press 2007 and 2009.},

abstract={Hyperhomocysteinemia has been identified as a risk factor for neurological disorders. To study the influence of early deficiency in nutritional determinants of hyperhomocysteinemia on the developing rat brain, dams were fed a standard diet or a diet lacking methyl groups during gestation and lactation. Homocysteinemia progressively increased in the offspring of the deficient group and at 21 days reached 13.3 ± 3.7 μmol/L versus 6.8 ± 0.3 μmol/L in controls. Homocysteine accumulated in both neurons and astrocytes of selective brain structures including the hippocampus, the cerebellum, the striatum, and the neurogenic subventricular zone. Most homocysteine-positive cells expressed p53 and displayed fragmented DNA indicative of apoptosis. Righting reflex and negative geotaxis revealed a delay in the onset of integration capacities in the deficient group. Between 19 and 21 days, a poorer success score was recorded in deficient animals in a locomotor coordination test. A switch to normal food after weaning allowed restoration of normal homocysteinemia. Nevertheless, at 80 days of age, the exploratory behavior in the elevated-plus maze and the learning and memory behavior in the eight-arm maze revealed that early vitamin B deprivation is associated with persistent functional disabilities, possibly resulting from the ensuing neurotoxic effects of homocysteine.

Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 42, 963-970]) is a parent-report questionnaire designed to assess eating styles related to obesity risk. It has been shown to have a robust factor structure and good internal reliability, but has not been validated against behavioural measures of eating. In the present study, associations were examined between three CEBQ scales (Satiety Responsiveness, SR; Food Responsiveness, FR; Enjoyment of Food, EF) and four aspects of eating behaviour (eating without hunger, caloric compensation, eating rate and energy intake at a meal) aggregated across up to five occasions, in a sample of 4-5-year olds. In multiple regression, the aggregated behavioural measures of eating explained 56% of the variance in SR, 33% of the variance in FR and 40% of the variance in EF. These findings support the validity of the CEBQ as a parent-report instrument to assess 'obesogenic' eating behaviours in children. An easily-administered measure such as the CEBQ will be valuable in gathering data on the scale required to study the behavioural phenotype associated with obesity risk. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Males of several insect species transfer nuptial gifts to females during mating, typically in the form of a protein-rich spermatophore. In chemically defended species, males could potentially enhance such a gift with chemicals that help protect the female, her eggs, or both. This was shown for lepidopteran species that accumulate pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Most Heliconius butterflies are presumably protected from predators by virtue of de novo synthesized and/or sequestered cyanogenic glycosides. Males of Heliconius species are known to transfer nutritional gifts to the females but whether defensive chemicals could also be transferred is not known. To ascertain whether transfer of cyanogens occurs, we dissected freshly mated females from nine different Heliconius species and analyzed spermatophores for cyanogenic glycosides. We found cyanogens in the spermatophores of all nine species. This is the first time cyanogenic glycosides are reported in the spermatophores of arthropods. We discuss the implications of these findings for Heliconius biology and for other cyanogenic insects as well. We suggest that chemically defended species commonly lace their nuptial gifts with defensive chemicals to improve gift quality. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Biomedical science has little considered the relevance of life history theory and evolutionary and ecological developmental biology to clinical medicine. However, the observations that early life influences can alter later disease risk - the "developmental origins of health and disease" (DOHaD) paradigm - have led to a recognition that these perspectives can inform our understanding of human biology. We propose that the DOHaD phenomenon can be considered as a subset of the broader processes of developmental plasticity by which organisms adapt to their environment during their life course. Such adaptive processes allow genotypic variation to be preserved through transient environmental changes. Cues for plasticity operate particularly during early development; they may affect a single organ or system, but generally they induce integrated adjustments in the mature phenotype, a process underpinned by epigenetic mechanisms and influenced by prediction of the mature environment. In mammals, an adverse intrauterine environment results in an integrated suite of responses, suggesting the involvement of a few key regulatory genes, that resets the developmental trajectory in expectation of poor postnatal conditions. Mismatch between the anticipated and the actual mature environment exposes the organism to risk of adverse consequences - the greater the mismatch, the greater the risk. For humans, prediction is inaccurate for many individuals because of changes in the postnatal environment toward energy-dense nutrition and low energy expenditure, contributing to the epidemic of chronic noncommunicable disease. This view of human disease from the perspectives of life history biology and evolutionary theory offers new approaches to prevention, diagnosis and intervention. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Background: Individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) exhibit severe disturbances in appetite regulation, including delayed meal termination, early return of hunger after a meal, seeking and hoarding food and eating of non-food substances. Brain pathways involved in the control of appetite in humans are thought to include the hypothalamus, frontal cortex (including the orbitofrontal, ventromedial prefrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas), insula, and limbic and paralimbic areas. We hypothesised that the abnormal appetite in PWS results from aberrant reward processing of food stimuli in these neural pathways. Methods: We compared functional MRI blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses while viewing pictures of food in eight adults with PWS and eight normal weight adults after ingestion of an oral glucose load. Results: Subjects with PWS demonstrated significantly greater BOLD activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex than controls when viewing food pictures. No significant differences were found in serum insulin, glucose or triglyceride levels between the groups at the time of the scan. Conclusions: Individuals with PWS had an increased BOLD response in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex compared with normal weight controls when viewing pictures of food after an oral glucose load. These findings suggest that an increased reward value for food may underlie the excessive hunger in PWS, and support the significance of the frontal cortex in modulating the response to food in humans. Our findings in the extreme appetite phenotype of PWS support the importance of the neural pathways that guide reward related behaviour in modulating the response to food in humans.},

abstract={Lifestyle factors, including diet, are critical in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. Because weight gain increases diabetes risk, and even modest weight reduction reduces risk, weight management is paramount in lessening the occurrence and effects of diabetes. Weight loss interventions should include patient education, behavioral strategies, physical activity, energy intake deficits of 500 to 1000 kcal/day, and prevention of recidivism. Macronutrient distribution ranges of diets for diabetic patients follow those of the Dietary Reference Intakes, allowing for individualization according to a patient's metabolic responses, needs, and preferences. Nutrients to be limited include saturated fats, artificial trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium, whereas nutrients to be emphasized include monounsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, fibers, antioxidants, and minerals, including potassium, magnesium, calcium, and chromium. Food sources are advised rather than supplements. Sugars can be isocalorically substituted for starches without detriments to glycemic control. Diets with low glycemic index or load may have modest benefits in managing type 2 diabetes. If a diabetic patient chooses to consume alcohol, he or she should do so in moderation. Foods advocated in type 2 diabetes are similar to those that are also beneficial in reducing risk for other chronic diseases. © 2007, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract={PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this review is to highlight the traditional and newly recognized suicide risk factors in patients with mood disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Current research findings clearly suggest that suicidal behaviour in patients with mood disorder is a 'state-dependent' phenomenon. Recently, there is, however, a growing body of evidence that besides the well accepted clinically explorable suicide risk factors in mood disorders (e.g., severe depression, prior suicide attempt, comorbid anxiety, substance use, personality disorders and so on), mixed state of depression could also be an important precursor of suicidal behaviour. This might be particularly true in unrecognized cases of bipolar depressives, when antidepressant monotherapy (unprotected by mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics) can worsen the clinical picture and rarely induce an aggressive or self-destructive behaviour. SUMMARY: In the majority of patients with mood disorders, suicidal behaviour is predictable and preventable, with a good chance. A careful and systematic exploration of suicide risk factors in patients with mood disorder helps clinicians to identify patients at high suicide risk. A successful, acute and long-term treatment of these patients substantially reduces the suicidal behaviour even in this high-risk population. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.},

abstract={Developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) focuses on the earliest stages of human development, and provides a novel paradigm to complement other strategies for lifelong prevention of common chronic health conditions. The 3rdInternational Congress on DOHaD, held in 2005, retained the most popular features from the first two biannual Congresses, while adding a number of innovations, including increased emphasis on implications of DOHaD for the developing world; programs for trainees and young investigators; and new perspectives, including developmental plasticity, influences of social hierarchies, effects of prematurity, and populations in transition. Emerging areas of science included, first, the controversial role of infant weight gain in predicting adult obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Second, in the era of epidemic obesity, paying attention to the over-nourished fetus is as important as investigating the growth retarded one. Third, environmental toxins appear to have abroad range of long-lasting effects on the developing human. Fourth, epigenetic mechanisms could unite several strands of human and animal observations, and explain how genetically identical individuals raised in similar postnatal environments can nonetheless develop widely differing phenotypes. Improving the environment to which an individual is exposed during development may be as important as any other public health effort to enhance population health world wide. © International Pediatrics Research Foundation, Inc. 2007.

abstract={The reinforcing effects of addictive drugs and palatable foods are regulated, at least in part, by a common biological mechanism. The reactivity or sensitivity of these brain reward regions have been found to correlate significantly with the risk for a variety of drug addictions. Sensitivity to Reward (STR) is conceptualised as a psycho-biological personality trait rooted firmly in the availability of dopamine in the mesocorticolimbic ('common reward') pathways, and as such is a good candidate for studying motivational factors and eating behaviours. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether STR was related to behaviours that contribute to excess body weight. Structural equation modelling procedures were used with a sample of healthy adult women (n = 151). We hypothesised that STR would positively predict overeating and a preference for foods high in fat and sugar; and that these two behaviour would, in turn, predict a higher Body Mass Index. Results provided an excellent fit of the model to our data confirming our view that a personality trait like STR can only influence a physical condition like body weight indirectly by the way it co-varies with behaviours that contribute directly to variation in the outcome variable. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={For newly settled coral reef fishes, survival advantages may be associated with specific early life history traits or condition levels that lead to differences in behavior. To identify physiological and behavioral characteristics associated with different condition levels, bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum recruits were collected immediately after settlement from reefs in the upper Florida Keys, USA, and transported to the laboratory for experimental analysis. Quantification of swimming capabilities was coupled with otolith analysis to identify early life history traits associated with swimming performance. Fish with the highest critical swimming speeds were those that grew faster as larvae, had shorter pelagic larval durations, and were smaller at settlement, although these individuals represented only 10% of the total sample. To further investigate condition-associated behaviors, a feeding treatment established fish of 2 different condition levels for comparison. Recruits fed for 1 wk at higher levels grew faster, had greater standardized weight (Fulton's condition factor), and swam faster than food-deprived recruits. In additional behavioral trials, high condition recruits evaded a simulated predator threat at faster speeds than the low condition recruits. High condition fish also exhibited less risk-taking behavior by sheltering more in the presence of a predator threat and consuming less food. For both high and low condition recruits, the number that sought shelter increased and food consumption rates decreased in the presence of a predator threat. These results link early life history traits and physiology with associated condition-based differences in behavior, likely underlying the observation that mortality in T. bifasciatum is frequently selective for condition. © Inter-Research 2006.},

abstract={A wide range of parasites are known to cause behavioral changes in their hosts and parasitized insects are especially amenable to the study of such changes. The majority of studies addressing parasite-induced behavioral alterations have focused on parasites with complex life cycles and the adaptive nature of such changes. Behavioral changes caused by parasitoids, single-host parasites that kill their host upon emergence, have been studied less and the adaptive nature of these changes is likely to be different than those in complex life cycles. I investigated behavioral alterations in Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae infected with parasitoid nematodes (family Mermithidae). I conducted several experiments in which I tested the following hypotheses: 1) Mermithid nematodes induce behavioral changes in mosquito larvae and the changes are density dependent. 2) Different species of mermithid nematodes induce similar changes in mosquito larvae behavior. 3) Behavioral alterations vary with mermithid developmental stage. 4) Mosquito larvae infected with mermithid nematodes behave similarly to uninfected food-deprived mosquito larvae. I found that 4th instar Ae. aegypti infected with Romanomermis culicivorax or Strelkovimermis spiculatus exhibited resting behaviors significantly more often than uninfected controls but that intensity of infection did not affect activity levels. In earlier instars, infected mosquito larvae were more active than uninfected control larvae in some behaviors associated with feeding. There was no significant difference between infected and uninfected food-deprived mosquitoes in nine of the ten behaviors observed. The decrease in activity of late instar Ae. aegypti larvae infected with mermithids may be a parasitoid adaptation that reduces the risk of predation and thus increases host and parasitoid survival. The increase in feeding activity in earlier instars as well as the similarity between uninfected food-deprived and infected Ae. aegypti behavior may indicate that these behaviors are adaptive for the parasitoid, increasing nutritional acquisition for successful parasitoid development.},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a gradual and hierarchical decline in cognition that is essentially connected with the functional properties of brain areas with the highest degree of plasticity. Corresponding brain regions are mostly affected by histological determinants of AD. Crucial pathways involved in maintaining the neural plasticity were also shown to be impaired in AD. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) seems to be one of the crucial factors connected with the majority of cognitive and plasticity deficits observed in AD. Recent studies indeed confirm that BDNF is severely disturbed in AD and form an important signaling pathway influencing neural plasticity and neural network status in general. Recently, several behavioral interventions including physical and mental activity or training programs, environmental factors during the early development, and dietary restriction were shown to enhance BDNF levels, neurogenesis, neural cell survival and plasticity and thus improve cognitive properties of the brain. Described behavioral interventions could form a promising approach for AD prevention and treatment programs for prophylactic purposes or in the early stages of AD (Ref 106).},

abstract={The past year has witnessed contentious debates about public health in England around smoking bans, alcohol licencing, food labelling and junk food advertising. Some people argue that any government intervention in these areas is 'nanny statist'-an unnecessary intrusion into people's lives and what they do, eat and drink. Others argue that only the state can alter the environment that shapes people's decisions and behaviour. This paper suggests that there is a strong argument to be made for government intervention to safeguard public health. Legislation brings about changes that individuals on their own cannot, and sets new standards for the public good. Rather than condemning such activity as 'nanny statist', it might be more appropriate to view it as a form of 'stewardship'. The paper draws on international evidence about alcohol use, smoking and road safety to show how taxation, advertising bans, regulations proscribing behaviour and education create a public health framework and shape individual choices towards healthier and safer behaviour. © 2006 The Royal Institute of Public Health.},

abstract={Depression is a serious illness, affecting more than one million Australians each year. It causes significant morbidity and is a major risk factor for deliberate self-harm and suicide. Depression was traditionally viewed as a personality weakness, for which few treatment options were available. The simplistic view that depression is a personality weakness has changed in recent times. Depression is now widely recognised as a mood disorder with underlying biological (biochemical and genetic) and psychosocial causes and as such is responsive to a number of different treatments. The aim of the present paper is to review the literature related to dietary manipulation and how manipulation may assist in treating this illness. Evidence reviewed supports a potential therapeutic benefit of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for the alleviation of negative symptoms associated with depression. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, optimal omega balance, folate, tryptophan, vitamin B6, B12, S-adenosyl-L-methionine and Hypericum perforatum may all serve as adjuncts to psychosocial and pharmacological therapies, with positive implications for long-term prognosis. © 2006 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2006 Dietitians Association of Australia.},

abstract={We examined the effects of 4 types of environmental enrichment (foraging opportunities, structural complexity, sensory stimulation/novelty, and social companionship) on aggressive and feather pecking, feather condition, food wastage, body weight, feed conversion, and egg production in adult Japanese quail. Sex differences were examined where possible. GLM analysis was used to evaluate the effects of enrichment and housing, while test-retest reliability and the stability of measures over 18 d were assessed using partial correlation. 3. Foraging enrichment reduced food wastage. Body weight, feed conversion, and egg production were not affected by enrichment. Rates of aggressive and feather pecking were also not significantly affected, but these behaviours were observed very infrequently in this study. Socially-housed birds had poorer feather condition, lower body weight and less efficient feed conversion than singly-housed birds. Social housing did not affect food wastage. There were no sex differences in feather pecking, feather condition, food wastage, or feed conversion. All measures except feather pecking were reliable over 24 h, but only feather condition and body weight were stable over 18 d. The instability of the behavioural measures over time suggests that enrichment effects may vary with age.},

abstract={The family can exert a strong influence on children's diet and eating behaviors, which, in turn, may have an impact on their weight status. Since the dawn of time, the dining table has been the nexus of family interaction. The simple act of sharing meals solidifies the family identity and family ties by modeling a wide range of learned behavioural patterns. One of the groups most affected in this respect are adolescents. Researchers have shown that family meals are associated with improved dietary intake. A higher frequency of family meals is associated with a greater intake of fruits, vegetables, grains and calcium-rich products, and negatively associated with consumption of fried foods and soft drinks. Family meals have also been shown to contribute to the development of regular eating habits and positive psychosocial functioning and to improvements in language and literacy. In addition, family meals have been associated with reduced risk-taking behaviours such as smoking and alcohol and drug use, as well as better school performance. Because of the multiple benefits of eating meals together as a family, promoting the family meal is a powerful public health measure for improving dietary quality, reducing the incidence of weight problems and improving educational and social outcomes.},

abstract={In the past 30 years, Daphnia has become a model organism in aquatic ecology. I review the changing concepts and paradigms in plankton ecology as reflected in the work on Daphnia. The availability of radiotracers favoured a new physiological approach that resulted in better energetic models and more reliable estimates of filtering rates. This led to deeper insights into the role of herbivore grazing on phytoplankton and microbial communities, and nutrient recycling. It provided a conceptual basis for general hypotheses on predictable seasonal successions (e.g. the PEG model). On the other hand, increasing knowledge about selective predation on zooplankton triggered population dynamic models and gave explanations for changing community structures. The Size-Efficiency-Hypothesis generated a framework for studies on trade-offs between competitive ability and susceptibility to predation. Daphnia was now in the centre of interaction-based concepts, being predator and prey at the same time. It was the backbone of practical applications of the theory in food-web manipulations. When ultimate factors came into the focus, Daphnia played an important role in explaining striking phenomena like diel vertical migration and cyclomorphosis. Its central position in food-webs, the unique propagation mode, easy cultivation and accessibility by molecular genetic methods made it a favourite object for studies in evolutionary ecology, concerning local adaptation, evolution of defences and life histories, induced phenotypic change, and genetic diversity. The large advantage of Daphnia over other biological model organisms is that its importance in pelagic freshwater systems is undoubtedly known. Hence there is a direct way of applying the results to ecological systems.},

abstract={The objective of the present study was to determine if the acute behavioral effects of cocaine acutely administered intraperitoneally (ip) at doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg on white male CF1 mice, 90 days of age, would be influenced by leptin acutely administered ip (at doses of 5, 10 and 20 μg/kg) or by endogenous leptin production enhanced by a high-fat diet. The acute behavioral effects of cocaine were evaluated in open-field, elevated plus-maze and forced swimming tests. Results were compared between a group of 80 mice consuming a balanced diet and a high-fat diet, and a group of 80 mice fed a commercially available rodent chow formula (Ralston Purina) but receiving recombinant leptin (rLeptin) or saline ip. Both the high-fat-fed and rLeptin-treated mice showed decreased locomotion in the open-field test, spent more time in the open arms of the elevated plusmaze and showed less immobility time in the forced swimming test (F(1,68) = 7.834, P = 0.007). There was an interaction between diets and cocaine/saline treatments in locomotion (F(3,34) = 3.751, P = 0.020) and exploration (F(3,34) = 3.581, P = 0.024). These results suggest that anxiolytic effects and increased general activity were induced by leptin in cocaine-treated mice and that low leptin levels are associated with behavioral depression. Chronic changes in diet composition producing high leptin levels or rLeptin treatment may result in an altered response to cocaine in ethologic tests that measure degrees of anxiety and depression, which could be attributed to an antagonistic effect of leptin.},

abstract={While prisoner's dilemma has frequently been used in studies of animal behavior, past work in the area fails to address the question of differential utility. As animals needs change, their behavior also changes. A hungry animal may be less likely to cooperate than a full one. In this study an abstract species is modelled using an energy balance computation that assigns a state of hungry, full, or neither to a given animal together with a modified finite state representation for a prisoner's dilemma strategy that implements distinct but linked strategies for each possible state. The strategy used is conditioned on the animal's current hunger state. An evolutionary algorithm is used to generate effective strategies for this deterministic form of differential utility prisoner's dilemma. A tool called fingerprinting is used to document the strategies that arise. It is shown that the strategies that arise for the three possible hunger states have different distributions among known strategies and also differ from a baseline experiment in which agents are evolved to play prisoner's dilemma without any form of differential utility.},

abstract={Analyses of body size of abyssal polychaetes were made from sites experiencing different levels of nutrient flux in the and Atlantic Oceans. Measuring polychaetes was problematical due to high levels of fragmentation, and width of the first chaetiger was used as a surrogate for body size. Results indicated that polychaetes were significantly smaller in Atlantic areas experiencing seasonal or periodic input of phytodetritus. This observation held not just for comparison of sizes of the total assemblage but also when comparisons were made at the family and species level. Not all families showed a response. In the Atlantic, individuals belonging to the families Cirratulidae, Spionidae and Sabellidae indicated size differences, while in the Pacific spionids were significantly smaller from phytodetrital sites. At the species level, six species - all deposit feeders - were significantly smaller from phytodetrital sites, while two nominally predator/omnivore species showed an increase in size. Two hypotheses for the size frequency of the Atlantic populations from phytodetrital sites are suggested - the juvenile recruitment hypothesis where the smaller population body size is because of an influx of newly recruited juveniles; and the allometric plasticity hypothesis which postulates a physiological response from populations from non-phytodetrital areas delaying reproduction and putting more energy into growth, hence resulting in a larger body size. It is hypothesised that the larger size in non-phytodetrital sites may be a response to starvation.},

abstract={OBJECTIVES. The aim of this study was to study the influences of child and maternal feeding behavior on weight gain and failure to thrive in the first year of life. METHODS. The Millennium Infant Study recruited a population birth cohort in Northeast England shortly after birth and studied them prospectively to the age of 13 months. Parents completed questionnaires at 6 weeks and 4, 8, and 12 months. Appetite was rated on a 5-point scale at each age, and a core group of questions was used to generate scores of oromotor dysfunction, avoidant eating behavior, maternal feeding anxiety, and response to food refusal. Routinely collected weights were used to assess weight gain using the thrive index (TI); weight faltering was defined as TI below the 5th percentile from birth to age 6 weeks or 4, 8, or 12 months. RESULTS. Of 923 eligible infants, 75% of the mothers returned at least 1 questionnaire and ≥2 weights. Weight gain to 6 weeks was independently related to appetite and oromotor dysfunction rated at 6 weeks. Appetite rated at 6 weeks and 12 months both independently predicted weight gain to 12 months. Some avoidant eating behavior was seen in most children by 12 months old, but there was no relationship with weight gain or faltering after adjustment for appetite. However, the extent to which caregivers responded to food refusal was a significant inverse predictor of weight gain, even after adjustment for appetite. CONCLUSIONS. Inherent child appetite characteristics seem to be an important risk factor for weight faltering and failure to thrive, but high maternal promotion of feeding may also have an adverse influence.

abstract={The observation that low birth weight is associated with cardiovascular disease and its risk factors has formed the basis for the 'developmental origins' hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that the operation of adverse influences during intrauterine life leads to permanent alterations in structure and physiology of the adult phenotype which predispose to a range of common adult diseases. The process is known as developmental plasticity or programming and is strongly supported by studies in experimental animals. Recent evidence suggests that the same processes may affect the development of the immune system and play a part in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease. Animal studies show that the intrauterine environment has powerful and long-lasting effects on many aspects of immune function. The corresponding human evidence, though preliminary, suggests that birth weight or other markers of the early environment are associated with a range of autoimmune diseases. © 2006 SAGE Publications.},

abstract={Nutritional and other environmental cues during development can permanently alter the structure, homeostatic systems, and functions of the body. This phenomenon has been referred to as 'programming'. Epidemiological and animal studies show that programmed effects operate within the normal range of growth and development, and influence the risk of chronic disease in adult life. We review the evidence that these effects include reduced nephron number and compensatory adaptations, which might lead to hypertension, and perhaps accelerate the decline in renal function that accompanies aging. These processes might be exacerbated by programmed changes in vascular structure and function, and alterations in endocrine and metabolic homeostasis. Programmed effects might be initiated as early as the periconceptual phase of development, and could involve epigenetic changes in gene expression or altered stem cell allocation. Better understanding of these processes could lead to the development of novel diagnostic and preventive measures, and to early detection of at-risk individuals. By monitoring blood pressure, weight, and renal function in children, it might be possible to reduce the risk of cardiovascular and renal disease in later life. ©2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract={Background: Depression is associated with high mortality in haemodialysis (HD) patients, and can be associated with the poor oral intake that contributes to malnutrition. Malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrome (MICS) causes increased morbidity and mortality in HD patients. We investigated relationships between depressive affect, social support and various components of MICS in HD patients. Methods: The subjects were 110 patients (65 men and 45 women, mean age 45.39 ± 14.73 years) on maintenance HD. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Cognitive Depression Index (CDI), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) were used to assess aspects of depressive affect in each subject. Results: The mean dialysis duration was 53.04 ± 38.15 months. The mean BDI and CDI scores were 12.10 ± 7.43 and 8.40 ± 5.72, respectively. Patients were divided into two subgroups according to CDI score (depressive affect >10 (n = 71) and non-depressive affect ≤10 (n = 39)). CDI score was correlated with malnutrition-inflammation score (MIS) (r = 0.24; P < 0.05), haemoglobin level (r = -0.23; P < 0.05) and MSPSS score (r = -0.28; P < 0.01). The subgroup with depressive affect had higher MIS (P < 0.01) and lower social support (P = 0.001) than the non-depressive affect group. Logistic regression analysis identified high MIS and low MSPSS score as independent risk factor for depression. Conclusions: The results suggest that MIS and MSPSS are the strongest predictors of depressive affect in HD patients. Further research is needed to understand the causal relationship between depressive affect and MICS in HD patients. © 2006 The Authors.},

abstract={Accidental hypothermia, in older people, is a potentially fatal yet often preventable medical emergency. It may remain un-recognised as older people do not always complain of feeling cold, or because the presentation is subtle and non-specific, such as a change in personality or impaired judgement. The clinical signs and symptoms of mild hypothermia can mimic cognitive decline, stroke or hypothyroidism. Furthermore, hypothermia may be the presentation of other serious pathology, e.g. acute abdomen or septic shock. Failure to recognize atypical presentations and initiate early treatment increases morbidity and mortality. Thus a high index of suspicion, prompt identification and efficient emergency management are required. This article provides an overview of the epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, treatment and prevention of accidental hypothermia in older people.},

abstract={To develop a conceptual understanding of the interaction between tourists and bears, this study examined the responses of brown bears (Ursus arctos) to experimentally introduced tourism at Douglas River in south-central Alaska within the framework of current predator-prey theory. Factors eliciting displacement and the nutritional consequences of behavioral changes were measured. GPS collars were deployed to track temporal and spatial resource use and scan and focal observations were used to quantify foraging efficiency, vigilance behavior, and bear use of various food resources. Total food intake was quantified by combining data on food resource use based on GPS locations and foraging efficiency was measured using spotting scopes from long distances. Seasonal food availability and quality were monitored and utilized as co-variates in comparisons between pre-treatment and treatment years. Though the bear population exhibited significant behavioral differences between the presence and absence of humans, changes in behavior generally mediated effects on total food intake. Adult males at a salt marsh viewing area were the only sex/age class exhibiting reduced food intake resulting from a 15% decline in foraging time when viewers were present. Salmon intake did not differ between pre-treatment and treatment years despite a 10% decline in time spent fishing when viewers were present. The tightly controlled experimental bear-viewing introduced in this study allowed bears to evaluate predation risk associated with human activity and optimally respond to minimize costs due to changes in foraging activities. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Carotenoids are important for various functions during chick development. Since these pigments cannot be synthesized, they can be considered limited resources that the mother optimally allocates between herself and her offspring (maternal effect). Some studies have examined the effects of carotenoids on growth and immune function but little is known about their role in behaviour. In this study of the grey partridge, we conducted two supplementation experiments: (1) laying females were fed with β-carotene enriched or impoverished diets; (2) chicks were fed directly with β-carotene enriched or impoverished diets. We then evaluated the effects of this carotenoid on chick growth, immunocompetence and anti-predator behaviour (reactions to a raptor model). In the first experiment, the β-carotene enriched diet given to mothers did not cause any difference in chick physiology. In the second experiment, β-carotene supplementation of chicks had a significant beneficial effect on their growth and immune response, although their behavioural reactions did not differ in relation to the diet. Therefore, β-carotene supplementation had beneficial effects on growth and immunocompetence only when directly supplied to chicks. The beneficial effect reported in other species for begging or pecking behaviours was not confirmed for the anti-predator behaviour of grey partridge chicks. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Amongst the benefits of foraging in flocks are the enhancement of food finding and predation avoidance. Characteristics such as size, individual position, as well as position and distance between members are factors that may influence vigilance and foraging. In a study using scaled doves, Columbina squammata, I observed a negative correlation between group size and vigilance and a positive correlation with time spent foraging, which suggests a reduction of costs and an increase of benefits as a consequence of larger group sizes. Individual position in the flock appeared to be an important factor in this trade-off. Peripheral individuals were more vigilant and foraged less than central ones, suggesting an edge effect in flocks of this species. The clustering of conspecifics may be related with fast transmission of information. Overall, aggressive interactions were rarely observed; when registered, they occurred mostly in larger groups, suggesting an effect of interference competition. These results imply that predation may be a strong pressure on the scaled dove's flock formation and behaviour. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We examined food items cached by arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii) from boreal-steppe meadows of southwest Yukon Territory, Canada. Caches recovered from two sites are dominated by fruits and seeds of either northern comandra (Geocaulon lividum) or prickly rose (Rosa acicularis). These two taxa are relatively rare in the local flora at the study sites (Site 1: ≥32 available taxa, and Site 2: ≥39 available taxa), suggesting they are selectively cached as preferred items. Cache selectivity may be related to perishability, fruit size/seed abundance, and predation risk. These caches are of significantly different composition than caches from present tundra sites and Pleistocene fossil arctic ground squirrel nests and caches (middens) recovered from central Yukon. These findings suggest that although arctic ground squirrels evolved in open tundra, they can subsist on a variety of cache items and may have the ability to adapt to and select a profitable cache within a variety of boreal and tundra habitats. © 2006 Regents of the University of Colorado.},

abstract={The use of tool or tool-like food processing behaviours can render animals vulnerable to theft (kleptoparasitism) because (1) large, nutritious items are usually involved, (2) value is added to the food due to long and/or complex handling, and (3) physical control of items is often temporarily lost during handling. In Barbados, Carib grackles (Quiscalus lugubris) immersing items in water before consumption (a behaviour known as food dunking) lose a larger proportion of items to conspecific food thieves than grackles that do not dunk. In this paper, we first show that dunking in Carib grackles functions as a proto-tool food-processing technique that speeds up ingestion. We then examine five potential predictors of kleptoparasitism: only conspecific density and loss of physical control on food were found to influence the probability that birds would be attacked and successfully robbed of food by conspecifics. Grackles could reduce the probability of kleptoparasitism by holding items in the bill while dunking and engaging in head-up displays. These behaviours were used flexibly depending on variation in the risk of kleptoparasitism. We suggest that costs like the ones incurred from theft might limit the profitability and frequency of tool and proto-tool food processing behaviours, creating a context where counter-strategies might be selected. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Objective: Impulsivity is generally believed to be more characteristic of individuals with "bulimic" than with "restrictive" eating disorders (EDs). However, studies have not exhaustively explored the association between EDs and various component dimensions of the impulsivity construct. Method: We conducted a multidimensional assessment of impulsivity in 84 women with bulimia nervosa (BN), 37 with anorexia nervosa (AN: 19 " restricters" and 18 "bingers-purgers"), and 61 normal-control participants. To assess multiple components of impulsivity, participants completed a battery of self-report questionnaires and a performance test. Results: Compared with normal-control participants, all ED groups showed attentional problems. However, only women suffering BN or AN-binge purge subtype showed elevations on motoric forms of impulsivity, whereas women with BN were the only group to report tendencies toward reckless behavior. Conclusion: These findings suggest that binge-eating behavior coincides with problems of response inhibition, whereas a risk-taking attitude may be a unique characteristic of individuals with BN. © 2006 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We also found decreased (not increased) use of socially acquired information by rats choosing between unfamiliar foods when exposed to direct cues of predation risk (experiment 2). Furthermore, experiences of gastrointestinal upset following ingestion of unfamiliar foods (intended to act as a cue to the presence of toxic potential foods) failed to increase rats' use of social information when choosing between additional unfamiliar foods (experiment 3). The results of our experiments thus failed to confirm predictions of several formal models of the effects of costs of individual assessment of alternatives on use of socially acquired information. © 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={1. In a correlative study, we investigated the relative importance of fish predation, refuge availability and resource supply in determining the abundance and size distributions of the introduced and omnivorous signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) in lakes and streams. Moreover, the biomass and food selection of predatory fish was estimated in each habitat type and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen were measured in perch (Perca fluviatilis), the dominant predator in the lakes, and in its potential food sources (crayfish, juvenile roach and isopods). 2. In lakes, crayfish were the most frequent prey in large perch (46%), followed by other macroinvertebrates (26%, including the isopod Asellus aquaticus) and small fish (25%). Crayfish and fish dominated the gut contents of large perch with respect to biomass. Nitrogen signatures showed that perch were one trophic level above crayfish (approx. 3.4‰) and a two-source mixing model using nitrogen isotope values indicated that crayfish (81%) contributed significantly more to perch isotope values than did juvenile roach (19%). A positive correlation was found between the abundance of crayfish and the biomass of large perch. Crayfish abundance in lakes was also positively correlated with the proportion of cobbles in the littoral zone. Lake productivity (chlorophyll a) was positively correlated with crayfish size, but not with crayfish abundance. 3. In streams, brown trout (Salmo trutta) were the most abundant predatory fish. Gut contents of large trout in a forested stream showed that terrestrial insects were the most frequently found prey (60%), followed by small crayfish (27%) and isopods (27%). In contrast to lakes, the relative abundance of crayfish was negatively correlated with the total biomass of predatory fish and with total biomass of trout. However, abundance of crayfish at sites with a low biomass of predatory fish varied considerably and was related to substratum grain size, with fewer crayfish being caught when the substratum was sandy or dominated by large boulders. The mean size of crayfish was greater at stream sites with a high standing stock of periphyton, but neither predator biomass nor substratum grain size was correlated with crayfish size. 4. Our results suggest that bottom-up processes influence crayfish size in lakes and streams independent of predator biomass and substratum availability. However, bottom-up processes do not influence crayfish abundance. Instead, substratum availability (lakes) and interactions between predation and substratum grain size (streams) need to be considered in order to predict crayfish abundance. © 2006 The Authors.},

abstract={Larvae of the California newt (Taricha torosa) exhibit striking predator-avoidance behavior, escaping to refuges in response to a chemical cue from cannibalistic adults. In laboratory flow-tank experiments, stream water collected near free-ranging adults induced hiding responses in 100% of the larvae tested. Solutions prepared by bathing adults (in field and laboratory) also evoked strong hiding behaviors. Insensitive to adult feeding status (fed or starved), and clearly not an excretory product, the chemical cue was released from adult skin (i.e., in swabs of adult backs, sides, and bellies). Tetrodotoxin (TTX) was found in skin swabs of adults and in bathwater at 1 × 10-7 mol/L using reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Concentrations of 1 × 10-7 to 1 × 10-9 mol/L TTX standard, and equivalent dilutions of bathwater, triggered hiding behaviors in larvae, with no subsequent sublethal toxicity. The presence of TTX-sensitive cells within larval olfactory epithelium was confirmed by behavioral experiments and electrophysiological recordings. In contrast, larvae did not hide in response to two other, structurally mimetic compounds (saxitoxin and μ-conotoxin GIIIB). Ontogenetically, larval behavioral responses to TTX and bathwater were strongest during weeks 3-5, diminishing to nil during week 7. No longer susceptible to adult cannibalism, larval indifference to the cue coincided with their ability to climb out of water and onto land. Thus, newt larvae escape cannibalism by detecting a poison (TTX) well known as a chemical defense for conspecific adults. Eliciting a behavioral response in one case and inhibiting neural activity in the other, this compound results in opposing physiological effects, with avoiding predation as the common goal. Accordingly, TTX joins a select group of keystone molecules, each having critical, but different, ecological consequences at multiple trophic levels. The unique combination of bioactive properties makes a compelling case for asymmetrical selection as a force driving the evolution of adult-larval trophic interactions. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Feeding behavior of carnivorous and herbivorous organisms is commonly explained in terms of nutritional requirements. However, feeding behavior of omnivorous organisms is difficult to predict and may not be based on nutritional requirements alone. To assess the plasticity of feeding behaviors exhibited by an omnivore, we conducted a feeding experiment using juvenile signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus (Dana, 1852)), both alone and in the presence of conspecifics and predators. Crayfish were presented with three types of food (chironomids, mayflies, and woody debris) in experimental enclosures, and the food type consumed and time to consumption were recorded. Although the same overall food choice (chironomid larvae) was made in all trials, the time it took for the juvenile crayfish to make a food selection was longer in the presence of adult conspecifics (both male and female) and adult cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii (Richardson, 1836)). Food selection also took longer, although not significantly, in the presence of conspecific juvenile crayfish, and no changes in behavior were noted in the presence of young-of-the-year (YOY) cutthroat trout. The altered behavior of the juvenile crayfish observed in the presence of adult fish and crayfish can lead to context-dependent effects of this omnivore on its community. Ecologists must be increasingly aware that the feeding of omnivores may not be solely based on nutritional criteria. © 2006 NRC.},

abstract={Stallion castration is one of the most common surgical procedures performed on horses. The opening of the abdominal cavity and the work with finger thick blood-vessels make this operation liable to frequent complications. Regularly, castrations have serious, often deadly complications such as: haemorrhage; prolapse of intestine or omentum; wound infection; funiculitis and peritonitis. Laparoscopic castration leaving the testicles in situ is a less invasive alternative to more conventional techniques of castration. However, with large horses and in individual cases the laparoscopic method leaves remnants of active testicular tissue and has the disadvantage of not completely eliminating stallion behaviour. The aim of this study was to evaluate a laparoscopic castration technique for smaller stallion breeds with regard to its practicability, advantages and disadvantages, complications and postoperative behaviour of the stallions. The study involved 15 two year old Icelandic stallions and 5 one-year-old stallions of a small horse breed. For better visualization within the abdomen the animals were starved for a period of 36 hours prior to the operation. All stallions were sedated and laparoscopically castrated standing in the stocks. The operation was preceded by the establishment of a capnoperitoneum and of two transabdominal ports under local anaesthesia: one for the laparoscope and one for the instruments. The plica vasculosa including the deferent duct was ligated as close as possible to the anulus vaginalis by a double Roeder knot. The testicles remained in situ. The operated horses underwent a daily check-up within the first week post surgery. A final examination took place 6 months after the operation. The following parameters were measured: Body temperature before and within the first 8 days after the operation; testosterone levels before and 8 days after the operation; the size of the testicles before and 6 months after the operation. Additionally an HCG stimulation test was carried out 6 months post surgery in order to identify possible remnants of active testicular tissue. There were no major or life threatening complications during the castration. Difficulties occurred owing to poor visualization because of bleeding from small vessels of the plica vasculosa; an insufficient overview because of a full bladder or intestines; or through an unintentional loosening of the ligature after the ends of the suture were trimmed. In one case a one sided lameness of the hind limb was observed but disappeared the following day. All incisions healed by primary intention. With practice by the surgeon a decrease in average operation time from 153 minutes in the beginning down to 50 minutes was observed after 20 operations. The day after the operation all patients showed an average increase of body temperature of 0.63°C. The procedure did not always result in complete resorption of testicular tissue. Six months after the castration eight cases still had one testicle. In three cases two testicles remained. In 6 of 18 cases (33%) the HCG simulation test was positive 6 months after the operation indicating incomplete castration With regard to complications in wound healing, haemorrhage or intestinal prolapse this method of castration appears very safe. A further risk is minimized by avoiding general anaesthesia. Furthermore there is a relatively short convalescence because there are only small incisions in the abdominal wall. Disadvantages to this procedure include: the requirement of considerable staff and equipment; considerable surgical expertise; the need of an HCG simulation test to check the result of the castration. The contractual duties accepted with the undertaking of a castration of a healthy stallion are firstly to eliminate reproductive ability and secondly to prevent reproductive instinct and stallion behaviour. In this regard it is critical to note that 4 of the 20 laparoscopically castrated stallions still exhibited stallion behaviour and that 6 animals showed a positive HCG stimulation test. The described method is to be used only after a thorough explanation to the owner. In most cases a castration through orchidectomy under general anaesthesia with suturing of the processus vaginalis and suturing of the wound will be the better alternative in spite of the anaesthetic risk. The result of routine surgery is more certain, faster and forensically less contestable.},

abstract={The present study was to compare the weight-control behaviour of Korean (KS) and German (GS) female students. 548 students were interviewed. Approx. 48 % of the KS and 53 % of the GS are content with their figures. One third of the interviewed find themselves a little too fat although their BM1 is in the range of normal weight. In general, KS are less content with their appearance than GS. 18 % of the KS and 4 % of the GS only weigh themselves daily. Nearly 90 % of the KS would like to lose weight while 40 % of the GS do not. 73 % of the KS and 59 % of the GS already tried to lose weight. For 40 % of the KS and 54 % of the GS "looking better" is the most important reason for a diet. 20 % of the KS and 34 % of the GS succeeded in losing weight while ca. 48 % of the KS and 18 % of the GS stopped dieting. To reduce weight, about two thirds of the KS and GS ate less (e. g. no snacks, no sweets). 50 % of the KS and 59 of the GS tried to reduce weight by more physical activity (sports, e.g.). TV (50.2 %), friends (47.4 %) and newspapers/journals (36.9 %) were essential sources of pertinent information. The results have shown that KS are more interested in a diet than GS. The majority of KS hence tries several methods for weight reduction which, however, are less promising and which are not based on a lasting change in nutrition. It is, therefore, necessary to intensify cooperation among those concerned (e.g., dietitians, teachers, parents, media) and to develop a weight-control program considering lifestyle and daily rhythm and combining physical actvity, nutrition and behavioural and personality training.},

abstract={Using the mouse as a model organism in pharmaceutical research presents unique advantages as its physiology in many ways resembles the human physiology, it also has a relatively short generation time, low breeding and maintenance costs, and is available in a wide variety of inbred strains. The ability to genetically modify mouse embryonic stem cells to generate mouse models that better mimic human disease is another advantage. In the present study, a comprehensive phenotypic screening protocol is applied to elucidate the phenotype of a novel mouse knockout model of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 4-γ. HNF4-γ is expressed in the kidneys, gut, pancreas, and testis. The first level of the screen is aimed at general health, morphologic appearance, normal cage behaviour, and gross neurological functions. The second level of the screen looks at metabolic characteristics and lung function. The third level of the screen investigates behaviour more in-depth and the fourth level consists of a thorough pathological characterisation, blood chemistry, haematology, and bone marrow analysis. When compared with littermate wild-type mice (HNF4-γ+/+), the HNF4-γ knockout (HNF4-γ-/-) mice had lowered energy expenditure and locomotor activity during night time that resulted in a higher body weight despite having reduced intake of food and water. HNF4-γ-/- mice were less inclined to build nest and were found to spend more time in a passive state during the forced swim test. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

EPM results showed that the longer the exposition to the deficient diet, the lower the anxiety of malnourished animals, a result similar to that produced by the treatment with DZ.

abstract={Laboratory animals, when subjected to behavioural tests, are often motivationally primed by a period of prior water or food restriction. To date, it is still debatable which restriction protocol (water versus food) is more appropriate for different species. In general, a protocol is considered appropriate if animal discomfort is kept to a minimum whilst motivation for the task is maximised. Here we present a comparison study of the effects of water versus food restriction protocols in mice. The characterisation of the physiological and behavioural effects of food and water restriction in mice is beneficial for both institutional animal care centres and the scientific community. We have investigated body weight fluctuations in three groups of C57BL/6J female mice (water-restricted, food-restricted and control) in two different protocols (20 h versus 22 h of restriction per day) over 2 consecutive weeks. Subsequently, a selected number of mice from each group were subjected to a battery of behavioural tests to investigate exploratory, emotional and dominance behaviours, in addition to learning and memory processes. Body weight fluctuations suggested that mice tolerate a water restriction regimen better than a comparable food restriction regimen. Furthermore, behavioural performances demonstrated that food-restricted mice show a reduction in the exploration of a new environment and particular aspects of their timing memories are distorted. Finally, both water- and food-restricted mice tended to be more offensive than control mice when paired with an opponent in a social dominance test condition. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Accumulating evidence has suggested that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a role in eating behaviours, and that BDNF-heterozygous (+/-) mice exhibit abnormal behaviours (e.g. obesity, anxiety and aggression). The present study was undertaken to determine whether or not dietary restriction (DR) alters the behaviours in BDNF+/- mice, as DR has been shown to exert a number of beneficial effects on the brain. Eight-week-old male wild-type (+/+) and BDNF+/- mice were divided into two groups, ad libitum (AL) diet group and DR group, for 16 weeks. After carrying out a behavioural evaluation, we determined the BDNF mRNA levels, as well as mRNA levels for subtypes (5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C) of the 5-HT receptor and 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), protein levels of BDNF and concentrations of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and frontal cortex. DR significantly ameliorated behaviours including obesity, anxiety and aggression in BDNF+/- mice. The concentrations of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the frontal cortex, and 5-HT in the hippocampus, of BDNF+/- mice were significantly lower than those of wild-type mice. Interestingly, DR significantly increased the levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the frontal cortex of BDNF+/- mice. These findings suggest that DR may alter the behaviours in BDNF+/- mice, and that the 5-HT system may be implicated in the beneficial effects of DR on these behaviours. © The Authors (2006).},

abstract={Food and predators are thought to have independent effects on avian reproductive success. Several studies have now shown that extra food can reduce nest predation rates. Most hypotheses suggest that this is due to changes in adult and/or nestling behaviour. A critical test as to whether behaviour is key, is to examine when predation events occur for birds with and without extra food. If behaviour is important, extra food should lead to fewer nest predation events during the day, when birds are active, but have no effect at night. We conducted a food supplementation experiment on song sparrows and tested for food effects on timing of nest predation events, adult antipredator behaviour and nestling begging behaviour. Food supplementation significantly reduced the relative frequency of daytime nest predation especially during incubation. During incubation, fed females had shorter foraging bouts and longer bouts on the nest, and these behaviours were associated with a reduced probability of being preyed upon. During brooding, we found trends (P < 0.1) towards lower daytime predation and greater adult nest attendance for fed birds than for unfed birds, but nestling begging did not differ with food treatment. Our results show that food availability does influence nest predation through its effect on antipredator behaviour. We highlight the importance of examining adult behaviour and vulnerability to predation at both stages of the nesting period because behavioural changes with extra food were extreme at the egg stage and were more effective at reducing nest predation than were behavioural changes at the nestling stage. © 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={It is commonly assumed that iteroparous fish, once mature, normally reproduce in all consecutive seasons. Recent work has suggested, however, that in Norwegian spring-spawning herring-a population that undertakes extensive spawning migrations-almost one in two adults may skip their second spawning migration. Why should herring not return to spawn the year after first spawning, but instead wait an extra year? For herring, participation in distant, energetically costly, and risky spawning migrations will only pay off in terms of fitness if individuals are sufficiently large, and in sufficient condition, to both successfully migrate and spawn. Changes in the environment and individual condition should therefore affect the likelihood of skipped spawning. This paper describes long-term changes in the extent to which the second reproductive season is skipped in this herring population. These are shown to be linked to the size and condition of herring as first-time spawners, and to climatic factors possibly related to food availability. The findings corroborate the hypothesis that skipped reproduction results from trade-offs between current and future reproduction, growth and survival. © Springer-Verlag 2006.},

Sarcopenia impairs physical ability, reduces quality of life and increases the risk of fall and injury. Since aging is a process of stochastic decline, there may be many factors that impinge on the progression of sarcopenia. Possible factors that may promote muscle decline are contraction-related injury and oxidative stress. However, relatively little is understood about the cellular pathways affecting muscle aging, in part because lifespan studies are difficult to conduct in species with large muscles, such as rodents and primates. For this reason, shorter-lived invertebrate models of aging may be more useful for unraveling causes of sarcopenia and functional declines during aging. Recent studies have examined both physiological and genetic factors that affect aging-related declines in Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. In C. elegans, aging leads to significant functional declines that correlate with muscle deterioration, similar to those documented for longer-lived vertebrates. This article will examine the current research into aging-related functional declines in this species, focusing on recent studies of locomotory and feeding decline during aging in the nematode, C. elegans. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Despite significant sexual dimorphism and differing reproductive strategies in carnivores, sexual segregation is rarely studied and is often overlooked in the management of wild populations. Potential nutritional constraints imposed by sexual dimorphism and differing reproductive strategies between the sexes have important implications, particularly when combined with differential effects of human activities on sex and age classes. We examined the effects of sexual dimorphism, reproductive strategies, and human activities (bear-viewing and hunting) on resource use by different sex and age classes of brown bears (Ursus arctos). Sexual segregation of habitat use and effects of experimental bear-viewing were quantified at a single site in south-central Alaska, USA, by capturing, collaring, and observing brown bears at a salt marsh and salmon stream. Effects of salmon capture rate, availability of alternative salmon runs, harvest pressure, and numbers of annual visitors on sex and age class use were examined from data collected or previously published from 13 other sites. Bear-viewing sites on salmon streams where salmon capture rates were low (<4 salmon/hour) resulted in low use by adult males (<10% of all bears), except for sites with falls. However, maximum male use of viewing areas also depended on the availability of alternative salmon streams and harvest pressure. Use of habitats by females with dependent young was significantly related to the prevalence of adult males at the site. Thus, both sexual dimorphism and differing reproductive strategies led to sexual segregation in habitat use by bears. As a result of infanticide, females with young appear to prioritize avoidance of male bears over avoidance of humans when choosing habitats, in contrast to responses documented in herbivores. Because carnivores often exhibit both sexual dimorphism and infanticide, selection for sexual segregation is likely to be high. In these cases, the nutritional demands of large adult males, balanced with responses to human activity, drive dynamic temporal and spatial distributions of individuals in the population. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

We show here that chimpanzees, one of humans' two closest primate relatives, sometimes attempt to actively conceal things from others. Specifically, when competing with a human in three novel tests, eight chimpanzees, from their first trials, chose to approach a contested food item via a route hidden from the human's view (sometimes using a circuitous path to do so). These findings not only corroborate previous work showing that chimpanzees know what others can and cannot see, but also suggest that when competing for food chimpanzees are skillful at manipulating, to their own advantage, whether others can or cannot see them. © 2006.},

abstract={Animals prenatally exposed to ethanol (E) exhibit behavioral alterations in a wide variety of stressful or challenging tasks. The hypothalamic peptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is known to play a crucial role in integrating an organism's behavioral responses to environmental stressors or challenges. Previous research indicates that E animals exhibit increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) reactivity, including increased hypothalamic CRF expression under both basal and stress conditions. However, the possible role of CRF in mediating the behavioral changes observed in E animals remains to be determined. The current study investigated the hypothesis that E animals may be differentially sensitive to the effects of CRF on behavior in the elevated plus-maze, a task widely used to assess anxiety-like behavior in rodents. Sprague-Dawley offspring from prenatal E, pair-fed (PF), and ad lib-fed control (C) groups were tested at 60-90 days of age. Thirty minutes prior to a 5 min test on the elevated plus-maze, animals received an icv infusion of vehicle (VEH) or CRF (males: 0.75 μg or 1.5 μg; females: 1.0 μg or 2.0 μg). Under VEH conditions, E males showed greater activity (more total arm entries) than PF and C males and both E males and E and PF females showed less anxiety-like behavior (more open arm entries) than their PF and/or C counterparts. As expected, CRF treatment resulted in fewer open arm, closed arm and total arm entries, and total rears in both males and females in all prenatal groups, and increased time in the closed arms in males compared to that in their VEH-treated counterparts. Importantly, the effects of CRF were most pronounced in E animals. That is, when normalized for prenatal group differences following VEH treatment, CRF-treated E males showed fewer total arm entries and total rears than PF and C males, and CRF-treated E and PF females showed fewer open arm entries than C females. These results support and extend previous findings demonstrating that E animals show altered behavior in aversive or stressful situations. While some effects of CRF in females may be mediated partially by nutritional effects of ethanol, the data overall suggest that the behavioral alterations observed in E animals may be due, at least in part, to increased sensitivity to CRF. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Aphids often form mutualistic associations with ants, in which the aphids provide the ants with honeydew and the ants defend the aphids from predators. In this paper, we report aphid egg protection by ants as a novel aspect of the deeply interdependent relationship between a tree-feeding aphid and its attendant ant. The ant Lasius productus harbours oviparous females, males, and eggs of the hinoki cypress-feeding aphid Stomaphis hirukawai in its nests in winter. We investigated the behaviour of ants kept with aphid eggs in petri dishes to examine whether the ants recognise the aphid eggs and tend them or only provide a refuge for the aphids. Workers carried almost all of the aphid eggs into the nest within 24 h. The ants indiscriminately tended aphid eggs collected from their own colonies and those from other ant colonies. The ants cleaned the eggs and piled them up in the nest, and egg tending by ants dramatically increased aphid egg survival rates. Starving the ants showed no significant effect on aphid egg survivorship. Without ants, aphid eggs were rapidly killed by fungi. These results suggested that grooming by the ants protected the aphid eggs, at least, against pathogenic fungi. This hygienic service afforded by the ants seems indispensable for egg survival of these aphids in an environment rich in potentially pathogenic microorganisms. © Springer-Verlag 2006.},

abstract={The principle omega-3 fatty acid in brain, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), accumulates in the brain during perinatal cortical expansion and maturation. Animal studies have demonstrated that reductions in perinatal brain DHA accrual are associated with deficits in neuronal arborization, multiple indices of synaptic pathology including deficits in serotonin and mesocorticolimbic dopamine neurotransmission, neurocognitive deficits, and elevated behavioral indices of anxiety, aggression, and depression. In primates and humans, preterm delivery is associated with deficits in fetal cortical DHA accrual, and children/adolescents born preterm exhibit deficits in cortical gray matter maturation, neurocognitive deficits particularly in the realm of attention, and increased risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia. Individuals diagnosed with ADHD or schizophrenia exhibit deficits in cortical gray matter maturation, and medications found to be efficacious in the treatment of these disorders increase cortical and striatal dopamine neurotransmission. These associations in conjunction with intervention trials showing enhanced cortical visual acuity and cognitive outcomes in preterm and term infants fed DHA, suggest that perinatal deficits in brain DHA accrual may represent a preventable neurodevelopmental risk factor for the subsequent emergence of psychopathology. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Childhood externalizing behavior (aggression, hyperactivity, and conduct disorder) has been increasingly viewed as a public health problem because of its etiology and outcome. The association between malnutrition and externalizing behavior has begun to receive attention. This review summarizes recent empirical findings on malnutrition as a risk factor for the development of externalizing behavior, with an emphasis on micronutrient deficiency, and explores brain dysfunction as a possible mechanism. RECENT FINDINGS: Externalizing behavior is associated with both macromalnutrition (e.g. protein) and micromalnutrition (e.g. iron and zinc). Both prenatal and postnatal malnutrition is implicated. The long-term effects of malnutrition on behavior could be reversible. The effects of docosahexaenoic acid/omega-3 long-chain essential fatty acid on externalizing behavior are more mixed. From animal and human findings, it is hypothesized that malnutrition impairs neurocognitive functioning by reducing neurons, alternating neurotransmitter functioning, and increasing neurotoxicity, and that such neurocognitive impairments predispose to externalizing behavior. SUMMARY: Different lines of evidence support the view that poor nutrition contributes to the development of child behavior problems. More randomized, controlled trials that manipulate nutritional intake and evaluate behavior in children are needed to evaluate the etiological role of nutrition in externalizing behavior in order to inform intervention and prevention efforts. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={Background: In an exploratory positron emission tomography study of postprandial regional cerebral blood flow, which is a marker of neuronal activity, obese men differed from lean men in several brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex. The subjects received a meal proportional to their body size; therefore, the meal volume was different for each person. Objective: We investigated whether differences in the brain responses of obese and lean men to a meal represent satiety or feelings of gastric distension. Design: We studied 9 lean (x- ± SD body fat: 15 ± 5%; age: 33 ± 10 y) and 9 obese (body fat: 31 ± 4%; age: 32 ± 10 y) men given a fixed amount (400 mL) of a liquid meal. We compared their results with those in 11 lean (body fat: 16 ± 5%; age: 35 ± 8 y) and 11 obese (body fat: 33 ± 5%; age: 28 ± 5 y) previously studied men given a meal proportional to their body size. We performed analyses by using a two-level, random-effects approach in the STATISTICAL PARAMETRIC MAPPING software package and a significance level of P ≤ 0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons. Results: Compared with lean men, obese men had consistently less postprandial activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, irrespective of meal size. Conclusion: Because the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the inhibition of inappropriate behavior, satiety, and meal termination, differential responses of neuronal activity to food intake in this area may contribute to a propensity for obesity or to the difficulty in losing weight experienced by obese men. © 2006 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={The evolution of cooperation and altruistic behaviour where individuals forego their own reproduction to help others reproduce can be explained by kin selection. Depending on the costs and benefits provided, altruism can be evolutionarily favoured if it is directed at close relatives. A considerable body of data supports the role of relatedness as a key determinant of cooperation and conflict within societies. However, the role of ecological factors and, in particular, how these costs and benefits interact with relatedness remains poorly understood. By studying 16 colonies, here I show that in a drywood termite ecological factors determine the importance of relatedness. In colonies with limited food supply, nestmates restrict cooperative interactions mainly to close relatives, while non-discriminative cooperation occurs when food is abundant. This shows for the first time directly the interaction between ecological conditions and relatedness in shaping cooperation. © 2006 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Amphibians are known to exhibit phenotypic plasticity in response to variations in predation pressure. Data also indicate that developmental changes can be induced by embryonic exposures to predator non-contact cues. However, the possible consequences of such exposures on larval behavioural activity and sensitivity to chemical cues from predators have remained unexplored. These laboratory experiments examine the effects of predation cues experienced during embryonic development on some morphological and behavioural traits in hatchlings and tadpoles of the common frog (Rana temporaria). Eggs were raised until hatching in the nonlethal presence of either a sympatric predator (larval spotted salamander, Salamandra salamandra), or an allopatric predator (juvenile Turkish crayfish, Astacus leptodactylus), or crushed conspecific tadpoles. Predators were kept either starved, or fed with R. temporaria tadpoles. Embryonic treatments had significant consequences on weight and total length of hatchlings, as well as on the general activity of tadpoles. Olfactometric tests showed that the behavioural responses of tadpoles to chemical cues from the two predators tested were not significantly affected by embryonic treatments. In contrast, embryonic experience showed a significant influence on the behavioural response of tadpoles to chemical cues from crushed conspecifics. These results indicate that the morphology of hatchlings depends on the species and diet of the predators present during embryonic development and demonstrate for the first time that the subsequent activity and chemically mediated antipredator behaviour of tadpoles can be influenced by embryonic experience of the predation risk. © 2006 E.

abstract={This study examined the challenges that HIV-positive women face at different stages of early infant feeding using a longitudinal, qualitative design. The study explored factors influencing infant-feeding decision-making and behavior of HIV-positive mothers and identified characteristics of women and their environments that contributed to success in maintaining exclusivity of their infant feeding practices. The study was undertaken at 3 sites in South Africa. Participants consisted of a purposive sample of 27 women who had a positive HIV test result during antenatal care and were intending to either exclusively breast-feed or exclusively formula-feed their infants. Women were interviewed once antenatally and at 1, 4, 6, and 12 wk postpartum. Just under one-half of the women who initiated breast-feeding maintained exclusivity and over two-thirds of the women who initiated formula-feeding maintained exclusivity. Key characteristics of women who achieved success in exclusivity included the ability to resist pressure from the family to introduce other fluids and to recall key messages on mother-to-child transmission risks and mixed feeding. Among women who maintained exclusive breast-feeding, a strong belief in the benefits of breast-feeding and a supportive home environment was important. For women using formula milk, having resources such as electricity, a kettle, and flask made feeding at night easier. Support for infant feeding that extends beyond the antenatal period is important to enable mothers to cope with new challenges and pressures at critical times during the early postpartum period. © 2006 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={There is often considerable variation in the intensity of behavioural responses of prey to predation cues. The purpose of the current study was to determine the role of standard length (a correlate of age), body condition (a measure of energy reserves, calculated by mass/(standard length)3), and gonadosomatic index (state of reproduction, calculated by gonad mass/body mass) in the responses of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas Rafinesque, 1820) to damage-release alarm cues. Our data indicate that during the nonbreeding season longer/older minnows exhibited significantly increased antipredator responses compared with younger individuals. However, the significance of these correlations ceased during the breeding season. Data from the same trials failed to reveal a significant correlation between the intensity of antipredator behaviour and the body condition before or during the breeding season; the intensity of a minnow's antipredator response was also not significantly correlated with its gonadosomatic index. These data are important in understanding factors affecting antipredator behaviour of minnows, as well as aiding researchers in determining potential time of year confounds in future studies. © 2006 NRC.},

A frequent problem for researchers is setting the periods of the day when each of the main environmental factors operates, because its effects usually decay or increase smoothly from dawn to dusk. We solved this problem by fitting the body mass to time of day with a model generated with a differential approach. This model shows the typical bimodal pattern of daily fattening routines in small birds and allows calculation of the inflexion point, that is, the time of day when the trajectory ends the decelerated period of body mass gain and starts the accelerated increase in body weight. A delay or advance in the inflexion point can be related to environmental stress that may otherwise pass unnoticed. We calculated a mean delay of 10% in the inflexion point in a sample of studies with limited food availability, and a mean advance of 6% in a sample of studies with increased predation risk. The change in the shape of daily trajectories of body mass between stressful and nonstressful conditions was inversely correlated with body mass at dawn. © 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={I studied the foraging ecology of Coquerel's Coua (Coua coquereli) and Giant Coua (Coua gigas), which occur in the dry forest in west Madagascar. This kind of forest is characterised by an alternating of a dry and a rainy season. The foraging behaviour was described in several dimensions: i.e. height and proportion of perching, rate of capture (estimating the food availability), foraging techniques, substrates used, type and size of the captured prey. Their foraging behaviour was different according to the season and to the proximity of water. Habitat structure was important to take in consideration to study their foraging behaviour. They tended to use the same pattern of techniques and substrates, but differed by the proportions they used these variables and also by the possibility to climb into the dense understorey vegetation. Seasonal variation has probably an important effect on the prey availability and the nature of prey captured. The diet of both species is also discussed. I suggest that change in habitat structure and resources levels could be important to take in consideration for the conservation of these forest birds. To cite this article: P. Chouteau, C. R.

abstract={Birds may react to the presence of humans with an immediate primary behavioural reaction and with physiological responses, such as the activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. This study investigates the suite of behavioural and adrenocortical responses to the presence of humans and to handling in two subspecies of blue tits Parus caeruleus, a small hole-nesting passerine, during the period of feeding their nestlings. The first aim was to investigate whether the presence of humans near their nests elicits an adrenocortical response and whether the increase in circulating corticosterone is correlated with the behavioural reaction of the birds. The second aim was to determine the time-lag between the onset of capture and handling stress and the increase in circulating corticosterone levels. The third aim was to try to explain individual variation in the adrenocortical response to handling with 9 intrinsic and extrinsic factors (sex, age, body size, measures of body condition, time of day, and date). One half of the parents showed a behavioural reaction to our presence near the nest, such as alarming, and hesitating to enter the nestbox. However, the degree of behavioural reaction before handling was not related to circulating corticosterone levels which remained low. The results confirm that primary behavioural and adrenocortical reactions to the presence of predators are independent of each other. A comparison with published findings supports the hypothesis that birds react to predators with an adrenocortical response only in a situation that is imminently life-threatening. Hence, the primary behavioural response of the bird to a predator may determine whether or not an adrenocortical response is elicited. An adrenocortical response to handling started 3 min after capture in the nest box. Individual variation in baseline corticosterone levels could be explained by subspecies and body condition (fat stores), variation in handling-induced corticosterone levels by subspecies, body condition, body size, and time of day. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Substantial work has shown that rats although identical in stock, sex, age, and housing conditions can differ considerably in terms of behavior and physiology. Such individual differences, which can be detected by specific behavioral screening tests, are rather stable, that is, they probably reflect a behavioral disposition or trait. Here, we asked whether and how such differences might affect performance in a task of spatial learning and memory, the radial maze. As in our previous work, we used the degree of rearing activity in a novel open field to assign male adult outbred Wistar rats into those with high versus low rearing activity (HRA/LRA rats). They were then tested in a plus-maze for possible differences in anxiety-related behavior. Finally, and most importantly, they were food deprived and underwent maze training using an 8-arm radial maze with four non-baited and four baited arms. One of these arms consistently contained a larger bait size than the other three. In the open field, HRA rats not only showed more rearing behavior, but also more locomotor activity than LRA rats. In the plus-maze, HRA rats again showed more locomotion, but did not differ in open arm time or percentage of open arm entries, that is, conventional measures of anxiety-related behavior. In the radial maze, HRA rats consistently needed less time to consume all pellets than LRA rats, which was due to faster locomotion on the arms and less time spent at the food pits (especially in baited arms) of HRA rats. During the initial days of training, they were also more efficient in obtaining all food pellets available. Furthermore, HRA rats visited more arms and made relatively less reference memory errors than LRA rats. This allowed them to forage food quickly, but was paralleled by more working memory errors than in LRA rats. In general, working memory errors were more frequent in the arm with the large bait size, but there were no indications that HRA and LRA rats responded differently dependent on reward size. Finally, LRA rats lost slightly more weight than HRA rats during the period of food deprivation. These results are discussed with respect to the role of cognitive and motivational mechanisms, which as subject-inherent factors can contribute substantially to inter-individual variability in the radial maze. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

To test this hypothesis, we compared lateralized and nonlateralized fish, obtained through selective breeding, in a situation requiring the sharing of attention between two simultaneous tasks, prey capture and predator vigilance. Food-deprived individual Girardinus falcatus had to enter a compartment adjacent to the home tank to capture live brine shrimps either in the presence or in the absence of a live predator placed at some distance. When no hazard was present, lateralized and nonlateralized fish did not differ in rate of prey capture. However, when the predator was visible, lateralized fish were twice as fast at catching shrimps as were nonlateralized fish. A fine analysis of fish movements revealed that lateralized fish tended to monitor the predator with one eye and to use the other eye for catching prey, whereas nonlateralized fish swapped between tasks, using each eye for both functions. © 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Imperiled species that have been translocated or established in captivity can show rapid alterations in morphology and behavior, but the proximate mechanisms of such phenotypic changes are rarely known. Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis) are endemic to a single desert pool and are characterized by a small body, large head and eyes, and lack of pelvic fins. To lessen the risk of extinction, additional populations of C. diabolis were established in artificial refuges. Yet, pupfish in these refuges rapidly shifted to a larger body, smaller head and eyes, and greater body depth. Here we examined how food availability and temperature, which differ between these habitats, influence morphological development in closely related Amargosa River pupfish (Cyprinodon nevadensis amargosae). We were interested in knowing whether these environmental factors could developmentally shift Amargosa River pupfish toward the morphology typical of pupfish in Devil's Hole. By regulating food ration, we created groups of pupfish with low, medium and high growth rates. Pupfish with low growth showed proportionally larger head and eyes, smaller body depth, and reduction in pelvic fin development. Elevated temperature further inhibited pelvic fin development in all treatments. Pupfish in the low growth group also showed reduced levels of thyroid hormone, suggesting a possible physiological mechanism underlying these morphological changes. To test this mechanism further, pupfish were reared with goitrogens to pharmacologically inhibit endogenous thyroid hormone production. Pupfish given goitrogens developed larger heads and eyes, shallower bodies, and reduced pelvic fins. Taken together, our results suggest that changes in environmental factors affecting the growth and thyroid hormone status of juvenile pupfish may play a developmental role in generating the morphological differences between C. diabolis in Devil's Hole and the refuges. These findings illustrate the need to incorporate a mechanistic understanding of phenotypic plasticity into conservation strategies to preserve imperiled fishes.},

abstract={In birds, sibling competition encompasses several activities, one of which is jostling for position, that is, competing for the location in the nest where parents predictably deliver food items. We hypothesized that nestlings that compete by jostling for position may fall out of the nest either accidentally or because siblings push each other to reduce brood size. This hypothesis predicts that in a competitive environment needy nestlings trade-off the benefit of being fed against the cost of falling out of the nest. As a first attempt to evaluate this hypothesis, we experimentally manipulated the number of young per brood in the colonial Alpine swift, Apus melba. Nestlings fell out of their colony more frequently when reared in enlarged than in reduced broods. Because brood size manipulation affects not only the number of young per nest but also their body condition, we analysed an extended data set to disentangle these two factors. This analysis showed that, independently of brood size, nestlings in poor condition and those reared in broods where sibling differed markedly in weight were more likely to disappear from the colony. Nestling disappearance also occurred predominantly in nests close to the colony entrances. Although nestling swifts can wander in the colony and become adopted in neighbouring nests, we found no evidence that wandering per se increased the risk of falling out of the colony. Our study therefore highlights a novel cost of scramble competition. © 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Invertebrate neuroscience has provided a number of very informative model systems that have been extensively utilized in order to define the neurobiological bases of animal behaviours (Sattelle and Buckingham in Invert Neurosci 6:1-3, 2006). Most eminent among these are a number of molluscs, including Aplysia californica, Lymnaea stagnalis and Helix aspersa, crustacean systems such as the crab stomatogastric ganglion and a wide-range of other arthropods. All of these have been elegantly exploited to shed light on the very important phenomenon of the molecular and cellular basis for synaptic regulation that underpins behavioural plasticity. Key to the successful use of these systems has been the ability to study well-defined, relatively simple neuronal circuits that direct and regulate a quantifiable animal behaviour. Here we describe the pharyngeal system of the nematode C. elegans and its utility as a model for defining the genetic basis of behaviour. The circuitry of the nervous system in this animal is uniquely well-defined. Furthermore, the feeding behaviour of the worm is controlled by the activity of the pharynx and this in turn is regulated in a context-dependent manner by a simple nervous system that integrates external signals, e.g. presence or absence of food, and internal signals, e.g. the nutritional status of the animal to direct an appropriate response. The genetics of C. elegans is being effectively exploited to provide novel insight into genes that function to regulate the neuronal network that controls the pharynx. Here we summarise the progress to date and highlight topics for future research. Two main themes emerge. First, although the anatomy of the pharyngeal system is very well-defined, there is a much poorer understanding of its neurochemistry. Second, it is evident that the neurochemistry is remarkably complex for such a simple circuit/behaviour. This suggests that the pharyngeal activity may be subject to exquisitely precise regulation depending on the animal's environment and status. This therefore provides a very tractable genetic model to investigate neural mechanisms for signal integration and synaptic plasticity in a well-defined neuronal network that directs a quantifiable behaviour, feeding. © Springer-Verlag 2006.},

abstract={Intraguild predation (IGP) is common among generalist predators and an important issue in food web theory, because IGP may destabilise communities by increasing extinction of species. Also, IGP may interfere with the effectiveness of generalist predators as biological control agents. In general, occurrence of IGP in laboratory or field studies is inferred from abundance data or direct observations only. We investigated if tracing stable isotopes allows distinction between different types of predation and confirmation of IGP. Wolf spiders were chosen as model organisms for generalist predators; IGP of third instar A. cuneata on second instar P. palustris was investigated in a laboratory experiment. The availability of alternative prey and the complexity of the microhabitat were manipulated, since both factors are thought to facilitate coexistence of predators. Stable isotope analysis documented predation of A. cuneata on P. palustris and predation on alternative prey by both juveniles. Both the presence of alternative prey and the availability of shelter reduced mortality of juvenile P. palustris during the first week. During the second week mortality increased in complex structure without alternative prey presumably due to enhanced activity and cannibalism among starving P. palustris. Thus, microhabitat complexity and prey abundance may foster coexistence of wolf spiders in the field. In conclusion, stable isotope analysis was proven a powerful tool to investigate animal behaviour without direct observation. The method allowed disentangling predator feeding behaviour when more than one type of prey was present. © OIKOS.},

abstract={Rehydration in the triatomine bug Rhodnius prolixus (Stål) is dependent on the blood meal, and water balance regulation is crucial for survival of starving bugs. In an experimental arena with zones at different climatic conditions, starved R. prolixus nymphs prefer a cooler and more humid zone, stopping there more often and for longer periods. This is probably a behavioural adaptation to limit water loss and reduce metabolic rate. In the Venezuelan State of Portuguesa, temperature and humidity were monitored in three kinds of potential refugia during the dry season: (i) in a palm roof; (ii) in a crack of the wall of a house; and (iii) in a palm tree crown. Fluctuations in temperature and saturation deficit are not very different inside and outside the palm roof except during a few hours of the day when the sun is at its zenith. In the crack of the wall, the diurnal temperature range is reduced to 6.5°C compared with 12.4°C outside, and the saturation deficit varies by only 7.6 hPa compared with 28.6 hPa outside. In the palm tree crown, the daily temperature range is only 4.2°C compared with 13.8°C outside, and the saturation deficit is permanently < 5 hPa. The microclimatic conditions in the palm tree crown would appear to be ideal for starving R. prolixus, but this kind of refugium generally harbours low densities of bugs, probably related to a combination of predation, pathogens and lower mean temperature within the crown. Such biotic and abiotic constraints play a lesser role in the less ideal palm roof and wall crack refugia where bugs can proliferate as long as hosts are readily available nearby. © 2006 The Authors.},

abstract={Context: Early age at first sex has been identified as a risk factor for unplanned pregnancy and HIV infection. However, the emotional relationships and physical behaviors that precede first intercourse, and how they differ by sex, also may provide important cues about how to prevent sexual risk behavior. Methods: The precoital activities of 2,051 adolescents aged 17-19 in Cebu, Philippines, are examined using 1998-2000 and 2002 data from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey. The timing and tempo of emotional relationships and physical behaviors for males and females are described. Cox proportional hazards models are used to identify the characteristics associated with age at first sex. Results: Males engage in precoital physical behaviors and first sex at younger ages than females. Although the standard order in which the two sexes engage in emotional relationships for the first time is the same, males progress through the sequence more quickly than females. After adolescents have progressed through the sequence of emotional relationships, there is a gap of a least a year before they begin to have sex. In the multivariate analysis, rapid progression through the sequence of emotional relationships was associated with initiating sex at a younger age for females (hazard ratio, 1.5), but not for males. Conclusion: The period between first date and first sex experienced by both males and females provides an opportunity to ensure that adolescents have access to the information and services that will allow them to make informed choices about sexual behavior.},

abstract={Although previous studies of individual differences in preferences for masculinity in male faces have typically emphasized the importance of factors such as changes in levels of sex hormones during the menstrual cycle, other research has demonstrated that recent visual experience with faces also influences preferences for sexual dimorphism in faces. Adaptation to either masculine or feminine faces increases preferences for novel faces that are similar to those that were recently seen. Here, we replicate this effect and demonstrate that adaptation to masculine or feminine faces also influences the extent to which masculine faces are perceived as trustworthy. These adaptation effects may reflect a proximate mechanism that contributes to the development of face preferences within individuals, underpins phenomena such as imprinting-like effects and condition-dependent face preferences, and shapes personality attributions to faces that play an important role in romantic partner and associate choices.

abstract={Anorexia nervosa (AN) is highly valued by people with the disorder. It is also a highly visible disorder, evoking intense emotional responses from others, particularly those closest to the person. A maintenance model of restricting anorexia nervosa, combining intra- and interpersonal factors is proposed. Four main maintaining factors (perfectionism/cognitive rigidity, experiential avoidance, pro-anorectic beliefs, response of close others) are suggested and the evidence supporting these is examined. These factors need to be integrated with what is known about starvation-related maintenance factors. This model departs from other models of AN in that it does not emphasize the role of weight and shape-related factors in the maintenance of AN; that is, it is culture-free. Implications for clinical practice and research are discussed. © 2006 The British Psychological Society.},

abstract={Poor fetal environments are thought to produce adaptive changes in human developmental trajectories according to the Predictive Adaptive Response hypothesis. Although many studies have demonstrated correlations between indicators of fetal environment and negative adult health outcomes, the adaptive significance of these outcomes is unclear. Our study explicitly tests the adaptive nature of fetal programming in humans. We show that differences in nutritional status at birth are associated with adaptive differences in the sensitivity of adult ovarian function to energetic stress. Women who were born as relatively fat babies do not exhibit ovarian suppression in response to moderate levels of physical activity at adulthood, in contrast to women who were born as skinnier babies. The levels of estradiol in women born in the highest tertile of ponderal index (an indicator of neonatal nutritional status) were 37% and 46% higher, respectively, than levels of estradiol in women born in the low and middle ponderal index tertiles. These findings suggest that fetal programming of reproductive function results in developmentally plastic, but essentially adaptive, shifts in set points of ovarian response to energetic stress, such that women who were gestated under conditions of energetic constraint show greater sensitivity to energetic stress in adulthood. Our results have practical implications in terms of behavioral strategies for reducing the risk of breast cancer. We suggest that the amount of activity necessary to reduce levels of estrogen, which may in turn reduce cancer risk, can depend on a woman's nutritional status at birth. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract={Dynamic state-dependent models have been widely developed since 1990s for solving questions in evolutionary ecology. Up to now, these models were mainly run over finite-time horizon. However, for many biological questions an infinite-time horizon perspective could be more appropriate, especially when the end of the modeled period is state- rather than time-dependent. Despite this approach is widely used in the field of economics and operational research, thus far no work has been providing biologists with a general method to solve infinite-time horizon problems. Here we present such a method, through the exhaustive description of an algorithm that we implement to determine the strategy an organism should follow to reach a particular state as fast as possible while limiting mortality risk. To illustrate that method we explored web-building behavior in an orb-weaving spider. How are adult females predicted to build their successive webs to gain energy, grow, and lay their first clutch as fast as possible, without suffering from either predation or starvation? From this example, we first show how an optimal strategy over infinite-time horizon can be processed and selected. Second, we analyse variations of the optimal web-building strategy along with the spider's body weight and predation risk during web building. Our model yields two main predictions: (1) spiders reduce their web size as they are gaining weight due to body-mass-dependent cost of web-building behavior, and (2) this reduction in web size starts at lower weight under higher predation risk. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The sedimentary and plant-associated macroinvertebrate communities have been examined in a series of mesocosm experiments carried out in five locations, in Finland, Sweden, UK, Northwest Spain and Mediterranean Spain (the International Mesocosm Experiment). The experiments were designed to investigate how shallow lake ecosystems respond to the addition of nutrients and planktivorous fish along a climate gradient. Nutrient additions increased sedimentary benthos densities and total biomass to a plateau at intermediate levels of nutrients. The effect was greater in the warmest localities. Beyond the saturation point a further increase in nutrient loading had different effects depending on locality. Only in the southernmost site (in Mediterranean Spain), did it induce a shift to a turbid phase and macrophyte disappearance. Thus there are breakpoints in the relationship with nutrients, leading to alternative sediment communities subsequent to the water alternative states. Presence offish increased the densities and biomass of sediment macroinvertebrates, more clearly in the more southern locality, where the fish Gambusia did not prey in the bottom animals. A stabilising role of macrophytes was observed by cutting them, samples taken three weeks after cutting indicated a higher effect of fish on the sediment community when macrophytes were not present. Nutrients tended also to increase densities of plant associated macro invertebrates at low levels with a flattening of response at intermediate levels and a decline at high levels. At high fish level the numbers and biomass of plant-associated macroinvertebrates were lowered in all cases, because of increased predation. However fish addition at low level in most cases had the opposite effect, because their predation pressure was not high and regeneration of nutrients through their activities might increase food availability and control invertebrate predators. Fish influenced especially community composition, because they prey selectively. Addition of fish at low densities increased macroinvertebrate diversity. A diel migratory cycle was observed in plant-associated macroinvertebrates, but only in the southerly locations. Latitudinal influences on the structure of the macroinvertebrate communities occur but that they operate indirectly. There was a prominent effect of nutrients on these communities so that starting trophy is very important. Fish effects are layered on these and depend to a large extent on the particular range of diet of the species involved. © Asociación Española de Limnología.},

abstract={It has been recognised that life style and nutritional habits may result in increased insulin resistance and risk of diabetes. There is a significant tendency for type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance in the elderly. The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus at the early stage before chronic complications can improve the quality of life and nutritional status and, decreases mortality. Aged-related changes must be taken into account to introduce the medical nutritional theraphy (MNT) for the person with diabetes. The nutritional status of the elderly may well be under attacked by a number of determinants including the difficulties in chewing and swallowing, loss of vision, taste, smell and appetite, and nutrients absorption. Furthermore some diseases such as osteoarthritis, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases in addition to the multiple drug theraphy, may be consistently associated with the changes in the nutritional status of the elderly. Periodical nutritional assesment may be one of the important tool for preventing vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and may also help to restore the MNT. MNT, for older people with diabetes should be individualized with consideration given to the individual's usual food and eating habits, metabolic profile, treatments goals. A daily multivitamin supplement and oral enteral nutrition support may be appropriate for older adults, especially those with reduced energy intake. Exercise increses fat free mass and decreases fatty mass, and improve glucose tolerance. Education of older people with diabetes and caregiver is an important part of therapy. It makes one by one because of differences clinical problems and personality. Self-monitoring is needed for metabolic control of patients.},

Exploratory factor analysis uncovered 3 factors: unconditional permission to eat, eating for physical rather than emotional reasons, and reliance on internal hunger/satiety cues; confirmatory factor analysis suggested that this 3-factor model adequately fit the data after 4 items with factor loadings below.45 were deleted. IES scores were internally consistent and stable over a 3-week period. Supporting its construct validity, IES scores were (a) negatively related to eating disorder symptomatology, body dissatisfaction, poor interoceptive awareness, pressure for thinness, internalization of the thin ideal, and body mass; (b) positively related to several indexes of well-being; and (c) unrelated to impression management.

abstract={This study was carried to investigate the relationship between the affective regulation disorders and obesity: it was assumed that alexithymia is not a secondary psychological result but represents a stable personality trait and constitutes a risk factor for the onset of obesity. The Twenty-Item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) questionnaires were administered to 50 obese patients (body weight mean kg. 114,5), to 60 post-obese subjects after biliopancreatic diversion for obesity (body weight mean kg. 78,1), and to 50 lean healthy controls body weight mean kg. 59,8) to verify this assumption. The prevalence of individuals with alexithymia type personality traits was substantially similar in the two groups of obese and post-obese subjects (30% vs. 37%, respectively), and the TAS-20 scores (mean 55,5 vs. 52,6) essentially overlapped. Furthermore, the bulimic behaviour in both groups of obese and post-obese subjects was positively associated with the difficulties in distinguishing inner feelings from bodily sensations, in accordance with the psychological pattern of alexithymia. Therefore, it can be suggested that in the obese patient alexithymia is a trait independent of body weight and shape. In particular, the difficulty in managing inner feelings can lead the subject to confusing negative emotions and feelings as void for hunger, and drive the patient directly to eating, thus contributing to maintain the patient's obese status.},

abstract={1. An organism's ability to adjust its physiological traits to changes in environmental conditions is central for its ecological success. However, the effect of ecological interactions on physiological flexibility has rarely been investigated. Here we carry out a factorial experiment to analyse how food limitation (a potential result of competition) and tail loss (a potential result of sub-lethal predation) affect anatomical and physiological traits of the South American lizard Liolaemus nitidus. 2. The size of several internal organs was affected by food availability. Small intestine mass increased with food consumption, allowing animals to keep constant digestibility at greater levels of digesta, which in turn permitted higher rates of food assimilation. Organs related to energy storage reached larger sizes in autotomized animals with high food availability, but tail regeneration rate after 3 weeks did not change with food availability. 3. Metabolic rate was affected by tail loss, and animals regenerating their tail showed higher metabolic rates than tailed ones. Because this increase in metabolic rate was independent of internal organ mass, a local effect of tail regeneration process (e.g. cell proliferation) on metabolic rate is suggested. 4. When anatomical and metabolic data are jointly considered it follows that lizards adopt different physiological strategies, changing both energetic inputs and expenditures. This fact illustrates the complex interplay between ecological factors and physiological flexibility, which ultimately determine an organism's fitness. © 2006 The Authors.},

abstract={Studying play behavior in octopuses is an important step toward understanding the phylogenetic origins and function of play as well as the cognitive abilities of invertebrates. Fourteen Octopus vulgaris (7 subadults and 7 adults) were presented 2 Lego objects and 2 different food items on 7 consecutive days under 2 different levels of food deprivation. Nine subjects showed play-like behavior with the Lego objects. There was no significant difference in play-like behavior corresponding to food deprivation, age, and sex of the octopuses. The sequence of behaviors, from exploration to play-like behavior, had a significant influence on the establishment of play-like behavior, as it occurred mostly on Days 3-6 of the 7-day experiment. The pattern of development of play-like activities after a period of exploration and habituation in this study agrees with the hypothesis that object play follows object exploration. A homologous origin of this behavioral trait in vertebrates and invertebrates is highly unlikely, as the last common ancestor might not have had the cognitive capacity to possess this trait.

abstract={Nature-based tourism has experienced a greater increase, and, even although it might have deleterious effects for many wildlife species, its consequences remains little explored. Many lizard species are endangered and tourism has been proposed as a potential factor responsible of the decline of several lizards' populations, but no study has examined the effect of tourism on lizards' behaviour, body condition and health state. Many lizards respond to people as if they were predators, by readily escaping to refuges. However, an increase in the frequency of these antipredatory strategies can lead to a loss of body condition, which may have important consequences for short and long term fitness. We analysed the effects of tourism on escape behaviour of common wall lizards, Podarcis muralis, as well as on their body condition and health state (ectoparasites, blood parasites, and cell mediated immune response). Results showed that lizards did not modify their escape behaviour in response to tourism. Lizards had similar approach and flight distances, and escape strategies regardless of the level of tourism pressure. However, lizards inhabiting areas with high tourism levels, where they presumably needed to perform antipredatory behaviours more often, showed higher intensity of infection by ticks and lower body condition at the end of the breeding period. Moreover, lizards with poorer body condition had lower cell mediated immune responses. Therefore, tourism seems to have deleterious effects on body condition and on host-parasite relationships in this lizard species. These effects should be taking into account when designing walking paths in protected areas. Our study reports evidence that regardless lizards showed similar escape behaviour in tourist than in natural areas, their body condition and health state should be also examined to accurately assess the actual effects of tourism on lizards' populations. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The present study evaluates the pharmacological profile of the new neutral cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-hexyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole -LH-21- on feeding behavior and alcohol self-administration in rats, two behaviors inhibited by cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonists. Administration of LH-21 (0.03, 0.3 and 3 mg/kg) to food-deprived rats resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of feeding. Subchronic administration of LH-21 reduced food intake and body weight gain in obese Zucker rats. Acute effects on feeding were not associated with anxiety-like behaviors, or induction of complex motor behaviors such as grooming or scratching sequences, usually observed after central administration of cannabinoid receptor blockers with inverse agonist properties. LH-21 did not markedly reduce alcohol self-administration (30% reduction observed only at a high dose of 10 mg/kg). This pharmacological pattern partially overlaps that of the reference cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist N-piperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methylpyrazole- 3-carboxamide, SR141716A, (0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg) that reduced feeding and alcohol self-administration with similar efficacy. In vitro analysis of blood-brain barrier permeability using a parallel artificial membrane permeation assay demonstrated that LH-21 has lower permeation through membranes than SR141716A. That was confirmed in vivo by studies showing lower potency of peripherally injected LH-21 when compared to SR141716A to antagonize motor depression induced by intracerebroventricular administration of the CB1 agonist CP55,940. The neutral antagonist profile and the lower penetration into the brain of LH-21 favour this class of antagonists with respect to reference inverse agonists for the treatment of obesity because they potentially will display reduced side effects. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We manipulated offspring age in grey-headed albatrosses, Thalassarche chrysostoma, by swapping chicks between nests. Parents given chicks 6 days older than their own shortened brooding by only 1.2 days, and parents given chicks 6 days younger than their own extended brooding by 1.4 days. Despite being relatively unresponsive to chick age, parents adjusted brooding in relation to calendar date and to chick condition. The results suggest that adults do not use chick age per se as a cue, but instead probably use an internal timer, and fine-tune the decision to end brooding according to date and chick mass. The duration of brood guarding did not correlate with adult body condition, suggesting that adults had a sufficient safety margin to allow them to respond to chick needs without compromising their own residual reproductive value. Chick survival at the end of brood guarding was strongly dependent on calendar date (early and late chicks suffered higher mortality), which suggests that grey-headed albatrosses benefit from breeding synchronously. We conclude that the length of the brood-guarding period is dependent on chick condition and seasonal variation in chick predation risk. © 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={It has been reported that N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is implicated in drug addiction and antagonists of the NMDA receptor complex can inhibit the development and expression of conditioned place preference (CPP) induced by several addictive drugs, implying that this class of compounds might be considered as candidate for the treatment of substance abuse. To explore this possibility, it is important to evaluate whether the inhibitory effect of NMDA receptor antagonists would be confined to behaviors produced by drugs of abuse only, but not by natural reinforcers. According to the quantitative changes of NMDA receptor subunits, including NR1, NR2A, and NR2B, induced by diverse types of reinforcers, we chose NR2B subunit as the target of research. Experimental results showed that (1) an augmented expression of NR2B subunit was revealed by Western blotting in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the hippocampus in rats with CPP induced by morphine, but not by natural rewards such as food, novel environment and social interaction. (2) Ifenprodil, an antagonist highly selective for NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor, produced a dose-dependent reduction in CPP induced by morphine and novel environment, but not that by food consumption and social interaction. Taking together, these findings suggested that NR2B containing NMDA receptor may be more involved with morphine reward rather than natural rewards, and that antagonism of NR2B may have a potential for the treatment of morphine abuse. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Ability to store resources that will be used for reproduction represents a potential life history adaptation because storage permits feeding and reproduction to be decoupled spatially and/or temporally. The two ends of a continuum involve acquiring all resources prior to reproduction (capital breeding) or acquiring all resources during the reproductive period (income breeding). Traditional life history theory examines tradeoffs between costs and benefits of such strategies, but this theory has not been integrated into life history studies of ants, even though founding queens have the analogous strategies of fully claustral (capital breeding) and semi-claustral (income breeding). This study demonstrates that facultatively semi-claustral queens of the seed-harvester ant Pogonomyrmex desertorum exhibit phenotypic plasticity during colony founding because unfed queens produced few, small minims, whereas ad libitum fed queens produced larger, heavier minims and additional brood. Fed queens also lost less mass than unfed queens despite their producing more brood. Overall, foraging provides queens with a suite of benefits that likely offset potential negative effects of foraging risk. Life history studies across a diverse array of taxa show that capital breeding is consistently associated with low availability and/or unpredictability of food, i.e., environmental conditions that favor prepackaging of reproductive resources. Such a broad and consistent pattern suggests that similar factors favored the evolution of fully claustral (capital breeding) colony founding in ants. Overall, these data suggest that ant researchers should revise their conventional view that fully claustral colony founding evolved because it eliminated the need for queens to leave the nest to forage. Instead, colony founding strategies should be examined from the perspective of environmental variation, i.e., availability and predictability of food. I also provide a functional scenario that could explain the evolution of colony founding strategies in ants. © Birkhäuser Verlag, 2006.},

abstract={Many precocial birds make long-distance movements with their young after hatch to reach the best foraging sites. On Bylot Island, Nunavut, a large number of Greater Snow Goose (Chen caerulescens atlantica L., 1758) families move 30 km from the main nesting colony (MNC) to reach the main brood-rearing area (MBR) soon after hatch. Geese moving from the MNC to the MBR generally rear lighter and smaller goslings than geese that avoid this movement by both nesting and rearing their brood at the MBR. In this study, we tested the hypotheses that use of low-quality habitats and an increase in the time spent walking at the expense of foraging during movements could explain the reduced growth of goslings in those families. We conducted visual observations to compare habitat use and selection as well as behaviour of geese during brood movements from the MNC to the MBR (i.e., at a transit area) with those of families that had already settled at the MBR. We also conducted aerial tracking to monitor habitat use of 16 radio-marked females during and after brood movements. Streams, wet polygons, and lakes, considered high-quality habitats in terms of feeding opportunities and predator refuges, were preferred, while upland, a low-quality habitat, was avoided at both the transit area and the MBR. However, broods were found in the upland habitat more often during movements than once settled on a rearing site. The behaviour of unmarked geese at the transit site did not differ from that of geese at the MBR. We suggest that reduced food intake in low-quality habitats during movements, but not the increase in time spent walking, may explain the reduction in growth observed at fledging in goslings moving from the MNC to the MBR. © 2006 NRC.},

Reference compounds are used to illustrate the determination of substance-specific parameters, such as the dose that produces the half-maximal effect (ED(50)), the maximal effect, as well as the time of onset and duration of compound action. Indirect calorimetry performed at different temperatures provides information on several other well-defined parameters, including resting metabolic rate, basal metabolic rate, lower critical temperature, temperature sensitivity, defended body temperature, and respiratory quotient.},

abstract={Male complicity versus conflict over sexual cannibalism in mantids remains extremely controversial, yet few studies have attempted to establish a causal relationship between risk of cannibalism and male reproductive behavior. We studied male risk-taking behavior in the praying mantid Tenodera aridifolia sinensis by altering the risk imposed by females and measuring changes in male behavior. We show that males were less likely to approach hungrier, more rapacious females, and when they did approach, they moved more slowly, courted with greater intensity, and mounted from a greater distance. Similarly, when forced to approach females head-on, within better view and better reach of females, males also approached more slowly and courted with greater intensity. Thus, males behaved in a manner clearly indicative of risk avoidance, and we support the hypothesis of sexual conflict over sexual cannibalism. © 2006 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={To understand the characteristics of retrieval in squirrels' (Sciurus vulgaris) food-hoarding behaviors in the field and what intensities in different stages of winter the squirrels retrieve the food resources that they hoarded, we surveyed their retrieved-caches in a snowy field by means of stratified random sampling in the periods of early-winter (Nov. 6-14 in 2004), mid-winter (Jan. 16-24 in 2005) and late-winter (Mar. 22-31) in Liangshui National Nature Reserve, Heilongjiang Province, Northeastern China. The results showed: 1) There was a significant difference (x 2 = 30.734, df = 2, P &lt; 0.05) in the retrieving intensities among three stages of winter, early-winter showing the most activity and mid-winter the least. Regression in the frequencies of samples indicated that the populations of data in all of three stages complied with Exponential Distribution (early-winter: Z = 0.749, df = 17, P = 0.682; mid-winter: Z = 0.948, df = 9, P = 0.330; late-winter: Z = 1.039, df = 13, P = 0.230). 2) The number of retrieved-caches which seeds had been eaten in situ (namely hulls can be found) contributed to 83 percent of the total caches; the remaining caches examined lacked seed hulls. Presumably, these caches may have been re-cached elsewhere by squirrels in order to prevent pilferage or other risk of loss. Because of low yield and seed over-harvest by humans in recent years, we found that retrieved-caches with only one or two seed hulls were very common (up to 92% of total retrieved-caches that seeds had been eaten in situ). 3) The ANOVA by weather factor (temperature and snow depth) showed that, there was a significant difference among the three stages of winter concerning the scales of retrieved-caches (caliber: F (2,285) = 51.26, P &lt; 0.05; depth: F (2,285) = 519.21, P &lt; 0.05). A certain snow depth, perhaps, is beneficial to retrieval by squirrels. So, we concluded that these different performances of squirrels on retrieving intensities indicated a behavioral adaptation to changes of surroundings (especially food supply), in terms of ethology, it is in accord with one of the economic laws of animal foraging behaviors, namely, the minimization of starvation risk. And, optimized seed-retrieval behavior still can be found in the characteristics of retrieving caches which we surveyed.},

abstract={A large number of studies show that low birth weight is associated with cardiovascular disease and its risk factors including raised blood pressure, glucose intolerance and the metabolic syndrome. These findings have formed the basis for the 'fetal origins hypothesis'. This suggests that the operation of adverse influences during intrauterine life leads to permanent alterations in fetal structure and physiology which predispose to adult disease. The process is known as developmental plasticity or programming and is strongly supported by studies in experimental animals. Ongoing research is providing important insights in to the underlying mechanisms. It is likely that adverse environmental factors during pregnancy are important, and that these include suboptimal nutrition of the mother. The long-term programming effects may be transduced by alterations in the set-point of key hormonal axes, especially the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and recent evidence suggests that epigenetic modification of gene expression may be a key factor. Importantly, this has the potential to produce transgenerational effects. The hypothesis has not remained unchallenged and a wide variety of criticisms have been put forward. These include accusations that the associations are weak and overestimated due to publication bias, that there are many inconsistencies between studies, that the associations are confounded by lifestyle factors, and that there has been inappropriate adjustment for adult size. Finally many studies report that the findings in singletons do not seem to be replicated in twins. While many of these issues have been resolved, some continue to form the basis of a lively dialogue and ongoing research. Nevertheless the research findings have important implications for clinical obstetric practice and maternal-fetal medicine. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={Young women with breast cancer often experience early menopause as a result of the therapy for their malignant disease. The sudden occurrence of menopause resulting from chemotherapy, oophorectomy, radiation, or gonadal dysgenesis frequently results in hot flashes that begin at a younger age and may occur at a greater frequency and intensity than hot flashes associated with natural menopause. Hormone therapy relieves symptoms effectively in 80%-90% of women who initiate treatment. This therapy, however, is generally contraindicated in estrogen-dependent cancers, such as breast cancer, because of the potentially increased risk for recurrence. Many agents have been investigated as potential means for alleviating hot flashes in survivors of breast cancer, such as progestagens, clonidine, gabapentin, and antidepressants. Several complementary and alternative medicines frequently used by patients have also been studied. These include black cohosh, phytoestrogens, homeopathy, vitamin E, acupuncture, and behavior strategies. To support the use of one of more of these nonpharmacological or pharmacological options in the treatment of hot flashes in breast cancer patients, more evidence from well-controlled clinical trials is needed. In particular, soundly based scientific research with complementary and alternative medicine therapies is lacking. Pharmacological treatments appear to be more beneficial than nonpharmacological treatments. This article reviews the current literature to assess the epidemiology and diagnosis of hot flashes and the nonpharmacological and pharmacological options for the treatment of hot flashes, in breast cancer patients in particular. When specific treatment options have not been evaluated in breast cancer patients specifically, published data on the management of hot flashes with this modality in healthy postmenopausal women are described. ©AlphaMed Press.},

abstract={In three experiments the effects of post-conditioning pairings of a discriminative stimulus (Sd) with an illness-inducing agent (lithium chloride, LiCl) on subsequent discrimination performance in extinction and consumption of reinforcing outcome were investigated. Rats were trained to choose a correct lever to obtain food pellets, with a light presented on a bulb just above the correct lever serving for the Sd on each trial. After achievement of a criterion of the discrimination, animals received paired or unpaired presentations of the Sds and LiCl injection. In Experiment 1, in which a familiar outcome was given throughout the discrimination training, Sd-LiCl pairings did not reduce either lever-press performance during presentation of the Sds or amount of consumption of outcomes. On the other hand, in Experiment 2 where a novel outcome was introduced in the final two sessions of the discrimination training, subsequent Sd devaluation reduced lever-press performance during presentations of the Sds. Similar findings were obtained in Experiment 3, in which animals were given extended discrimination training with introduction of novel outcomes in the final two sessions. These findings suggest that a representation of the outcome, evoked by presentation of the Sd, and illness were associated in the course of Sd-LiCl pairings but only when a novel outcome was used. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Neuropeptide Y was administered into the central nucleus of the amygdala in both satiated and overnight-fasted rats, and intake and preference for a high fat diet (56%)/low carbohydrate (20%) diet or a low fat (10%)/high carbohydrate (66%) diet were measured. Intra-amygdalar NPY administration in satiated rats did not change total caloric intake, but it did produce a dose-dependent decrease in intake of and preference for high fat diet relative to low fat diet over 24 h. In overnight-fasted rats, intra-amygdalar NPY also decreased the intake and preference for a high fat diet relative to low fat diet over 24 h, without altering total caloric intake. Intra-amygdalar NPY administration did not produce conditioned taste aversions to a novel saccharin solution.

abstract={Behavioral and physiological characteristics of individuals within the same species have been found to be stable across time and contexts. In this study, we investigated individual differences in learning abilities and object and social manipulation to test for consistency within individuals across different tasks. Individual ravens (Corvus corax) were tested in simple color and position discrimination tasks to establish their learning abilities. We found that males were significantly better in the acquisition of the first discrimination task and the object manipulation task, but not in any of the other tasks. Furthermore, faster learners engaged less often in manipulations of conspecifics and exploration of objects to get access to food. No relationship between object and social manipulation and reversal training were found. Our results suggest that individual differences in regard to the acquisition of new tasks may be related to personalities or at least object manipulation in ravens. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Objective: The primary objective of the current study was to examine the efficacy of single media literacy lessons in reducing media internalization in young adolescents. Method: Eleven classes of 237 students (100 girls and 137 boys; mean age = 13.79 years, SD = .42) randomly received 1 of 6 lessons. Eating disorder risk factors were assessed at baseline, and the Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire-3 (SATAQ-3) was used to assess media internalization postintervention. Results: At postintervention, boys had significantly lower SATAQ-3 scores on 4 of the 5 subscales (effect sizes = .42-.71), whereas girls had significantly lower scores on 1 subscale (effect size = .54). Higher baseline levels of dietary restraint, magazines bought/read, and perceived sociocultural pressure predicted smaller reductions in boys' scores, whereas depression predicted smaller reductions in girls' scores. Conclusion: The current study provides support that boys be included in eating disorder prevention programs and that media literacy may represent a promising prevention approach. © 2006 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Objective: To compare the prevalence of eating disorders (ED), socio-cultural risk factors, and body image characteristics in two populations of female adolescents, one Mexican and one Spanish, from similar socio-economic backgrounds. Method: A total of 467 Spanish and 329 Mexican girls aged from 11-12 to 17-18 years were assessed using the Eating Attitude Test-26 (EAT-26), the CETCA (Eating Disorders Assessment Questionnaire), the CIMEC (Questionnaire on Influences on Body Shape Model), and a survey of socio-demographic and risk factors produced for this study. Results: One out of four subjects showed a significant risk of an eating disorder and 6-7% probably already had one. No significant differences were found between the two samples. Significant differences were found in risk behaviors: more Spanish girls reported body dissatisfaction and binging; more Mexican girls had a history of psychiatric and psychological treatment, pressure from parents and friends to lose weight, dieting, physical activity and vomiting to lose weight, and a history of greater weight loss. In both the groups around 50% of subjects wanted to increase the size of their breasts. However, significantly more Mexican girls desired thinner arms and narrower shoulders and back, and more Spanish girls wanted thinner hips, buttocks, and legs, parts of the body that many Mexicans wanted to increase. Conclusions: Risk behaviors and the ideal body models of these Spanish and Mexican adolescent girls varied significantly, indicating major socio-cultural differences. However, the prevalence of ED was similar. Further research should aim to clarify whether the similarities found between this Spanish sample and a Mexican sample taken from an upper-middle class urban environment, a minority that is unrepresentative of the general population, are also observed in samples from other sectors of Mexican society. © Steinkopff Verlag Darmstadt 2006.},

abstract={Current foraging models limit the decision-making process of animals to the food searching and consuming phase. The post-consummatory phase of feeding may influence optimal meal size for some species as a morphologic change often results from feeding. In snakes, a single prey item can lead to abrupt increases in body mass, thus influencing locomotor performance. Identifying factors affecting locomotor performance can help predict behaviors that should maximize an animal's chance of evading predators. Although many snakes ingest large percentages of their body mass, not much work has examined the post-consummatory effects of ingesting bulky prey differing in relative mass. I examined the locomotor performance and antipredator tactics of hatchling trinket snakes (Elaphe helena) after subjecting snakes to mice prey varying by relative mass differences of 20-35%, 50-59% or 70-79% of an individual hatchling's body mass. Snakes in treatment groups were compared with snakes in a control group (0%). Meal size-affected locomotor parameters such as burst speed, endurance, and endurance times for hatchlings that ingested 50-59% and 70-79% of their body mass (p < 0.001). Recent feeding also affected the types of antipredator modes employed. Hatchlings in the 0% and 20-35% treatments exhibited behaviors that were categorized as active and threatening, while hatchlings in the 50-59% and 70-79% treatments exhibited stationary, neutral, and cryptic behaviors. Although snakes may become more reclusive following a meal, this study demonstrates that relative prey mass affects the ability of hatchling trinket snakes to flee from a predator. In turn, these results suggest that the post-consummatory effects of foraging should be considered in optimal foraging models for organisms that consume a substantial portion of their body mass during a single feeding. © 2006 Blackwell Verlag.},

abstract={Colic remains a significant problem in the horse in terms of welfare and economics; in some equine populations it is the single most common cause of death. Many causes of colic are cited in the equestrian and veterinary literature but little scientific evidence exists to substantiate these theories. Recent epidemiological investigations have confirmed that colic is complex and multi-factorial in nature. Studies have identified a number of factors that are associated with increased risk of colic including parasite burden, certain feed types, recent change in feeding practices, stabling, lack of access to pasture and water, increasing exercise and transport. These findings are reviewed together with examples of management practices that may be altered to reduce the incidence of specific types of colic. This is an opinionated, not a systematic, review focusing on those areas that are considered most relevant to the practitioner. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: Adolescent eating disorders (ED) are a serious public health problem rising with morbidity and mortality. It is important a quick detection, since an early beginning of treatment improves the prognosis and results. Objective: To quantify the risk prevalence of ED in female adolescents of the Metropolitan Region (MR), and evidence differences by groups of age and socioeconomical level (SEL). To identify the impact of the psychological characteristics that reinforce them. Patients and Methods: The EDI-2 test was applied to a total of 1610 female students between 11 and 19 years old. The sample was not random and was extracted from 9 schools chosen by convenience, located in areas of different SEL in the MR. The threshold used to consider risk of ED was > 110. Results: 1 050 surveys were analyzed. 8,3% of the adolescent school population presented risk factors for ED. A higher risk of ED was found in schools located in low-income areas (11,3%), middle-income (8,3%) and high-income (5,1%). These differences were statistically significant (p < 0,02). A tendency to a greater proportion of adolescents at risk of ED was shown in the group of girls 12 years old or younger (10,3%), while those between 13 and 15 years old presented 8,6%, and 7,4% for those older than 16 (p < 0,575). The three first scores, (DT) Drive for Thinness (14,6 vs 6,3), (B) Bulimia (6,1 vs 1,8) and (BD) Body Dissatisfaction (17,2 vs 7,7) discriminate the high-risk group to develop ED. The eight remaining scores show traces of personality that reinforce eating disorders. Conclusions: 1) The study concludes that prevalence of risk for ED in the screened population was 8,3%; 2) The prevalence of risk for ED was greater in the low-income socioeconomic level (11,3%) (p < 0,02); 3) Despite not being statistically significant, the observed tendency is that the group at greater risk is the one of younger age, recommending a future evaluation; 4) The results confirm that the three first scores of the test EDI-2 distinguish the group at highest risk of developing an ED; 5) We believe that the use of this screening test routinely in adolescent population will be fundamental for an early detection of ED when applicated by experienced professionals on specific populations under study. © 2006 Sociedad Chilena de Pediatría.},

abstract={In the present study we demonstrate that consumption of a tryptophan-deficient diet for a period of 14 days decreased the striatal serotonin and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid tissue content in rats, whereas the level of dopamine remained unchanged. Under this condition of diminished serotonergic tone, a challenge dose of cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly increased motor activity and dopamine extracellular content in the nucleus accumbens compared to rats fed with a balanced diet. We moreover found that pretreatment with cocaine (7 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a significant increase in preference for a cocaine-associated environment in the tryptophan-deficient group compared to control rats. Our experiments show that a low tone of serotonergic system, augments the behavioural reinforcing effect of cocaine and that this effect may be due to a increased cocaine-induced accumbal dopamine release. These data indicate that a tryptophan-deficient diet alters the behavioural and neurochemical effect of psychostimulants, such as cocaine, and suggest an important role of serotonin in modulation of these effects. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract={Injurious pecking has serious welfare consequences in flocks of hens kept for egg laying, especially when loose-housed. Frequent diet change is a significant risk for injurious pecking; how the mechanics of diet change influence pecking behavior is unknown. This study investigated the effect of diet change on the behavior of chicks from a laying strain. The study included a 3-week familiarity phase: 18 chick pairs received unflavored feed (Experiment 1); 18 pairs received orange oil-flavored (Experiment 2). All chicks participated in a dietary preference test (P); a diet change (DC); or a control group (C), 6 scenarios. All P chicks preferred unflavored feed. In Experiment 1, DC involved change from unflavored to orange-flavored; Experiment 2, orange-flavored to unflavored. Compared with controls, Experiment 2 DC chicks exhibited few behavioral differences; Experiment 1 DC chicks exhibited increased behavioral event rates on Days 1 and 7. They pecked significantly longer at their environment; by Day 7, they showed significantly more beak activity. There was little evidence of dietary neophobia. Change from more preferred to less preferred feed led to increased activity and redirected pecking behavior. Copyright © 2006, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.},

abstract={The impairment of brain functions during aging could be prevented by an increase in antioxidative defenses. In fact, dietary manipulation with antioxidants or with antioxidant-rich extracts from vegetables and fruit can ameliorate age-associated behavioral alterations. Moreover, dietary supplements of antioxidants can reverse the age-dependent impairment to sustain long-term potentiation (LTP). There is evidence that fresh fruit could be more effective than antioxidant supplements or fruit and vegetable extracts but the effect of a diet enriched in fresh fruit on brain aging process has not been investigated until now. The aim of the present study was to verify whether dietary manipulation with fresh apples could influence age-induced changes in motor and emotional behavior and in LTP in rats. Groups of aged and young rats were fed with a standard diet or a diet supplemented with fresh apples of annurca variety for 10 weeks and assessed for behavioral performance in the open field and elevated plus maze tests and for the ability to sustain LTP. The brains were then removed, histochemically stained for superoxide dismutase (SOD) and SOD activity was measured by computer-assisted image analysis. The aged rats fed with the enriched diet showed a significant decrease in the anxiety level. Moreover, they improved in the ability to sustain LTP, reaching the level of the young rats. SOD activity was increased in the aged rats fed with the standard diet whereas SOD activity in the hippocampus of the aged rats treated with annurca apple was at the level of the young animals. These results suggest that a diet rich in annurca apple could have an important role in health-care during aging. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to investigate the thermoregulatory adaptations to fasting in a medium-sized mustelid with a high metabolic rate and energetic requirements. Sixteen farm-bred female American minks, Mustela vison, were divided into a fed control group and an experimental group fasted for 5 days. The deep body temperature (Tb) of the minks was registered at 10 min intervals with intraabdominal thermosensitive loggers and the locomotor activity was videotaped continuously for 5 days during the fasting procedure. The T b of the fasted animals increased during the first day of fasting and decreased during the second day. After 3-4 days of fasting, the levels of physical activity and Tb of the fasted minks increased above the levels of the fed animals. Significant increases in these parameters were observed at the beginning of the working day on the farm, during the feeding of the fed animals and around midnight. It is concluded that the mink differs from previously studied homeotherms in thermoregulatory and behavioral responses to fasting probably due to its high energy requirements and predatory success. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Sperm competition is a well-recognised agent in the evolution of sperm and ejaculate structure, as well as variation in female quality. Models of the evolution of ejaculate expenditure predict that male body condition, female fecundity and the risk and intensity of sperm competition may be the ultimate factors shaping optimal ejaculate size. We investigated sperm allocation in Austropotamobius italicus, a freshwater crayfish exhibiting a coercive mating system and external fertilisation, in relation to male and female traits and copulation behaviour under laboratory conditions. We found that mating males were sensitive to female size and produced larger ejaculates when mating with larger females, which were more fecund in terms of number of eggs produced. We found no evidence for female egg production being sperm-limited, as the number of eggs was not dependent on male sperm expenditure. Copulation duration and number of ejaculations reliably predicted the amount of sperm transferred, and both these behavioural measures positively covaried with female body size. These results indicate that male freshwater crayfish can modulate their sperm expenditure in accordance with cues that indicate female fecundity. In addition, a novel finding that emerged from this study is the decrease in sperm expenditure with male body size, which may either suggest that large, old male crayfish are better able than small males to economise sperm at a given mating to perform multiple matings during a reproductive season, or that they experience senescence of their reproductive performance. © Springer-Verlag 2006.},

abstract={Animals make economic decisions on where to feed based on balancing intake rates with the risk of starvation. When foraging, they must also manage time allocation to feeding, antipredator behaviour and resource guarding. These behaviours are usually believed to be mutually exclusive. The most intense foraging effort is predicted to occur in low-risk situations, while more antipredator behaviour is seen in high-risk situations. We studied the time allocation of individual light-bellied brent geese, Branta bernicla hrota, and the proportion of the flock engaged in foraging and vigilance behaviour in high- and low-risk habitats. Geese faced with a depleted resource in a low-risk intertidal situation responded by foraging in a higher-risk terrestrial habitat. Individual intake rates and levels of agonistic interactions were higher during terrestrial feeding, but group vigilance was maintained, with certain flock positions showing disproportionate levels of vigilance. In contrast to previous studies, agonistic interactions were more frequent when the geese were feeding on a nonpatchy resource, suggesting that different mechanisms drive agonistic encounters in different habitats. We discuss these results in the context of a growing population with limited resources. By remaining behaviourally plastic, the geese are able to adapt novel trade-off strategies to use alternative prey types. © 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Objective: The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of early protein malnutrition on the social memory of adult rats (Rattus norvegicus) using an experimental procedure. Methods: The animals received isocaloric diets containing 6% or 16% of protein during the lactation phase (0-21 days of age) and a commercial lab chow as from 22 days of age. The social memory test consisted of, after 2 daily habituation sessions (7minutes/session), to introduce an adult rat (100-114 days of age) and a young rat (30-44 days of age) into an acrylic cage (90cm x 90cm x 45cm), for two sessions separated by intervals of 30 (Experiment 1) or 15 (Experiment 2) minutes. Social contact was defined as exploration/sniffing the anogenital region of the rat. The difference in the time spent in social contact between the first and second sessions was defined as the memory index. Results: No differences were observed in Experiment 1 due to the diet conditions. In Experiment 2, social contact decreased from the first to the second session in the controls (p<0.05) in contrast to the malnourished animals, who showed no differences. Conclusion: These results suggest that early protein malnutrition impairs the social memory in adult rats.},

abstract={The ERK/MAP kinase cascade is important for long-term memory formation and synaptic plasticity, with a myriad of upstream signals converging upon ERK activation. Despite this convergence of signaling, neurons routinely activate appropriate biological responses to different stimuli. Scaffolding proteins represent a mechanism to achieve compartmentalization of signaling and the appropriate targeting of ERK-dependent processes. We report that kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR1) functions biochemically in the hippocampus to scaffold the components of the ERK cascade, specifically regulating the cascade when a membrane fraction of ERK is activated via a PKC-dependent pathway but not via a cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway. Specificity of KSR1-dependent signaling also extends to specific downstream targets of ERK. Behaviorally and physiologically, we found that the absence of KSR1 leads to deficits in associative learning and theta burst stimulation-induced LTP. Our report provides novel insight into the endogenous scaffolding role of KSR1 in controlling kinase activation within the nervous system. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Low birthweight in relation to the length of gestation, is now known to be associated with increased rates of coronary heart disease and the related disorders stroke, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. These associations extend across the whole range of birthweight, which implies that normal variations in nutrient delivery to the fetus have profound long-term effects. The associations are thought to reflect the body's plasticity during development, by which its structure and function can be permanently changed by the intra uterine and early post natal environment. Slow growth during infancy and rapid weight gain after the age of two years exacerbate the effect of slow fetal growth. Cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes arise through a series of interactions between environmental influences and the pathways of development that precede them. © 2006, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of levetiracetam (LEV) as adjunctive therapy in children (4 to 16 years) with treatment-resistant partial-onset seizures. METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial consisted of an 8-week baseline period followed by a 14-week double-blind treatment period. During the treatment period, patients received either placebo or LEV add-on therapy and were up-titrated to a target dose of 60 mg/kg/day. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-eight patients (intent-to-treat population) provided evaluable data. The reduction in partial-onset seizure frequency per week for LEV adjunctive therapy over placebo adjunctive therapy was significant (26.8%; p = 0.0002; 95% CI 14.0% to 37.6%). A 50% or greater reduction of partial seizure frequency per week was attained in 44.6% of the LEV group (45/101 patients), compared with 19.6% (19/97 patients) receiving placebo (p = 0.0002). Seven (6.9%) LEV-treated patients were seizure-free during the entire double-blind treatment period, compared with one (1.0%) placebo-treated patient. One or more adverse events were reported by 88.1% of LEV-treated patients and 91.8% of placebo patients. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were somnolence, accidental injury, vomiting, anorexia, hostility, nervousness, rhinitis, cough, and pharyngitis. A similar number of patients in each group required a dose reduction or withdrew from the study as a result of an adverse event. CONCLUSION: Levetiracetam adjunctive therapy administered at 60 mg/kg/day is efficacious and well tolerated in children with treatment-resistant partial seizures.

abstract={Food insecurity is a daily reality for hundreds of millions of people around the world. Although its most extreme manifestations are often obvious, many other households facing constraints in their access to food are less identifiable. Operational agencies lack a method for differentiating households at varying degrees of food insecurity in order to target and evaluate their interventions. This chapter provides an overview of a set of papers associated with a research initiative that seeks to identify more precise, yet simple, measures of household food insecurity. The overview highlights three main conceptual developments associated with practical approaches to measuring constraints in access to food: 1) a shift from using measures of food availability and utilization to measuring ''inadequate access''; 2) a shift from a focus on objective to subjective measures; and 3) a growing emphasis on fundamental measurement as opposed to reliance on distal, proxy measures. Further research is needed regarding 1) how well measures of household food insecurity designed for chronically food-insecure contexts capture the processes leading to, and experience of, acute food insecurity, 2) the impact of short-term shocks, such as major floods or earthquake, on household behaviors that determine responses to food security questions, 3) better measurement of the interaction between severity and frequency of household food insecurity behaviors, and 4) the determination of whether an individual's response to survey questions can be representative of the food insecurity experiences of all members of the household. © 2006 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={A central issue in predator-prey interactions is how predator associated chemical cues affect the behaviour and life history of prey. In this study, we investigated how growth and behaviour during ontogeny of a damselfly larva (Coenagrion hastulatum) in high and low food environments was affected by the diet of a predator (Aeshna juncea). We reared larvae in three different predator treatments; no predator, predator feeding on conspecifics and predator feeding on heterospecifics. We found that, independent of food availability, larvae displayed the strongest anti-predator behaviours where predators consumed prey conspecifics. Interestingly, the effect of predator diet on prey activity was only present early in ontogeny, whereas late in ontogeny no difference in prey activity between treatments could be found. In contrast, the significant effect of predator diet on prey spatial distribution was unaffected by time. Larval size was affected by both food availability and predator diet. Larvae reared in the high food treatment grew larger than larvae in the low food treatment. Mean larval size was smallest in the treatment where predators consumed prey conspecifics, intermediate where predators consumed heterospecifics and largest in the treatment without predators. The difference in mean larval size between treatments is probably an effect of reduced larval feeding, due to behavioural responses to chemical cues associated with predator diet. Our study suggests that anti-predator responses can be specific for certain stages in ontogeny. This finding shows the importance of considering where in its ontogeny a study organism is before results are interpreted and generalisations are made. Furthermore, this finding accentuates the importance of long-term studies and may have implications for how results generated by short-term studies can be used. © Springer-Verlag 2006.},

abstract={Behavior genetics studies in mice demand efficient training protocols for rapid phenotypic screening. However, the capacity of neonatal mice to form and retain associative memories has been difficult to study due to their limited sensorimotor capacities. The present study describes a method for robust, naturalistic associative learning in neonatal mice as young as 3 days old. After removal of the dam from the home cage for 2 h, preweanling CD-1 mice of ages 3, 5, and 10 days postnatal were conditioned to associate an arbitrary odorant with the suckling and milk delivery that ensued upon her return to the home cage. After a second maternal deprivation, neonates were tested on their acquired preference for that odorant. Neonates exhibited a learned preference for the conditioned odorant over a novel control odorant. No learning was observed without deprivation, that is, when the dam was removed only briefly for scenting. One-trial learning sufficed to show clear preferences for the conditioned odorant, although repeated training (three sessions over 8 days) significantly increased the expression of preference. The development of neonatal associative learning protocols requiring minimal human intervention is important for the behavioral phenotyping of mutant and transgenic strains, particularly those modeling developmental disorders. © 2006 Oxford University Press.},

abstract={In animals such as birds that are capable of adjusting energy reserves behaviourally in response to starvation risk and predation risk, mass is a measure of an individual's perception of the risks in its environment. Although it is often necessary to capture and handle animals to allow the scientific study of animal behaviour, little is known about how this affects the individual's perception of the risks in its environment or how this changes subsequent behaviour. In this study we remotely monitored the mass of individual wild great tits, Parus major, for 10 days after capture, handling and release and then used starvation-predation risk trade-off theory to investigate how individuals perceived the risks in their environment. Mass increased significantly after capture and remained higher for 7 days before returning to precapture levels. We conclude that the capture and handling event was perceived as an interruption to foraging induced by an encounter with a predator which heightened starvation risk. Although this forced interruption to foraging was a relatively small proportion of available foraging time (<6%), the subsequent response produced a large (66% of normal diurnal mass gain) and sustained change in mass. The results highlight the key role that foraging interruptions play in an individual's assessment of risks when trading off starvation against predation. They may also help to explain why some investigations of the effect of perceived predation risk on body mass in captive birds have produced inconsistent results. © 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={1. The effect of competition for a limiting resource on the population dynamics of competitors is usually assumed to operate directly through starvation, yet may also affect survival indirectly through behaviourally mediated effects that affect risk of predation. Thus, competition can affect more than two trophic levels, and we aim here to provide an example of this. 2. We show that the foraging success of redshanks Tringa totanus (L.) foraging on active prey was highest in the front of flocks, whereas this was not the case for redshanks foraging on inactive prey. Also, when foraging on active prey, foraging success in a flock decreased as more birds passed through a patch, while overall foraging success was not lower on subsequent visits to the same patch. Thus, redshanks foraging on active prey suffered from interference competition, whereas this was not the case for redshanks foraging on inactive prey. 3. This interference competition led to differences in activity: redshanks attaining a lower foraging success had a higher walking rate. Greater activity was associated with wider flock spacing and shorter distances to cover, which has previously been shown to increase predation risk and mortality from sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus (L.). 4. We conclude that behavioural adaptations of prey species can lead to interference competition in foraging redshanks, and thus can affect their predation risk and mortality through increased activity. This study is one of the first to show how interference competition can be a mechanism for behaviourally mediated indirect effects, and provides further evidence for the suggestion that a single species occupying an intermediate trophic level may be simultaneously top-down controlled by a predator and bottom-up controlled by a behavioural response of its prey. © 2006 The Authors.},

abstract={In cooperatively breeding species, parents may be assisted by other individuals to feed the young. How breeding parents react when they receive help is poorly understood. Evidence suggests that parents usually maintain their feeding effort when starvation of chicks is common, and reduce it when other risks such as predation are more important for chick survival, although some recent examples do not fit this pattern. In no case, however, have parents been found to increase their effort when they have helpers. We investigated this issue in a rarely studied cooperative breeder, the azure-winged magpie, Cyanopica cyanus. Breeders increased their provisioning rate when aided by helpers. However, chick starvation was rare and it was equally so in nests with and without helpers. The incidence of predation, conversely, was significantly lower in the presence of helpers. Helpers provisioned at a lower rate than parents but buffered the effect of adverse conditions in bad years in the nests they assisted. To our knowledge, these findings show for the first time that parents can increase their investment in the current brood in the presence of helpers, a result that does not seem to have been covered by current theory of cooperative breeding. © 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Background: Inadequate lifestyles (LS) in young women may be related to the increasing population that migrate to the cities. Objective: To compare the LS in rural and urban women and to assess their relation with educational levels and cardiovascular risk factors. Material and methods: Four hundred and eleven women (233 from rural and 178 from urban areas) aged 20 - 44 years were studied using the McMaster University questionnaire 'Do you have to fantastic lifestyle?'. Results : The mean age was similar in both groups (30.9 ± 7.2 years for rural vs 29.6 ± 7.3 for urban). Of the interviewed subjects, the rural women had a lower education level (47.2% had more than 8 years of study vs 73.6%; p<0.0001) and had a partner more frequently (68.3% vs 53.4%; p<0.04). The LS were better in the rural area (70.4 ± 12.4 vs 66.7 ± 14.0, p<0.01) and this was determined by less consumption of alcohol and drugs, more physical activity and higher family support. A higher level of schooling was related to better LS. Additionally, the women who had good LS had a lower body mass index. Conclusion: The urban women have worse LS than the rural ones. In both groups, the educational level was associated with healthier LS and less obesity, well-known risk factors for chronic diseases. © 2006 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose. To analyse prevalence of malnutrition, eating difficulties and feeding dependence in stroke rehabilitation patients because little is known about these prevalence's. Stroke patients have an increased risk for developing eating difficulties, feeding dependence and malnutrition because of their neurological deficits. Methods. Malnutrition is defined by having unintentional weight loss or a low BMI. Structured observations of eating difficulties and feeding dependence were performed at a regular meal. Results. During the study period of 18 months 69 patients of the 114 admitted stroke patients were included in our study. On admittance malnutrition was present in 35% of the patients and decreased to 3% after 4 weeks of rehabilitation. In total 43% of the patients had one or more eating difficulties and 16% was dependent in feeding. Aberrant eating speed was significantly associated with the presence of malnutrition at admission. Conclusions. The prevalence of malnutrition in stroke rehabilitation patients is high and decreases significantly during four weeks of rehabilitation. Research is needed into constructs of malnutrition, eating difficulties and feeding dependence. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={We developed a virtual world to study the effect of predators on predator recognition. We trained a neural network to discriminate between the shapes of simulated aerial and terrestrial predators and non-predators. Then, the network's weighting values were fixed into the genomes of a set of autonomous agents. These animats were required to eat, avoid death due to starvation, and avoid predation, by fleeing from approaching predators. We systematically varied the predator's lethality, the mutation rate, the cost of fleeing a predator, and the presence or absence of aerial and terrestrial predators. We used ANOVA to analyse the average recognition ability (a measure of directional selection) and the standard deviation of recognition ability (a measure of relaxed selection) after 500 generations of selection. Mutation rate and the cost of flight had the greatest effect on both the average and standard deviation of recognition abilities. The loss of all predators relaxed selection on predator recognition abilities. The loss of specific predators had complex effects on recognition abilities. Persistence is largely influenced by escape costs. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The memory deficits induced by cannabinoid agonists have been found in several behavioral paradigms. Nevertheless, there is evidence that not all types of memory are impaired after cannabinoid administration. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55212-2 (WIN) is able to influence the acquisition of fear conditioning using tone and contextual versions. For tone-fear conditioning, male Wistar rats were placed in the conditioning chamber and after 3 min, a sound (CS) was presented for 10 s that terminated with a 1-s electric footshock (1.5 mA). For contextual-fear conditioning, a similar procedure was used but no sound was presented. Twenty-four hours after, the animals were re-exposed to the respective CS (tone or conditioning chamber) and the freezing behavior was registered. A subsequent experiment investigated a possible state-dependent effect of WIN by administering WIN or control solution 30 min before conditioning and before testing. WIN (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg) administered i.p. 30 min before impaired contextual fear conditioning but did not modify the freezing behavior elicited by tone presentation. These animals did not show any state-dependent effects of WIN. Further, the impaired contextual conditioning was prevented by preadministration of SR141716A (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) or SR147778 (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.), selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonists. The present findings highlight that cannabinoid agonists effects are selective for the hippocampus-dependent aversive memories in rats. This effect appears to be related to the activation of CB1 cannabinoid receptors and confirms that cannabinoids might provide a novel approach for the treatment of unpleasant memories. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract={The large temporal and spatial variability in marine productivity encountered by marine predators may negatively influence breeding success. The Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella (AFS), a marine predator in the Southern Ocean (SO) ecosystem with a circumpolar distribution, exhibits a short, 4 mo lactation coinciding with increased summer marine productivity. The diet of AFS, and the distance to significant and productive oceanographic features, such as the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ), varies considerably between populations. We studied the foraging activity, foraging efficiency and the pup provisioning strategies of lactating AFS at a key breeding site in the southern Indian Ocean, the Kerguelen Archipelago. Foraging parameters were examined in relation to interannual variability in oceanographic conditions and prey availability in the PFZ over 3 consecutive breeding seasons (1998 to 2000). The location of foraging zones, diving activity, diet and foraging efficiency varied significantly between years, concurrently with annual changes in sea-surface temperature (SST) and prey availability. The strongest recorded El Niño Southern Oscillation event in 1997-1998 coincided with anomalously warm waters in the vicinity of the Archipelago. Deeper diving by females, reduced maternal and pup body condition, and minimal pup growth rates and low catch per unit effort of the primary prey species, lanternfishes (Myctophidae) were all recorded in this period. Maternal size was positively related to the growth performance of pups only in this period, indicating the importance of age/size and/or experience in mediating environmental fluctuations. Foraging efficiency over a foraging cycle and variability in mean provisioning rates (trip duration), were identified as proxies of prey availability within the foraging range of seals, emphasis-ing the effectiveness of the use of AFS foraging behaviour as an indicator of both food and oceanographic variability and climatic anomalies. The increasing frequency of anomalously warm SST events in sectors of the SO, however, may elicit specific behavioural responses from 'central place foragers' (i.e. species that return to breeding sites to feed their young) to avoid sustained poor body condition of females and their weaned offspring. © Inter-Research 2006.},

abstract={Wildlife feeding has become an integral part of the range of activities offered to protected area visitors. In marine protected areas (MPAs), fish feeding may cause changes in the behavior, and thus the density and distribution, of coastal fish species. We evaluated spatial variability in human-positive fish behavior around the Ustica Island MPA (Italy) and the potential indirect effects of behavioral change on other species. Two mensurative experiments demonstrated that ca. 1/3 of the species present in fish-feeding areas exhibited human-positive behavior, losing instinctive fear in the presence of humans and encircling people in the water even when food was not provided. A manipulative experiment demonstrated that this behavioral response was learned rapidly. Damselfishes were negatively affected by the unnatural aggregation of a labrid species, as these aggregations freguently attacked and destroyed the benthic nests of the damselfish. Thus, fish feeding can have both direct and indirect effects. Therefore the MPA management goals need to be explicitly stated on a case-by-case basis. If the aim of a reserve is only to promote awareness of marine life and the benefits of conservation to the public, activities such as fish feeding may be regarded as desirable, since the human-positive behavior brought about by this activity guarantees a visual spectacle for visitors. Fish-feeding locations, however, cannot be regarded as natural and may reduce the effectiveness of a reserve for scientific research. © Inter-Research 2006.},

abstract={Conditioned inhibition is demonstrated when the meaning of one signal (conditioned stimulus, CS) is qualified by another (conditioned inhibitor, CI). Whilst the CS presented alone reliably predicts the outcome (unconditioned stimulus, US), when presented in conjunction with the CI the otherwise expected US will not occur. Conditioned inhibition has long been established in animal research but there have been difficulties in establishing reliable procedures suitable for use in human research. Such procedures are necessary to investigate disorders in which cognitive inhibitory mechanisms are known to be deficient, e.g., schizophrenia. In healthy participants, individual differences in the tendency to show conditioned inhibition should be related to personality measures of cognitive inhibition. In the present study, this was measured using an automated test procedure, in which visual stimuli predict the occurrence or non-occurrence of a visual outcome US, and BIS/BAS and schizotypy scales. Conditioned inhibition was reliable across two alternative test variants, in which the non-occurrence of the US was specified differently, and was confirmed by summation tests. The level of CI shown was positively associated with BAS Reward Responsiveness but did not correlate significantly with any of the other BIS/BAS scales. Conversely, the level of CI shown was negatively associated with schizotypy. We suggest that this novel conditioned inhibition task should now be applied to investigate a range of disorders that have some basis in dysfunctional inhibitory processes, such as schizophrenia. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Method: Psychiatric interviews were administered to a community-based sample of 658 individuals at mean ages 14, 16, 22, and 33 years. Results: Individuals with PD by age 22 were at an elevated risk for eating disorders at mean age 33 years. PDs were associated with risk for onset of binge eating, purging, daily dietary restriction, and obesity among individuals without a history of these problems. Borderline and histrionic PD symptoms were associated with recurrent binging and purging at mean age 33 years. Antisocial and schizotypal symptoms were associated with recurrent binging and obesity at mean age 33 years. Depressive PD symptoms were associated with recurrent binging and dietary restriction at mean age 33 years. Conclusion: PD symptoms, evident by early adulthood, may be associated with the risk for the development of eating and weight problems by middle adulthood. © 2006 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Behavioral patterns of animals correlate with biotic (i.e., resources and conspecifics) and abiotic (i.e., weather and lunar cycle) factors. We studied the influence of ambient light, rain, sex, and resource availability on the activity pattern of the neotropical chestnut short-tailed bat (Carollia castanea; Phyllostomidae) in a tropical lowland forest in Panama. Time of emergence was tightly correlated with local sunset, in contrast to the time of return, which occurred sporadically over a span of hours. Activity by individuals peaked at the beginning of the night, coinciding with maximum availability of ripe fruits from understory pepper plants (Piperaceae), their main food source. Bats continued to forage during light and moderate rain and only stopped at heavy rain. Nightly activity level was similar in nonreproductive female and male C. castanea but the temporal distribution of activity differed. Females were more active in the 1st half of night, whereas activity of males was more evenly distributed throughout the night. In contrast to fruit-eating bats in the canopy, C. castanea did not exhibit a significant reduction in flight activity (lunar phobia) during bright nights around the full moon. We conclude that ecological conditions (availability of food and predation risk) and physiological constraints (small body size associated with high metabolic rate) are the most important factors that account for the observed activity patterns. © 2006 American Society of Mammalogists.},

abstract={It is becoming increasingly clear that conditions experienced during embryonic development can be of major importance for traits subsequent to parturition or hatching. For example, in mammals, offspring from stressed mothers show a variety of changes in behavioural, morphological, and life-history traits. The effects of maternal stress on trait development are believed to be mediated via transfer of glucocorticoids, the main hormones released during the stress response, from mother to offspring. However, also other physiological maternal responses during stress could be responsible for changes in offspring phenotype. We investigated the direct effects of corticosterone on offspring development, without other confounding factors related to increased maternal stress, by injection of corticosterone in eggs of the ovoviviparous lizard Lacerta vivipara. Corticosterone-manipulated offspring did not show impaired development, reduced body size or body condition at parturition. However, corticosterone-treated offspring showed altered anti-predator behaviour, as measured by the time required to emerge from shelter after a simulated predator attack. Differential steroid exposure during development, possibly mediated by maternal stress response, may explain some of the variation in behaviour among individuals in natural populations. © 2006 Blackwell Verlag.},

abstract={Background. In view of the potential utility of personality-based groupings in eating disorders (EDs), and the lack of studies using this approach in large samples of individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN), this study set out to examine (i) the nature of personality-based clusters of women with lifetime AN and (ii) if these clusters are associated with either clinical symptoms or aetiological variables. Method. The self-report Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology (DAPP) was completed by 153 women with a lifetime diagnosis of DSM-IV AN. A cluster analysis was used to identify personality-based subgroups. Clusters were then compared on clinical and aetiological variables. Results. Three personality-based clusters were identified, defined by broad, avoidant and compulsive types of personality pathology. Dimensions of low dissocial behaviour, high inhibition and high compulsivity were common to all clusters, while dimensions related to emotional dysregulation appeared more heterogeneous. Clinical symptoms were not related to personality profile with the exception of a trend towards more fasting behaviour in the broad group. The compulsive cluster with the narrowest range of extreme personality traits reported the highest familial risk of eating pathology. Conclusions. The three clusters identified in our AN sample were similar to those previously identified in broader eating disordered samples. Personality-based clusters did not correspond overall to clinical symptoms but aetiological differences supported their validity. Broader personality pathology indicative of emotional dysregulation, problems with identity and relationships, in addition to core traits, may increase vulnerability to AN in those with less familial risk. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={Where predation is a major limiting factor, it has been postulated that woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788)) reduce movements to minimize contact with predators and exhibit fidelity to seasonal ranges. We examined fidelity behaviour within season and among years of woodland caribou based on locations of 65 radio-collared individuals in British Columbia, Canada. We used average linear distances between all possible pairs of radiolocations of individuals to assess fidelity. Among-year interlocation distances were similar to within-season interlocation distances during summer, indicating that caribou did not shift their distribution during seasons when they were most vulnerable to predation. Among-year interlocation distances were significantly greater than within-season interlocation distances during both early winter and late winter, indicating that individual caribou shifted their distribution among winters. The amount that an individual's distribution shifted among winters varied among and within individuals over different years. During early winter this behavioural plasticity was correlated with snow accumulation, with individuals having greater interlocation distances in years with high snow accumulation. Our results indicate that site fidelity outside the calving season is unlikely solely influenced by predator avoidance. We suggest that seasonal shifts in the importance of limiting factors vary from predation in summer to food in winter. © 2006 NRC.},

abstract={1. Increasing evidence suggests that insects can assess their environment based on cues related to mortality risks to themselves or their offspring. Limited knowledge is available on such abilities in relation to entomopathogenic fungi, which can cause significant mortality in insect populations. In laboratory bioassays, the ability of the generalist predator Anthocoris nemorum L. (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) to detect the presence of its natural enemy, the fungal pathogen Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) was investigated. 2. Behavioural observations were conducted on adults of A. nemorum foraging in choice and non-choice arenas treated with conidia suspensions of B. bassiana or just the carrier (control). The arenas consisted either of nettle leaves or soil. Additionally, behaviours in response to sporulating nettle aphid cadavers compared with uninfected aphids or paper balls were evaluated on nettle leaves. An oviposition experiment was also conducted in choice arenas on conidia-treated and untreated nettle leaves. 3. Males and females detected and avoided contact with leaf surfaces inoculated with B. bassiana. Females that were forced to enter fungus-treated leaf surfaces were very reluctant to do so. When females encountered cadavers sporulating with B. bassiana they rapidly withdrew compared with harmless paper ball dummies. Soil inoculated with B. bassiana did not affect A. nemorum behaviour or residence time compared with control soil. Females inserted significantly more eggs in control leaf areas compared with areas treated with B. bassiana conidia. 4. All results suggest that A. nemorum detects and avoids the pathogen B. bassiana when it forages on host plants with which it is adapted but not on soil surfaces. The adaptive significance of detection of entomopathogenic fungi is discussed. © 2006 The Royal Entomological Society.},

abstract={Wild-caught animals are often given a settling in period before experimental trials are initiated. We used wild-caught chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs) to investigate (a) the effect of settling in period duration on the likelihood that chaffinches foraged during experimental trials and (b) whether settling in period duration influenced measures of foraging and vigilance behaviour recorded from those experiments. The probability of collecting foraging data from an individual's first trial fell below 50% if it had been in captivity for more than 12 days prior to that trial, whereas the probability was >75% if trials were completed within two days of capture. The successful collection of foraging data from subsequent trials was also dependent on the number of days an individual spent in captivity prior to its first trial and on whether that individual foraged in its first trial, suggesting that some individuals were more inclined to forage in captivity. Individuals that foraged in their first trial had a 94% higher success rate in subsequent trials than those that did not. However, settling in period duration did not significantly influence the peck rate, mean search period or mean vigilance period of individuals that did forage. Our results show that allowing a settling in period actually reduced the likelihood of collecting foraging data from chaffinches and that commencing experiments shortly after capture increased data collection efficiency. We discuss the possibility that the inability to collect data from certain birds following a settling in period could lead to potentially important biases in results, particularly if propensity to forage is linked to an individual's coping strategy or personality. We conclude that it may not always be beneficial to allow wild-caught animals to habituate to captivity before commencing experiments. In some cases, testing animals soon after capture may increase the likelihood of data collection, reducing both the number of study animals required and the length of time they spend in captivity. © Brill Academic Publishers 2006.},

abstract={Objective: Trait anger has been shown to predict coronary heart disease; however, there are no prior studies evaluating anger as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study was to determine if anger proneness predicted type 2 diabetes using prospective analyses. Methods: We analyzed data on trait anger, assessed by questionnaire, in a longitudinal, bi-racial cohort study of 11,615 initially non-diabetic adults aged 48-67, who were subsequently followed for 6 years for the development of type 2 diabetes. Results: There was no relation between overall trait anger and the subsequent risk of diabetes; however, individuals in the highest tertile of trait anger temperament scores had a 34% increased risk of developing diabetes compared to those in the lowest tertile (Relative hazard [RH]=1.34; 95% confidence interval: 1.10, 1.62), following adjustment for age, race, gender, and education. The relation between anger temperament and diabetes remained significant following adjustment for behavioral factors (smoking, physical activity, and caloric intake) (RH=1.31; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.60) but was non-significant after additional adjustment for waist-to-hip ratio and body-mass index (RH=1.18; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.44). Conclusions: While we found no relation between overall trait anger and incident diabetes, persons who had higher anger temperament subscale scores had a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes, which was largely explained by adiposity. Anger temperament may deserve further attention as a potential risk factor for type 2 diabetes. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={House sparrow (Passer domesticus) numbers have declined rapidly in both rural and urban habitats across Western Europe over the last 30 years, leading to their inclusion on the UK conservation red list. The decline in farmland has been linked to a reduction in winter survival caused by reduced food supply. This reduction in food supply is associated with agricultural intensification that has led to the loss of seed-rich winter stubble and access to spilt grain. However, urban house sparrows have also declined, suggesting that reduced food supply in farmland is not the sole reason for the decline. Here, we show that changes in house sparrow mass and thus fat reserves are not regulated to minimize starvation risk, as would be expected if limited winter food were the only cause of population decline. Instead, the species appears to be responding to mass-dependent predation risk, with starvation risk and predation risk traded-off such that house sparrows may be particularly vulnerable to environmental change that reduces the predictability of the food supply. © 2005 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Chronic ethanol intake causes various types of neural damage and behavioral impairments, probably acting through oxidative stress and excitotoxicity, while dietary restriction is considered by some authors to protect the central nervous system from these kinds of damage. In the present study, a factorial experimental design was used to investigate the effects of chronic ethanol and dietary restriction treatments, associated or not, on Wistar rats' exploratory behavior, spatial memory aspects and cortical and hippocampal acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Dietary restriction lasted for the whole experiment, while ethanol treatment lasted for only 3 weeks. Despite the short ethanol treatment duration, for two behavior categories assessed, moving and rearing, an interaction was observed between the effects of chronic ethanol and dietary restriction. There were no significant differences in AChE activities among the groups. Cerebellar neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOs) activity was measured as a first step to assess oxidative stress. Dietary restriction significantly reduced NO formation. The present results indicate that dietary restriction might exert a protective effect against chronic-ethanol-induced changes in exploratory behavior. It is hypothesized that the mechanisms underlying this protection can involve prevention of oxidative stress. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Measuring patch use of a forager can reveal not only its cost and benefits from foraging, but also the importance of environmental factors and the significance of energy, nutrients and predation risk to its fitness. In order to assess the effects of various variables that may affect the foraging behavior of free-ranging Nubian ibex in the Negev Desert, Israel, giving-up densities (GUD) in artificial food patches were measured following Kotler et al. In particular, we tested the effects of food quality and water availability on Nubian ibex foraging behavior. To do so, we (1) tested whether the tannic acid content of food affected diet preferences, (2) assayed their diet selection strategy, (3) tested if the foraging decisions of the Nubian ibex were affected by the availability of water and (4) determined the nutritional relationship between food resources and water. Nubian ibex had lower GUDs and used resources patches more intensively where water was available, the food quality was higher and the location was closer to the escape terrain. Nubian ibex showed an expanding specialist diet selection when exploiting resource patches with a mix of items that differ in quality. Overall, food and water were complementary resources for Nubian ibex, and tannins reduced food quality. These factors help to determine patch foraging behavior decisions in Nubian ibex and contribute to habitat quality. Copyright © Oikos 2006.},

abstract={1. Recent theoretical studies on the population dynamic consequences of cannibalism have focused on mechanisms behind the emergence of large cannibals (giants) in size-structured populations. Theoretically, giants emerge when a strong recruiting cohort imposes competition induced mortality on stunted adults, but also provides a profitable resource for a few adults that accelerate in growth and reach giant sizes. 2. Here the effects of a recruitment pulse on the individual and population level in an allopatric Arctic char population have been studied over a 5-year period and these results were contrasted with theoretical model predictions for the conditions necessary for the emergence of cannibalistic giants. 3. The recruitment pulse had negative effects on invertebrate resource abundance, and the decrease in body condition and increase in mortality of adult char suggested that strong intercohort competition took place. 4. The frequency of cannibalism increased and a few char accelerated in growth and reached 'giant' sizes. 5. The main discrepancy between model predictions and field data was the apparently small effect the recruited cohort had on resources and adult char performance during their first summer. Instead, the effects became pronounced when the cohort was 1 year old. This mismatch between model predictions and field observations was suggested to be due to the low per capita fecundity in char and the restricted nearshore habitat use in young-of-the-year (YOY) char. 6. This study provides empirical evidence that the emergence of giants is associated with the breakthrough of a strong recruiting cohort and also suggests that the claimed stable char populations with large cannibals may instead be populations with dynamic size structure that results in intermittent breakthroughs of recruitment pulses, providing the conditions necessary for char to enter the cannibalistic niche. 7. The data suggest that increased recruit survival through restricted habitat use may destabilize dynamics and cause the emergence of giants. However, they also suggest that this does not necessarily develop into populations with bi-modal size structure in populations with low per capita fecundity and size- and density-dependent habitat use of recruiting cohorts. © 2006 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) offer plants chemical defences against herbivores, and are known to influence intake and diet choice in both insect and mammalian herbivores. However, there is limited knowledge regarding how PSMs influence herbivore foraging decisions. Herbivore foraging decisions, in turn, directly impact on which individual plants, and plant species, are selected for consumption. We took advantage of the natural variation in sideroxylonal concentrations in the foliage of Eucalyptus melliodora (Cunn. ex Schauer) to investigate feeding patterns of a marsupial folivore, the common ringtail possum, Pseudocheirus peregrinus (Boddaert 1785). Foliage, collected from six trees, contained between 0.32 and 12.97 mg g-DM-1 sideroxylonal. With increasing sideroxylonal concentrations, possums decreased their total intake, rate of intake and intake per feeding bout, and increased their cumulative time spent feeding. Possums did not alter their total feeding time, number of feeding bouts or time per feeding bout in response to increasing sideroxylonal concentrations. Results demonstrate important behavioural changes in foraging patterns in response to sideroxylonal. These behavioural changes have important implications, in relation to altered foraging efficiency and potential predation risk, for herbivores foraging in the field. As a result, the spatial distribution of dietary PSMs across a landscape may directly influence herbivore fitness, and ultimately habitat selection of mammalian herbivores. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract={Predation is considered as an important factor constraining the expression of sexual signals. Nevertheless, direct quantitative evidence for predation provoking significant viability costs on individuals signalling at high rates is scarce. Moreover, it is unclear whether high rate signallers are able to balance presumably increased predation costs. We examined whether a condition dependent audible sexual signal, drumming, makes Hygrolycosa rubrofasciata male spiders more prone to predation by pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), and whether sexual signalling rate is related to escaping ability once attacked. When birds were given a choice between two spider males manipulated to drum either one or three bouts per minute using playbacks, naïve birds attacked the males randomly regardless of the drumming rate. However, experienced birds chose significantly more often the males with high signalling rate. When spiders were allowed to escape, males with high sexual signalling rate tended to be better at escaping attacks than males with low sexual signalling rate. This study provides evidence that high signalling rate increases the risk of predation, but simultaneously males with high mobility, which correlates positively with signalling rate seemed to be better at compensating this cost. © 2005 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.},

abstract={Surfactants are man-made compounds that are meanwhile omnipresent in the environment, but environmental concentrations of surfactants are such that they are thought to have little risk for aquatic systems. The major anionic surfactants currently on the global market are linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS), a class where the commercially available FFD-6 belongs to. The hypothesis was tested that sublethal effects of FFD-6, i.e. the morphological effect of colony formation in the common test alga Scenedesmus obliquus, occurs at a concentration lower than the no-observed-effect concentrations for endpoints commonly used in regulatory toxicity testing with algae. The surfactant FFD-6 induced colonies in Scenedesmus at concentrations a few orders of magnitude lower (i.e. between 0.001 and 0.01 g l-1) than at which growth inhibition was observed (i.e. between 1 and 10 g l-1). Growth rates were lowest for Scenedesmus grown in P-limited medium, intermediate for algae reared in N-limited medium and highest for algae cultured in non-limited standard medium. Growth inhibition due to FFD-6 was similar for non-limited and nutrient-limited Scenedesmus, but colony formation was stronger in non-limited Scenedesmus than in nutrient limited cultures. The colony inducing effect of the surfactant FFD-6 on Scenedesmus occurs at much lower concentrations than growth inhibition and might affect species interactions, the survival of species and the energy flow along the food chain. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Objective: We sought to examine rates of eating disorder symptoms among seriously overweight children seeking treatment using the Eating Disorder Examination for Children (ChEDE) and to provide initial data about their association with treatment outcome. Method: Overweight children (N = 27) 8-13 years old were interviewed using the ChEDE before participating in a family-based behavioral treatment program. Height and weight were measured pretreatment, posttreatment, and approximately 8 months posttreatment. Results: Fifteen percent of children reported subjective bulimic episodes (SBE). Weight loss did not differ for children with and without SBEs, but concerns about body shape were related to larger weight losses during treatment. Conclusion: A considerable minority of treatment-seeking overweight children report an episodic sense of loss of control over eating. Loss of control is related to other disordered eating attitudes and behaviors, but does not appear to affect treatment outcome. Future studies are needed to replicate these initial findings. © 2005 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Previous studies have suggested that the developmental pattern of insect body parts is influenced by food conditions during the nymphal stages. In this study, we compared the developmental patterns of five body parts (body length, fore-femur length, mid-femur length, hind-femur length, and angle of claw) in the predatory insect Lethocerus deyrolli Vuillefroy fed three diets (tadpoles, Odonata nymphs, and tadpole-Odonata nymph mixture) during the nymphal stages. Significant age by sex interactions were detected in body length, fore-femur length, and hind-femur length, indicating developmental patterns of these traits varied between sexes Significant age food interactions were detected in body length and hind-femur length and were marginally significant in mid-femur length, showing developmental patterns of these traits varied among food types. None of the interactions were significant in angle of the claw. A predation experiment was performed using double-claw nymphs as a control and one-claw nymphs (adult type) as a treatment. Double-claw nymphs successfully caught both large and small tadpoles, whereas one-claw nymphs caught small tadpoles more frequently than large tadpoles. Our results suggest that the claw development, which is very likely related to predatory function, may be less affected by nutritional conditions, and that double claws during nymphal stages may be indispensable to increased predation success. © 2006 Entomological Society of America.},

abstract={In North America, there are few representative data about the effects of management practices on equine welfare. In a randomized survey of 312 nonracing horses in Prince Edward Island (response rate 68.4%), owners completed a pretested questionnaire and a veterinarian examined each horse. Regression analyses identified factors affecting 2 welfare markers: body condition score (BCS) and stereotypic behavior. Horses' BCSs were high (mean 5.7, on a 9-point scale) and were associated with sex (males had lower BCSs than females; P < 0.001) and examination date (P = 0.052). Prevalences of crib biting, wind sucking, and weaving were 3.8%, 3.8%, and 4.8%, respectively. Age (OR = 1.07, P = 0.08) and hours worked weekly (OR = 1.12, P = 0.03) were risk factors for weaving. Straw bedding (OR = 0.3, P = 0.03), daily hours at pasture (OR = 0.94, P = 0.02), and horse type (drafts and miniatures had a lower risk than light horses; P = 0.12) reduced the risk of horses showing oral stereotypies. Some of these results contradict those of other studies perhaps because of populations concerned.},

abstract={Sexual conflict occurs when individuals of one sex express traits that reduce the fitness of individuals of the other sex. In many poeciliid fish, males harass females for copulations, which is thought to reduce female fitness by lowering foraging efficiency and increasing predation risk, energetic expenditure and the likelihood of disease transmission. Mating may also be costly for males, who often engage in aggressive interactions with other males in addition to expending energy pursuing females. We examined the effects of three operational sex ratios on male behaviour, female fitness and male body condition in the western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, during a 10-week experiment. Despite a significant reduction in male harassment, female growth and reproductive success decreased as the proportion of females increased. Results suggest that increases in female density had a strong, negative effect on female fitness, overwhelming any potential costs of male harassment. Aggressive behaviour between males increased and male copulation rate decreased as the proportion of males increased, suggesting that operational sex ratio influences the number of copulations that a male attempts by altering the frequency of agonistic interactions with other males and the number of females available to mate. We did not detect a difference in male body condition between treatments. Sources of female density dependence and consequences of variation in operational sex ratio on male fitness are discussed. © 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={Human beings may affect the welfare of fish through fisheries, aquaculture and a number of other activities. There is no agreement on just how to weigh the concern for welfare of fish against the human interests involved, but ethical frameworks exist that suggest how this might be approached. Different definitions of animal welfare focus on an animal's condition, on its subjective experience of that condition and/or on whether it can lead a natural life. These provide different, legitimate, perspectives, but the approach taken in this paper is to focus on welfare as the absence of suffering. An unresolved and controversial issue in discussions about animal welfare is whether non-human animals exposed to adverse experiences such as physical injury or confinement experience what humans would call suffering. The neocortex, which in humans is an important part of the neural mechanism that generates the subjective experience of suffering, is lacking in fish and non-mammalian animals, and it has been argued that its absence in fish indicates that fish cannot suffer. A strong alternative view, however, is that complex animals with sophisticated behaviour, such as fish, probably have the capacity for suffering, though this may be different in degree and kind from the human experience of this state. Recent empirical studies support this view and show that painful stimuli are, at least, strongly aversive to fish. Consequently, injury or experience of other harmful conditions is a cause for concern in terms of welfare of individual fish. There is also growing evidence that fish can experience fear-like states and that they avoid situations in which they have experienced adverse conditions. Human activities that potentially compromise fish welfare include anthropogenic changes to the environment, commercial fisheries, recreational angling, aquaculture, ornamental fish keeping and scientific research. The resulting harm to fish welfare is a cost that must be minimized and weighed against the benefits of the activity concerned. Wild fish naturally experience a variety of adverse conditions, from attack by predators or conspecifics to starvation or exposure to poor environmental conditions. This does not make it acceptable for humans to impose such conditions on fish, but it does suggest that fish will have mechanisms to cope with these conditions and reminds us that pain responses are in some cases adaptive (for example, suppressing feeding when injured). In common with all vertebrates, fish respond to environmental challenges with a series of adaptive neuro-endocrine adjustments that are collectively termed the stress response. These in turn induce reversible metabolic and behavioural changes that make the fish better able to overcome or avoid the challenge and are undoubtedly beneficial, in the short-term at least. In contrast, prolonged activation of the stress response is damaging and leads to immuno-suppression, reduced growth and reproductive dysfunction. Indicators associated with the response to chronic stress (physiological endpoints, disease status and behaviour) provide a potential source of information on the welfare status of a fish. The most reliable assessment of well-being will be obtained by examining a range of informative measures and statistical techniques are available that enable several such measures to be combined objectively. A growing body of evidence tells us that many human activities can harm fish welfare, but that the effects depend on the species and life-history stage concerned and are also context-dependent. For example, in aquaculture, adverse effects related to stocking density may be eliminated if good water quality is maintained. At low densities, bad water quality may be less likely to arise whereas social interactions may cause greater welfare problems. A number of key differences between fish and birds and mammals have important implications for their welfare. Fish do not need to fuel a high body temperature, so the effects of food deprivation on welfare are not so marked. For species that live naturally in large shoals, low rather than high densities may be harmful. On the other hand, fish are in intimate contact with their environment through the huge surface area of their gills, so they are vulnerable to poor water quality and water borne pollutants. Extrapolation between taxa is dangerous and general frameworks for ensuring welfare in other vertebrate animals need to be modified before they can be usefully applied to fish. The scientific study of fish welfare is at an early stage compared with work on other vertebrates and a great deal of what we need to know is yet to be discovered. It is clearly the case that fish, though different from birds and mammals, however, are sophisticated animals, far removed from unfeeling creatures with a 15 s memory of popular misconception. A heightened appreciation of these points in those who exploit fish and in those who seek to protect them would go a long way towards improving fish welfare. © 2006 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

abstract={Background: Research to date suggests a relationship between fish consumption, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and depression. However, interpretation of this research is difficult due to methodological limitations. Postpartum women provide an excellent opportunity to examine these relationships because omega-3s are transferred from mother to fetus during pregnancy and from mother to child after birth through breast milk. Hence new mothers are more likely to be depleted in omega-3s. Our aim was to determine whether prenatal fish consumption and omega-3 status after birth were associated with postnatal depression. Methods: Eighty first-time mothers were recruited; 41 who scored on or over the cut-off on one of two depression-screening instruments, and 39 in the control group. Depression was diagnosed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Fish consumption was measured during pregnancy, and depression and omega-3 status were determined postnatally. Logistic regression and t-tests were used to examine relationships between fish consumption, omega-3 status, and postnatal depression, while controlling for known covariates. Results: Prenatal fish consumption was not predictive of postnatal depression, and postnatal omega-3 status was not associated with postnatal depression. However, prenatal fish consumption did predict omega-3 status after birth. Limitations: Prenatal fish consumption was measured using only a food frequency questionnaire, and no participants consumed oily fish (rich in omega-3s) regularly. Conclusions: There was no association between postnatal depression and either fish consumption in early pregnancy, or omega-3 status after birth. Our findings make it difficult to justify trials of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the treatment of postnatal depression. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A previous study found that as monkeys learned novel mappings between visual cues and responses, neuronal activity patterns evolved at approximately the same time in both the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and the putamen. Here we report that, in both regions, the population activity for novel mappings came to resemble that for familiar ones as learning progressed. Both regions showed activity differences on trials with correct responses versus those with incorrect ones. In addition to these common features, we observed two noteworthy differences between PMd and putamen activity during learning. After a response choice had been made, but prior to feedback about the correctness of that choice (reward or nonreward), the putamen showed a sustained activity increase in activity, whereas PMd did not. Also in the putamen, this prereward activity was highly selective for the specific visuomotor mapping that had just been performed, and this selectivity was maintained until the time of the reward. After performance reached an asymptote, the degree of this selectivity decreased markedly to the level typical for familiar visuomotor mappings. These findings support the hypothesis that neurons in the striatum play a pivotal role in associative learning. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

Spiders are common, ubiquitous arthropod generalist predators in most natural and managed terrestrial ecosystems. Thus, the relationship of spider cannibalism to food limitation, competition, and population regulation has direct bearing on basic ecological theory and applications such as biological control. This review first briefly treats the different types of spider cannibalism and then focuses in more depth on evidence relating cannibalism to population dynamics and food web interactions to address the following questions: Is cannibalism in spiders a foraging strategy that helps to overcome the effects of a limited supply of calories and/or nutrients? Does cannibalism in spiders reduce competition for prey? Is cannibalism a significant density-dependent factor in spider population dynamics? Does cannibalism dampen spider-initiated trophic cascades? Copyright © 2006 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Many animals spend a large proportion of their time either foraging for food or watching out for predators (antipredator vigilance). There have been many theoretical and empirical studies investigating the trade-off between these two activities, especially in birds. Previous models of antipredator vigilance assume that all birds within the group spend the same amount of time feeding. However, many empirical studies have shown that individuals on the edge of flocks are more vigilant. Here we describe a vigilance model which investigates the effect of position on the birds' strategies by dividing the feeding area into an inner and outer region. The model examines how various parameters such as food availability and predation risk affect the strategies of individual birds according to whether they are in the inner or outer region. Our model predicts that birds in the outer group are always more vigilant than those in the inner region. Birds in the centre receive a higher payoff in each of the wide range of scenarios that we have considered, and so our model also indicates why dominant birds would choose to feed in the centre of the group; a prediction in accord with several empirical studies. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Emesis may be modulated via multiple mechanisms. The actions of ghrelin suggest an ability to couple an induction of hunger with preparation of the stomach for ingestion of food. Such a process might reduce any tendency to vomit, so an anti-emetic activity of ghrelin was investigated in the ferret cisplatin-induced emesis model. In controls, intra-peritoneal cisplatin (10 mg/kg) induced 41.4 ± 8.4 episodes of emesis comprising 310.4 ± 55.3 retches and 28.8 ± 6.9 vomits during the 6 h observation; the latency to onset of the first emetic episode was 108.9 ± 4.8 min. Intra-peritoneal ghrelin (1 mg/kg, split as a 30 min pre- and 30 min-post dose) did not induce a change in behaviour or modify cisplatin-induced emesis (p > 0.05). Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration (third ventricle) was achieved via a pre-implanted cannula. At the first emetic episode following cisplatin, ghrelin or vehicle (20 μl saline) was administered i.c.v. During the 30 min following the initial episode of emesis, control animals exhibited 18.0 ± 2.6 emetic episodes comprising 160.3 ± 24.1 retches and 13.8 ± 2.7 vomits. Ghrelin 10 μg i.c.v. reduced the number of retches by 61.5% (p < 0.05) and at a dose of 30 μg i.c.v. ghrelin reduced the number of episodes, individual retches and vomits by 74.4 (p < 0.05), 80.4 (p < 0.01), and 72.5% (p < 0.05), respectively. At subsequent time periods there were no differences between ghrelin- or saline-treated animals (p > 0.05). An ability of ghrelin to reduce emesis is consistent with a role in modulating gastro-intestinal functions and identifies a novel approach to the treatment of emesis. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Animals looking for food sources are modelled as particles in a swarm moving over an abstract food landscape. The particles are guided to the food by a smell (or aura), which surrounds it and whose intensity is proportional to the amount of food available. The results show that this new extended version of the algorithm produces qualitatively realistic behaviour.

abstract={Most species reproduce seasonally, even in the tropics where activity occurs year-round. Squamate reptiles provide ideal model organisms to clarify the ultimate (adaptive) reasons for the restriction of reproduction to specific times of year. Females of almost all temperate-zone reptile species produce their eggs or offspring in the warmest time of the year, thereby synchronizing embryogenesis with high ambient temperatures. However, although tropical reptiles are freed from this thermal constraint, most do not reproduce year-round. Seasonal reproduction in tropical reptiles might be driven by biotic factors (e.g., peak periods of predation on eggs or hatchlings, or food for hatchlings) or abiotic factors (e.g., seasonal availability of suitably moist incubation conditions). Keelback snakes (Tropidonophis mairii, Colubridae) in tropical Australia reproduce from April to November, but with a major peak in May-June. Our field studies falsify hypotheses that invoke biotic factors as explanations for this pattern: the timing of nesting does not minimize predation on eggs, nor maximize food availability or survival rates for hatchlings. Instead, our data implicate abiotic factors: female keelbacks nest most intensely soon after the cessation of monsoonal rains when soils are moist enough to sustain optimal embryogenesis (wetter nests produce larger hatchlings, that are more likely to survive) but are unlikely to become waterlogged (which is lethal to eggs). Thus, abiotic factors may favor seasonal reproduction in tropical as well as temperate-zone animals. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Human studies have shown that iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in infants are associated with behavioral impairment, but the periods of brain development most susceptible to iron deficiency have not been established. In the present study, rhesus monkeys were deprived of iron by dietary iron restriction during prenatal (n = 14, 10 μg Fe/g diet) or early postnatal (n = 12, 1.5 mg Fe/L formula) brain development and compared to controls (n = 12, 100 μg Fe/g diet, 12 mg Fe/L formula) in behavioral evaluations conducted during the first four months of life in the nonhuman primate nursery. Iron deficiency anemia was detected in the pregnant dams in the third trimester and compromised iron status was seen in the prenatally iron-deprived infants at birth, but no iron deficiency was seen in either the prenatally or postnatally iron-deprived infants during the period of behavioral evaluation. Neither prenatal nor postnatal iron deprivation led to significant delays in growth, or gross or fine motor development. Prenatally deprived infants demonstrated a 20% reduced spontaneous activity level, lower inhibitory response to novel environments, and more changes from one behavior to another in weekly observation sessions. Postnatally deprived infants demonstrated poorer performance of an object concept task, and greater emotionality relative to controls. This study indicates that different syndromes of behavioral effects are associated with prenatal and postnatal iron deprivation in rhesus monkey infants and that these effects can occur in the absence of concurrent iron deficiency as reflected in hematological measures. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The role of salmon-catching bears in increasing the fertility of the forests and the bordering woodlands is discussed. Bears fertilize the forests, nourishing them by discarding partially eaten salmon carcasses. The large predators bring valuable marine-derived nutrients, in the form of salmon tissues, to the woodlands, where the uneaten fish provide sustenance for animals and plants. The bears consume about 25 percent of each captured salmon, selectively eating only the parts highest in fat contents, such as eggs. Bears make a tremendous amount of food and nutrients available to streamside plants and animals that would otherwise not have the access to this resource, by killing many of the fatter salmons, carrying the fish to the forest and abondoning the carcass. The foraging of all the animals feeding on that carcass, together with leaching by rain and microbial activity, breaks down the carcass, making the nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients.},

abstract={Female sand tilefish (Malacanthus plumieri) inhabiting a deep channel in the fringing reef at Glover's Atoll, Belize (channel females) spawned planktonic eggs more frequently than those occupying the shallow sand-rubble slopes adjacent to patch coral reefs inside the atoll lagoon (reef-slope females). We tested five non-exclusive hypotheses to explain habitat differences in female spawning frequency. We found no evidence that spawning frequency variation was a consequence of differences in food availability, variation in male fertility, or the intensity of predation on spawned eggs. On reef slopes, barracuda stalked tilefish near their benthic burrows, whereas these piscivores attacked channel tilefish by diving suddenly from higher in the water column. Differences in the hunting behavior of barracuda suggested that the behavior of tilefish females might be influenced by temporal variation in predation risk (risk allocation hypothesis). Consistent with this hypothesis, reef-slope females had a much higher frequency of retreats to burrows in response to barracuda, spent more time burrowing and ventured less far from these refugia in response to a simulated predatory threat. As predicted by the risk allocation hypothesis, reef-slope females also had lower and more variable frequencies of foraging bites, and shorter and more variable travel distances to forage than channel females. Estimated mortality from predation was over nine times higher in channel tilefish. Consistent with the hypothesis that investment in current vs. future reproduction is influenced by rates of adult mortality (mortality risk hypothesis), channel females invested more supplemental energy in egg production whereas reef-slope females invested more in growth. Our results indicate that behavioral and life-history traits of female tilefish show phenotypic plasticity depending upon the nature and intensity of localized predation risk. © 2006 Blackwell Verlag.},

abstract={Objective: Eating in the absence of hunger (EAH) may be a behavioral trait through which obesity-promoting genes promote positive energy balance. The primary aim of this study was to compare children born at high vs. low risk for obesity with respect to EAH at 5 years of age. Research Methods and Procedures: This was an observational investigation of families enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania and The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Infant Growth Study. Five-year-old children born at high (N = 28) or low (N = 25) risk for obesity on the basis of maternal prepregnancy body weight were evaluated at a hospital-based laboratory. Children consumed 11 snack foods ad libitum after consuming an ad libitum dinner and reporting fullness. Parents reported on snack foods at home and their own eating styles. Nutritive sucking at 3 months of age was evaluated by computerized apparatus. Results: EAH in high-risk boys (mean ± standard error = 326 ± 66 kJ] was more than twice that of low-risk boys (mean ± standard error = 151 ± 39 kJ), p = 0.03. Among girls, there was a trend for EAH to be associated with increased parental limitations on daughter snack food consumption at home (p = 0.06). EAH was unrelated to 3-month sucking behavior. Discussion: Genes that promote childhood obesity may partially exert their influence through EAH, an effect that was limited to boys born at risk for obesity. The unique influences of genes and home environment on this trait should be disaggregated in subsequent studies. Copyright © 2006 NAASO.},

abstract={The chase-away model of sexual selection posits that elaborate male sexual displays arise because they exploit preexisting biases in females' sensory systems and induce females to mate in a suboptimal manner. An essential element of this hypothesis is that such manipulation should quickly lead to female resistance to male displays. Nuptial food gifts may be a frequent conduit by which males attempt to influence the mating behavior of females against females' own reproductive interests. In decorated crickets Gryllodes sigillatus, such inducements come in the form of a spermatophylax, a gelatinous mass forming part of the male's spermatophore and consumed by the female after mating. We conducted experiments in which spermatophylaxes obtained from male G. sigillatus were offered as novel food gifts to females of a non-gift-giving species (Acheta domesticus) having no evolutionary history of spermatophylax consumption. Female A. domesticus that were allowed to consume the spermatophylax took significantly longer to remate than when given no such opportunity. In contrast, when female G. sigillatus were prevented from consuming their partners' nuptial gifts, there was no difference in their propensity to remate relative to females permitted to consume a food gift after mating. These results suggest that the spermatophylax synthesized by male G. sigillatus contains substances designed to inhibit the sexual receptivity of their mates but that female G. sigillatus have evolved reduced responsiveness to these substances. © 2006 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={Optimality theory rests on the assumptions that short-term foraging decisions are driven by variation in environmental quality, and that these decisions have important implications for long-term fitness. These assumptions, however, are rarely tested in a field setting. We linked behavioral foraging decisions in food patches with measures of environmental quality covering larger spatial (resource density) or temporal (growth parameters) scales. In 10 lakes, we measured the food density at which benthic fish give up foraging in experimental food patches (giving-up density, GUD), quantified the biomass of benthic invertebrates, and calculated the maximum individual size (L ∞) of bream (Abramis brama L.), a typical benthivore in these lakes. We found positive relationships between resource density and both GUD and L∞, and a positive relationship between L∞ and GUD. Prey characterized as vulnerable to predation contributed most to the relationships between resource density and either GUD or L∞. A path analysis showed that resource density and L∞ directly explained 54% and 28%, respectively, of the variation in GUD, whereas 86% of the variation in L∞ was explained by resource density, with mostly indirect contribution from GUD. We conclude that the short-term foraging behavior of benthivores matched our expectations based on optimality theory by being positively linked to variables on environmental quality operating at both a larger spatial scale and a longer temporal scale. © 2006 by the the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={1. Trade-off theory has been extensively used to further our understanding of animal behaviour. In mammalian herbivores, it has been used to advance our understanding of their reproductive, parental care and foraging strategies. Here, we detail how trade-off theory can be applied to herbivore-parasite interactions, especially in foraging environments. 2. Foraging is a common mode of uptake of parasites that represent the most pervasive challenge to mammalian fitness and survival. Hosts are hypothesized to alter their foraging behaviour in the presence of parasites in three ways: (i) hosts avoid foraging in areas that are contaminated with parasites; (ii) hosts select diets that increase their resistance and resilience to parasites; and (iii) hosts select for foods with direct anti-parasitic properties (self-medication). We concentrate on the mammalian herbivore literature to detail the recent advances made using trade-off frameworks to understand the mechanisms behind host-parasite interactions in relation to these three hypotheses. 3. In natural systems, animals often face complex foraging decisions including nutrient intake vs. predation risk, nutrient intake vs. sheltering and nutrient intake vs. parasite risk trade-offs. A trade-off framework is detailed that can be used to interpret mammal behaviour in complex environments, and may be used to advance the self-medication hypothesis. 4. The use of trade-off theory has advanced our understanding of the contact process between grazing mammalian hosts and their parasites transmitted via the faecal-oral route. Experimental manipulation of the costs and benefits of a nutrient intake vs. parasite risk trade-off has shown that environmental conditions (forage quality and quantity) and the physiological state (parasitic and immune status) of a mammalian host can both affect the behavioural decisions of foraging animals. 5. Naturally occurring trade-offs and the potential to manipulate their costs and benefits enables us to identify the abilities and behavioural rules used by mammals when making decisions in complex environments and thus predict animal behaviour. © 2006 Mammal Society.},

abstract={The oceans are nutritionally dilute, and finding food is a major challenge for many zooplanktonic predators. Chemodetection is necessary for successful prey-capture, but little is known about the infochemicals involved in the interaction between herbivorous copepods and their phytoplankton prey. We used females of Temora longicornis to investigate chemodetection of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in this calanoid copepod and quantified its behavioral response to plumes of DMS using video-microscopy in combination with laser-sheet particle image velocimetry (PIV). Slow injection of a 1-μmol L-1 DMS plume into the feeding current resulted in a characteristic behavioral pattern ("tail-flapping"), a redirection of flow equivalent to 30% of the average current velocity, and changes in the location of flow-induced vortices. In free-swimming individuals, this likely results in somersault-type movements that are associated with search behavior in copepods. In comparison to seawater controls, DMS injections significantly increased the average number of tail-flaps per copepod during the first 2 s after exposure to DMS gradients. Our results demonstrate that copepods can detect and react to plumes of DMS and suggest that this biogenic trace gas can influence the structure and function of pelagic foodwebs. © 2006, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract={Cathemeral species are routinely active during the day, the night and at twilight. For the majority of species it is advantageous to specialize on the environmental conditions of a particular phase of the 24-hour day, so this rather uncommon type of activity must be a consequence of specific constraints. Good examples are the polyphasic activity patterns found in some small mammals. In shrews, with small body size and extremely high metabolic rate, polyphasic activity represents a simple short-term hunger cycle. In voles the short-term rhythm is triggered by an additional endogenous ultradian clock that interacts with the common circadian system, which probably is functionally related to endosymbiont digestion of cellulose-rich food. The activity bouts of individuals are synchronized on the population level to spread predation risk. As cathemeral species, voles are not specifically adapted to particular light conditions, but they are also not restricted to a particular activity phase. Therefore, the benefits from flexible responses in activity timing to environmental challenges may compensate for the disadvantages of not being specialized. Copyright © 2006 S. Karger AG.},

abstract={In temperate regions, winter presents animals with a number of challenges including depressed food abundance, increased daily energy requirements, higher frequency of extreme weather events and shortened day length. Overcoming these constraints is critical for overwintering survival and scheduling of future breeding of long-lived species and is likely to be state dependent, associated with intrinsic abilities such as food acquisition rates. We examined the relationship between environmental and intrinsic factors on overwintering foraging and subsequent breeding phenology of the European shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis, a diurnal marine predator. We tested a range of hypotheses relating to overwintering foraging time and location. We found that individuals greatly increased their foraging time in winter to a peak of more than 90% of available daylight at the winter solstice. The seasonal patterns of foraging time appear to be driven by a combination of light levels and weather conditions and may be linked to the availability of the shag's principal prey, the lesser sandeel Ammodytes marinus. There was no evidence that shags dispersed south in winter to increase potential foraging time. Foraging time decreased after the winter solstice and, crucially, was correlated with subsequent breeding phenology, such that individuals that spent less time foraging in February bred earlier. The relationship was much stronger in females than males, in line with their more direct control of timing of breeding. Our results demonstrate that pre-breeding intrinsic foraging ability is critical in determining breeding phenology. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract={Rationale: The amnesic effects of morphine may be related to its action on nociception, anxiety, or locomotion. This effect is also suggested to be related to state dependency. Objectives: The aims of this study were to verify the effects of morphine on mice tested in the plus-maze discriminative avoidance task (DAT) that uses light and noise as aversive stimuli and allows the concomitant evaluation of learning, memory, anxiety, and locomotion and also to verify the possible role of state-dependent learning in the effects of morphine. Methods and results: The DAT was conducted in a modified elevated plus-maze. In the training, the aversive stimuli were applied when mice entered in one of the enclosed arms, whereas in the test, no stimuli were applied. The main results showed that (1) pretraining morphine (5-20 mg/kg i.p.) induced retrieval deficits (evaluated by the time spent in the aversive arm in the test) but not acquisition deficits (evaluated by the decrease in aversive arm exploration along the training); (2) pretest morphine (5-10 but not 20 mg/kg) counteracted this deficit; (3) morphine induced hypolocomotion (decreased number of entries in the arms), irrespective of memory alterations; and (4) morphine did not alter anxiety-like behavior (evaluated by the time spent in the open arms) during the training. Conclusions: Morphine given before training induces retrieval deficits in mice tested in the DAT, and these deficits could be related to morphine-induced state-dependent learning. Neither the memory deficit induced by pretraining morphine nor the reversal of this deficit by pretest morphine seems to be related to anxiety levels or locomotor alterations. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

We suggest that rearing is a useful marker of environmental novelty, that the hippocampal formation is a crucial component of the system controlling rearing in novel environments, and that rearing is one of several ethological measures that can profitably be used to assess hippocampal learning and memory. Consideration is given to the following topics: the possible functions of rearing in information-gathering and escape behaviour; the modulation of rearing by various factors such as anxiety/ fear emotionality; comparative perspectives on rearing; neuroanatomical circuits involved in rearing with particular reference to the hippocampal formation and its afferents and efferents; and the role of the hippocampal formation in uncharted and mismatch environmental novelty. The review concludes with testable predictions about rearing, environmental novelty and the hippocampus. © Freund & Pettman.},

abstract={A functional response study of the eight most common arthropod predators of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), eggs was conducted in the laboratory. Predators were starved for 24 h, and single predators were exposed to different prey density treatments. Predation response was observed at 6, 12, and 24 h after reeding trials began. At the highest prey density (150 eggs per predator), Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville and Collops quadrimaculatus (F.) adults and Chrysopa oculata Say larvae showed the highest consumption rates (116, 85, and 119 eggs/24 h, respectively), followed by H. convergens larvae (51 eggs/24 h), adult Geocoris punctipes (Say) (45 eggs/24 h), and adult Scymnus loewii Mulsant, Orius insidiosus (Say), Notoxus spp., and Nabis capsiformis Germar (1, 1, 10, and 12 eggs/24 h, respectively). Adult Notoxus spp., N. capsiformis, and O. insidiosus showed type 1 functional response, whereas adult C. quadrimaculatus, G. punctipes, H. convergens, and larval H. convergens and C. oculata showed type 2 response. All predators consumed the highest number of bollworm eggs at 35°C and the lowest numbers at 15°C; predation rate at 35°C was four times higher than that at 15°C. The prey density- dependent behavior of predators and effect of temperature on their predation behavior are discussed. © 2006 Entomological Society of America.},

abstract={Short-range predator-prey interactions among small soil-dwelling arthropods are poorly understood. In this study, we measured the behavioural interactions between the predacious mite Hypoaspis aculeifer Canestrini (Gamasida: Laelapidae) and its collembolan prey Folsomia fimetaria L. (Collembola: Isotomidae) and the influence of sex, size, starvation, and poisoning with the organophosphate dimethoate. Pairs of mite and springtail were placed in 18-mm diameter test arenas with a plaster of Paris substrate and their behaviour were measured by a computerized vision system, which automatically detected the locomotory activity of the two animals, their encounters, and the precise time of capture and killing. Data suggest that neither the mite nor the springtail possesses near-field sensory detection of the opponent. A Cox regression model showed that mite sex, size ratio between the predator and prey, average mite velocity, and encounter rate had a significant influence on the mite-capture efficiency (springtail survival). Female H. aculeifer demonstrated higher capture efficiency than males by catching and killing their prey after fewer encounters. Surprisingly, starvation had only a moderate effect on the mite locomotory behaviour and no influence on the capture efficiency as such. Also, springtail survival was independent of its moulting stage. Sublethal poisoning with dimethoate, on the other hand, dramatically increased the mite's capture rate, probably by impeding the evasive response of the springtail. © 2006 The Netherlands Entomological Society.},

abstract={Objectives - To determine historical events leading to establishment of bovine tuberculosis in the white-tailed deer population in the northeastern corner of the lower peninsula (NELP) of Michigan and describe factors relevant to the present outbreak of bovine tuberculosis in Michigan. Sample population - Cattle and white-tailed deer in Michigan from 1920 to 1990. Procedures - A search of extant historical documents (eg, scie ntific journals, books, public reports, and correspondence and internal reports from governmental agencies) was conducted. Factors investigated included the number of cattle and prevalence of tuberculosis, deer population and density levels, and changes in regional environments affecting the population and management of cattle and wild deer. Results - High deer numbers and severe winter feed shortages resulting from habitat destruction in the NELP in 1930 contributed to the transmission of tuberculosis from cattle to deer. Starvation increased the susceptibility of deer to infection and modified behavior such that exposure to infected cattle was increased. Relocation of deer resulted in spread of infection to other sites, including locations at which spatial clusters of tuberculosis presently exist. Ribotyping of Mycobacterium bovis from a human patient suggests that the strain of M bovis presently infecting white-tailed deer in the region is the same strain that affected cattle farms at that time. Conclusions and clinical relevance - Feeding deer to maintain numbers above the normal carrying capacity of the NELP led to deer depending on consumption of livestock feed for survival during winter and increased contact with domestic cattle. This practice should be avoided.},

abstract={Introduction The fundamental assumption underlying the DOHaD model is that environmental factors acting in early life have consequences which become manifest as an altered disease risk in later life. The concept that multiple phenotypes can arise during development from a single genotype (‘developmental plasticity’) is not new: these different phenotypes are based on the nature of the gene-environment interactions, a feature well recognised in developmental biology and the range of phenotypes that can be induced is termed the reaction norm (Gilbert 2001). Given the universality of developmental plasticity, particular sets of phenotypic outcomes may be manifest as variable disease risk (Bateson et al. 2004). As a result, one part of the reaction norm may be associated with better survival in one type of environment, while another is better suited to a different environment. One example comes from the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria, where factors acting in the larval stage induce a phenotype appropriate for migratory or non-migratory situations (Applebaum and Heifetz 1999, Simpson et al., 2002). Having a wing shape appropriate for a non-migratory lifestyle will compromise the locust in a situation of overcrowding and nutritional compromise. While in comparative biology the concept of environmentally influenced developmental trajectories has been accepted, its influence on our understanding of human disease has taken time to be accepted. This delay has impacted on how the developmental-origins field has developed since the early epidemiological observations in humans relating birth size to later disease risk (Forsdahl 1977, Barker and Osmond 1986). © P.

abstract={We studied the impact of grazing and substrate supply on the size structure of a freshwater bacterial strain (Flectobacillus sp.) which showed pronounced morphological plasticity. The cell length varied from 2 to >40 μm and encompassed rods, curved cells, and long filaments. Without grazers and with a sufficient substrate supply, bacteria grew mainly in the form of medium-sized rods (4 to 7 μm), with a smaller proportion (<10%) of filamentous forms. Grazing experiments with the bacterivorous flagellate Ochromonas sp. showed that freely suspended cells of <7 μm were highly vulnerable to grazers, whereas filamentous cells were resistant to grazing and became enriched during predation. A comparison of long-term growth in carbon-limited chemostats with and without grazers revealed that strikingly different bacterial populations developed: treatments with flagellates were composed of >80% filamentous cells. These attained a biomass comparable to that of populations in chemostats without grazers, which were composed of medium-sized rods and c-shaped cells. Carbon starvation resulted in a fast decrease in cell length and a shift towards small rods, which were highly vulnerable to grazing. Dialysis bag experiments in combination with continuous cultivation revealed that filament formation was significantly enhanced even without direct contact of bacteria with bacterivores and was thus probably stimulated by grazer excretory products.

The purpose of this study was to explore the longitudinal influences of personality and health behaviors on changes in fatigue. One hundred and seventy-eight participants of the Georgia Centenarian Study were part of this study. Multiple regression analyses were computed to assess the influence of personality, physical activity, stress management, and nutritional risk on fatigue after initial fatigue, self-reported health, and psychosocial variables were controlled for. Anxiety, physical activity, and nutritional risk had significant longitudinal effects on fatigue. Older adults who were anxious, less engaged in physical activity, and who had higher levels of nutritional risk were more likely to show increased fatigue levels. The results suggest that more clinical and research attention should he paid to changes of fatigue in older populations. Copyright 2006 by The Gerontological Society of America.},

abstract={BACKGROUND/AIM: Numerous studies have provided clear and convincing evidence that psychosocial factors contribute to the pathogenesis and expression of coronary heart disease (CHD). These factors have been related to the following psychosocial domains: personality factors and character traits, depression, anxiety, social isolation and chronic life stress. The aim of this study was to estimate the influence of personality traits and psychosocial risk factors for the development of coronary heart disease. METHODS: The investigation was conducted as observational cross-sectional (case-control) study. Based on medical records all subjects were divided into two groups: the group of patients with CHD (61 participants), and the control group of 41 healthy participants. All participants fulfilled the Eysenck Inventory Questionnaire, Paykel stress scale and Bortner scale of A-B self-estimation. RESULTS: The participants with CHD were shown to have lower education than healthy participants, but were comparable by gender, age and place of residence. According to the Bortner scale, most participants with CHD expressed type A personality, whereas most healthy participants expressed types B and AB. The patients with CHD achieved higher scores on the Paykel stress scale of life events, and they had the higher level of neurotic and psychotic tendencies, as well as the lower level of extroversion compared to the healthy participants. Multivariate logistic regression model identified chronic stress (odds ratio 1.018; 95% confidence interval 1.007-1.028) as an important predictor for the occurrence of coronary heart disease, when adjusted for age, gender, nourishment and blood pressure. On the other side, the lower risk for the occurrence of CHD was observed among the participants who had the higher level of extroversion (odds ratio 0.859; 95% confidence interval 0.636-0.902). CONCLUSION: Chronic stress and introversion can be considered important risk factors for the development of coronary heart disease, independent of other predictors such as obesity and hypertension, supporting the biopsychosocial model of the occurrence of coronary heart disease.},

abstract={Background: Variation in the perception of bitter tastes has been associated with eating behavior, body composition, and cardiovascular disease. Recent observations have implicated 2 common haplotypes of TAS2R38 in the determination of bitter compound-tasting ability. Objective: The objectives of the study were to examine, in the British Women's Heart and Health Study cohort, any association between TAS2R38 haplotypes, coronary heart disease (CHD), CHD risk factors, and eating behavior and to examine whether the associations allow for estimation of the effects of variation in diet on the etiology of common disease. Design: We conducted a cross-sectional study of relations between TAS2R38 haplotypes and CHD, CHD risk factors, and eating behavior in 3383 women from 23 British towns. Results: Genotyping at P49A and V262A in TAS2R38 (rs713598 and rs1726866) allowed construction of all 4 possible haplotypes. The 2 most common haplotypes corresponded with previously identified haplotypes related to bitter compound-tasting ability. No substantial evidence of association was found between these haplotypes and CHD (odds ratio for taste-defining haplotypes: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.2), body mass index (difference between means of taste-defining haplotypes: -0.084; 95% CI: -0.45, 0.29), or a series of physiologic and dietary characteristics. A marginally lower risk of diabetes was observed among those with the nontaster haplotype than among those with the taster haplotype (odds ratio: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.48, 1.00). Conclusion: TAS2R38 status was not an important determinant of CHD, related risk factors, or eating behavior in the British Women's Heart and Health Study sample. © 2005 American Society for Clinical Nutrition.},

Method: Using preprogrammed, hand-held computers, 39 women with bulimia-spectrum eating disorders monitored ongoing eating episodes, dietary restraint, and binge cravings over a 7-29-day interval. Results: Multilevel modeling analyses indicated that restraint was not systematically elevated before binging. However, elevated restraint preceded strong binge cravings. Conclusion: Results suggest that dietary restraint may contribute to binge cravings, but may not be a direct antecedent to binge episodes. Such findings are consistent with restraint theory, which suggests that dietary restraint potentiates binging, but does not necessarily trigger its occurrence. © 2005 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Environmental enrichment falls into four general categories: foraging opportunities, structural complexity, sensory stimulation/novelty, and social companionship. Each may have distinct behavioural effects. We examined the use of these four enrichment types, and their effects on activity budgets (foraging, general activity, pacing), social proximity preference (time spent observing companions through a window), and fear (flight distance in a predator surprise test, consumption of novel food) in adult Japanese quail. Foraging and structural enrichments were used extensively (29 and 26% of scans, respectively), as were the dustbaths available in all pens (16%). Use of enrichments and the dustbath was consistent over 24 h and over 17 d (partial r &gt; 0.42, p &lt; 0.001). Foraging enrichment increased foraging (F 3,89 = 5.66, p &lt; 0.01) and general activity (F3,89 = 4.75, p &lt; 0.01). Foraging and structural enrichment decreased pacing (F 3,89 = 6.33, p = 0.001). Novelty enrichment had no significant effects. Social housing reduced use of enrichments (enrichment treatment × housing type F3,89 = 3.30, p &lt; 0.05) and dustbaths (F 1,89 = 4.59, p &lt; 0.05), suggesting resource monopolisation. Male birds ate more novel food (F1,45 = 5.43, p &lt; 0.05) and spent more time observing social companions (F1,45 = 7.88, p &lt; 0.01) than females, who used enrichments (F1,89 = 13.35, p &lt; 0.01) and foraged more (F1,89 = 38.18, p &lt; 0.001) and were more active than males (F1,89 = 34.83, p &lt; 0.001). Results indicate that the use and behavioural effects of enrichment vary by enrichment type in caged quail. Foraging enrichment had the most positive behavioural effects while social housing had some negative effects. Furthermore, male and female quail may not benefit equally from enrichment. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Cover provides shelter, food, nesting opportunities and protection from predators. The behavioural response of small mammals to reduced cover has been well documented. However, very little is known about the effect of cover on community and population dynamics. Australian small mammals generally inhabit extremely dynamic ecosystems, where cover and food supplies are greatly affected by fire. Species are described as early or late seral specialists, generally returning to a disturbed area once their habitat requirements are met. Habitat requirements have loosely been interpreted as cover and food supply, however, these factors are not mutually exclusive and few studies have attempted to determine the driving factors behind small mammal succession. In this study, we manipulated specific aspects of cover in the eucalypt forests of Fraser Island and show that the behaviour and population dynamics of small mammals were greatly affected. A reduction of cover from grass-trees (Xanthorrhoea johnsonii) did not affect small mammal species composition, however, the abundance and size structure distribution of the dominant species (Rattus fuscipes) decreased. Patch use by rodents also decreased after cover was reduced. Rattus fuscipes must trade-off remaining in an environment with increased risk of predation, or disperse to an area with greater cover but increased competition. Juveniles dominated (>60%) populations of R. fuscipes after cover was reduced, however, size distributions of control sites were relatively more even (<25% juvenile). While adult R. fuscipes are either killed by predators or disperse to other areas, juveniles that remained or immigrated to an area of reduced cover gained a selective advantage over those in control sites, because reduced competition with adults increased body condition of juvenile R. fuscipes.},

A prospective test of the dual-pathway model of bulimic pathology: mediating effects of dieting and negative affect. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 110, 124-135.] in a non-clinical sample of female adolescents and a clinical sample of female eating disorder patients. The model assumes that negative affect and restrained eating mediates the link between body dissatisfaction and overeating. We also tested an extended version of the model postulating that negative affect and overeating are not directly related, but indirectly through lack of interoceptive awareness and emotional eating. Structural equation modelling was used to test our models. First, in the two samples, body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness were associated with overeating/binge eating. In both clinical and adolescent sample, we found support for the negative affect pathway and not for the restraint pathway. Lack of interoceptive awareness and emotional eating appear to (partly) explain the association between negative affect and overeating. Emotional eating was much more strongly associated with overeating in the clinical than in the adolescent sample. In sum, we found substantial evidence for the negative affect pathway in the dual pathway model. The link between body dissatisfaction and overeating in this respect might be explained by the fact that negative affect, due to body dissatisfaction, is related to a lack of awareness of personal feelings and to eating when dealing with negative emotions, which on its turn is associated with overeating. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Obesity is a multifactorial disease associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, cancer, and consequently, with a reduced length of life. Metabolic phenotypes of reduced energy expenditure have been associated with weight gain, but their contribution has been estimated to be relatively small. On the other hand, excessive food intake is likely to be the major determinant of positive energy balances and it is underlied by both non-conscious (homeostatic) and conscious (perceptual, emotional, and cognitive) phenomena processed in the brain. Functional neuroimaging is a promising tool to investigate these neural substrates in humans, because it provides a measurement of state-dependent brain regional activity, bridging the gap between neural events and behavioral responses. Using this technology, a few studies have provided the first evidence of functional differences between obese and lean individuals in the brain's response to energy intake and investigated the presence of neural risk factors of weight gain. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={We investigated whether protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) exacerbates brain injury in global ischemia. It was hypothesized that PEM would increase secondary brain damage by worsening ischemia-induced depletion of glutathione (GSH) and increasing oxidative stress. Adult male gerbils were fed an adequate protein (12.5%; C) or low protein (2%; PEM) diet for 4 weeks and subjected to 5 min of bilateral carotid artery occlusion (Ischemia) or sham surgery (Sham). At 12 h post-ischemia, GSH and markers of oxidative stress were measured in hippocampus and neocortex. The remaining gerbils were tested in the open field on days 3, 7, and 10, with viable hippocampal CA1 neurons assessed on day 10. Although the habituation of C-Ischemia gerbils in the open field was normal by day 7, PEM-Ischemia gerbils failed to habituate even by day 10 and spent greater time in the outer zone (P < 0.05). Mean (±SEM) total number of viable CA1 neurons at 10 days post-ischemia were C-Sham = 713 (13), C-Ischemia = 264 (48), PEM-Sham = 716 (12), and PEM-Ischemia = 286 (66). Although PEM did not increase CA1 neuron loss caused by ischemia, a subset (4/12) of PEM-Ischemia gerbils showed dramatic reactive gliosis accompanied by extensive neuronal loss. Hippocampal protein thiols were decreased by PEM and ischemia. Although the mechanism is yet to be established, the finding that PEM worsens functional outcome following global ischemia is clinically relevant since 16% of elderly are nutritionally compromised at the time of admission for stroke. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Context: Mature ghrelin has been shown to stimulate eating and to participate in the regulation of insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis. Its gene, GHRL, is located on chromosome 3 in a region where we have shown linkage to eating behavior, percentage body fat, and total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in subjects of the Amish Family Diabetes Study. Objective: Our objective was to determine whether mutations in GHRL might influence eating behavior and risk for metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, and related traits. Design: We genotyped 856 Amish samples for three missense polymorphisms in GHRL, Arg51Gln, Leu72Met (rs696217), and Gln90Leu (rs4684677) and performed association analyses with eating behavior traits and metabolic syndrome as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Subjects: Our subjects were adult participants in the Amish Family Diabetes Study. Results: The allele frequencies of these variants were 0.03, 0.04, and 0.03, respectively. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was lower among those carrying the 51Gln allele (3.8 vs. 15.8%; age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio = 0.22; P = 0.031). Hunger scores tended to be lower among 51Gln allele carriers but did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07). The Leu72Met variant was also associated with increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome (23.2 vs. 13.4%; age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio = 2.57; P = 0.02) as well as higher fasting glucose, lower high-density lipoprotein, and higher triglyceride levels (P = 0.02, P = 0.007, and P = 0.04, respectively). The two variants were not in linkage disequilibrium with each other, suggesting independent effects. We conclude that mutations in GHRL may confer risk for the metabolic syndrome.

The relative contribution of broad risk factors to these disorders is discussed, including temperament, genetics, biological influences, cognition, and familial variables. In addition, the role that specific learning experiences play in relation to each disorder is reviewed. In an overarching hierarchical model, it is proposed that generalized anxiety disorder, and to some extent panic disorder, loads most heavily on broad underlying factors, whereas specific life history contributes most strongly to circumscribed phobias.

abstract={Until recently, the principal causes of degenerative disease were thought to act in adult life and to accelerate destructive processes, such as the formation of atheroma and rise in blood pressure. Recent observations that people who develop coronary heart disease grow differently to other people during fetal life and childhood have, however, led to a new 'developmental' model for the disease. Low birthweight has been shown to be associated with increased rates of coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and altered glucose tolerance. These associations with low birthweight extend across the normal range of birthweight and reflect slow fetal growth ratherthan premature birth. The associations are thought to be consequences of developmental plasticity, the phenomenon by which one genotype can give rise to a range of different physiological or morphological states in response to different environmental conditions during development. Recent observations suggest that low birthweight, thinness at 2 years of age and an increase in body mass index (BMI) after the age of 2 years are each associated with the development of insulin resistance in later life. The prevention of a substantial proportion of type 2 diabetes and other disorders linked to insulin resistance may, therefore, depend on interventions during development. These include protecting the growth of babies during the first 2 years after birth by good infant feeding practices and preventing a rapid increase in BMI after the age of 2 years. Improving fetal nutrition remains an important long-term goal. Copyright © 2005 S. Karger AG.},

abstract={The novelists Rebecca West, Winifred Holtby, Margaret Storm Jameson, and Naomi Mitchison developed an interest in politics during the 1930s as a response to the pervasive belief that their society was becoming increasingly uncivil and fragmented. The erosion of social bonds had adverse emotional effects on the members of their communities and prevented the creation of associations that would bring about the socio-political change needed to prevent another war. Politics was a means of establishing workable relationships between the state - felt to be increasingly distant from the lives of the majority of the citizenry; the sum of voluntary associations which constituted civil society; and individuals, demoralised by isolation. It was to the workings of civil society that these four writers turned their attention with a view to examining closely the intricacies of human relationships under adverse conditions. At the same time, they offered alternative models of human interaction that would allow individuals to develop their personalities more fully in a nourishing environment. This article analyses their position by placing their non-fictional work within the context of the political ideas circulating at the time, emphasising the moral implications of their political vocabulary.},

abstract={Protein feeding is known to decrease hunger and subsequent food intake in animals and humans. It has also been suggested that glucose appearance into portal vein, as occurring during meal assimilation, may induce comparable effects. Here, we connect these previous observations by reporting that intestinal gluconeogenesis (i.e., de novo synthesis of glucose) is induced during the postabsorptive time (following food digestion) in rats specifically fed on protein-enriched diet. This results in glucose release into portal blood, counterbalancing the lowering of glycemia resulting from intestinal glucose utilization. Comparable infusions into the portal vein of control postabsorptive rats (fed on starch-enriched diet) decrease food consumption and activate the hypothalamic nuclei regulating food intake. Similar hypothalamic activation occurs on protein feeding. All these effects are absent after denervation of the portal vein. Thus, portal sensing of intestinal gluconeogenesis may be a novel mechanism connecting the macronutrient composition of diet to food intake. Copyright © 2005 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Most avian migration is consisted of migratory flights and stopover. Fuel is consumed during the former and deposited during the later period. Avian migrants are adapted to the frequent alternations between energy consumption and deposition. This paper reviewed the studies of the energetic ecology of migratory birds during stopover periods focusing on the rate of energy deposition, patterns of body mass change and phenotypic plasticity of digestive organs. Future research directions of the physiological ecology of stopover migrants were also discussed. Anticipating energetic demanding, avian migrants deposit fat stores before migration. However, they often have to periodically replenish depleted energy stores during stopovers. Fat is the main source of migration energy of avian migrants although more studies recently documented the use of protein during migration. Fuel deposition rate at the stopover sites affects the speed and the probability of a successful migration. Migrants can increase the fuel depositions through increasing foraging time, feeding rate and possibly assimilation rate. Some birds can decrease the fuel consumption rate during stopover through hibernation. Affected by the food resources, inter- and intra-species competition, predation risk and weather conditions, fuel deposition rate varies among stopover sites. Studies have suggested that the availability of food resources is the key factor which determines the fuel deposition rate. Molting, an energetically expensive event, decrease the fuel deposition rate of some species, especially in fall. The pattern of body mass change of stopover migrants is organ and time dependent. The muscle mass of flight organs increases over stopover period and reaches maximum just before migrants depart the stopover sites; the mass of digestive organs increases during the early period of stopover and decreases before migrants depart the stopover sites. The mass of digestive organs just before the departures is similar to that when the birds arrive at the stopover sites. This pattern indicates that birds are adapted to the variations of functional requirements of different body systems between migratory fly and fuel deposition periods and are optimized through special regulation mechanisms. However, this pattern has not been observed in migrants during short-distance migration. During stopover, the size and mass of digestive organs increase with the increase of food intake. However, the activity of digestive enzyme and the rate of assimilation do not change obviously. Many birds change their food choice from carnivory to phytophagy or omnivory, which is coupled with the increase of digestive organs, activity of digestive enzyme, and in some cases, the assimilation rate. However, the phenotypic plasticity of digestive organs is limited, fasting during a long-distance migration can result in the reduction of the size and function of digestive organs. Energetic ecology of stopover bird migrants still need to further address: (1) body composition change during migration, (2) effect of the availability and type of food resources on the digestive organs during stopovers, (3) integrative effects of migration on the physiological ecology, (4) energetic ecology under natural conditions, and (5) the fuel deposition rate over the entire migration journals of a migrant.},

abstract={Resource use is known to influence the ranging behaviour of primates, and this effect may be pronounced when the resource is uncommon in the environment. Here we investigate the effect of geophagy on the ranging behaviour of Phayre's leaf monkeys (Trachypithecus phayrei) in the Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand. UTM coordinates were collected via GPS from the group centre every 30 min during all-day follows of one study group over a 4-month period. On days during which the group visited a distant saltlick (n = 3), the monkeys travelled significantly further (p < 0.001), significantly faster (p < 0.001) and with fewer stops compared to non-saltlick days (n = 61). Saltlick visits also increased the home range size from 73.7 ha to 93.4 ha. Increased daily path length, increased travel speed and consistent pace are necessary because of the distance from the saltlick to the regularly used portion of the home range, and these reflect the importance of soil consumption to the leaf monkeys.

Two of the candidate risk genes encode the enzymes proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) and catechol-O- methyltransferase (COMT), which modulate the levels of a putative neuromodulator (L-proline) and the neurotransmitter dopamine, respectively. Mice that model the state of PRODH deficiency observed in humans with schizophrenia show increased neurotransmitter release at glutamatergic synapses as well as deficits in associative learning and response to psychomimetic drugs. Transcriptional profiling and pharmacological manipulations identified a transcriptional and behavioral interaction between the Prodh and Comt genes that is likely to represent a homeostatic response to enhanced dopaminergic signaling in the frontal cortex. This interaction modulates a number of schizophrenia-related phenotypes, providing a framework for understanding the high disease risk associated with this locus, the expression of the phenotype, or both. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract={We study whether and how physiological demands affect foraging decisions under predation risk, by evaluating the effect of starvation on the rate of food consumption and prey-size preferences and the potential trade-off between starvation and predation risk on foraging behavior in the whelk Acanthina monodon, a gastropod inhabiting the intertidal rocky shores of central Chile. These whelks appear to adjust their foraging strategy to physiological (nutritional) demand and predation risk. Starvation reduced the effect of predation risk on the rate of food consumption by A. monodon. Thus, in the absence of the predator sea star, the rate of food consumption by starved and satiated whelks was similar. When a predator was present, starved whelks fed faster than satiated whelks. Our results indicate that foraging behaviour represents an integrated and hierarchical response to environmental conditions and the physiological conditions of the forager. © 2005 Blackwell Verlag.},

Nowadays, scurvy mainly affects homeless populations of large occidental cities and the isolated and malnourished inhabitants of developing countries. The clinical presentations of scurvy are numerous and often misleading and its evolution without treatment is always lethal. After years of wanderings and research, the physiopathological mechanisms of scurvy were finally understood, due to the will of outstanding personalities who took the risk to brave the established superstitions in order to apply a strict medical approach.

abstract={In a laboratory experiment, we investigated the role played by conspecific chemical cues in the acquisition of chemical recognition of an unfamiliar predator by common toad tadpoles, Bufo bufo. During a ten-day period, we assigned one group of tadpoles to a control (unexposed) and five other groups to different conditioning treatments involving exposure to either an allopatric predatory crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus), or a sympatric harmless gastropod (Lymnaea stagnalis). We kept the caged crayfish under three conditions: i) starved, ii) starved in combination with cues from crushed tadpoles, or iii) fed with toad tadpoles. In the same way, we kept the caged pond snails either alone or paired with cues from crushed tadpoles. After exposure, we carried out behaviour measurements to assess the effects of conditioning treatments on the behavioural responses to chemical cues from starved crayfish, pond snails and crushed conspecifics. Test solutions from starved crayfish and snails produced a significant decrease in the percentage of moving tadpoles, a known antipredator response, but only in the two groups of tadpoles previously exposed to these organisms in combination with cues from crushed conspecifics. These results indicate that Bufo bufo tadpoles can learn to recognize an organism as representing a predation risk based on a prior association between the chemical stimuli from that organism and the chemical cues from damaged conspecifics. © 2005 E.

abstract={The biology and behavior of the longhorned beetle Dectes texanus LeConte (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) was studied on two host plants that suffer economic losses from this pest; sunflower, Helianthus annuus, and soybean, Glycines max. Reciprocal crosses of D. texanus collected from the two plants all produced viable progeny, indicating that conspecific insects attack both crops. Pupae from soybean stalks weighed about 40% less than those from sunflower, and adults fed on soybean lived a mean of 23 days, compared to a mean of 53 days (males) and 76 days (females) for those fed sunflower. A female's larval host plant had no effect on her tendency to ovipuncture plants of either type in a greenhouse trial. A field-tested population collected exclusively from sunflower contained three types of females in similar proportions: those that laid eggs only on sunflower, those that laid only on soybean, and those that laid equally on both host plants. Females in field trials fed more on the plant they had fed on in the laboratory, but soybean-fed females fed more on soybean than did sunflower-fed females. Females fed soybean also made more ovipunctures on soybean plants in field trials than sunflower-fed females, but their responses to sunflower plants were similar. Females displayed higher total ovipositional activity when they encountered sunflower first in the field, and lower total activity when they encountered soybean first. Feeding scores were significantly correlated with ovipunctures and eggs on both plant types. We conclude that sunflower is the preferred host plant, although females will accept soybean when it is the only available food. The results suggest that D. texanus is still in the initial stages of a host range expansion with female host selection behavior demonstrating both genetic influences and phenotypic flexibility. Sunflower represents a nutritionally superior, ancestral host plant and relatively high fitness costs are still associated with utilization of the novel host plant, soybean, costs that may be offset by benefits such as reduced intraspecific competition. These potential benefits and their consequent implications for D. texanus host range evolution are hypothesized and discussed.},

abstract={Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily strikes the elderly. Studies in both humans and animal models have linked the consumption of cholesterol and saturated fats with amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and development of AD. Yet, these studies did not examine high fat diets in combination with reduced carbohydrate intake. Here we tested the effect of a high saturated fat/low carbohydrate diet on a transgenic mouse model of AD. Results: Starting at three months of age, two groups of female transgenic mice carrying the "London" APP mutation (APP/V7171) were fed either, a standard diet (SD) composed of high carbohydrate/low fat chow, or a ketogenic diet (KD) composed of very low carbohydrate/high saturated fat chow for 43 days. Animals fed the KD exhibited greatly elevated serum ketone body levels, as measured by β-hydroxybutyrate (3.85 ± 2.6 mM), compared to SD fed animals (0.29 ± 0.06 mM). In addition, animals fed the KD lost body weight (SD 22.2 ± 0.6 g vs. KD 17.5 ± 1.4 g, p = 0.0067). In contrast to earlier studies, the brief KD feeding regime significantly reduced total brain Aβ levels by approximately 25%. Despite changes in ketone levels, body weight, and Aβ levels, the KD diet did not alter behavioral measures. Conclusion: Previous studies have suggested that diets rich in cholesterol and saturated fats increased the deposition of Aβ and the risk of developing AD. Here we demonstrate that a diet rich in saturated fats and low in carbohydrates can actually reduce levels of Aβ. Therefore, dietary strategies aimed at reducing Aβ levels should take into account interactions of dietary components and the metabolic outcomes, in particular, levels of carbohydrates, total calories, and presence of ketone bodies should be considered. © 2005 Van der Auwera et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Despite the knowledge that women are more susceptible than men to stress-related mental illness, such as major depression, there is no comprehensive estimation of the role of gender in the detrimental effects of chronic stress that might cause depression. Sex differences regarding the association of behavioral parameters with serotonergic and hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal axis activities were investigated in the chronic mild stress model of depression. Additionally, the impact of chronic mild stress exposure on an additional/novel short-term stressful procedure, such as the forced swim test was examined in male and female rats. Female rats were found to be more vulnerable to chronic mild stress and that was depicted with disruption of sucrose intake, decreases in open field activity, increased corticosterone levels, alteration in estrous cycle and decreased serotonergic activity in hippocampus and hypothalamus. On the contrary, in males the current chronic mild stress protocol elicited only behavioral changes, such as disruption in sucrose intake and decreased open field activity. Interestingly, in response to forced swim test, females previously subjected to chronic mild stress, were found to cope better by exhibiting increased active behavior in the second forced swim test session and higher hypothalamic serotonergic activity in comparison with corresponding males. On the other hand, males were more affected by previous chronic mild stress exposure and that was manifested by decreased active behavior in the first forced swim test session and increased corticosterone levels following second forced swim test session. These data indicate that although females are more vulnerable in the application of chronic mild stress than males, in response to an additional-novel stressor (forced swim test) they show better response. Therefore, both sex/gender and combination of stressful procedures should be carefully considered in the study of the pathophysiology of stress-related mental illnesses. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO.},

abstract={Omnivores, including humans, have an inborn tendency to avoid noxious or unfamiliar foods. Such defensive foraging behaviors are modifiable, however, in response to physiological needs. Here we describe a method for assessing risk-sensitive food acquisition in Drosophila melanogaster. Food-deprived fly larvae become more likely to feed on noxious foods (adulterated with quinine) as the duration of deprivation increases. The neuropeptide F receptor NPFR1, a mammalian neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor homolog, centrally regulates the response to noxious food in D. melanogaster. Overexpression of NPFR1 was sufficient to cause nondeprived larvae to more readily take in noxious food, whereas loss of NPFR1 signaling led to the opposite phenotype. Moreover, NPFR1 neuronal activity may be directly regulated by the insulin-like signaling pathway. Upregulation of insulin-like receptor signaling in NPFR1 cells suppressed the feeding response to noxious food. Our results suggest that the coordinated activities of the conserved NPY- and insulin-like receptor signaling systems are essential for the dynamic regulation of noxious food intake according to the animal's energy state. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract={Food intake is normally influenced by a multitude of complex endogenous neurochemical systems, in addition to numerous external environmental stimuli, including olfaction. Since most olfactory neurons process odorant exposures through Ca2+ -mediated mechanisms via Ca2+ channels, a novel approach at influencing the ingestive behaviors of animals might therefore involve altering olfactory acuity via Ca2+ channel blockade. We tested the ability of a Ca2+ channel blocker, diltiazem, to alter food intake in hyperphagic rats when administered using the intranasal (i.n.), intraperitoneal (i.p.), oral (p.o.) or intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) routes of administration. Male Sprague Dawley rats, which had been food-deprived for 4 h at the beginning of the dark cycle, were administered different doses of diltiazem (0 - 8 mg/ animal or 0-40 mg/kg) and the amounts of food consumed were measured. While food intake at 1, 2 and 4 h post drug administration was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner after i.n. administration, the i.p., p.o., and i.c.v. routes did not affect food intake. In another experiment, rats trained to eat their daily meal during the first 4 h at the onset of the dark cycle and treated daily with i.n. diltiazem (0 - 8 mg/ animal) prior to food introduction exhibited a significantly decreased rate of weight gain in a dose-dependent manner over a 14-day period. Both i.n. and i.p. diltiazem significantly increased the plasma drug concentration at 1 h, however there was no significant difference between these routes of administration. Additional studies failed to demonstrate any detrimental effects of i.n. diltiazem (0- 8 mg/ animal) on conditioned taste aversion, locomotion or gross neurological/behavioral competence using the rota-rod test. While a local action on the nasal odorant receptors is most likely the site of diltiazem's action, further studies are needed to determine the exact mechanism of action of i.n. diltiazem. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Chaoborus presented a 1:1 clonal mixture under HP or LP, consumed more individuals under LP. Moreover, fewer clone 1 individuals were consumed.

abstract={Following tenor management theory, the authors suggest women's striving to attain a thin physique is fueled in part by existential concerns. In three studies, women restricted consumption of a nutritious but fattening food in response to reminders of mortality (mortality salience; MS). When conducted in private (Study 1), this effect was found among women but not men; when replicated in a group setting in which social comparison was likely (Studies 2 and 3), only women who were relatively less successful attaining the thin ideal (i.e., high body mass index; BMI) restricted eating after MS. In Study 3, MS caused high BMI women to perceive themselves as more discrepant from their ideal thinness; this perceived failure mediated the effects of MS and BMI on eating behavior. Findings are discussed from a self-regulatory framework, which considered in the context of pressures for women to be thin, can shed light on health risk behavior. © 2005 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.},

abstract={In slave-making ants, the invasion of the host colony by newly mated queens is a critical stage. We studied the strategy used by Rossomyrmex minuchae queens to invade their host Proformica longiseta. Field observations revealed that queens enter the host nest unchallenged by the host workers in the vicinity of the nest entrance. Pre-usurpation queens were found to possess a highly inflated Dufour's gland, which considerably reduces in size after successful usurpation. Chemical analysis of these queen glands revealed tetradecanal to be the major product in pre-usurpation Rossomyrmex queens, but to be almost absent in queens that have been adopted by P. longiseta. We consequently hypothesized that tetradecanal is a repellent that is used by queens to prevent host worker aggression. We tested its repellent effect by attempting to deter starved, highly motivated workers from a droplet of honey. Tetradecanal indeed proved to be highly repellent both to host worker P. longiseta and non-host worker Formica selysi. It was even more powerful than limonene, a reported general ant repellent. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that R. minuchae queens use Dufour's gland secretion as a weapon during nest usurpation. The general use of tetradecanal as a defensive compound, and its seemingly non-specific repellent effect on ants, indicate that it may act as a general ant repellent. Its adoption by R. minuchae queens thus provides them with an efficient defensive and offensive chemical weapon during their long and risky search for new host nests. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In the clinic, obesity and anorexia constitute prevalent problems whose manifestations are encountered in virtually every field of medicine. However, as the command centre for regulating food intake and energy metabolism is located in the brain, the basic neuroscientist sees in the same disorders malfunctions of a model network for how integration of diverse sensory inputs leads to a coordinated behavioural, endocrine and autonomic response. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive; rather, much can be gained by combining both perspectives to understand the pathophysiology of over- and underweight. The present review summarizes recent advances in this field including the characterization of peripheral metabolic signals to the brain such as leptin, insulin, peptide YY, ghrelin and lipid mediators as well as the vagus nerve; signalling of the metabolic sensors in the brainstem and hypothalamus via, e.g. neuropeptide Y and melanocortin peptides; integration and coordination of brain-mediated responses to nutritional challenges; the organization of food intake in simple model organisms; the mechanisms underlying food reward and processing of the sensory and metabolic properties of food in the cerebral cortex; and the development of the central metabolic system, as well as its pathological regulation in cancer and infections. Finally, recent findings on the genetics of human obesity are summarized, as well as the potential for novel treatments of body weight disorders. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Two experiments with rats were conducted to study interval time-place learning when the spatiotemporal contingencies of food availability were more similar to those likely to be encountered in natural environments, than those employed in prior research. In Experiment 1, food was always available on three levers on a variable ratio (VR) 35 schedule. A VR8 schedule was in effect on Lever 1 for 5 min, then on Lever 2 for 5 min, and so forth. While rats learned to restrict the majority of their responding to the lever that provided the highest density of reinforcement, they seemed to rely on a win-stay/lose-shift strategy rather than a timing strategy. In Experiment 2, the four levers provided food on variable ratios of 15, 8, 15, and 30, each for 3 min. As expected the rats learned these contingencies. A novel finding was that the rats had a spike in response rate immediately following a change from a higher to lower reinforcement density. It is concluded that rats exposed to spatiotemporal contingencies behave so as to maximize the rate of obtained reinforcement. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Animals allocate the time spent on different behaviours according to nutritional requirements, the distribution of food and the risk of predation. When the perceived predation risk is high, animals primarily behave in ways to increase their safety such as regularly scanning their surroundings, forming large groups and feeding in habitats with cover or high visibility. This study investigated which factors Soay sheep (Ovis aries) are most sensitive to in allocating time to different behaviours when the risk of predation is negligible. Continuous focal sampling was used to record the behaviour of the free-ranging Soay sheep on Lundy Island and measures of vegetation, group size and terrain were also recorded. Stepwise multiple regression produced a model of grazing with terrain and range of grass coverage as predictors and a model of vigilance with terrain as a predictor. Sheep grazed for longer on the slopes and as the range of grass cover decreased. They were more vigilant on the slopes. The results support the view that the group size effect largely depends on anti-predatory vigilance and suggest that time-budgets are more sensitive to other factors in the absence of predation. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Background: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a chronic disease, with which the patients have difficulty in taking traditional Chinese medicine decoction. So it is necessary to accumulate the special prescriptions for CFS. Based on the principle of nourishing-yin-and-replenishing-kidney and filling-up-essence-and-producing-an-effect-toward-clear-vision, American ginseng, aweto, Tortoise Shell and cornus officinalis were selected and were made into a compound preparation by using modern pharmaceutical technique. Objective: To establish the animal model of chronic stress-related fatigue for observations on the effects of yi xin le oral Liquid (YXL) on behavioral and neuroendocrinological changes in rats. Design: It was a randomized controlled study. Setting: Medical Study Department, Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Area Command of Chinese PLA; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Panyu-shigi People's Hospital of Guangzhou city of Guangdong Province. Materials: The experiment was conducted at the Laboratory Center of Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Area Command of Chinese PLA from August to December 2003. Sixty Kunming mice were selected and divided into 5 groups, as normal group, model group, Ejiao (EJ) compound group, small dose YXL group and large dose YXL group, with 12 mice in each group. YXL was produced by the Medical Research Department of Guangzhou LiuHuaQiao Hospital (1mL YXL was made from 1g raw materials, with a lot number of 030618). EJ compound was produced by Shandong Dong-E E-Jiao CO.,LTD, with lot number of 030425. Water maze was supplied by Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Methods: All the animals were fed in clean level room at (20+2)°C, five mice in one cage, with free food and water supply. After 1-2 days, they were used for establishing animal model. Except for mice in normal group, mice in other groups swam in cold water at (10±1) °C, in duration of 6.0-9.5 minutes for each time. Additionally, in EJ group, mice received EJ at a dose of 50 g/(kg·d). In small dose YXL group, mice received YXL at a dose of 25 g/(kg·d). In large dose of YXL group, mice received YXL at a dose of 50 g/(kg·d). In normal group and model group, mice received saline at a dose of 0.5 mL for each time, twice a day and in a duration of 9 days. After establishing the animal model, spontaneous exploratory activity of mice and the forced-swim time was assessed (time spent in the middle of open field or to traversing the field, times to traversing the test field, time spent in orientating while upright or decoration and exploring times before orientating while upright or decoration were measured by open field test). After tests, blood samples were taken from carotid artery and the animals were decollated under anesthesia. Immediately, their adrenal glands were taken out under axenic condition. And the serum level of monoamine neurotransmitter was measured by high performance liquid chromatography HPLC and electrochemical devices. The concentration of vitamin C in adrenal gland was detected using 2,4 dinitrophenylhydrazine colorimetric method. Main outcome measures: After treatment, the spontaneous exploratory activity, and the forced-swim time, the vitamin C content in adrenal gland and the changes in monoamine neurotransmitter and its metabolites were measured. Results: All the 60 mice in the experiment entered the statistical analysis. 1 Comparison of changes in the time spent in the middle of the open field among all the groups: Compared with control group, significantly longer time was spent in model group [(6.64±3.73), (13.80±6.70) s, P <0.01]. Compared with model group, significantly shorter time was spent in EJ group, small dose YXL group and large dose YXL group [(13.80± 6.70), (5.12±2.62), (4.51±1.43), (3.34±2.01)s, P < 0.05,P < 0.05,P < 0.01]. Compared with EJ group, significantly shorter time was spent in small dose YXL group and large dose YXL group (P < 0.05,P < 0.01). 2 Comparison of the forced-swim time after cold water stress among all the groups: Compared with control group, significantly shorter time was spent in model group [(176.44±38.02), (145.01±59.51)minutes, P < 0.01]. Compared with model group, significantly longer time was spent in EJ group, small dose YXL group and large dose YXL group [(145.01±59.51), (172.73±71.59), (181.91±38.60), (186.59±50.81)minutes,P < 0.05,P < 0.05,P < 0.01]. Compared with EJ group, significantly longer time was spent in small dose YXL group and large dose YXL group (P < 0.05,P < 0.01). 3 Comparison of the vitamin C content in adrenal gland after cold water stress in all the groups: Compared with control group, significantly lower vitamin C content in adrenal gland was detected in model group [(3 951+280),(3 546±408) μg/g,P < 0.01]. Compared with model group, significantly higher vitamin C content in adrenal gland was detected in EJ group, small dose YXL group and large dose YXL group [(3546±408), (3 978±288),(4 068±672),(4 248±704) μg/g,P < 0.05,P < 0.05,P < 0.01]. Compared with EJ group, significantly higher vitamin C content in adrenal gland was detected in large dose YXL group (P < 0.05). 4 Comparison of the levels of monoamine neurotransmitter and its metabolites after cold water stress in all the groups: Compared with control group, adrenalin and dopamine were significantly higher in model group [(175±56) nmol/L, (258±97) nmol/L; (1 804±889) nmol/L, (4 049±1 443) nmol/L, P < 0.01], while 5-Hydroxyindole Acetic Acid (5-HIAA) was decreased [(129.05±34.19), (117.78±42.86) nmol/L, P < 0.05]. Compared with model group, adrenalin and dopamine were significantly lower in EJ group, small dose YXL group and large dose YXL group [(258±97), (256±135), (230±113),(198±88) nmol/L,P < 0.05,P < 0.01; (4 049±1443), (3 702 ±1 266), (2 630±939), (1 903±658) nmol/ L,P < 0.05,P < 0.01,P < 0.01], while 5-HLAA was significantly higher [(117.78±42.86), (138.57± 50.43), (155.07±35.31), (236.21±49.82) nmol/L, P < 0.05,P < 0.05,P < 0.01]. Compared with EJ group, adrenalin and dopamine were significantly lower in small dose YXL group and large dose YXL group (P < 0.05,P < 0.01), and compared with EJ group, the 5-HIAA was significantly higher in large dose YXL group (P < 0.01). Conclusion: YXL can promote the spontaneous exploratory activity, the forced-swim time and the adrenalin level in mice CFS model. It can also regulate the imbalance of serum monoamine neurotransmitter level and hereby to have the benefits of anti-fatigue, anti-stress and regulations on neuroendocrinological system.},

abstract={Red drum larvae (Sciaenops ocellatus) were exposed to environmentally realistic and sublethal levels of the herbicide atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamin- 6-isopropylamino-S-triazine) to evaluate its effects on ecologically critical traits: growth, behavior, survival potential, and resting respiration rate. Settlement size larvae (7 mm total length) were given an acute exposure of atrazine at 0, 40, and 80 μg l-1 for 4 days. Tests of 96 h survival confirmed that these naturally occurring concentrations were sublethal for red drum larvae. Growth, routine swimming, antipredator responses to artificial and actual predators, and resting respiration rate were monitored 1 and 3 days after onset of exposure. Atrazine exposure significantly reduced growth rate. Atrazine-exposed larvae also exhibited significantly higher routine swimming speeds, swam in more convoluted paths, and were hyperactive. Responses to artificial and actual predators were not affected by atrazine exposure nor were resting respiration rates. The higher rate of travel (86% higher in atrazine-treated larvae) resulted in higher predicted encounter rates with prey (up to 71%) and slow moving predators (up to 63%). However, hyperactivity and faster active swimming speeds of exposed larvae indicated that naturally occurring sublethal levels of atrazine will result in an elevated rate of energy utilization (doubling the total metabolic rate), which is likely to increase the risk of death by starvation. Moreover, atrazine effects on growth will prolong the larval period, which could reduce the juvenile population by as much as 24%. We conclude that environmentally realistic levels of atrazine induce behavioral and physiological effects on fish larvae that would compromise their survival expectations. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The relative contribution of genetic and non-genetic factors in shaping personality traits is of fundamental relevance to biologists and social scientists. Individual animals vary in the way they cope with challenges in their environment, comparable with variation in human personalities. This variation has a substantial genetic basis. Here we describe experiments showing the strength of environmental factors (food availability and sibling competition) in shaping personality traits in a passerine bird (Parus major). We manipulated the early rearing condition in two lines (F4) bidirectionally selected for different personalities (fast line: high exploration speed and high aggression; slow line: low exploration speed and low aggression) with a food rationing protocol inducing an impairment in growth rate and an enhancement in levels of offspring solicitation (begging behaviour). Growth impairment was more marked in the slow line. In a first experiment each nest contained experimental and control siblings of the same line (within-nests design). Slow chicks became much faster than their parents in the exploration tests regardless of the treatment, whereas fast chicks had scores similar to their parents and showed no treatment effect. As a consequence, the line difference in exploration behaviour of the offspring was not apparent in the juvenile phase. Six months later the offspring of the slow line was still relatively fast, but lines differed in exploration, since the fast line became even more fast. Food-rationed birds of the fast line were more aggressive than both controls and their fathers, while treatment did not affect the slow line. In a second experiment, carried out only in the slow line, each nest contained either control or experimental siblings (between-nests design). Now, only the food-rationed chicks became faster in exploration. We suggest that the shift in the controls in the within-nests design was due to enhanced sibling competition, forced by the experimental chick. Indeed, the control chicks in the first experiment begged more persistently and had higher exploration scores than the control chicks in the between-nests design. Environmental factors during ontogeny modulate the expression of phenotypic traits against the background of the reaction norm allowed by the genome even in selected lines of animals resulting in profound and reliable differences in behaviour. © Brill Academic Publishers 2005.},

abstract={In this study, we analysed the diet of breeding kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) in a Mediterranean area with the aim to evaluate the relative importance of both hunting area and individual feeding behaviour as factors affecting prey selection. Differently from the populations from middle and northern Europe which primarily feed on voles, the kestrels breeding in the Mediterranean region showed a wider diet composition. As expected, hunting area features influenced the diet composition and, in general, the kestrels were feeding on what was locally more abundant. However, we detected consistent differences in the diet composition between neighbouring breeding pairs which were also maintained in subsequent years. Since the neighbouring birds were sharing the same hunting grounds, the differences observed were likely to reflect individual preferences or capabilities in catching some prey type regardless of their actual availability. The presence of differences in diet composition between neighbouring pairs and their temporal consistency suggests that the hunting skills, and in general the feeding behaviour of kestrels, is likely to represent a trait characterising a behavioural type. © Brill Academic Publishers 2005.},

abstract={Prenatal stress and maternal separation are used in a large number of studies on early adversity consequences and present some similarities in their effects. The present work investigates the behavioral effects of these two procedures on two models of anxiety: the elevated plus-maze and the elevated T-maze. During pregnancy, female rats were submitted to uncontrollable electric foot shock sessions every other day or kept undisturbed. After delivery, litters from undisturbed dams were submitted to either 180-min daily periods of maternal separations from the 3-14th postnatal days or maintained with the dams all the time. Litters from the stressed dams were left undisturbed from the 3-14th postnatal days. Only males were tested. In adulthood, rats were tested in the elevated T-maze or in the elevated plus-maze. In the latter procedure half the subjects were submitted to a 60-min period of restraint immediately before being tested. The following measures were taken in the elevated plus-maze: frequency and time spent in entries into the arms, stretching, rearing, grooming and head dipping. In the T-maze measures of avoidance and escape latencies were used. Our data indicated that prenatal stress had more pronounced anxiogenic effects than maternal separation, as judged by reduced exploration of the open arms of the elevated plus-maze, but mainly after the restraint stress, and increase in avoidance latencies in the elevated T-maze. The other measures not directly involved in the elevated plus-maze arm exploration yielded similar results. Our data indicate that prenatal stress causes more anxiogenic effects in adulthood than maternal separation but, in the elevated plus-maze, these anxiogenic effects are better seen immediately after an acute stress. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Previous studies suggested that metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu5) receptors play an important role in the reinforcing effects of abused drugs. The present experiments evaluated the effects of the mGlu5 receptor antagonist, MPEP (2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine hydrochloride; 1-10 mg/kg, salt, i.p.), in rat models of nicotine-seeking behavior that may have relevance to relapse to drug-taking. Male Wistar rats (with restricted access to food) were trained to nose-poke to receive intravenous infusions of nicotine (0.03 mg/kg per infusion, base) under a fixed ratio 5 time out 60 s schedule of reinforcement. After stable nicotine self-administration was acquired, nose-poking behavior was extinguished in the absence of nicotine-associated cues. During the reinstatement test phase, independent groups of animals were exposed to: (a) response-contingent nicotine-associated cues (cue-induced reinstatement); or (b) response-noncontingent presentations of 45-mg food pellets under fixed time 2 min schedule (schedule-induced reinstatement). Additional control experiments were conducted to demonstrate that in nicotine-naïve animals MPEP does not affect cue-induced reinstatement of food-seeking behavior and has no effects on operant behavior maintained by a simple fixed interval 2 min schedule of food reinforcement. Pretreatment with MPEP (10 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the reinstatement of nicotine-seeking in both experiments. Further, MPEP (10 mg/kg) significantly attenuated polydipsia induced by a fixed time 2 min food schedule. In conclusion, the present findings indicate that the blockade of mGlu5 receptors attenuates cue-induced reinstatement of nicotine self-administration behavior (but not food-seeking) and may produce a general inhibition of schedule-induced behaviors, including schedule-induced nicotine-seeking. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={A number of standard behavioral tasks in animal research utilize food rewards for positive reinforcement. In order to enhance the motivation to participate in these tasks, animals are usually placed on a restricted diet. While dietary restriction (DR) has been shown to have beneficial effects on recovery after brain injury, life span and aging processes, it might also represent a stressor. Since stress can influence a broad range of behaviors, the purpose of this study was to assess whether DR may have similar effects on skilled movement. Adult male Long-Evans rats were trained and tested in a skilled reaching task both prior to and during a mild food restriction regimen that maintained their body weights at 90-95% of baseline weight for eight days. The observations revealed that DR decreased reaching success and increased the number of attempts to grasp a single food pellet. The animals appeared to be more frantic when attempting to reach for food pellets, and the time taken to reach for 20 pellets decreased following the onset of DR. A second experiment investigating behaviors that do not require food rewards, including a ladder rung walking task and an open field test, confirmed that rats on DR display deficits in skilled movements and are hyperactive. These findings suggest that results obtained in motor tasks using food rewards need to be interpreted with caution. The findings are discussed with respect to stress associated with DR. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Terrestrial hermit crabs use mollusc shells to protect their soft bodies from predation and desiccation, but their use is costly. The energetic short-term cost of using shells has been demonstrated, yet this could theoretically be overcome by increasing feeding rate or food quality. In the long term, shells have the potential to constrain growth, which may in turn have a negative effect on fitness. Thus crabs should choose the lightest (least expensive to carry) shell amongst those of a size that permit growth. Since in nature lighter shells are also thinner-walled, these may provide insufficient protection from predation or desiccation, facing the crabs with a trade-off between protection and growth. This potential trade-off was investigated in the terrestrial hermit crab Coenobita compressus. Crabs were individually maintained in captivity for a variable period of between 1 and 7 months, during which light or heavy replicates of the preferred shell were available. In a second experiment, crabs were given a choice between a thick (and heavy) or a thin (and light) shell. In addition, the resistance and water retention capacity of thin and thick shells was compared. As predicted, crab growth was negatively correlated with the weight of the shell used, but crabs rejected the thin (light) shells. Thin shells were more likely to break when crabs used the normal 'rolling' behaviour in response to perceived threats. In addition, thin shells lost water at a faster rate than thick ones. Since two putative functions of shell use in terrestrial hermit crabs are protection against predation and against desiccation, it is inferred that the preference for shells of intermediate weight in C. compressus results from a balance between the need to grow and the cost of carrying a brittle shell that is not sufficiently water tight. © 2005 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract={Rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss stocked into Flaming Gorge Reservoir, Utah-Wyoming, are thought to be in poor condition and to rarely overwinter. In 2001-2002, we evaluated factors that affect the growth and abundance of rainbow trout, both temporally and spatially, based on a series of field measurements and growth experiments. Based on our field measurements, the growth and condition of rainbow trout in Flaming Gorge Reservoir actually parallel those of rainbow trout of various strains in other systems, and some rainbow trout overwinter as many as 3 years in the reservoir. Overall, rainbow trout appear to be spatially limited by physical factors (e.g., temperature) during only a few isolated times of the year and not in all areas of the reservoir. Although zooplankton were abundant throughout the reservoir, primary and secondary production vary spatially with concordant effects on fish growth and condition. Diet analysis indicated that rainbow trout consume primarily aquatic macroinvertebrates along with some zooplankton and demonstrate an extremely limited switch to piscivory at larger sizes. Rainbow trout reared in netpens and limited to a diet of zooplankton lost weight in all three areas of the reservoir. In addition, the reservoir supports a large population of trophy lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, which probably affects the abundance of rainbow trout directly through consumption and the growth potential of rainbow trout indirectly through risk-averse behavior. The combination of spatial variation in reservoir productivity and habitat type, differing stocking strategies, and behavioral responses caused by predators appears to determine the varying success of stocked rainbow trout in the different areas of the reservoir. Our study suggests that stocking strategies may be most effective when specific characteristics of the prey and predator base, the suitability of different habitats, and the genetic strain are explicitly evaluated within the context of the targeted angler population. © Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2005.},

abstract={Life-history theory generally predicts that there should be no selection for longevity beyond the limit of reproductive capacity. However, the capacity to increase fitness may not end when individuals reach a state of functional sterility. Recent studies show that intergenerational transfers of resources from post-reproductive parents can increase the offspring's fitness, and analytical theory shows that age-trajectories of transfers may shape the course of senescence in social organisms. In eusocial insects, female roles are partitioned so that one phenotype or "caste" reproduces while another is responsible for resource transfers: the reproductive "queens" are arrested in a continuous reproductive mode, while transfer-activities such as hygienic behaviors, guarding, foraging and further food processing ("nursing") that increases the nutritional value of provisions are conducted by sterile "workers". Worker honey bees normally perform these tasks in a sequence so that nursing inside the protected nest is conducted prior to more risky exterior hive activities such as guarding and foraging. However, foragers may revert to nurse-activity in response to demographic changes, and worker bees can also develop into a stress resistant survival form with a 10-fold increase in lifespan. This elastic division of parental functions is believed to increase colony fitness. Further, it generates a stage-dependent trajectory of senescence that is difficult to address with established theories of aging. In the following, we show how a recent theory that includes resource transfers can be used to elucidate patterns of senescence in eusocial, non-reproducing individuals like the honey bee worker. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract={Gottfredson and Hirschi 's general theory has generated an abundance of research examining the effects of low self-control, on crime and. analogous behaviors. Less research, however, has focused on the factors that contribute to the development of low self-control. Gottfredson and Hirschi maintain that ineffective parents are the sole cause for the emergence of low self-control. At the same time, they disregard the possibility that low self-control has a biological or genetic component. This article extends prior research and examines the effects of birth complications and parental involvement on low self-control. Using a sample of twin children, the authors find that parental involvement is only weakly and inconsistently related to low self-control. On the other hand, although most of the birth complications had no appreciable effect on low self-control, anoxia (oxygen starvation) emerged as the strongest and most consistent predictor of low self-control. © 2005 Sage Publications.},

abstract={Dietary protein contains amino acids used in the brain for synthesis of neurotransmitters. Although information on pre- and post-natal exposure to low-protein diets in rodents is available, little is known about effects of such diets on adult animals. Therefore, the behavioral and neurochemical consequences of exposure to a brief (11 days), low (4%)-protein diet in animals exposed to normothermic and hyperthermic test conditions were examined. In separate groups of animals, the Porsolt Swim test and elevated plus maze were administered. These tasks are sensitive to nutritional and/or environmental manipulations. In other groups of rats exposed to the same dietary and environmental conditions, dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and serotonin in the striatum were assessed using microdialysis. In the Porsolt swim test, which assesses coping behavior, performance was impaired under normothermic and hyperthermic conditions in animals on the low-protein diet. Performance on the plus maze, a measure of exploration and anxiety, was altered in the hyperthermic condition by low protein, with the diet increasing exploration. Microdialysis detected increased norepinephrine in the striatium of hyperthermic animals on the low-protein diet. This study demonstrates that changes in stress-related behaviors of adult animals occur following brief exposure to low-protein diets.},

abstract={Given limited food, prey fishes in a temperate climate must take risks to acquire sufficient reserves for winter and/or to outgrow vulnerability to predation. However, how can we distinguish which selective pressure promotes risk-taking when larger body size is always beneficial? To address this question, we examined patterns of energy allocation in populations of age-0 trout to determine if greater risk-taking corresponds with energy allocation to lipids or to somatic growth. Trout achieved maximum growth rates in all lakes and allocated nearly all of their acquired energy to somatic growth when small in early summer. However, trout in low-food lakes took greater risks to achieve this maximal growth, and therefore incurred high mortality. By late summer, age-0 trout allocated considerable energy to lipids and used previously risky habitats in all lakes. These results indicate that: (i) the size-dependent risk of predation (which is independent of behaviour) promotes risk-taking behaviour of age-0 trout to increase growth and minimize time spent in vulnerable sizes; and (ii) the physiology of energy allocation and behaviour interact to mediate growth/mortality trade-offs for young animals at risk of predation and starvation. © 2005 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Working animals provide an essential transport resource in developing countries worldwide. Many of these animals are owned by poor people and work in harsh environments, so their welfare is a cause for concern. A protocol was developed to assess the welfare of working horses, mules and donkeys in urban and peri-urban areas, using direct observation of health and behaviour parameters. In this study, 4903 animals used for draught, pack and ridden work in Afghanistan, Egypt, India, Jordan and Pakistan were assessed between December 2002 and April 2003. The data showed that donkeys were more likely than mules or horses to demonstrate avoidance or aggressive behaviour towards an observer, while horses were most likely to make a friendly approach. Fewer than 8% of working equines had abnormal mucous membranes, ectoparasites or poor coat condition. Body lesions occurred predominantly in the areas of the breast/shoulder, withers and girth in all three species, with mules having the highest prevalence of lesions in these areas (22.5, 21.3 and 28.4%, respectively). Among horses and donkeys, the prevalence of these lesions was influenced by the type of work carried out. Lesions on the head, neck, ribs, flank and tail base were seen in less than 10% of animals. Across all three species approximately 70% of animals were thin, having a body condition score (BCS) of 2 or less on a scale of 1-5 (1, very thin; 5, very fat) and more horses were in very thin condition (BCS 1) than mules or donkeys. Over 75% of animals demonstrated limb deformities and abnormalities of gait. The results of this study are being used as the initial stage of a long-term strategy to inform priorities for welfare interventions in working equines and to establish a welfare benchmark. Subsequent stages will rank the welfare concerns identified, assess the contributing risk factors and implement specific interventions to address these risks. Following intervention, success in improving welfare will be measured by repetition of this protocol and comparison with the benchmark. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Epidemiological observations of associations between early life nutrition and long-term disease risk have prompted detailed experimental investigation of the biological basis of programming. Studies using rodent or large animal models have clearly established the biological plausibility of nutritional programming and are now yielding important information on underlying mechanisms. Nutritional interventions in pregnancy, including global food restriction, protein restriction, micronutrient restriction and excess fat feeding, determine a consistent cluster of disorders in the resulting offspring. The common association of such diverse nutritional disturbances with hypertension, glucose intolerance and adiposity suggests that a small number of simple common mechanisms are active in response to fetal nutrient imbalance. Studies of rodent models indicate that fetal undernutrition determines adult adiposity. It is unclear whether the increase in central adiposity is related to increased food intake or reduced energy expenditure, although evidence exists to suggest that both may act together. Rats subject to intrauterine protein restriction exhibit increased preference for high fat foods. Feeding of energy dense foods to rats that were undernourished in utero promotes a greater degree of obesity than is noted in animals subject to adequate nutrition in fetal life. There is evidence to suggest that programming of appetite may stem from remodelling of hypothalamic structures that control feeding and programming of the expression of genes involved in responses to orexogenic hormones. The early life programming of appetite and obesity is a complex phenomenon and our understanding of how maternal nutrition determines later energy balance is at a very early stage. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.},

In this study we test the impact of two biotic factors in combination (presence/absence of predators and low/ high food level) on gender specific life-history traits in the damselfly Coenagrion puella (Odonata). Results show that predator presence and low food density decreased activity in both sexes. Additionally, individuals with less food grew more slowly, emerged later, remained smaller and had a higher mortality. At low food densities, however, and in contrast to former investigations, individuals from treatments with predator presence were the same size or larger than individuals without predators. Gender had a strong impact on larval activity and life-history traits and sexes differed in development. Females were less active and took longer to complete development, but emerged at a larger size, weight and fat content. This study highlights the importance of gender specific approaches in life-history research. Copyright © OIKOS 2005.},

abstract={The present experiment investigated the effects of aging on emotional behavior, without concomitant influences from any previous behavioral manipulation apart from weighing the rats. Anxiety-related behaviors were measured in the elevated plus-maze (EPM). Performance in the open field (OF) was also assessed to control for any effect of aging on exploratory behavior that could account for changes in emotional behavior. Fifty-two naïve male Wistar rats of 3 (3MO), 17 (17MO), or 24 (24MO) months, were submitted to two sessions (5 min each) of EPM, followed by two sessions (2 min each) of OF, on 4 consecutive days. The main emotional indices (open arm entries, ratio of open arm entries to total entries, time spent in open arms, ratio of time in open arms to time in four arms, open arm ends, and head dips) measured in the EPM indicated a lower level of anxiety in aged (24MO) than in young (3MO) rats, whereas middle-aged (17MO) rats showed intermediate values between those of 3MO and 24MO rats; 3MO rats showed higher general motor activity (number of rearings in closed arms of EPM and in OF, and higher number of areas crossed in OF) than 17MO and 24MO rats. We conclude that aging is associated with a decrease in anxiety and in general motor activity. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract={Chemical-mediated effects of predatory fish on chironomid larvae behaviour have been ignored so far. Sediment-dwelling chironomid larvae inhabit protective burrows from which they extend their bodies only to feed on deposited detritus and microalgae from the surrounding sediment. Here, we performed factorial laboratory experiments to study whether fish-borne chemical cues (kairomones) are responsible for behavioural trait changes of chironomid larvae, and whether chironomid larvae are able to assess the densities of fish predators and food resources and the trade-off between them. We exposed naïve Chironomus riparius larvae to the chemical presence of zero, one, and ten predator fish (Rutilus rutilus) and offered two resource levels (low food, high food) for each treatment. Kairomones induced significant inherent behavioural trait changes in chironomid larvae. During the first 120 min after exposing chironomids to fish-conditioned water, we found a significant increase in digging activity with increasing predator density. After 3 days of exposure, the deepest chironomid burrows were found in treatments with the highest predator density. Chironomid larvae were significantly able to adjust their foraging behaviour to different predator densities and food concentrations and trade off between them; that is, when fish predators were more abundant or when more food resources were available, the foraging activities of larvae were significantly reduced. Our data suggest that chemically mediated trait changes (burrowing and foraging behaviour) may cascade through the littoral food web. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract={The timing of twilight transition behaviour of diurnal reef fish is likely to be determined by the trade-off between food intake and risk of predation. However, the correspondence between fish behaviour and light-dependent feeding is poorly documented. We used flume measurements of prey detection and consumption by small reef-dwelling zooplanktivorous fish to examine the effects of light and prey flux on the fish's in situ behaviour during twilight. Feeding rates increased from nearly nil to saturation as light level increased, corresponding to about 45 min of the morning twilight. Changes in feeding rates were mostly due to light-dependent changes in reactive distance. In the reef, fish emerged from their nocturnal shelter at lower light intensities than those at which they retreated at dusk. These light intensities at which the fish emerged and retreated in the field greatly exceeded the level required to detect prey. We examined whether the approach of measuring relative ratio of mortality risk to food gained can be applied to predict the observed patterns in the twilight transition behaviour of the fish studied. We suggest that both the times of emergence and retreat and the dawn-dusk asymmetry are the result of a direct response to temporal and spatial variations in predation risk; no evidence for fine-tuned adjustments to diel fluctuations in food availability by changes in the time of emergence and retreat was found. © 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={1. Megaplanktivores such as filter-feeding sharks and baleen whales are at the apex of a short food chain (phytoplankton - zooplankton - vertebrate) and are sensitive indicators of sea-surface plankton availability. Even though they spend the majority of their time below the surface it is still not known how most of these species utilize vertical habitat and adapt to short-term changes in food availability. 2. A key factor likely to control vertical habitat selection by planktivorous sharks is the diel vertical migration (DVM) of zooplankton; however, no study has determined whether specific ocean-habitat type influences their behavioural strategy. Based on the first high-resolution dive data collected for a plankton-feeding fish species we show that DVM patterns of the basking shark Cetorhinus maximus reflect habitat type and zooplankton behaviour. 3. In deep, well-stratified waters sharks exhibited normal DVM (dusk ascent - dawn descent) by tracking migrating sound-scattering layers characterized by Calanus and euphausiids. Sharks occupying shallow, inner-shelf areas near thermal fronts conducted reverse DVM (dusk descent - dawn ascent) possibly due to zooplankton predator - prey interactions that resulted in reverse DVM of Calanus. 4. These opposite DVM patterns resulted in the probability of daytime-surface sighting differing between these habitats by as much as two orders of magnitude. Ship-borne surveys undertaken at the same time as trackings reflected these behavioural differences. 5. The tendency of basking sharks to feed or rest for long periods at the surface has made them vulnerable to harpoon fisheries. Ship-borne and aerial surveys also use surface occurrence to assess distribution and abundance for conservation purposes. Our study indicates that without bias reduction for habitat-specific DVM patterns, current surveys could under- or overestimate shark abundance by at least 10-fold. © 2005 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Systemic injection of peptide YY3-36 reduces food intake in rodents and humans, although some groups have reported a lack of response. PYY3-36 is thought to act via the Y2 receptor to presynaptically inhibit the release of neuropeptide Y and GABA from hypothalamic arcuate neurones. Due to the controversy surrounding its action in rodents, we tested the peptide intravenously on feeding behaviour in rats and attempted to block its actions with the Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE0246. PYY3-36 significantly decreased food intake during the first hour in male Sprague-Dawley rats fasted overnight and then re-fed. BIIE0246 had no effect alone on re-feeding, but completely blocked the action of PYY3-36. In a second experiment of similar design, the behavioural satiety sequence (BSS) was studied. Normal rats eat, drink, explore and groom before entering rest. PYY3-36 significantly reduced food eaten maintaining the normal BSS, although shifting it to the left as expected for a natural satiety factor. The latency to rest occurred earlier for animals given PYY3-36 alone and PYY3-36 tended to increase the total time in rest compared with controls. These behavioural effect of PYY3-36 were blocked by BIIE0246, and BIIE0246 alone did not have an effect on the BSS. These results support the role of PYY3-36 as a natural satiety factor acting through Y2 receptors. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Serotonin (5-HT) is well known to affect the motivational properties of stimuli predictive of rewards as well as the inhibitory control of behavior. Here, central 5-HT depletion was induced by the acute tryptophan (TRP) depletion (ATD) procedure in young healthy volunteers to examine the role of 5-HT in motivated action and prepotent response inhibition. A novel reaction-time task, tailored to individual differences in general cognitive speed, was employed to measure the guidance of behavior by motivationally relevant signals predictive of reinforcement likelihood, while the stop-signal reaction-time task was used to measure response inhibition. Following the TRP-balancing control drink, cues predictive of high-reinforcement certainty induced faster, but less accurate responses compared with cues predictive of lower reinforcement certainty. Depletion of central 5-HT modulated this coupling between motivation and action by slowing responses and increasing accuracy as a function of incentive certainty. These effects of ATD on motivated action correlated highly with individual differences in the personality trait of Nonplanning Impulsiveness (Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-II)), so that strongest effects on motivated action were observed in high-impulsive individuals. By contrast, ATD left unaltered the ability to inhibit prepotent responses. Our findings may have implications for a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including impulsive aggressive disorders and depression. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

abstract={The Arctic has become a sink for organochlorine contaminants (OCs) from lower latitudes, and relatively high levels have been found in different biota. Recent studies of the glaucous gull, Larus hyperboreus, a top predator in the arctic food web, have documented that high blood residues of various OCs are related to lower reproductive performance and reduced adult survival. Here we provide additional evidence that OCs are having ecological effects in the glaucous gull population at Bear Island in the Norwegian Arctic, and compare the effects of the four major OCs found in the glaucous gulls: HCB, oxychlordane, DDE and PCBs, which made up >95% of measured OCs. Firstly; it has previously been shown that gulls with high levels of PCBs in their blood spent more time away from the nest site during incubation than gulls with low levels. Here we reanalyzed the data and found that PCBs (P<0.02) and oxychlordane (P<0.05) were positive and significantly related to time away from the nest site, while DDE and HCB were not related to this trait. Secondly, among females which bred in an area where fish dominated the diet, and thus had high flight costs during feeding, early chick growth was negatively related to maternal levels of all four OCs, especially HCB and DDE (P<0.01). On the contrary, among females breeding in an area where the diet was dominated by eggs and young from nearby seabird colonies, and thus feeding costs were low, there were no effects of OC levels on early chick growth. This indicates that additional stress may be fundamental in causing reproductive effects of OCs in this population. Finally, during three breeding seasons we examined the probability of adults returning to the breeding grounds in the subsequent season, as a function of blood concentration of the four OCs. Overall, return rate from one year to the next was negatively related to blood residues of oxychlordane (P=0.02), but not significantly related to the other three compounds. Further support for the importance of oxychlordane was that a 60% drop in the blood levels between 1997 and 2000 led to a significant increase in return rate between these two years. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Alzheimer's disease is a genetically complex disorder associated with multiple genetic defects, either mutational or of susceptibility. Although potentially associated with an accelerated stochastically driven aging process, Alzheimer's disease is an independent clinical entity in which the aging process exerts a deleterious effect on brain activity in conjunction with polymodal genetic factors and other pathological conditions (i.e., age-related cerebrovascular deterioration) and environmental factors (i.e., nutrition). Alzheimer's disease genetics does not explain in full the etiopathogenesis of this disease. Therefore, it is likely that environmental factors and/or epigenetic phenomena also contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathology and phenotypic expression of dementia. The genomics of Alzheimer's disease is still in its infancy, but this field is aiding the understanding of novel aspects of this disease, including genetic epidemiology, multifactorial risk factors, pathogenic mechanisms associated with genetic networks and genetically regulated metabolic cascades. Alzheimer's disease genomics is also helping to develop new strategies in pharmacogenomic research and prevention. Functional genomics, proteomics, pharmacogenomics, high-throughput methods, combinatorial chemistry and modern bioinformatics will greatly contribute to accelerate drug development for Alzheimer's disease and other complex disorders. The multifactorial genetic dysfunction in dementia includes mutational loci (APP, PS1, PS2, TAU) and diverse susceptibility loci (APOE, alpha2M, alphaACT, LRP1, IL1 alpha, TNF, ACE, BACE, BCHE, CST3, MTHFR, GSK3 beta, NOS3 and many other genes) distributed across the human genome, probably converging in a common pathogenic mechanism that leads to premature neuronal death, in which mitochondrial DNA mutations may contribute to increased genetic variability and heterogeneity. In Alzheimer's disease, multiple pathogenic events, including genetic factors, accumulation of aberrant or misfolded proteins, protofibril formation, ubiquitin-proteasome system dysfunction, excitotoxic reactions, oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial injury, synaptic failure, altered metal homeostasis, dysfunction of axonal and dendritic transport, and chaperone misoperation may converge in pathogenic pathways leading to premature death and neurodegeneration. Some of these mechanisms are common to several neurodegenerative disorders, which differ depending upon the gene(s) affected and the involvement of specific genetic networks, together with epigenetic factors and environmental events. Many genes potentially associated with Alzheimer's disease in some studies cannot be confirmed as candidate genes in replication studies, indicating that methodological problems and genomic complexity are leading to erroneous conclusions. A different approach to Alzheimer's disease functional genomics is to integrate individual genetic information in polygenic genotypes (haplotype-like model) and to investigate genotype-phenotype correlations and genotype-related pharmacogenomic behaviors. The application of functional genomics to Alzheimer's disease can be a suitable strategy for molecular diagnosis and for understanding pathophysiological mechanisms associated with Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration. Furthermore, the pharmacogenomics of Alzheimer's disease may contribute in the future to optimize drug development and therapeutics, increasing efficacy and safety, and reducing side-effects and unnecessary costs.

abstract={Epidemiological and clinical observations have led to the hypothesis that the risk of developing some chronic diseases in adulthood is influenced not only by genetic and adult lifestyle factors, but also by environmental factors acting in early life. These factors act through the processes of developmental plasticity and possibly epigenetic modification, and can be distinguished from developmental disruption. The concept of predictive adaptation has been developed to explain the relationship between early life events and the risk of later disease. At its base, the model suggests that a mismatch between fetal expectation of its postnatal environment and actual postnatal environment contribute to later adult disease risk. This mismatch is exacerbated, in part, by the phenomenon of 'maternal constraint' on fetal growth, which implicitly provides an upper limit of postnatal nutritional environment that humans have adapted for and is now frequently exceeded. These experimental, clinical and conceptual considerations have important implications for prevention and intervention in the current epidemic of childhood obesity and adult metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.},

abstract={The potential effects of predation risk on common brushtail possums were investigated in south-eastern Australian woodlands. Patterns of habitat use, foraging costs using giving-up density (GUD) experiments, and indices of body condition and reproductive success were examined at eight sites in two habitat types (eucalypt- or cypress-pine-dominated stands), within three areas of different red fox abundance (high, moderate and low fox density). In cypress-pine-dominated stands, possums travelled further on the ground, visited more feeding stations and had lower GUDs at feeders where foxes were removed than did possums in high-fox-density sites. In contrast, there was no effect of fox removal on the behaviour of possums in eucalypt-dominated stands. Fox removal also had no effect on indices of body condition and reproduction. Minor effects of microhabitat were detected with trackplot and GUD experiments, but, overall, the results suggest that habitat at the stand-level was more important. The non-lethal effects of foxes in different habitats may need to be taken into account when developing conservation strategies for native marsupials. © CSIRO 2005.},

abstract={Specific chemicals in the environment evoke significant changes in the behavior of many aquatic organisms. We studied in the laboratory whether satiated individuals of the hermit crab, Pagurus longicarpus Say 1817, adjust their investigatory behavior towards an empty, optimal gastropod shell according to differences of chemical context. We also explored to what extent shell investigation by a crab in the same hunger state was affected by occupying an inadequately sized shell. Our results confirmed in part previous findings that crabs can discriminate the odor of freshly dead snails from the odor of freshly dead conspecifics. In the presence of the former odor, crabs inhabiting shells of inadequate size were more responsive and active than those in better-fitting shells. To the contrary, regardless of the quality of the inhabited shell, P. longicarpus remained practically motionless when presented with the odor of freshly dead conspecifics, possibly because the risks of incurring in predators would outweigh the benefits of acquiring a new shell. Unexpectedly, we found that crabs in both types of shell quality exhibited nearly the same behavior in control water, while crabs in adequate shells were more responsive in the presence of food odor. Individuals appeared insensitive to the odor of live snails; indeed, only one hermit crab species has been seen removing living snails from their shells. An intriguing result was that water conditioned by the odors of live conspecifics exerted a strong effect on all the individuals by inducing an intense shell investigation. Our study underlines the central role exerted by chemical detection in hermit crabs' behavior and demonstrates the existence of a complex interplay among chemical context, the physiological state of the animal, and the ecological pressures of the habitat. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={A decrease in sensitivity to pleasurable stimuli, anhedonia, is a major symptom of depression in humans. Several animal models have been developed to simulate this symptom (e.g. drug withdrawal, learned helplessness) using reward-sensitive procedures such as intracranial self-stimulation and progressive ratio responding as a measure of reward function. Recently, we introduced the use of another procedure, novel-object place conditioning in rats, to measure reward function in an associative learning situation. Withdrawal from chronic nicotine blocked a place preference conditioned by access to novel objects. This blockade was not due to impairment of object interaction, general activity, novelty detection, environmental familiarization, or expression of learning. Consequently, nicotine withdrawal directly reduced the rewarding properties of novelty. It is proposed that the novel-object place conditioning procedure could be usefully extended to other experimental situations and to genetically altered mice, so as to better understand the processes underlying changes in reward function. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={For fishes settling over wide areas, spatial temperature variation can have a significant impact on growth rates during the early juvenile period. Size variation within cohorts and across years will depend on the thermal sensitivity of growth rate, the ability to move to favorable growth environments, and the potential to compensate for periods of reduced growth. We examined the growth, behavior and energy storage responses of juvenile Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis exposed to a thermally induced reduction in growth. Halibut reared for 12 wk at 2°C then acclimated to and grown at 10°C (delayed treatment) were compared to fish reared continuously at 10°C (controls). Growth rates at 2°C were 25 % of those at 10°C, resulting in a 2.4-fold difference in mass after 12 wk. Following acclimation to 10°C, specific growth rates of delayed fish were 20 % higher than controls. Complete compensation would have required 35 wk, assuming maintenance of observed growth rate differences between treatments. Rapid growth during the compensation phase was probably due in part to a reduction in the allocation of energy to lipid storage: length-corrected lipid levels of delayed fish were 14 % lower than levels among control fish. Behavioral observations indicated that growth compensating fish were more active than control fish; this is assumed to reflect increased foraging activity. However, when presented with food, growth-compensating halibut did not initiate feeding more rapidly than control fish. The predation and starvation risks associated with increased activity and decreased energy storage appear to represent trade-offs with rapid compensatory growth in juvenile halibut. © Inter-Research 2005.},

abstract={The neuroendocrine protein secretogranin II is the precursor of several neuropeptides, including secretoneurin and a novel 66-amino acid peptide, EM66, the sequence of which has been highly conserved across the vertebrae phylum. The presence of EM66 has been detected in the adult and fetal human adrenal gland, as well as the rat pituitary and adrenal glands. The present study aimed to explore a possible neuroendocrine role of EM66 by analysing its occurrence and distribution within the jerboa hypothalamus, and its potential implication in the control of feeding behaviour. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of jerboa hypothalamic extracts combined with a radioimmunoassay of EM66 revealed a single peak of immunoreactive material exhibiting the same retention time as recombinant EM66. Immunocytochemical labelling showed that EM66-producing neurones are widely distributed in several hypothalamic regions, including the preoptic area, the suprachiasmatic, supraoptic, parvocellular paraventricular and arcuate nuclei, and the lateral hypothalamus. Food deprivation for 5 days induced a significant increase in the number of EM66-containing neurones within the arcuate nucleus (105% increase) and the parvocellular aspect of the paraventricular nucleus (115% increase), suggesting that EM66 could be involved in the control of feeding behaviour and/or the response to stress associated with fasting. Altogether, these data reveal the physiological plasticity of the EM66 system in the hypothalamus and implicate this novel peptide in the regulation of neuroendocrine functions. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The objective was to investigate, in the rat, the effects of maternal exposure to vigabatrin (VGB) on the postnatal motor-cognitive behaviour of the offspring. We used an experimental evaluator-blind, placebo-controlled study in the rat. Ten pregnant rats were divided into five groups and treated with different doses of VGB (250, 500, 750, 1000 mg/kg/day) or placebo from gestation day (GD) 6 to GD10. After delivery, 56 pups (40 pups prenatally exposed to VGB and 16 pups exposed to placebo) were evaluated for motor-cognitive behaviour throughout postpartum day 40. At the end of testing sessions the animals were sacrificed and brain tissues processed for biochemical analysis of GABA levels. Body weight of pups and young rats whose mothers were treated with a dose of 750 mg/kg/day were significantly lower both at birth and during the whole postnatal life with respect to the control groups. Young rats of this group exhibited impaired performance in both the open-field and water maze tasks. Brain GABA contents were dramatically increased in this group of rats. No other significant nutritional, biochemical or behavioural changes were observed after treatments with doses of VGB lower than 750 mg/kg/day. The exposure to a dose of 1000 mg/kg caused abortion. Maternal exposure to VGB at relatively high doses (750 mg/kg/day) is likely to cause some important changes of the nutritional status during the pre- and postnatal life. Thus, the biochemical and cognitive abnormalities observed in this study could be related to some disturbances of brain development induced by malnutrition and/or to a disturbance of neuronal programming of the gabaergic system. © Springer-Verlag Italia 2005.},

abstract={Objective: Examine a model that encourages health at every size as opposed to weight loss. The health at every size concept supports homeostatic regulation and eating intuitively (ie, in response to internal cues of hunger, satiety, and appetite). Design: Six-month, randomized clinical trial; 2-year follow-up. Subjects: White, obese, female chronic dieters, aged 30 to 45 years (N=78). Setting: Free-living, general community. Interventions: Six months of weekly group intervention (health at every size program or diet program), followed by 6 months of monthly aftercare group support. Main outcome measures: Anthropometry (weight, body mass index), metabolic fitness (blood pressure, blood lipids), energy expenditure, eating behavior (restraint, eating disorder pathology), and psychology (self-esteem, depression, body image). Attrition, attendance, and participant evaluations of treatment helpfulness were also monitored. Statistical analysis performed: Analysis of variance. Results: Cognitive restraint decreased in the health at every size group and increased in the diet group, indicating that both groups implemented their programs. Attrition (6 months) was high in the diet group (41%), compared with 8% in the health at every size group. Fifty percent of both groups returned for 2-year evaluation. Health at every size group members maintained weight, improved in all outcome variables, and sustained improvements. Diet group participants lost weight and showed initial improvement in many variables at 1 year; weight was regained and little improvement was sustained. Conclusions: The health at every size approach enabled participants to maintain long-term behavior change; the diet approach did not. Encouraging size acceptance, reduction in dieting behavior, and heightened awareness and response to body signals resulted in improved health risk indicators for obese women.

abstract={Changes in the spatial arrangement or identity of objects inside a familiar environment induce reexploration. The present study looks at modifications of place cell activity during such renewed exploration. Hungry rats foraged for food in a cylinder with a salient cue card attached to the wall and with two distinct objects at fixed positions on the floor relative to each other and to the cue card. Once a set of CA1 place cells was recorded in this standard configuration, additional sessions were done after two kinds of manipulation. In the first, the two objects were rotated as a rigid set 90 degrees counterclockwise around the cylinder center while leaving the cue card in place; this was considered a spatial change. The effects of rotating the objects were different for fields near the objects (near fields) and fields far from the objects (far fields). Object rotation altered most near fields in complex ways, including remapping and cessation of firing. Near fields that remained intact after object rotation underwent unpredictable rotations that frequently departed considerably from the expected value of 90 degrees CCW. In contrast, the only change induced in far fields was a reduction of discharge rate on day 1, but not day 2, exposures of the rat to the rotated objects. The effects on both near and far fields were reversed when the objects were returned to their standard position. In the second manipulation, substitution of one of the two familiar objects with a novel object, a nonspatial change, had no detectable effect on place cell activity, regardless of field location. The sensitivity of hippocampal place cells to spatial changes but not to nonspatial changes is in agreement with earlier results showing that hippocampal lesions abolish reexploration after spatial but not after nonspatial object manipulations. The fact that reexploration is accompanied by place cell changes after spatial but not nonspatial changes reinforces the role that the hippocampus is believed to play in navigational computing and is perfectly compatible with the idea that another brain structure, likely perirhinal cortex, is responsible for object recognition. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={A clear relationship between intrauterine development and later life predisposition to long-term disease is well established. Weight at birth provides a surrogate measure for fetal development and low birth weight predicts changes in most endocrine axes in adulthood. The exposure of the fetus to elevated levels of either endogenous or synthetic glucocorticoids, pre and periconceptional nutritional status and immediate postnatal development including catch-up growth all contribute substantially to the development of adult onset disease. Fetal exposure to high levels of glucocorticoids has direct clinical relevance. Synthetic glucocorticoids (betamethasone/dexamethasone) are administered to women at risk of preterm delivery to advance fetal maturation and reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality. However, in human pregnancy, evidence suggests that fetal exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids has detrimental effects on birth outcome, childhood cognition and long-term behavior. Studies in animals have established a link between prenatal exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids and alterations in fetal development as well as changes in placental function. These developmental alterations appear to be permanent. Whether this is the case in humans awaits long-term follow-up of children enrolled in randomized controlled trials of prenatal glucocorticoid therapy. The research challenges in this field are now centered on uncovering the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids are involved in programming the fetus for its future life, and discovering ways in which the effectiveness and safety of antenatal glucocorticoids can be enhanced. The purpose of this mini-review is to provide a background into the use of antenatal synthetic corticosteroids and to highlight and summarize recently published clinical and animal-based studies. © 2005 Bentham Science Publisher Ltd.},

abstract={Progressive accumulation of oxidative damage to proteins, lipids and nucleotides may lead to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline in humans and animals. One of the primary sources of free radical species that can damage macromolecules is the mitochondrion. This review focuses on evidence of beneficial effects of antioxidant supplementation on cognitive function obtained from both human clinical trials and studies of animal models. Human observational studies and clinical trials variably report improved cognition with supplement use and reduced risk for the development of pathological aging. Further, a combination of antioxidants provides superior protection than administration of single compound supplements. In rodent models, administration of either antioxidants or mitochondrial cofactors improves behavioral and neuronal function outcome measures, with combined supplement approaches producing larger effects than single item supplements. Our work shows that long-term feeding with a diet rich in a broad spectrum of antioxidants leads to improved cognition, in a canine model of cognitive aging. We have also found that long-term maintenance on the enriched diet has neuroprotective effects manifest later in life. Collectively, the results from human and animal studies suggest that the intake of a broad spectrum of antioxidants, particularly through an enriched diet, may promote successful cognitive aging.

abstract={Zooplankton taxa exhibit varying tolerances to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), with rotifers and copepods tending to be more UV tolerant than cladocerans, regardless of lake UV transparency. On the basis of these differences, we hypothesized that UV avoidance behavior would be greatest in zooplankton with low UV tolerance, particularly in high-UV systems. Both downward and upward movements of zooplankton were examined in cylindrical acrylic columns that either transmitted full sunlight or blocked UV-B and short wavelength UV-A radiation. Columns were suspended vertically in the surface waters of a high- and low-UV lake at varying times of day and cloud cover. In the high-UV lake, the cladoceran Daphnia catawba displayed a distinct avoidance of the surface waters in the UV+ treatment but often showed a preference for the surface in the UV-treatment. Copepods were less responsive to UVR with calanoids displaying a somewhat greater UV avoidance than cyclapoids. In the low-UV lake, no behavioral differences were observed among UV treatments. These results suggest that UVR may influence the vertical distribution and habitat partitioning of certain zooplankton taxa in high-UV lakes while other factors, such as predation and food limitation, may be more important in low-UV lakes. © The Author 2005.

abstract={Herbal weight-loss supplements are marketed with claims of effectiveness. Our earlier systematic review identified data from double-blind, randomized controlled trials for a number of herbal supplements. The aim of this systematic review was to assess all clinical evidence of adverse events of herbal food supplements for body weight reduction for which effectiveness data from rigorous clinical trials exist. We assessed Ephedra sinica, Garcinia cambogia, Paullinia cupana, guar gum, Plantago psyllium, Ilex paraguariensis and Pausinystalia yohimbe. Literature searches were conducted on Medline, Embase, Amed and The Cochrane Library. Data were also requested from the spontaneous reporting scheme of the World Health Organization. We hand-searched relevant medical journals and our own files. There were no restrictions regarding the language of publication. The results show that adverse events including hepatic injury and death have been reported with the use of some herbal food supplements. For herbal ephedra and ephedrine-containing food supplements an increased risk of psychiatric, autonomic or gastrointestinal adverse events and heart palpitations has been reported. In conclusion, adverse events are reported for a number of herbal food supplements, which are used for reducing body weight. Although the quality of the data does not justify definitive attribution of causality in most cases, the reported risks are sufficient to shift the risk-benefit balance against the use of most of the reviewed herbal weight-loss supplements. Exceptions are Garcinia cambogia and yerba maté, which merit further investigation. © 2005 The International Association for the Study of Obesity.},

abstract={Synapsins are evolutionarily conserved, highly abundant vesicular phosphoproteins in presynaptic terminals. They are thought to regulate the recruitment of synaptic vesicles from the reserve pool to the readily-releasable pool, in particular when vesicle release is to be maintained at high spiking rates. As regulation of transmitter release is a prerequisite for synaptic plasticity, we use the fruit fly Drosophila to ask whether Synapsin has a role in behavioral plasticity as well; in fruit flies, Synapsin is encoded by a single gene (syn). We tackled this question for associative olfactory learning in larval Drosophila by using the deletion mutant syn97CS, which had been backcrossed to the Canton-S wild-type strain (CS) for 13 generations. We provide a molecular account of the genomic status of syn97CS by PCR and show the absence of gene product on Western blots and nerve-muscle preparations. We found that olfactory associative learning in syn97CS larvae is reduced to ∼50% of wild-type CS levels; however, responsiveness to the to-be-associated stimuli and motor performance in untrained animals are normal. In addition, we introduce two novel behavioral control procedures to test stimulus responsiveness and motor performance after "sham training." Wild-type CS and syn97CS perform indistinguishably also in these tests. Thus, larval Drosophila can be used as a case study for a role of Synapsin in associative learning. ©2005 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract={The increasing prevalence of overweight youth in the United States and the associated increase in medical comorbidities has created a growing need for effective weight-management interventions. The recommended treatment for an overweight child to achieve a more healthful weight uses four primary behavioral strategies: (a) reduce energy intake while maintaining optimal nutrient intake to protect growth and development, (b) increase energy expenditure by promoting more physical movement and less sedentary activity, (c) actively engage parents and primary caretakers as agents of change, and (d) facilitate a supportive family environment. Although this approach has the most empirical support, the impact on the pediatric obesity epidemic has been limited, particularly for adolescents with more severe obesity and for African-American, Native-American, and Hispanic children. This has prompted efforts to adapt strategies that have been effective in adult weight management for use in pediatric behavioral intervention programs. These include using motivational interviewing to increase readiness for health behavior changes, modifying the carbohydrate content of children's diets, using culturally appropriate messages and materials, improving cultural competency of health care providers, and using computer-based strategies. Randomized, controlled clinical trials are needed to test the safety and efficacy of these approaches before they can be recommended for clinical practice. Pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery are more aggressive and historically adult interventions with greater risk that are being considered for severely obese adolescents who have serious obesity-related medical complications and who have failed other more conventional methods.

abstract={Eating disorders are stereotypically believed to be a white, female, middle class malady. There is not currently a widely-held awareness among health professionals that these conditions exist in males, although past research has estimated that between 5-10% of individuals presenting with eating disorders are male. Despite increased records of the incidence of both Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa in females over the last 50 years, the awareness of these disorders in males remains low. This has been attributed to bias and inaccuracy in diagnosis, stigma, and reluctance among males to seek treatment. This paper reviews the existing literature on males with eating disorders in an attempt to properly outline typical features that males may present with. These features are assessed within the context of generally accepted diagnostic criteria, and further the understanding of this phenomenon in males.},

abstract={Since David Lack first proposed that birds rear as many young as they can nourish, food limitation has been accepted as the primary explanation for variation in clutch size and other life-history traits in birds. The importance of food limitation in life-history variation, however, was recently questioned on theoretical grounds. Here, we show that clutch size differences between two populations of a neotropical thrush were contrary to expectations under Lack's food limitation hypothesis. Larger clutch sizes were found in a population with higher nestling starvation rate (i.e. greater food limitation). We experimentally equalized clutches between populations to verify this difference in food limitation. Our experiment confirmed greater food limitation in the population with larger mean clutch size. In addition, incubation bout length and nestling growth rate were also contrary to predictions of food limitation theory. Our results demonstrate the inability of food limitation to explain differences in several life-history traits: clutch size, incubation behaviour, parental feeding rate and nestling growth rate. These life-history traits were better explained by inter-population differences in nest predation rates. Food limitation may be less important to life history evolution in birds than suggested by traditional theory. © 2005 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Animals may respond to spatial and temporal heterogeneity by altering their movement patterns. The time an animal spends in an area of a given size is termed 'first-passage time' and can be used to identify the scales at which different movement processes occur. Using first-passage time and 2-h observations, we identified nested spatial scales representing three movement behaviours for elk (Cervus elaphus) - inactive/resting (moves < 50 m), active/foraging (x̄ = 276.7 m, SD = 56.6), and active/relocating (x̄ = 1628.3 m, SD = 436.6). Our ability to identify inactive behaviour was limited by GPS accuracy. The scale separating relocating and foraging behaviour ranged 550-1650 m across individuals and varied quadratically with the mean patch size of cutover forest in an animal's home range. We classified path segments into the 3 movement behaviours and related behaviours to local environmental conditions. Elk were likely to be inactive in areas having a low predicted use by wolves (Canis lupus), farther than 50 m from anthropogenic linear clearings, and where microclimatic conditions were cool (high shrub cover and north to east-facing slopes). In contrast, elk were most likely to forage in areas having intermediate levels of herbaceous biomass and low movement costs. Elk were most likely to be relocating when in areas of high wolf use, when close to linear clearings, and in energetically costly situations such as moving upslope. We discuss how elk use of potential foraging habitats may be restricted in this landscape by risks imposed by predators, humans, or both. © Springer 2005.},

abstract={The night sky is the venue for an ancient arms race. Insectivorous bats with their ultrasonic sonar exert an enormous selective pressure on nocturnal insects. In response insects have evolved the ability to hear bat cries, to evade their hunting maneuvers, and some, the tiger moths (Arctiidae), to utter an ultrasonic reply. We here determine what it is that tiger moths "say" to bats. We chose four species of arctiid moths, Cycnia tenera, Euchaetes egle, Utetheisa ornatrix, and Apantesis nais, that naturally differ in their levels of unpalatability and their ability to produce sound. Moths were tethered and offered to free-flying naïve big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus. The ability of the bats to capture each species was compared to their ability to capture noctuid, geometrid, and wax moth controls over a learning period of 7 days. We repeated the experiment using the single arctiid species E. egle that through diet manipulation and simple surgery could be rendered palatable or unpalatable and sound producing or mute. We again compared the capture rates of these categories of E. egle to control moths. Using both novel learning approaches we have found that the bats only respond to the sounds of arctiids when they are paired with defensive chemistry. The sounds are in essence a warning to the bats that the moth is unpalatable-an aposematic signal. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract={Adult female mice are innately attracted to non-volatile pheromones contained in male-soiled bedding. In contrast, male-derived volatiles become attractive if associated with non-volatile attractive pheromones, which act as unconditioned stimulus in a case of Pavlovian associative learning. In this work, we study the chemoinvestigatory behaviour of female mice towards volatile and non-volatile chemicals contained in male-soiled bedding, in combination with the analysis of c-fos expression induced by such a behaviour to clarify: (i) which chemosensory systems are involved in the detection of the primary attractive non-volatile pheromone and of the secondarily attractive volatiles; (ii) where in the brain male-derived non-volatile and volatile stimuli are associated to induce conditioned attraction for the latter; and (iii) whether investigation of these stimuli activates the cerebral reward system (mesocorticolimbic system including the prefrontal cortex and amygdala), which would support the view that sexual pheromones are reinforcing. The results indicate that non-volatile pheromones stimulate the vomeronasal system, whereas air-borne volatiles activate only the olfactory system. Thus, the acquired preference for male-derived volatiles reveals an olfactory-vomeronasal associative learning. Moreover, the reward system is differentially activated by the primary pheromones and secondarily attractive odorants. Exploring the primary attractive pheromone activates the basolateral amygdala and the shell of nucleus accumbens but neither the ventral tegmental area nor the orbitofrontal cortex. In contrast, exploring the secondarily attractive male-derived odorants involves activation of a circuit that includes the basolateral amygdala, prefrontal cortex and ventral tegmental area. Therefore, the basolateral amygdala stands out as the key centre for vomeronasal-olfactory associative learning. © Federation of European Neuroscience Societies.},

abstract={Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a hypothalamic neuropeptide with a prominent role in feeding and energy homeostasis. The rodent MCH receptor (MCH1R) is highly expressed in the nucleus accumbens shell (AcSh), a region that is important in the regulation of appetitive behavior. Here we establish a role for MCH and MCH1R in mediating a hypothalamic-limbic circuit that regulates feeding and related behaviors. Direct delivery of an MCH1R receptor antagonist to the AcSh blocked feeding and produced an antidepressant-like effect in the forced swim test, whereas intra-AcSh injection of MCH had the opposite effect. Expression studies demonstrated that MCH1R is present in both the enkephalin- and dynorphin-positive medium spiny neurons of the AcSh. Biochemical analysis in AcSh explants showed that MCH signaling blocks dopamine-induced phosphorylation of the AMPA glutamate receptor subunit GluR1 at Ser845. Finally, food deprivation, but not other stressors, stimulated cAMP response element-binding protein-dependent pathways selectively in MCH neurons of the hypothalamus, suggesting that these neurons are responsive to a specific set of physiologically relevant conditions. This work identifies a novel hypothalamic-AcSh circuit that influences appetitive behavior and mediates the antidepressant activity of MCH1R antagonists. Copyright © 2005 Society for Neuroscience.},

abstract={The foraging behaviour of animals depends on the distribution, abundance and predictability of their food resources. In the marine environment, top predators such as seabirds are known to concentrate their foraging effort in specific oceanic features where productivity is elevated or prey concentrated. When marine productivity is low and prey distribution unpredictable, such as in tropical waters, selection should favour the evolution of flexible foraging strategies. By using GPS, Argos transmitters and activity recorders, we studied the foraging strategy of red-footed boobies (RFBs) Sula sula breeding on Europa Island in the Mozambique Channel, to examine the way a central place forager searches for prey in tropical waters. RFBs only foraged during the day-time and never sat on the water at night; thus, they consequently had a limited maximum foraging range of 148 km. Primary production within this range was low overall (average 0.165 mg chlorophyll m-3), with a high spatial and temporal heterogeneity due to the presence of strong geostrophic currents and surface mixing by storms. RFBs appear to adjust their foraging strategy to cope with this situation. Individual birds do not return to the same oceanic sites from one trip to the next, but generally head in the direction of zones where productivity is enhanced. Active foraging, i.e. periods when birds spent time on the sea surface or dived, occurred at the most distant part of the foraging trip. Despite their limited foraging range and the low productivity of surrounding waters, red-footed boobies are able to track zones of prey availability located in areas of enhanced primary production. Searching is probably favoured by the presence of sub-surface predators that chase prey to the surface. The foraging strategy of this tropical sulid appears to differ extensively from that of temperate or polar seabirds whose prey distribution and availability are more predictable. © Inter-Research 2005.},

abstract={The hypothesis that there isa developmental component to subsequent adult disease initially arose from epidemiological findings relating birth size to either indices of disease risk or actual disease prevalence in later life. While components of the epidemiological analyses have been challenged, there is strong evidence that developmental factors contribute to the later risk of metabolic disease - including insulin resistance, obesity, and heart disease - as well as have a broader impact on osteoporosis, depression and schizophrenia. We suggest that disease risk is greater when there is a mismatch between the early developmental environment (i.e., the phase of developmental plasticity) versus that experienced in mature life (i.e., adulthood), and that nutritional influences are particularly important. It is also critical to distinguish between those factors acting during the developmental phase that disrupt development from those influences that are less extreme and act through regulated processes of epigenetic change. A model of the relationship between the developmental and mature environment is proposed and suggests interventional strategies that will vary in different population settings. Copyright © 2005 S.

abstract={Objective: A previous study suggested that insulin metabolic variables play a role in the progression of atherosclerosis in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits. The present study sought to determine: 1) if young, individually caged WHHLs are insulin-resistant relative to New Zealand white (NZW) rabbits and 2) whether dietary or exercise interventions can improve insulin sensitivity and slow the development of atherosclerosis in these animals. Methods: Forty-two WHHLs were assigned to a dietary, exercise, or control condition, and 12 NZWs were used as a comparison control group. The intervention ran from 3 to 7 months of age, and all animals received an intravenous glucose tolerance test at the beginning and end of the intervention. Results: WHHLs were insulin-resistant relative to NZWs at 3 months of age. Whereas the dietary intervention was effective in controlling insulin resistance, WHHLs in the exercise group without dietary restriction and the control group exhibited significant increases in insulin resistance. No intervention significantly influenced the progression of atherosclerosis. Conclusions: Young WHHLs are insulin-resistant during an early period when atherosclerosis is developing rapidly. Dietary restriction, but not exercise without weight control, is effective in controlling insulin metabolic variables in the WHHL model. Although dietary intervention can reduce cardiovascular risk factors such as insulin resistance, it is not effective in slowing the development of atherosclerosis in these genetically dyslipidemic animals. Similarly, exercise training, without dietary control, does not influence the progression of disease in WHHLs. Copyright © 2005 by the American Psychosomatic Society.},

abstract={At small spatial scales basking sharks (Cetorhinus maximus) forage selectively on zooplankton along thermal fronts, but the factors influencing broader scale patterns in their abundance and distribution remain largely unknown. Using long-term sightings data collected off southwest Britain between 1988 and 2001, we show that the number of basking sharks recorded was highly correlated with abiotic factors, principally sea surface temperature (SST) and the lagged effect of SST in the previous month, but only very weakly to zooplankton density. This suggests that the changes in number of basking sharks recorded over large spatio-temporal scales are more closely related to the availability of climate-driven thermal resources than prey availability, whereas the converse is supported by previous studies at local scales. Taken together, these results imply scale-dependent behavioural responses in basking sharks, with small-scale foraging movements linked by broad scale responses to temperature variation. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Dolphins are characterized by a significant behavioral versatility, which allows them to respond to environmental seasonality. Seasonal variation in dolphin behavior in tropical waters is not well known. Stenella attenuata graffmani is a resident dolphin in the clearly defined seasonal Gulf of Papagayo, Costa Rica, and we studied if dolphin group size, occurrence and behavioral patterns were associated with season and time of day in the gulf. Using strip transects we surveyed two locations for three consecutive years. School size ranged from 1 to 50 individuals, mean group size was 10.16 (SD = 9.61) individuals. Overall, foraging activities were the most frequent, followed by social interactions and travel. From 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM we mostly observed social interactions, followed by feeding-socializing (9:00 AM-12:00 PM) and feeding exclusively (12:00 PM-3:00 PM). Social activities intensified afterwards (3:00 PM-6:00 PM). Behavior and gulf seasonality were associated (χ2 = 90.52, gl = 6, p&lt;0.05, n = 99). In the dry season (December-April) feeding predominated over other activities, but socializing was more frequent in the early rainy season (May-July). Larger groups (mean 12 dolphins) forage actively; smaller groups (mean 6 dolphins 6.51 ± 5.12) foraged more passively. Seasonal variation in dolphin activities are likely to be associated with food availability, as observed in the high number of groups involved in foraging behaviors, and a high investment in foraging activities during the dry season.},

abstract={Neuroadaptations occurring in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway following recurrent exposure to drugs of abuse have been correlated with a behavioral phenomenon known as behavioral sensitization. We have developed an animal model of prenatal cocaine exposure and, using a postnatal sensitization protocol, have examined the subsequent sensitivity of offspring to cocaine. Pregnant Swiss Webster dams were injected twice daily from embryonic day 8 to 17, inclusive, with cocaine (COC40: administered cocaine HCl at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day, and COC20: administered cocaine HCl at a dose of 20 mg/kg/ day), or saline (SAL). The SPF40 group (saline pair-fed), a nutritional control group, was 'pair-fed' with COC40 dams. Activity was recorded for 30 min during a 3-day saline habituation, a 14-day 'initiation' phase, when animals received cocaine (15 mg/kg) or saline every other day, and following a 21-day 'withdrawal' period when all mice were challenged with cocaine. COC40 offspring, as compared with SAL controls, did not habituate to a novel environment, demonstrated increased cocaine-induced stereotypy on Coc 1 (first cocaine injection), and blunted locomotor sensitization on challenge as measured by the percentage of each animal's baseline locomotion. Tissue samples of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and striatum (Str) of all four prenatal treatment groups were examined to determine whether alterations in the transcription factor CREB or glutamate receptor subunit, GluR1, induced by prenatal cocaine treatment may have contributed to the altered behavioral responses. Immunoblot quantitation revealed significantly increased constitutive CREB expression in the NAc and Str of COC40 mice as compared with SAL controls. Such alterations in constitutive CREB levels may contribute to some of the behavioral differences reported in adult mice exposed to cocaine in utero. Copyright © 2005 S. Karger AG.},

abstract={Infochemicals are known to play a key role in mediating predator-prey interactions, both in aquatic and terrestrial communities. However, state-dependent variation may exist in how effectively individuals can use this information, depending on genotype, life stage and experience. For our study, we used the predator-prey model system fish-waterflea Daphnia magna Straus (Cladocera, Daphniidae). Adult Daphnia use fish-derived infochemicals, so-called kairomones, as indicators of predation risk, and exhibit a spectrum of morphological, behavioural and life-history responses to the presence of fish kairomones. Here, we investigate whether diapausing eggs, an embryonic resting stage in the life cycle of D. magna, also use fish kairomones and tune their hatching to the risk of fish predation, as reported for diapausing stages of dinoflagellates. In two laboratory experiments, we studied hatching proportion and time until hatching of D. magna diapausing eggs in the absence and presence of fish kairomones. D. magna families differed significantly in their response to the presence of fish kairomones; some families reduced hatching proportion, whereas others increased it. Our results imply genotype-dependent differences in the hatching reactions to fish kairomones as observed for other traits in adult Daphnia. © Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, 2005.},

abstract={Vitamin A (all-trans-retinol) is the parent compound of a family of natural and synthetic compounds, the retinoids. Retinoids regulate gene transcription in numerous cells and tissues by binding to nuclear retinoid receptor proteins, which act as transcription factors. Much of the research conducted on retinoid signalling in the nervous system has focussed on developmental effects in the embryonic or early postnatal brain. Here, we review the increasing body of evidence indicating that retinoid signalling plays an important role in the function of the mature brain. Components of the metabolic pathway for retinoids have been identified in adult brain tissues, suggesting that all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) can be synthesized in discrete regions of the brain. The distribution of retinoid receptor proteins in the adult nervous system is different from that seen during development; and suggests that retinoid signalling is likely to have a physiological role in adult cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum and associated brain regions. A number of neuronal specific genes contain recognition sequences for the retinoid receptor proteins and can be directly regulated by retinoids. Disruption of retinoid signalling pathways in rodent models indicates their involvement in regulating synaptic plasticity and associated learning and memory behaviours. Retinoid signalling pathways have also been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and depression. Overall, the data underscore the likely importance of adequate nutritional Vitamin A status for adult brain function and highlight retinoid signalling pathways as potential novel therapeutic targets for neurological diseases. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Eating disorders including anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) have increased lately, and they are increasingly seen in routine clinical settings. Eating disorders are associated with abnormalities in eating behaviors such as fear of obesity, apocleisis, binge-eating, and self-vomiting. These abnormalities result in complications such as malnutrition. The physical effects of these disorders include extended periods of chronic hypotension, bradycardia, hypothermia, swelling of the salivary gland, caries, anemia, dehydration, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and prolonged metabolic alkalosis. Therefore, renal failure or heart failure tends to occur due to these abnormalities. In addition, the possibility of sudden death due to arrhythmia is not uncommon. Gastric rupture may also occur due to binging or fierce vomiting. Secondary amenorrhea occurs in more than 90% of AN patients because of chronic malnutrition. Reduction of bone mass leads to an increased risk of bone fractures later in life. In addition, psychological complications such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and personality disorders are common, and it is important to note that domestic conflicts are manifested when patients develop eating disorders. Therefore, a multifaceted therapeutic approach, focused on the mental and physical aspects, is necessary in the treatment of eating disorders.},

abstract={This study aimed to determine whether apparently healthy, untreated postmenopausal women at risk of osteoporosis relative to nonmenopausal women are concomitantly at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in terms of various aspects of lifestyle, personality, body shape and composition, and blood chemistry. Two homogeneous groups of 30 women having reached menopause for 3-5 years and 30 nonmenopausal controls, all non-estrogen users without apparent CVD risk factors, were compared in a cross-sectional design. Data related to physical activity, dietary intakes, personality type, anthropometry, and skinfold-thickness were collected. Plasma insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and serum lipids were measured and used as biochemical predictors of osteoporosis and CVD, respectively. Compared to nonmenopausal controls, postmenopausal women were at greater risk of bone loss given their lower plasma IGF-1, lower physical activity level, and even given their higher serum lipids, as recent literature suggests. Moreover, their dietary calcium intake fulfilled only 70% of the current recommendation, which may reduce protection against osteoporosis and CVD (particularly hypertension) as well. The two groups did not differ regarding energy intake, body weight and frame size, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and waist-hip ratio (WHR). However, postmenopausal subjects had more adipose tissue and differed in terms of lifestyle factors (lower dietary lipids and greater alcohol consumption). While neither group was at particular risk of CVD according to waist circumference, WHR, and serum triglycerides, postmenopausal women were at risk according to percent body adiposity and serum cholesterol. This study shows that several risk factors for osteoporosis and CVD can coexist in apparently healthy postmenopausal women after a few years of natural menopause. It emphasizes the need for a timely screening that would stress both heart and bone risk factors. © Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.},

abstract={Birds frequently interrupt feeding to scan their surrounding environment. Usually an inverse correlation between scan rate and flock size exists. The 'many-eyes' hypothesis suggests that more eyes are able to detect a predator earlier. Due to the 'dilution-effect' animals in larger groups experience 'safety in numbers', while the 'scramble competition' hypothesis suggests that individuals reduce their vigilance in larger groups since they compete for a limited amount of scarce resources. Here, I induced competition in natural coot populations. Coots preferred feeding on grass and were occasionally fed by passers-by at the study sites. However, this resource was scarce and coots experienced additional food as a very limited resource. I sampled coots prior and after an experimental treatment with an additional food supply. Correlations between vigilance rate (number of scans during 1 min of foraging), nearest neighbor distance and flock size existed before the experimental treatment but afterwards the correlation between vigilance and nearest neighbor distance faded. I found a significantly lower vigilance rate and nearest neighbor distance after inducing competition. This study provided experimental evidence for the 'scramble competition' hypothesis namely that individuals in groups lowered their vigilance when faced with competition for a limited amount of food resources given similar flock sizes. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Recent theoretical and empirical work argues that growth rate can evolve and be optimized, rather than always being maximized. Chronically low resource availability is predicted to favour the evolution of slow growth, whereas attaining a size-refuge from mortality risk is predicted to favour the evolution of rapid growth. Guppies (Poecilia reticulata) evolve differences in behaviour, morphology and life-history traits in response to predation, thus demonstrating that predators are potent agents of selection. Predators in low-predation environments prey preferentially on small guppies, but those in high-predation environments appear to be non-selective. Because guppies can outgrow their main predator in low- but not high-predation localities, we predict that predation will select for higher growth rates in the low-predation environments. However, low-predation localities also tend to have lower productivity than high-predation localities, yielding the prediction that guppies from these sites should have slower growth rates. Here we compare the growth rates of the second laboratory-born generation of guppies from paired high- and low-predation localities from four different drainages. In two out of four comparisons, guppies from high-predation sites grew significantly faster than their low-predation counterparts. We also compare laboratory born descendants from a field introduction experiment and show that guppies introduced to a low-predation environment evolved slower growth rates after 13 years, although this was evident only at the high food level. The weight of the evidence suggests that resource availability plays a more important role than predation in shaping the evolution of growth rates. © 2005 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Question: Has the less expensive gamete (sperm) really been selected as the limiting factor in a nematode's reproduction, as laboratory studies have implied? Hypothesis: Reproductive output of the self-fertilizing hermaphroditic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is oocyte-limited in the worm's natural environment: soil. Organism: Sperm depletion and laying of unfertilized oocytes occurs in well-fed laboratory cultures of the self-fertilizing hermaphroditic nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. This phenomenon has been much discussed as a possible contradiction to the usual expectation of selection for maximum fertility. Methods: Caenorhabditis elegans were maintained in a variety of food regimes, not just the ad libitum Escherichia coli typical of laboratory cultures. Sperm production, oocyte production and body size were measured for nematodes cultured on agar with feeding treatments of serially diluted bacteria suspensions, before and during gamete formation. Body sizes were also measured for worms cultured in soil or compost microcosms. Results: Reproduction was sperm-limited only for nematodes in the highest food treatments (106 or more E. coli cells per day); lower food treatments produced smaller worms with considerable excess sperm. Caenorhabditis elegans grown in natural soil or compost microcosms achieved the same sizes as those in treatments that showed oocyte limitation, not the large sizes of those typical of C. elegans in treatments that exhibited sperm limitation. Enriching soil or compost by adding E. coli produced appreciably larger C. elegans, but only if numbers of other invertebrates - potential predators/competitors of C. elegans - were minimized. Even with increased nutrients and reduced numbers of other invertebrates, only a few C. elegans in natural soil or compost were large enough to be consistent with sperm limitation. © 2005 Nancy C.

abstract={Recent studies on humans show that too much choice can make subjects less likely to choose any item. I consider general adaptive and non-adaptive explanations of why such choice aversion, or its converse, might occur in animals. There are three questions: is more choice always preferred, does it ever lead to less consumption (or a lower probability of consumption), and may it result in worse items being selected? A preference for choice is one of the main explanations for lek formation and I draw attention to previously unrecognised parallels with models of human shopping behaviour. There is indeed evidence of female preference for larger leks, although much of the observational data are open to other interpretations. Unfortunately nobody has looked for choice aversion where it is most to be expected, in leks larger than normally occur. Evidence that too much choice of males confuses females is strongest in acoustically advertising frogs, but the widespread decrease of mating skew in larger leks might also have this explanation. A model reanalyses data on skew in black grouse Tetrao tetrix and suggests that considering only a random subset of a large lek may increase the chances of selecting the better males: larger leks are more likely to include better males, but these are less likely to be selected. These opposing effects may lead to an optimum lek size, but only with a sufficient decline in choice accuracy with size. With food choice, very few studies have avoided confounding choice with food quality, by manipulating only flavour. The widespread phenomena of stimulus-specific satiety and novelty seeking imply that monotonous diets are aversive, but no studies test whether animals choose sites where they know food diversity to be greater. Operant experiments that demonstrate mild preferences for free choice concern choice about the means to get food rather than the food itself. In some insect species even moderate choice of diet can be deleterious, and studies on search images and the confusion effect may be evidence of this in vertebrates. Environmental enrichment of captive animals often relies on increasing the options available, but it need not be the choice itself that is beneficial. I consider briefly further areas in biology where choice preference or aversion are potentially important.},

abstract={Foraging site selection is likely to be influenced by vegetation structure since this can affect both the potential energy gain and predation risk that animals associate with a patch. We investigated foraging site selection by chaffinches, Fringilla coelebs, between a 'safe' patch with short stubble allowing earlier detection of an approaching predator and a 'risky' patch with longer, more visually obstructive stubble. When initial seed densities in the patches were equal, individuals foraged more in the short stubble and had shorter vigilance periods than those that foraged in the long stubble. These differences in foraging and vigilance behaviour changed if the food abundance in each patch was unequal. We used these variations in measures of foraging and vigilance behaviour to predict the level of increased food abundance in the 'risky' patch necessary for it to be used more often. As the relative density of seeds in the long stubble compared to that in the short stubble increased, the proportion of time individuals spent in the short stubble declined. Patch switching occurred at a seed density ratio of approximately 1:2.5. Individuals made a higher proportion of pecks in the short stubble with less than two times as many seeds in the long stubble. With more than three times as many seeds in the long stubble, they made a higher proportion of pecks in the long stubble. The results show that compensation through vigilance for the increased predation risk manifest in a patch's physical characteristics may greatly reduce the profitability of a patch. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={Weight loss is difficult to achieve and maintaining the weight loss is an even greater challenge. The identification of factors associated with weight loss maintenance can enhance our understanding for the behaviours and prerequisites that are crucial in sustaining a lowered body weight. In this paper we have reviewed the literature on factors associated with weight loss maintenance and weight regain. We have used a definition of weight maintenance implying intentional weight loss that has subsequently been maintained for at least 6 months. According to our review, successful weight maintenance is associated with more initial weight loss, reaching a self-determined goal weight, having a physically active lifestyle, a regular meal rhythm including breakfast and healthier eating, control of over-eating and self-monitoring of behaviours. Weight maintenance is further associated with an internal motivation to lose weight, social support, better coping strategies and ability to handle life stress, self-efficacy, autonomy, assuming responsibility in life, and overall more psychological strength and stability. Factors that may pose a risk for weight regain include a history of weight cycling, disinhibited eating, binge eating, more hunger, eating in response to negative emotions and stress, and more passive reactions to problems.},

abstract={Rats were repeatedly exposed to an open arena containing two depletable food sources in a discrete-trials procedure. Their movement patterns were recorded and compared to adaptive foraging tactics such as minimizing distance or energy expenditure, thigmotaxis, and trail following. They were also compared to the predictions of the associative route-finder model of Reid and Staddon [Reid, A.K., Staddon, J.E.R., 1998. A dynamic route finder for the cognitive map. Psychol. Rev. 105 (3), 585-601]. We manipulated the presence/absence of food, goal cups, and a wooden runway to determine the influence of local and distal stimuli (visual, olfactory, and tactile) on movement patterns. Increased experience in the arena produced decreases in travel distance and time to the food sources. Local and distal stimuli influenced movement patterns in ways compatible with visual beacons and trail following. The route-finder model accurately predicted movement patterns except those that were influenced by local and distal stimuli. These results show how certain stimuli influence movement and provide a guide for the incorporation of local and distal stimuli in a future version of the dynamic route-finder model. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={A single social defeat by a dominant conspecific induces long-term changes in several physiological and behavioral parameters in rats. These changes may represent an increased vulnerability to subsequent stress and stress-related pathology. Environmental factors, in particular possibilities for social interactions, could modulate these effects. Therefore, we assessed the influence of social environment on susceptibility for the long-term effects of social defeat. Socially housed males of an unselected strain of wild-type rats were equipped with radio-telemetry transmitters that recorded heart rate, temperature and activity. They were individually subjected to defeat and subsequently either housed alone or returned to their group. Behavioral and physiological responses to various novelty stressors were determined during a three-week period after the social defeat. Furthermore, changes in baseline behavior and physiology following defeat were studied in the rat's homecage. The results show a complex interaction between defeat and housing conditions. Depending on the parameters measured, effects were caused by both isolation alone, defeat alone or a combination of both defeat and isolation. Individual housing alone caused a characteristic hyperactive response to novelty stress. Though defeat did not affect behavioral responses, it amplified the physiological response to novelty and social housing did not attenuate this effect. However, social housing did reduce the effects of defeat on heart rate, temperature and activity in the home cage and completely prevented defeat-induced weight loss. Together these results indicate that social housing may indeed positively affect the animal's capacity to cope with stressors. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Structural neuroimaging techniques: • There is sufficient evidence of a relationship between eating disorders and altered brain structures. • Morphological brain alterations are most likely a consequence of endocrine and metabolic reactions to starvation, regardless of whether starvation leads to an underweight state ('pseudoatrophy'). • However, there are individual cases in whom the brain alterations continue to exist. • Improvement in MRI technique will shed more light on the regional distribution of structural brain abnormalities. Functional neuroimaging techniques: • The functional abnormalities may be partly secondary to weight loss but may also reflect underlying primary brain dysfunction. • Cognitive activation and symptom provocation paradigms might elucidate typical brain activation patterns in eating disorder patients. • Re-assessment should be performed upon recovery to determine if the structural and functional abnormalities are strictly secondary to the abnormal eating behavior or related to underlying traits. • The enormously rapid development of new technology in structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will allow more precise observation of the brain. Serotonin activity: • Disturbances of brain serotonin activity have been described in patients with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. • Whether abnormalities are a consequence or a potential antecedent of pathological eating behavior remains a major question. • There are distinct differences in serotonin activity between recovered and ill patients with anorexia or bulimia nervosa (challenge tests, CSF 5-HIAA). • It cannot be ruled out that subjects at risk of an eating disorder might have trait abnormalities in the regulation of brain serotonin function that might make them vulnerable to abnormal eating behavior (as a way to 'treat' abnormal serotonin activity) or to dietinginduced decreases in plasma tryptophan. • In addition, a disturbance of serotonin activity may also explain associated psychopathological features (e.g. obsessionality, depression) that are common to both anorexia and bulimia nervosa. Other neurochemicals: • Altered regulation in several neurotransmitter systems (e.g. dopamine) may contribute to the disorder. © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Foraging behavior often reflects food availability in predictable ways. For example, in habitats where food availability is high, predators should attack prey more often and move more slowly than in habitats where food availability is low. To assess relative food availability and habitat quality, I studied the foraging behavior of breeding Prothonotary Warblers (Protonotaria citrea) in two forest habitat types, cypress-gum swamp forest and coastal-plain levee forest. I quantified foraging behavior with focal animal sampling and continuous recording during foraging bouts. I measured two aspects of foraging behavior: 1) prey attack rate (attacks per minute), using four attack maneuvers (glean, sally, hover, strike), and 2) foraging speed (movements per minute), using three types of movement (hop, short flight [≤1 m], long flight [>1 m]). Warblers attacked prey more often in cypress-gum swamp forest than in coastal-plain levee forest. Foraging speed, however, was not different between habitats. I also measured foraging effort (% time spent foraging) and relative frequency of attack maneuvers employed in each habitat; neither of these variables was influenced by forest type. I conclude that Prothonotary Warblers encounter more prey when foraging in cypress-gum swamps than in coastal-plain levee forest, and that greater food availability results in higher density and greater reproductive success for birds breeding in cypress-gum swamp.},

abstract={Several empirical studies have demonstrated the existence of intraspecific variation in age and size at reproductive maturity for organisms experiencing different food environments and predation risk. For some species, these changes have been shown to arise primarily through changes in foraging activity. Theoretically, changes in age and size at maturity can arise through either behavioural or physiological responses. Here we analyse two models. The first is a conventional life-history model with no explicit recognition of the physiology of energy utilization by the organism - growth (i.e. weight gain) is simply the difference between assimilation and respiration, and there are no physiological restrictions on the timing of maturation. The changes in age and size at maturity in response to food availability and predation risk predicted by this model are consistent with published experimental data for one particular species, the midge Chironomus tentans. Numerical calculations with parameters appropriate to this species suggest that the optimal response is purely behavioural. The second model is a general, dynamic energy budget model that takes account of the energetic costs associated with development to reproductive maturity. With that model, we prove that the optimum partitioning of energy between growth and development is independent of predation risk and food availability, thereby demonstrating the generality of the previous finding with the life-history model. On the basis of the combined insight from the two models, we propose that fixed allocation to growth and development, despite variation in food availability and predation risk, is optimal for a broad class of life histories. Consequently, the absence of an allocation response to experimental manipulation of food or predators should not necessarily be taken as evidence for physiological or other constraints on life-history adaptation. © 2005 Erik G.

abstract={Individual animals from the same population, sex, age and reproductive status often respond differently and consistently to predators. One important dimension of this behavioural variation is the shy-bold continuum. Innate differences in boldness might explain why individuals differ in their antipredator behaviour. In a laboratory experiment, we examined the sources of individual variation in antipredator behaviour of adult male lizards Lacerta monticola. We simulated in the laboratory repeated predatory attacks of low or high risk and analysed activity levels and refuge use in both situations. Multivariate analyses suggested the existence of two consistent and independent shy-bold continua. The first described a gradient from bold lizards that spent shorter times in the refuge after predatory approaches to shy lizards with longer emergence times, whereas the other described a gradient from bold lizards with a low propensity to hide when the predator was close but risk was low to shy lizards that hid more often. We analysed whether morphological characteristics, body condition and health (estimated from their T cell immunocompetence) of individuals might account for the differences observed. Bold individuals had smaller absolute body size, but relatively larger heads, better body condition and better health. Bold individuals with a low propensity to hide when risk was low had larger absolute body sizes, whereas relative head size, and body condition and health were not important. We suggest that the position of an individual in the shy-bold continua might reflect its optimal antipredator behaviour, which would be a function of its health, general quality and ability to evade predators. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={Sexual cannibalism may influence expression of elaborate male traits by either reinforcing or opposing sexual selection. Male Schizocosa ocreata (Hentz) wolf spiders (Lycosidae) have tufts of bristles on the first pair of legs that may function as a condition-indicating signal trait. We paired virgin and previously mated adult females with males under seminatural conditions (laboratory containers with leaf litter). For males encountering virgin females, probability of attempted premating cannibalism varied with male size, body condition, tuft size, fluctuating asymmetry of tufts (FA) and female size (larger females attacked smaller males and males in poor condition with smaller, more asymmetrical tufts). Probability of successful cannibalism varied with the relative size of both sexes and female body condition, but not male tuft size (smaller males were cannibalized by larger females in better condition). Males with larger tufts (relative to body size) were more likely to mate, but no other traits (male or female) were associated with mating success. Postmating cannibalism risk was associated with female size and age, and male size, body condition and tuft size (larger, older females cannibalized smaller males in poor condition with smaller tufts). For males paired with previously mated females, probability of cannibalism was influenced by size of both sexes and male tuft size (larger females cannibalized smaller males with smaller tufts). While no morphological characteristics (male or female) influenced the probability of second matings, recently matured females were more likely to mate twice. Results suggest that both mate choice and sexual cannibalism can impose reinforcing directional selection on male size and secondary sexual characters. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={Aims: Recent studies suggest that cannabinoid receptor agonists may promote relapse to drug-seeking behaviour after a period of abstinence. In this study, the ability of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to reinstate previously reinforced responding for alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages was assessed in rats using a novel lick-based paradigm. Methods: Rats were initially given free access to beer (containing 4.5% ethanol v/v), near-beer (a beverage that looks and tastes like beer but contains &lt;0.5% ethanol v/v) or isocaloric sucrose in their home cages for 3 weeks. They were then trained to lick at a tube to self-administer the pre-exposed beverage in operant chambers under a VR10 schedule in 30-min sessions daily. After ∼3 weeks of such access, the rats underwent an extinction procedure, so that licking at the tube produced no reward. Once responding had ceased, the rats were subjected to various reinstatement tests. Results: In Experiment 1, the cannabinoid receptor agonist Δ9-THC (1 mg/kg) significantly reinstated responding, previously reinforced with beer or near-beer. The effect was unlikely to be caused by increased appetite because 24 h food-deprivation had no such effect. Exposure to cat odour in the test chamber failed to reinstate responding for beer or near-beer and caused a complete inhibition of responding. In Experiment 2,Δ9-THC (0.3 and 1 but not 3 mg/kg) again reinstated beer-seeking behaviour while the 1 mg/kg dose also reinstated responding in sucrose trained animals. Midazolam (0.15 mg/kg but not 0.5 or 1.5 mg/kg) produced a modest reinstatement of beer-seeking but had no effect on sucrose-seeking behaviour. Conclusions: The finding that Δ9-THC can reinstate alcohol-seeking provides the impetus for further research into the involvement of the cannabinoid system in alcohol craving. However, the reinstatement of near-beer and sucrose-seeking behaviour caused by Δ9-THC suggests a relatively non-specific effect. This may perhaps be related to the stressor-like effects of cannabinoids, and their ability to activate key neural circuitry in the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. © Medical Council on Alcohol 2005; all rights reserved.},

abstract={Every year, about three million farm-reared red-legged partridges are released in Spain for hunting purposes, most of them for restocking where the success is very low. Some factors such as the sudden shift from abundant commercial energy-rich diet to natural food and absence of experience at looking for natural food resources could cause a rapid physical deterioration, being more vulnerable to predation and disease. To determine fasting capacity in red-legged partridges, we fasted 32 birds during 4 days and then we refed them, collecting blood samples and body masses during the experiment. Red-legged partridges entered in the third critic phase of fasting, in which body proteins became the main energetic source, after 48 h of fasting. The fasting period caused an average loss of 17% of their initial body mass and only attained a 93.6% of their initial body mass after 24 days of refeeding. The limited capacity to resist fasting in the red-legged partridge could be one of the reasons for the low success in restocking, mainly in those where neither supplementary feeding nor acclimation period is allowed for birds before they are finally released. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={In theory, for any communication system, receivers cannot increase their responsiveness to signals without simultaneously increasing their risk of responding to inappropriate stimuli. This inevitable trade-off may be an important selective pressure on signalling systems, but has rarely been studied. Nestling tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor, produce a begging display when their parents arrive at the nest with food, but they also beg to apparently inappropriate stimuli in the absence of parents, such as movements of the nest or broodmates. To explore the implications of these errors for begging, we experimentally determined how begging errors vary with nestling hunger and age, two factors that affect begging rate and intensity in response to parents. Specifically, we examined how begging rate and intensity varied in response to recordings of (1) a tree swallow adult landing on a nestbox and calling and (2) a common grackle, Quiscalis quiscala, a nest predator, landing on a nestbox, during a 1-h period of food deprivation and also across two ages (5-6 and 7-9 days posthatch). Nestlings increased the rate and intensity of their begging responses to both swallow and grackle stimulus sounds as time without food increased, although responses to the grackle sounds were always less than to the swallow sounds. Begging rate, but not intensity, increased with age for both swallow and grackle sounds; both measures of response were lower for the grackle sound at both ages. Thus, as nestlings become more responsive to parents, they also risk committing more errors. This trade-off supports theoretical predictions and may be an important selective force shaping parent-offspring signalling. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={Many carnivorous arthropods can use chemical information from plants to locate their herbivorous prey. The composition of blends of herbivore-induced plant volatiles can vary with plant and herbivore species and thus carnivores are confronted with variable information about the presence of their prey. Such environmental variation is expected to favour learning. We investigated the learning ability of the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis, a specialized natural enemy of polyphagous spider mites. We reared mites on different plant species, and subsequently tested their preference for volatiles from lima bean plants infested with either the prey herbivore Tetranychus urticae or the nonprey caterpillar Spodoptera exigua in a Y-tube olfactometer. Predators reared on lima bean preferred the volatiles induced by T. urticae, whereas predators reared on cucumber did not. We also investigated the foraging behaviour of mites after a nonrewarding experience during the adult phase (i.e. food deprivation in the presence of S. exigua-induced volatiles from lima bean) or after a rewarding experience (i.e. feeding in the presence of T. urticae-induced volatiles). The rewarding experience had a much larger impact on the foraging responses. Predatory mites with multiple experiences (i.e. a nonrewarding experience followed by a rewarding experience) had the strongest preference for T. urticae-induced versus S. exigua-induced volatiles. We conclude that these learning abilities enable the predatory mites to forage in an environment where their prey can feed on a different plant species than the one on which the predator developed, and where nonprey caterpillars are also present. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={Tasks requiring visual discrimination are commonly used in assessment of canine cognitive function. However, little is known about canine visual processing, and virtually nothing is known about the effects of age on canine visual function. This study describes a novel behavioural method developed to assess one aspect of canine visual function, namely contrast sensitivity. Four age groups (young, middle aged, old, and senior) were studied. We also included a group of middle aged to old animals that had been maintained for at least 4 years on a specially formulated food containing a broad spectrum of antioxidants and mitochondrial cofactors. Performance of this group was compared with a group in the same age range maintained on a control diet. In the first phase, all animals were trained to discriminate between two high contrast shapes. In the second phase, contrast was progressively reduced by increasing the luminance of the shapes. Performance decreased as a function of age, but the differences did not achieve statistical significance, possibly because of a small sample size in the young group. All age groups were able to acquire the initial discrimination, although the two older age groups showed slower learning. Errors increased with decreasing contrast with the maximal number of errors for the 1% contrast shape. Also, all animals on the antioxidant diet learned the task and had significantly fewer errors at the high contrast compared with the animals on the control diet. The initial results suggest that contrast sensitivity deteriorates with age in the canine while form perception is largely unaffected by age. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We examined the behavioural ecology of mothers and calves during the first year of life to identify variables predicting calf mortality among bottlenose dolphins. Specifically, we investigated whether the primary cause of calf mortality was poor calf condition or shark predation. Seventy-five per cent of calves that died (N = 12) showed visible signs of poor health compared with 4.7% of the survivors (N = 21). Calves that spent more time swimming in infant position (in contact under the mother) in the first year of life were more likely to die by 3 years of age than calves that spent less time swimming in infant position. No other behavioural or ecological measures tested were associated with calf mortality. We suggest that the mother and/or calf may compensate for poor calf health by increasing the time spent in contact with the mother. In contrast, frequent mother-calf separation and high rates of calf socializing and foraging are proposed to be indicators of vigour. Although most of our results do not support the predation hypothesis, mothers altered one behaviour in relation to predation risk. Mothers rested less in deep water during the warm months, where and when predation risk was high, than during the cool months, when predation risk was low, suggesting that predation risk influenced maternal vigilance. However, calf mortality was not higher in warm months than in cool months. Our results suggest that poor calf condition, not predation, is the primary cause of calf mortality. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behavior. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={For many animals, selecting whether to forage during day or night is a critical fitness problem: at night, predation risks are lower but feeding is less efficient. Habitat selection is a closely related problem: the best location for nocturnal foraging could be too risky during daytime, and habitat that is safe and profitable in daytime may be unprofitable at night. We pose a theory that assumes animals select the combination of daytime and night activity (feeding vs. hiding), and habitat, that maximizes expected future fitness. Expected fitness is approximated as the predicted probability of surviving starvation and predation over a future time horizon, multiplied by a function representing the fitness benefits of growth. The theory's usefulness and generality were tested using pattern-oriented analysis of an individual-based model (IBM) of stream salmonids and the extensive literature on observed diel behavior patterns of these animals. Simulation experiments showed that the IBM reproduces eight diverse patterns observed in real populations. (1) Diel activity (whether foraging occurs during day and/or night) varies among a population's individuals, and from day to day for each individual. (2) Salmonids feed in shallower and slower water at night. (3) Individuals pack more tightly into the best habitat when feeding at night. (4) Salmonids feed relatively more at night if temperatures (and, therefore, metabolic demands) are low. (5) Daytime feeding is more common for life stages in which potential fitness increases more rapidly with growth. (6) Competition for feeding or hiding sites can shift foraging between day and night. (7) Daytime feeding is more common when food availability is low. (8) Diel activity patterns are affected by the availability of good habitat for feeding or hiding. We can explain many patterns of variation in diel foraging behavior without assuming that populations or individuals vary in how inherently nocturnal or diurnal they are. Instead, these patterns can emerge from the search by individuals for good trade-offs between growth and survival under different habitat and competitive conditions. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Nociception was studied in male mice, mostly of the C57BL/6 strain, during continuous or prolonged restriction of caloric intake (60% of ad-libitum) from midlife to senescence (up to 105 weeks). Restricted mice showed fewer licking or biting responses 20-60 min after hind paw injection of 5% formalin at 46 and 70 weeks, but not at 93 weeks. Also, they showed longer response latencies around 46 weeks of age in the 52°C hot-plate test, which partial tail amputation failed to affect, although it did produce at least 2 weeks of chronic neuropathic hypersensitivity in ad libitum controls. Injection of collagen subcutaneously at 36-42 weeks led to chronic hyperalgesia in the DBA/1 but not the C57BL/6 strain, measured weekly by the barely nociceptive 50°C hot-plate test to minimize damage. This collagen-induced arthritic hyperalgesia was then gradually and reversibly blocked during 9-15 weeks of caloric restriction starting at 53-58 weeks. In longitudinal trials on normal mice, performed every 2-4 weeks between 42 and 105 weeks with the 50°C hot-plate, caloric restriction led to altered latencies (higher relative to controls) only in the last 10-20 weeks, perhaps because it delayed the onset of age-related peripheral neuropathies. In conclusion, long-term caloric restriction leads to significant hypoalgesia in pre-senescent mice subjected to above-threshold pain of widely different durations, the effect disappearing at later ages unless spontaneous neuropathies become influential. A reduction in cumulative food intake thus appears to generate antinociceptive signals in adult male mice, perhaps serving specifically to promote riskier behavior during prolonged food shortages. © 2005 International Association for the Study of Pain.

abstract={Treatment for myasthenia gravis should be individualized to each patient based on the clinical characteristics of myasthenia including the distribution, duration, and severity of weakness and resulting functional impairment; the risks for treatment complications related to age, gender, and medical comorbidities; and the presence of thymoma. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors provide temporary, symptomatic treatment for all forms of myasthenia gravis. Immune modulators address the underlying autoimmune process in myasthenia gravis, but are associated with potential complications and side effects. Most patients with generalized myasthenia who have significant weakness beyond the ocular muscles and who remain symptomatic, despite treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors, are candidates for immune modulation. Although corticosteroids are effective for long-term immune modulation in myasthenia gravis, several more contemporary immunomodulators including azathioprine, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil have shown efficacy in myasthenia gravis and are used increasingly as first-line treatments and as steroid-sparing agents. Plasma exchange is used to achieve rapid improvement in patients with myasthenic crisis or exacerbation, to improve strength before a surgical procedure or thymectomy, and to minimize steroid-induced exacerbation in patients with oropharyngeal or respiratory muscle weakness. Intravenous immunoglobulin represents an alternative to plasma exchange in patients requiring relatively rapid short-term improvement in the setting of poor venous access. Because of a lack of controlled trials, the role of thymectomy in nonthymomatous myasthenia gravis is unclear, although evidence suggests that thymectomy increases the probability for myasthenic remission or improvement.

abstract={Many nestlings respond to alarm calls with anti-predator behavior, but their physiological responses to such calls are poorly understood. Alarm calls could stimulate increased secretion of corticosterone to mobilize energy reserves in anticipation of an interaction with a predator. However, elevated corticosterone levels can be costly to nestlings because they induce catabolic reactions at a time when the birds are engaged in anabolic processes. Thus, there may be constraints on the secretion of corticosterone if the catabolic costs outweigh the behavioral benefits. Furthermore, many studies use baseline corticosterone levels as a correlate of body condition, and if nestlings respond hormonally when they hear alarm calls rather than when they are first handled by (or catch sight of) an investigator, then determination of baseline hormone levels would be difficult. To investigate this phenomenon, we broadcast taped calls of either adult conspecific alarm calls or songs of heterospecifics to 15-20 d old American Kestrel (Falco sparverius) nestlings. Playbacks were started when adults were absent, but adults returned and produced alarm calls at two control and three experimental nests. Blood was collected from randomly selected nestlings at each nest 13 min after the onset of a playback and within 2 min of opening the nest box, and the plasma was assayed for corticosterone. There was no difference in corticosterone values between nestlings that heard alarm calls and those that heard control vocalizations. Hearing natural kestrel alarm calls did not affect the results, although our small sample sizes resulted in low power to detect differences. These data indicate that 15-20 d old kestrels do not increase corticosterone secretion in response to adult conspecific alarm calls, and suggest that studies of corticosterone secretion in nestling kestrels will not be affected by the occurrence of adult alarm-calling.},

abstract={Many grazing-management challenges stem from poor livestock distribution resulting in overuse of some areas and low utilization of others. Managing livestock-distribution patterns requires knowledge of pasture characteristics and animal behavior patterns. Behavioral patterns result from recognizable processes that include inherited attributes, individual and social learning systems, cue-consequence specificity, predispositions toward novel stimuli, and spatial memory. Through these behavioral mechanisms, animals form and revise preferences and aversions for specific locations in their foraging landscape. To accomplish habitat selection, domestic herbivores use sight and sound cues to seek and return to high-quality foraging locations. Nested within habitat selection are learned diet preferences and aversions by which ungulate herbivores associate taste with positive or negative postingestive feedback. The deliberate and careful modification of animal attributes and habitat characteristics could yield options for adaptive rangeland management. In this article, we describe the basic principles that underlie how animals make decisions about where to forage and how long to stay in a particular habitat. We also suggest management practices designed to modify animal behavior and alter habitat-use patterns.},

abstract={Many mobile predators use different foraging behaviours depending on whether prey are clumped or uniformly distributed in space. It is believed that predators can increase foraging efficiency on patchily distributed prey if they alternate intensive searching (slow speeds and frequent, acute turns) with extensive searching (high speeds and infrequent, shallow turns). We used Fourier transforms, fractal dimension analysis and traditional single-value measures of movement to determine which proximate cue caused these changes in behaviour: frequency of encounter or degree of satiation. Over a range of encounter rates and levels of hunger, we found that larval ladybird beetles showed intensive search behaviour for varying levels of encounter frequency, but did not alter their behaviour when hunger level was manipulated. We provide a conceptual model that explains why encounter frequency is more likely than hunger level to determine search behaviour. We discuss the relative merits of Fourier transforms in relation to fractal dimension and single-value measures. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Animals have the ability to alter development, physiology, growth, and behavior in response to different environmental conditions. These responses represent critical assessments of both external and internal factors. For example, the timing of metamorphosis, hatching, or birth depends on the trade-offs between growth opportunity and mortality risk in the developmental habitat. Physiological sensors compute these trade-offs as a function of energy balance and environmental stress, and effectors initiate physiological, developmental, and behavioral responses to these determinations. The neuroendocrine stress axis provides a means for animals to integrate information from multiple sources and to respond accordingly. Considerable evidence now supports the view that the secretion of hormones critical to development (corticosteroid and thyroid hormones) is controlled by a common neuroendocrine stress pathway involving corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and related peptides. CRF produced in the hypothalamus stimulates the biosynthesis and secretion of both thyroid and corticosteroid hormones, leading to accelerated tadpole metamorphosis. Similarly, in mammals CRF of fetal and placental origin has been shown to influence the timing of birth. Studies in several experimental animal models and in humans show that early life experience can have long-term phenotypic consequences. Furthermore, there is evidence that phenotypic expression is strongly influenced by the actions of stress hormones produced during development. The integrated neuroendocrine response to stress, and its role in timing critical life history transitions and establishing long-term phenotypic expression, arose early in the evolution of vertebrates. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Wintering birds face a trade-off between starvation and predation risk. In Eurasian woodcocks, Scolopax rusticola, habitat use may reflect this trade-off because meadows, where most birds spend the night, are characterized by a higher risk of predation and a higher biomass of food (earthworms) than the woods, used by day. We monitored activity of 34 woodcocks fitted with tiltswitch radiotags. Young birds were more active than adults, probably because they were less efficient at foraging. In general, nocturnal activity was inversely correlated with air temperature and with daylight foraging activity, suggesting some compensatory mechanism, modulated by thermoregulatory constraints. Individual activity patterns differed, and we classified woodcocks according to three main wintering strategies: 'always', 'sometimes' or 'never' visiting fields at night. The decision to fly to fields at night seemed to be taken every evening, according to the amount of daylight foraging activity in woods and the air temperature. After feeding in a rich patch of food on a mild day, woodcocks did not have to risk going to meadows. Conversely, in patches of fewer food resources or at lower temperatures or both, woodcocks could not meet all their energy requirements without going to fields at night (where there was always sufficient food) and eventually, changing their diurnal sites. Therefore, the trade-off between feeding and predation risk depends on how efficiently birds find a rich patch of food in the forest and exploit it optimally during the day. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

This association occurred independently of other potentially confounding variables, including age, sex, two indices of nutritional status, season, region, and year found. Total blubber PCB levels (as Aroclor 1254) were also calculated, enabling direct comparison with a proposed threshold for adverse health effects (including immunosuppression) in marine mammals of 17 mg/kg lipid. In porpoises with total PCB levels greater than 17 mg/kg lipid (n = 154), total PCB levels were significantly higher in the infectious disease group compared to the physical trauma group (p < 0.001). This association was no longer significant in porpoises with total PCB levels of less than 17 mg/kg lipid (n = 103; p > 0.55). These findings are consistent with a causal (immunotoxic) relationship between PCB exposure and infectious disease mortality, and they provide a framework for future quantitative risk-assessment analyses of porpoise populations of known size and PCB exposure.},

abstract={It has taken a staggering amount of time for the medical community to realize that new-borns are able to feel pain. The treatment of neonatal pain during procedures has become mandatory, not only for humanitarian reasons which could alone justify the soothing of pain in these infants but also because repeated and prolonged pain may have long-term consequences in neonates. Nonpharmacological interventions which comprise environmental and behavioral interventions have a wide applicability for neonatal pain management alone or in combination with pharmacological treatments. These interventions are not necessarily substitutes or alternatives for pharmacological interventions but are complimentary. Nonpharmacological interventions can reduce neonatal pain indirectly by reducing the total amount of noxious stimuli to which infants are exposed and directly, by blocking nociceptive transduction or transmission or activation of descending inhibitory pathways or by activating attention and arousal systems that modulate pain. This article describes prevention, environmental interventions, and behavioral strategies. Within the behavioral strategies, sweet solutions, especially sucrose and glucose, with or without non-nutritive sucking, skin to skin contact, and breastfeeding during procedures have been studied and their analgesic efficacy has been shown. A practical approach is described hereafter. Give 1-2 ml of oral sucrose or glucose 30% at 2 min before a minor painful procedures in term neonates or neonates weighing more than 2500 g. The analgesic efficacy of sucrose and glucose seems similar. For preterm neonates weighing less than 2500 g, give 0.5 ml of oral sucrose or glucose 30%, and for those weighing less than 1500 g, 0.3 ml of oral sucrose or glucose 30%. Since a synergistic effect has been shown for the association of sweet solutions and pacifiers, give a pacifier together with sweet solutions. For term neonates that are breastfed, consider breastfeeding during procedures. These nonpharmacological interventions are suitable for minor procedures. They should not constitute the sole analgesic when performing more invasive procedures. © 2004 Elsevier SAS. Tous droits réservés.},

abstract={The inclusion of physical activity in behavioral weight control programs may enhance long-term weight loss significantly. Moreover, physical activity may have independent effects on risk factors that impact morbidity and mortality rates of overweight and obese individuals. Therefore, it is important that overweight individuals engage in at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity to promote health. It may be necessary for daily activity to reach 45 to 90 minutes per day to enhance weight loss outcomes, however. To achieve these higher levels of physical activity, it may be necessary to include numerous behavioral strategies, including intermittent activity, lifestyle activity, and pedometer-based interventions to complement traditional forms of structured physical activity. This may improve the adoption and maintenance of physical activity and, thus, contribute to the effective management of body weight.},

abstract={Objective: We evaluated the behavior of serum albumin concentrations in response to metabolic stress that is associated with cardiac surgery and the role of this protein as a predictor of clinical outcome in children at high surgical risk who undergo operative correction of congenital heart defects. Methods: Serum albumin concentrations were measured in 30 children who had heart disease and were at high surgical risk. Analyses were performed before surgery, on the second postoperative day, and on discharge from the intensive care unit. Preoperative serum concentrations of albumin were compared with those of a control group that consisted of 20 healthy and well-nourished children. Results: Preoperative albumin concentrations of patients were lower than those of the control group (3.4 ± 0.25 g/dL versus 4.0 ± 0.18 g/dL, P < 0.05). Serum levels decreased on the second postoperative day and at discharge from the intensive care unit (3.1 ± 0.65 g/dL and 3.2 ± 0.44 g/dL, P < 0.05) compared with preoperative concentrations. Preoperative concentrations lower than 3.0 g/dL were associated with increased postsurgical infection (P = 0.0026) and with increased mortality (P = 0.0138). Patients whose postoperative levels were lower than 3.0 g/dL had longer hospital stays compared with those whose concentrations were higher than 3.0 g/dL (14.5 ± 1.3 d versus 10 ± 2.2 d, P < 0.05). Conclusion: The results suggest that hypoalbuminemia is common among children who have heart disease and are at high surgical risk, and serum albumin concentrations lower than 3 g/dL may be related to outcome in the period after cardiac surgery. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Lack of physical activity and overweight status continues to be a significant health problem in the United States. To assess the actual prevalence of these problems, we reviewed data from the School-based Health Promotion Centers in one middle school, and one High school in central Kentucky. A total of 232 6th graders and 607 9th graders were included. A total of 92% of 6th graders and 45% of 9th graders reported complete lack of regular exercise. 37% of 9th graders and 59% of 6th graders had inappropriate nutrition, 47% of 9th graders and 33% of 6th graders had Body Mass Index over the 85th percentile for age. Among overweight adolescents, only 16% of 9th graders and 1% of 6th graders thought they were overweight. Since the body mass index data is derived from actual objective measurement, we conclude that overweight status is a significant problem in Kentucky and that the actual numbers may be higher than those reported for the State based on surveys and estimates. Furthermore, many adolescents are not aware of their weight problem and most of them do not participate in regular exercise. © Freund Publishing House Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Although there have been numerous reports in personality of mood disorders, there have been few reports in regard with personality of winter seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Furthermore, no reports have been published concerning summer SAD personality characteristics. Thus, this study was conducted to assess the personality of winter and summer SAD using Tri-dimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) that have been used in a variety of mental disorders. Methods: A total of 6135 Japanese were evaluated with TPQ, the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ) and the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS). Winter, summer and non-SAD groups were classified by SPAQ. We compared the difference of personality trait among these three groups in consideration of gender, age and SDS score influence. Results: Winter SAD demonstrated higher "Novelty Seeking" and "Harm Avoidance"; summer SAD showed higher "Harm Avoidance" than the non-SAD group. "Harm Avoidance" in both SAD groups was re-analyzed using SDS score as a covariate, and "Novelty Seeking" in winter SAD using age as a covariate. As a result, the significance of high "Novelty Seeking" and high "Harm Avoidance" in winter SAD was excluded. However, "Harm Avoidance" remained the significant difference between summer and non-SAD. Limitation: SAD was diagnosed only by SPAQ and not by interview. The state-dependency of "Harm Avoidance" was not confirmed in identical patients over lapse of time. Conclusion: Patients with winter SAD have high "Harm Avoidance" dependent on the depressive state that is in accordance with non-seasonal depression. Patients with summer SAD have high "Harm Avoidance" possibly independent from the depressive state. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The interaction of the genetic program with the environment shapes the development of an individual. Accumulating data from animal models indicate that prenatal and early-postnatal events (collectively called "early-life events") can initiate long-term changes in the expression of the genetic program which persist, or may only become apparent, much later in the individual's life. Researchers working with humans or animal models of human diseases often view the effects of early-life events through the lens of pathology, with a focus on whether the events increase the risk for a particular disease. Alternatively, comparative biologists often view the effects of early-life events through the lens of evolution and adaptation by natural selection; they investigate the processes by which environmental conditions present early in life may prompt the adoption of different developmental pathways leading to alternative life histories. Examples of both approaches are presented in this article. This article reviews the concepts of phenotypic plasticity, natural selection, and evidence from animal models that early-life events can program the activity of the neuroendocrine system, at times altering life history patterns in an adaptive manner. Data from seasonally breeding rodents are used to illustrate the use of maternally derived information to alter the life history of young. In several species, the maternal system transfers photoperiodic information to the young in utero. This maternally derived information alters the response of young to photoperiods encountered later and life, producing seasonally distinct life histories. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Evidence that fetal nutrition triggers permanent adjustments in a wide range of systems and health outcomes is stimulating interest in the evolutionary significance of these responses. This review evaluates the postnatal adaptive significance of fetal developmental plasticity from the perspective of life history theory and evolutionary models of energy partitioning. Birthweight is positively related to multiple metabolically costly postnatal functions, suggesting that the fetus has the capacity to distribute the burden of energy insufficiency when faced with a nutritionally challenging environment. Lowering total requirements may reduce the risk of negative energy balance, which disproportionately impacts functions that are not essential for survival but that are crucial for reproductive success. The long-term benefit of these metabolic adjustments is contingent upon the fetus having access to a cue that is predictive of its future nutritional environment, a problem complicated in a long-lived species by short-term ecologic fluctuations like seasonality. Evidence is reviewed suggesting that the flow of nutrients reaching the fetus provides an integrated signal of nutrition as experienced by recent matrilineal ancestors, which effectively limits the responsiveness to short-term ecologic fluctuations during any given pregnancy. This capacity for fetal nutrition to minimize the growth response to transient ecologic fluctuations is defined here as intergenerational "phenotypic inertia," and is hypothesized to allow the fetus to cut through the "noise" of seasonal or other stochastic influences to read the "signal" of longer-term ecologic trends. As a mode of adaptation, phenotypic inertia may help the organism cope with ecologic trends too gradual to be tracked by conventional developmental plasticity, but too rapid to be tracked by natural selection. From an applied perspective, if a trait like fetal growth is designed to minimize the effects of short-term fluctuations by integrating information across generations, public health interventions may be most effective if focused not on the individual but on the matriline. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Bird nestlings may be at risk not only from starvation but also from predators attracted to the nest by parental feeding visits. Hence, parents could trade reduced visitation rates for a lower predation risk. Here, through field data and an experiment, we show plasticity in daily patterns of nest visitation in the Siberian jay. Perisoreus infaustus, in response to predator activity. In high-risk territories, jay parents avoided going to the nest at certain times of the day and compensated by allocating more feeding effort to periods when predators were less active. Such modifications in provisioning routines allowed parents in high-risk habitat to significantly lower the risk of providing visitation cues to visually oriented corvid nest predators. These results indicate that some birds modify their daily nest visitation patterns as a fourth mechanism to reduce predator-attracting nest visits in addition to the clutch size reduction, maximization of food load-sizes, and prevention of allofeeding suggested by Skutch.},

abstract={Adults' disorders of the feeding behaviour encompass anorexia, bulimia nervosa, and various atypical forms of nutritional disorders. Following a clinical review of anorexia and bulimia, the authors describe the so-called binge eating disorder in which the nutritional behaviour is assessed by the number of days of overfeeding rather than by the number of crises per week, over a period lasting 6 months at least. This disorder is 2-to 3-fold more frequent than bulimia nervosa. The night eating syndrome often induces obesity. Potomania, merycism, and pica are also described. Establishing the prognosis is always difficult. Published studies show important variations. Therapeutic follow-up studies show frequent relapses during the first year following a hospitalization. Poor prognosis corresponds to a long pre-treatment duration of the disorder and to a persistent anorexic behaviour. Epidemiologic data confirm the seriousness of such disorders, with a significant mortality rate associated to prolonged disease. The authors analyze the aetiopathogenesis of these disorders and their relationships with other psychiatric affections (depressive disorders, anxiety, personality disorders); addictions; biological perturbations; genetic factors; and the social and educational context. The cognitive-behavioural model and the psychodynamic theories are presented. The authors recommend approaching the ambivalence inherent in nutritional disorders by a series of specific interviews and a special attention to the singularity of each case and to the risk of negative reinforcement related to the measures of strict isolation. The family should be integrated in the therapeutic program. Resuscitation measures must be adapted. Precise and relevant criteria for hospitalization are presented, a definition of the therapeutic goals is recommended, together with the establishment of a care contract, and dietary and behavioural measures aimed at modifying both the relationships of the patient with feeding and weight gain. Group therapies are emphasized. © 2005 Publié par Elsevier SAS.},

abstract={Food preferences were investigated in cuttlefish during the first 3 months' posthatching, using choice tests between crabs, shrimps, and young fish. The results showed that without previous feeding experience, cuttlefish preferred shrimps on Day 3. This suggests an innate food preference; however, it was possible to induce a preference for an originally nonpreferred prey item in 3-day-old and naïve cuttlefish, demonstrating the flexibility of this initial behavioral preference in response to previous individual experience. This preference suggests a learning process involving a form of long-term memory, demonstrated for the first time in juvenile cuttlefish. Until Day 30, juvenile cuttlefish fed exclusively shrimps chose shrimps. This preference probably depends on their previous feeding experience. Finally, it appears that from Day 60, cuttlefish reared on the same restricted diet have a tendency to switch their preference to novel prey items, which diversify their diet. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Many animals gain benefits from living in groups, such as a dilution in predation risk when they are closely aggregated (referred to as the 'selfish herd'). Game theory has been used to predict many properties of groups (such as the expected group size), but little is known about the proximate mechanisms by which animals achieve these predicted properties. We explore a possible proximate mechanism using a spatially explicit, individual-based model, where individuals can choose to rest or forage on the basis of a rule-of-thumb that is dependent upon both their energetic reserves and the presence and actions of neighbours. The resulting behaviour and energetic reserves of individuals, and the resulting group sizes, are shown to be affected both by the ability of the forager to detect conspecifics and areas of the environment suitable for foraging, and by the distribution of energy in the environment. The model also demonstrates that if animals are able to choose (based upon their energetic reserves) between selecting the best foraging sites available and moving towards their neighbours for safety, then this also has significant effects upon individuals and group sizes. The implications of the proposed rule-of-thumb are discussed. © 2004 The Royal Society.},

abstract={The never-ending tension between finding food and avoiding predators may be the most universal natural stressor wild animals experience. The 'chronic stress' hypothesis predicts: (i) an animal's stress profile will be a simultaneous function of food and predator pressures given the aforesaid tension; and (ii) these inseparable effects on physiology will produce inseparable effects on demography because of the resulting adverse health effects. This hypothesis was originally proposed to explain synergistic (inseparable) food and predator effects on demography in snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus). We conducted a 2 × 2, manipulative food addition plus natural predator reduction experiment on song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) that was, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate comparable synergistic effects in a bird: added food and lower predator pressure in combination produced an increase in annual reproductive success almost double that expected from an additive model. Here we report the predicted simultaneous food and predator effects on measures of chronic stress in the context of the same experiment: birds at unfed, high predator pressure (HPP) sites had the highest stress levels; those at either unfed or HPP sites showed intermediate levels; and fed birds at low predator pressure sites had the lowest stress levels. © 2004 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Animals often use alternative strategies when they compete for resources, but it is unclear in most cases what factors determine the actual tactic followed by individuals. Although recent models suggest that the internal state of animals may be particularly important in tactic choice, the effects of state variables on the use of alternative behavioural forms have rarely been demonstrated. In this study, using experimental wind exposure to increase overnight energy expenditure, we show that flock-feeding house sparrows (Passer domesticus) with lowered energy reserves increase their use of scrounging (exploiting others' food findings) during their first feed of the day. This result is in accordance with the prediction of a state-dependent model of use of social foraging tactics. We also show that scrounging provides less variable feeding rates and patch finding times than the alternative tactic. These latter results support the theoretical assumption that scrounging is a risk-averse tactic, i.e. it reduces the risk of immediate starvation. As the level of energy reserves predicts the use of social foraging tactics, we propose that selection should favour individuals that monitor the internal state of flock mates and use this information to adjust their own tactic choice. © 2004 The Royal Society.},

abstract={We describe the social organization, mating system, and social structure of a group of hybrid baboons (Papio anubis x P. hamadryas) in Ethiopia's Awash National Park. The group contained elements of both hamadryas and anubis societies. Overall, the group was a multimale, multifemale group that lacked cohesion and frequently formed subgroups. Subgroup formation was more strongly associated with predation risk than food availability. Although there were several hamadryas-like one-male units OMUs within the group, there was no evidence of a hamadryas multilevel society. Male and female members of OMUs were phenotypically more hamadryas-like than non-OMU individuals. The group contained substantial variation in the strength of inter- and intrasexual bonds: some females primarily groomed males while other females primarily groomed females, and the patterns were consistent with the OMU substructure. Despite some promiscuous mating, mating was biased towards the hamadryas condition for all group members. Additionally, rates of immigration and emigration were very low, and mean pairwise relatedness within the group is rising. For measures of intersexual bonding, all members of the group were intermediate between anubis and hamadryas individuals in less hybridized groups. The group was phenotypically and behaviorally more intermediate than it was in the 1970s (Sugawara, K. (1988). Primates 29: 429-448.) and the changes may indicate a relatively young and dynamic hybrid zone.},

abstract={Exercise provides a means of increasing energy expenditure and may help adjust energy balance for weight loss and maintenance. At least 30 minutes a day of moderate intensity aerobic exercise per day is recommended for weight loss and maintenance but greater amounts appear to increase the magnitude of weight loss and maintenance. Resistance training has recently been shown to have positive effects on body composition but does not typically show significant decreases in weight. Regardless of weight loss, both aerobic exercise and resistance training have been shown to diminish risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Since exercise is only effective if sustained, behavioural strategies such as self-monitoring, goal setting, social support, etc. are used to help individuals start and maintain exercise programs and show improved results compared to exercise programs without behavioural strategies. The available evidence indicates that exercise is an important component of weight loss and perhaps the best predictor of weight maintenance. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We conducted an exploratory investigation in an area where nut-cracking by wild capuchin monkeys is common knowledge among local residents. In addition to observing male and female capuchin monkeys using stones to pound open nuts on stone "anvils," we surveyed the surrounding area and found physical evidence that monkeys cracked nuts on rock outcrops, boulders, and logs (collectively termed anvils). Anvils, which were identified by numerous shallow depressions on the upper surface, the presence of palm shells and debris, and the presence of loose stones of an appropriate size to pound nuts, were present even on the tops of mesas. The stones used to crack nuts can weigh > 1 kg, and are remarkably heavy for monkeys that weigh <4 kg. The abundance of shell remains and depressions in the anvil surface at numerous anvil sites indicate that nut-cracking activity is common and long-enduring. Many of the stones found on anvils (presumably used to pound nuts) are river pebbles that are not present in the local area we surveyed (except on or near the anvils); therefore, we surmise that they were transported to the anvil sites. Ecologically and behaviorally, nut-cracking by capuchins appears to have strong parallels to nut-cracking by wild chimpanzees. The presence of abundant anvil sites, limited alternative food resources, abundance of palms, and the habit of the palms in this region to produce fruit at ground level all likely contribute to the monkeys' routine exploitation of palm nuts via cracking them with stones. This discovery provides a new reference point for discussions regarding the evolution of tool use and material culture in primates. Routine tool use to exploit keystone food resources is not restricted to living great apes and ancestral hominids. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Objective. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) selected from Wistar Kyoto (WKY) strain represent an animal model of human essential hypertension. This strain of rats is known by excessive neuroendocrine and cardiovascular responses under stress. The aim of the present study was: 1. To compare the reactivity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (HPA) to acute mild stress of handling between SHR and WKY rats, 2. to compare the behavioral activity of both strains under basal conditions and during chronic unpredictable emotional stress. Methods. Seven to eight weeks old male SHR and WKY rats bred in the Physiological Institute, Academy of Sciences of he Czech Republic (Prague) were used. Acute stress was induced by 2-minute handling of the animals in their cage. Blood plasma was analyzed for ACTH and corticosterone (CORT) by specific radioimmunoassay. Chronic unpredictable stress lasted 20 days and consisted of random exposures to following interventions: Light on or off for 24 h, overcrowding i.e. pooling the rats from two cages into one (size 24 x 39 x 23 cm) for 24 h, isolation by placing a single rat into one cage for 24 h, new hierarchy by mixing 4 rats from two different cages for 24 h, limited access to food or water for 1 hour in one day between 3 and 6 p.m., inescapable foot shock (20 shocks, duration 5 s, intensity 10 mA, intershock interval 30 s), tilting the cages for 24 h. The sequence of individual stress exposures was the same in all rats. On day 6, 10 and 20, behavioral activity was measured using the elevated plus-maze in non-stressed control and stressed rats. The results were evaluated by non parametrical Kruskal -Wallis test followed by Man-Whitney U- test. Results. The two-minute handling resulted in a significantly higher activation of HPA in the SHR than in the WKY rats (plasma ACTH: 350±65 pg/ml for SHR vs. 97±17 pg/ml for WKY p<0.01; plasma corticosterone: 2.8±1.4 mg/100ml for SHR vs. 0.7±0.06 mg/100ml for WKY p<0.05). In WKY rats no activation of HPA was observed. Elevated plus-maze anxiety test showed inverse behavioral pattern between SHR and WKY rats. In the first test of anxiety the number of open arm entries (OAE) as well as total mobility expressed as total arm entries of the SHR was lower than of the WKY rats (p<0.01) without any difference between stressed and non-stressed animals in either strain. It was gradually increasing in stressed and non-stressed SHR in subsequent sessions markedly exceeding the activity of WKY rats (p<0.01). Stressed WKY rats showed less OAE and total mobility than their controls (p<0.01). Conclusions. Our results show enhanced neuroendocrine response to acute handling and enhanced anxiety in acute novelty stress in SHR comparing to WKY rats which suggests a common mechanisms for neuroendocrine and behavioral changes. These results further underline the lack of anxiety related behavior of SHR under chronic emotional stress.},

abstract={The origin of primates has had a long history of discussion and debate, with few ever considering the impact of the original body weight on subsequent primate adaptive radiations. Here, I attempt to reconstruct early primate evolution by considering the initial size of primates as well as the critical functional-adaptive events that had to occur prior to the early Eocene. Microcebus is often viewed as a living model, and thus 40-65 g might represent a practical ancestral weight for the origin of primates. I consider a smaller original body weight, likely 10-15 g in actual size, and I address the biological implications for shrew-sized primates by comparing the behavioral ecology of mouse lemurs, our smallest living primates, to another tiny-sized mammalian group, the shrews (Family Soricidae). Several behavioral and ecological characteristics are shared by shrews and mouse lemurs, and several mammalian trends are evident with decreased size. I suggest that a shrew-sized ancestral primate would have had high metabolic, reproductive, and predation rates, relatively low population densities, and a dispersed and solitary existence with a promiscuous mating system. Although small mammals like shrews provide insights concerning the ancestral size of primates, primate origins have always been tied to arboreality. I assess other potential arboreal models such as Ptilocercus and Caluromys. By combining all of this information, I try to sequence the events in a functional-adaptive series that had to occur before the early Eocene primate radiations. I suggest that all of these important adaptive events had to occur at a small body size below 50 g. (c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Social learning as one of the key concepts of cognitive ecology includes different forms of behavioural displays from relatively simple, such as "social release" and "stimulus enhancement" up to "teaching" and "cultural transmission" in animal communities. Rapid development of this fiels resulted in some contradictions in methods and terminology. In this review different forms and levels of social learning are analyzed. Ecological aspects of social learning are connected with diet shaping, fear of predators and mate choice. The first aspect is the most studied but still discussible. Social learning being an intricate component of feeding behaviour matches with innate behaviour, imprinting as well as early associative learning. Investigation of cognitive aspects of social learning going back to Thorndike's crucial question "Do apes ape?" are now developing into series of questions uncluding even: "Do ants ape?". Elaboration of universal methods of comparative studying of social learning such as "artificial fruit" and "two ways / one outcome" has essentially enlightened these questions and made comparative analysis possible. Large continuum of displays of cognitive skills in social learning has been revealed in non-primate species. One of the disctussible issues in the role of social learning is distribution of innovations. Many authors have investigated this intriguing aspect of animal behaviour in different ways, such as long field observations as well as laboratory experiments based on "artificial innovators" that is specimens specially taught by experimentalists. Many impressive results were obtained; in particular it turned out in contradiction with some mathematical models that individuals in groups are rather different in their psychophysiological predisposition to innovative behaviour. Role of teaching in such different forms of behaviour as shaping of species-specific behavioural patterns and spread of innovations is considered. Although the majority of aminals in wild populations are not good teachers and pupils, some cultural aspects of behaviour were recently revealed, mostly in primates. At the same time some classical results concerning cultural transmission of new patterns (for example, bottle-opening in tits) were experimentally revised. Many problems still remain unsolved, in particular, how spread of innovations may favour prosperity of populations; to what degree behavioural peculiarities of local groups may be determined by processes of social learning; which internal and external factors and under what circumstances invest into social learning in natural environment.},

abstract={Reports of postpartum parental care in squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes) are rare and generally anecdotal. We investigated parental care in black rock skinks, Egernia saxatilis, from southeastern Australia. These lizards live in small family groups, with adults defending territories against conspecifics. Juvenile lizards live within their parents' territory and may thus be protected from infanticide. In staged encounters in the laboratory, adults frequently attacked unrelated juveniles but not their own offspring, and the parent's presence significantly reduced the incidence of this infanticidal aggression. This protection arose not through specific 'parental' behaviours, but because adults tended to ignore juveniles when another (potentially threatening) adult was present. When two family groups were placed in the same enclosure, one family rapidly became dominant over the other. Juveniles of the dominant family derived thermoregulatory and foraging benefits from their parents' status. Thus, some lizards do show postpartum parental care, and may thereby significantly benefit their progeny via reduced risk of infanticide and better access to thermal and nutritional resources. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={Cervical carcinoma and genital infections with human papillomavirus (HPV) are significant health problems worldwide. One variable often overlooked in these two diseases is the role of nutrition as a risk reduction strategy or a treatment method for early disease. This chapter reviews the epidemiology of HPV and cervical cancer, explores the possible cofactors that contribute to the development of diseases, and reviews the data related to nutrition. A variety of variables contributes to a woman's exposure to HPV and development of diseases. These variables include male factors, HPV type, viral load, viral persistence, immune response, and nutrition. Other than sexual behavior, only nutrition is the modifiable factor that can contribute to prevention and/or treatment of disease. The studies of nutrition as an intervention method have been limited by the focus on a single or combination of micronutrients in women with evidence of cytologic or pathologic disease. This reductionist approach is far too focused and non-reflective of the observation epidemiologic data, which suggest that a diet high in fruit and vegetables reduces the risk of HPV and pre-invasive cervical disease. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Out of storage, the highest activity was recorded in week 0: nearly all IJ were active within the first minute of observation and remained active for the 20-min observation period. With increasing storage time, an increasing proportion of IJ were inactive in the first minute, reaching 83-96% by week 6. The time taken by 50% of the IJ to become active (AT50) initially increased with nematode age, reaching a maximum of 3-7 min in week 4 or 6 (depending on isolate) but subsequently declined to 2-4 min in week 10. By the time the IJ were becoming more readily activated in weeks 6-8, 75% of the lipid reserves had been depleted, and IJ had started to die. This greater propensity to become active with age may represent a switch to risk-taking behaviour in the face of impending starvation. © Koninklijke Brill NV, 2004.},

abstract={Background: Female mate choice may be adaptive when males exhibit heritable genetic variation at loci encoding resistance to infectious disease. The Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis predicts that females should assess the genetic quality of males by monitoring traits that indicate health and vigor (condition-dependent choice, or CD). Alternatively, some females may employ a more direct method of screening and select mates based on the dissimilarity of alleles at the major histocompatibility loci (we refer to this as opposites-attract, or OA). Empirical studies suggest that both forms of mate choice exist, but little is known about the potential for natural selection to shape the two strategies in nature. Results: We used computer simulation models to examine the evolutionary fates of the two forms of mate choice in populations at risk for infection by debilitating parasites. We found that populations exhibiting random mating (no mate choice) can be invaded and replaced completely by individuals practicing CD type mate choice. We also found that an allele encoding OA choice can increase when rare in randomly mating populations, but that it does not go to fixation under selection. A similar result was obtained when the OA strategy was introduced into populations practicing CD mate choice. As before, we found that the OA choice allele will increase when rare, and that it will not go to fixation under selection. The converse however was not true, as CD individuals gain no rare advantage when introduced into an OA population. Conclusions: Taken together, the results suggest that, when rare, OA is the best strategy for parasite evasion (of those considered here). The consequence of OA increasing in the population, however, is to reduce the parasite driven genotype oscillations and facilitate the breakdown of linkage disequilibrium at the disease-resistance loci. This leads to a neutrally stable situation in which different strategies have equal fitness, and suggests that multiple forms of mate choice may be expected to occur in populations at risk from infectious disease. © 2004 Howard and Lively; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is engaged in modulation of memory retention after (fear) conditioning, but it is unknown which pathways and neurotransmitter system(s) play a role in this action. Here we examine immunocytochemically whether muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), mediating cholinergic signal transduction in the SCN, are involved. For this purpose, mAChR immunoreactivity (mAChR-ir) was studied in the SCN after various stages of passive shock avoidance (PSA) and active shock avoidance (ASA) training and, for ASA, at various posttraining time points. mAChR-ir was significantly enhanced in SCN neurons as a result of the training procedure, and the number of mAChR-positive glial cells in the SCN increased significantly. The increase in mAChR-ir as a result of PSA and ASA training was not due to fear conditioning or the number of correct avoidances (in case of ASA training) but rather to behavioral arousal as a consequence of (brief) exposure to a novel environment (the test apparatus). This finding was confirmed by a cage-change experiment in which the rats were allowed to stay in a novel cage for 15 min or 24 hr. Only the brief exposure to the fresh cage triggered alterations for SCN mAChRs 24 hr later. These results shed new light on a possible function of the cholinergic system in the SCN mediated by mAChRs in relation to modulation of memory processes and demonstrate that behavioral arousal during (the habituation stage of) a learning task is sufficient to alter the mAChR system in the SCN. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={One hundred and twenty-eight pigs were reared in barren or enriched environments from birth to slaughter at 21 weeks of age. Pigs remained as litter-mate groups until 8 weeks of age when they were mixed into groups of eight animals. These groups were balanced for gender and weight and contained two pigs from each of four different litters. Each pig was assigned high or low social status on the basis of relative success in aggressive interactions at mixing. Injury levels were assessed on a weekly basis from 8 to 21 weeks of age. Pigs were exposed to two group food competition tests after a period of food restriction at 10 weeks of age, and to an individual novel pen test at 11 weeks of age. Behavioural and plasma cortisol responses to both types of test were recorded. Low social status was associated with increased injuries to the head, neck and ears, and therefore reduced welfare. Pigs with low social status showed reduced resource-holding ability in the food competition test, and greater avoidance of a novel object during the novel pen test. It is suggested that avoidance of the novel object reflected 'learned' fearfulness in these individuals. Environmental enrichment did not negate the effect of low social status on injury levels, but did appear to reduce the negative influence of low social status on stress during food restriction, and led to a reduction in fearfulness in response to the novel pen test. These results suggest that environmental enrichment may improve the welfare of growing pigs with low social status. © 2004 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.},

abstract={Individuals in a range of species consistently differ in their behavior towards mild challenges, over age and time. Differences have been found for several personality traits in a range of species. In great tits these traits have a genetic basis and are phenotypically correlated. Estimates of genetic correlations are, however, fundamental to understanding the evolution of consistent individual differences in behavior. This study analyzed two selection experiments on two avian personality traits, early exploratory behavior and risk-taking behavior. The selection lines used were both started using wild great tits (Parus major) from two natural populations. Genetic correlations were calculated using the response and the correlated response to artificial selection. We found genetic correlations ranging from 0.51 to 0.66, based on individual values, and from 0.84 to 1.00 based on nest means. Genetic correlations can be due to pleiotropic effects or to linkage disequilibrium. The different behavioral traits might therefore have a common genetic basis, possibly constraining independent evolution of personality traits in natural populations. These results are discussed in relation to domain generality and domain specificity of personalities.},

abstract={In group-living animals, competition for a scarce resource often results in the formation of dominance hierarchies. Dominant individuals garner more of that resource for themselves through the use of aggression, forcing subordinates to rely on nonaggressive strategies to secure it. Stealing from dominants is common, but subordinate thieves can risk attack if caught. How, then, do subordinates decide when and where to steal? We explored whether the opportunity to learn about the location and availability of food might facilitate food-stealing attempts by male blue gouramis, Trichogaster trichopterus, a freshwater tropical fish. Our results show that subordinates were able to use learned cues to mount highly effective 'sneaky' tactics. By anticipating food location and availability, subordinates reduced the number of attacks they received as well as the amount of time they spent fleeing from dominants. More importantly, however, our results revealed unexpected plasticity in the cognitive mechanisms underlying this learning: like privately trained dominants, privately trained subordinates learned to approach food cues directly; however, on the very first occasion that subordinates were tested with a dominant present, they dramatically altered their previously learned direct approach to food cues, immediately adopting a different, sneaky tactic instead. Thus, subordinates were able to combine information about previous learning, namely an 'expectancy' of food, with the probability of future attack and adjust their food-getting strategy accordingly. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={The strength of an animal's behavioural response to human presence has often been used as an index of an animal's susceptibility to disturbance. However, if behavioural responsiveness is positively related to the animal's condition, this may be an inappropriate index, as individuals showing little or no response may in fact be those with most to lose from changing their behaviour. We tested the link between individual state and responsiveness by manipulating condition via the provision of supplementary food for turnstones, Arenaria interpres, on rocky shores. Birds at one site were fed 450 g of mealworms at low tide every day for 3 days while birds at another site acted as a control. On the fourth day, using a standardized disturbance protocol, we recorded flush distances, flight lengths and the amount of time between predator scans for birds in both flocks. After a break of 3 days, the treatments were then swapped between sites and the procedure repeated for a total of six trials. Birds whose condition had been enhanced showed greater responsiveness to standardized human disturbance, flying away at greater distances from the observer, scanning more frequently for predators and flying further when flushed. These findings suggest that our current management of the impact of human disturbance may be based on inaccurate assessments of vulnerability, and we discuss the implications of this for refuge provision. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={Background: Suboptimal uptake of existing vaccines, potential obstacles specific to HIV/AIDS stigma and mistrust, and marked health disparities suggest that it is vital to investigate consumer concerns, motivations, and adoption intentions regarding posttrial HIV vaccines before a vaccine is publicly available. Method: Nine focus groups were conducted with participants (n = 99; median age, 33 years; 48% female; 22% African American, 44% Latino, and 28% white) recruited from 7 high-risk venues in Los Angeles using purposive venue-based sampling. A semistructured interview guide elicited concerns, motivators, and adoption intentions regarding hypothetical U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved HIV vaccines. Data were analyzed using narrative thematic analysis and Ethnograph qualitative software. Results: Concerns included vaccine efficacy, vaccine-induced infection, vaccine-induced HIV seropositivity, side effects, cost/access, trustworthiness, and relationship issues. Motivators included protection against HIV infection and the ability to safely engage in unprotected sex. Participants expressed reluctance to adopt partial efficacy vaccines and likelihood of increased sexual risk behaviors in response to vaccine availability. Conclusion: Tailored interventions to facilitate uptake of future U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved HIV vaccines and to prevent risk behavior increases may be vital to the effectiveness of vaccines in controlling the AIDS pandemic.},

abstract={Increasing substrate structural complexity has been linked to higher densities of various refuge-seeking aquatic macroinvertebrates, many of which constitute major prey species in a variety of freshwater communities. We investigated (1) whether the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, a predator of such macroinvertebrates and an established model organism in studies of animal behaviour, is capable of discriminating between structurally complex and simple substrates, and (2) whether they show a substrate preference when foraging. Hunger-motivated sticklebacks presented with a choice of simple and complex substrate types preferentially foraged over complex substrates. This was seen when the prey density was equal on both substrate types, and when it was greater on the complex substrate. Where prey density was greater on the simple substrate, fish showed no preference for either. The preference for complex substrates existed in both the allocation of time spent foraging and in the direction and frequency of feeding strikes. No substrate preferences were seen in fish that were satiated, or when prey were absent from both substrates. This ruled out refuge as an explanation for the observed preference. We discuss the results in the context of the relative usefulness of substrate discrimination in effective patch foraging in fish. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={Little is known on environmental risk factors for cryptorchidism and hypospadias, which are among the most frequent congenital abnormalities. The aim of our study was to identify risk factors for cryptorchidism and hypospadias, with a focus on potential endocrine disruptors in parental diet and occupation. In a case-control study nested within a cohort of 8,698 male births, we compared 78 cryptorchidism cases and 56 hypospadias cases with 313 controls. The participation rate was 85% for cases and 68% for controls. Through interviews, information was collected on pregnancy aspects and personal characteristics, lifestyle, occupation, and dietary phytoestrogen intake of both parents. Occupational exposure to potential endocrine disruptors was classified based on self-reported exposure and ratings of occupational hygienists based on job descriptions. Our findings indicate that paternal pesticide exposure was associated with cryptorchidism [odds ratio (OR) = 3.8; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.1-13.4]. Smoking of the father was associated with hypospadias (OR = 3.8; 95% CI, 1.8-8.2). Maternal occupational, dietary, and lifestyle exposures were not associated with either abnormality. Both abnormalities were associated with suboptimal maternal health, a lower maternal education, and a Turkish origin of the parents. Being small for gestational age was a risk factor for hypospadias, and preterm birth was a risk factor for cryptorchidism. Because paternal pesticide exposure was significantly associated with cryptorchidism and paternal smoking was associated with hypospadias in male offspring, paternal exposure should be included in further studies on cryptorchidism and hypospadias risk factors.},

abstract={Much study has been devoted to the function of chemical alarm cues in predator-prey relationships in aquatic environments, but little is known about the production of these valuable sources of chemosensory information. Recent studies have demonstrated that donor (cue sender) condition may play an important role in the production of chemical alarm cues in juvenile convict cichlids (Archocentrus nigrofasciatus). In laboratory experiments, we conducted trials to test for the effect of donor body condition on the minimum behavioural response threshold and/or intensity of antipredator response to conspecific chemical alarm cues. Chemical alarm cue donors were sampled from high or low condition populations. Pairs of juvenile cichlids were exposed to the skin extracts of high condition versus low condition donors, across a range of relative concentrations (200, 100, 50, 25, and 12.5%), and a distilled water control. We found that cichlids exhibited overt antipredator behaviour beginning at a concentration of 25% for the high condition cue, while a minimum response threshold concentration of 50% was seen for low condition cue. The intensity of antipredator response was greater following exposure to the alarm cues of high condition stimulus versus low condition donors. Taken together, these findings suggest that the damage-released chemical alarm cues from high condition donors are qualitatively and quantitatively greater than those of low condition donors.},

abstract={Ghrelin was recently identified as an endogenous ligand of the GH secretagogue receptor. The novel peptide hormone is produced by gastric A-like cells, and circulating levels rise before feeding, suggestive of ghrelin as an endogenous hunger factor, ghrelin stimulates food intake and promotes adiposity after peripheral or central administration, likely by activating hypothalamic neurons expressing the orexigenic neuropeptides neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AGRP). To examine whether ghrelin-induced feeding resembles NPY and AGRP [AGRP fragment (83-132)] induced orexia, we compared the short- and long-term orexigenic capacity of the three peptides. A single intracerebroventricular injection of ghrelin (0.2, 1.0, and 5.0 μg) increased food intake in a dose-dependent manner. A prolonged and uncompensated increase in feeding was seen after the highest dose of ghrelin. The prolonged effects on feeding (+72 h) closely resembled those of AGRP (83-132) but not NPY. Surprisingly, ghrelin injections reduced overall locomotor activity by 20% during the first 24-h observation period. AGRP (83-132) had similar effects on locomotor behavior, whereas NPY had no effect. In summary, ghrelin causes long-term increases of food intake and, like AGRP, plays a previously unknown role as a suppressor of spontaneous physical activity. Expanding the current model of food intake control to include mechanisms regulating physical activity may promote our understanding of two major etiological factors causing obesity.},

More recently a second axis, related to the level of elaboration of products (whole carcass, jointed products or transformed products) has been developed. The productivity of the standard products is high but not so much higher than that of certified chicken. The difference could be compensated by the guarantees of traceability and production brought by certification. In term of quality also, part of the differences are vanishing, because the consumer's choices evolve and the difference in taste is especially marked for the thighs that are economically less important. However, the differences in transformation rate are in favour of faster-growing chickens. While the animals can express their natural behavior more when reared outside, they run an increased risk of microbial contaminations. With reference to all these results, it seems difficult to predict how the chicken production will evolve. But it appears clearly that the certified chicken, intermediary between standard chicken and Label chicken will develop.},

abstract={The concept of aggression is important to nursing because further knowledge of aggression can help generate a better theoretical model to drive more effective intervention and prevention approaches. This paper outlines a conceptual analysis of aggression. First, the different forms of aggression are reviewed, including the clinical classification and the stimulus-based classification. Then the manifestations and measurement of aggression are described. Finally, the causes and consequences of aggression are outlined. It is argued that a better understanding of aggression and the causal factors underlying it are essential for learning how to prevent negative aggression in the future.},

abstract={Four pigeons and three ringneck doves responded on an operant simulation of natural foraging. After satisfying a schedule of reinforcement associated with search time, subjects could "accept" or "reject" another schedule of reinforcement associated with handling time. Two schedules of reinforcement were available, a variable interval, and a fixed interval with the same mean value. Food available in the session (a variable related to the energy budget) was manipulated in the different conditions either by increases of the value of the search state schedule of reinforcement, or by increases in the mean value of the handling state schedules. The results indicate that the amount of food available in the session did not affect the preference for variable schedules of reinforcement, as would be predicted by an influential theory of risk sensitive foraging. Instead, the preference for variability depended on the relationship between the time spent in the search and the handling states, as is predicted by a family of models of choice that are based on the temporal proximity to the reinforcer. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={One of the important goals in conservation biology is to determine reliable indicators of population viability. Sexual traits have been suggested to indicate population extinction risk, because they may be related to viability through condition dependence. Moreover, condition-]dependent sexual traits may be more sensitive indicators of population viability than early life-history traits, because deleterious fitness effects of inbreeding tend to be expressed mainly at the end of the species' life history. However, empirical evidence of the significance of sexual behaviour for population viability is missing. In this study, we examined two male sexual traits and survival in 39 different-sized and isolated natural populations of the wolf spider, Hygrolycosa rubrofasciata. We also used several traits to estimate female reproductive success in 25 populations of H. rubrofasciata. According to previous studies, H. rubrofasciata males have a costly and condition-dependent acoustic signal, courtship drumming, which is the target of female choice. Males with a high drumming rate have considerably higher viability than males with a low drumming rate, and females that mate with the more actively drumming males gain genetic benefits in terms of increased offspring viability. Our results show that males in small populations had both lower survival and lower drumming rate than males in larger populations. However, we did not find any evidence for a decline in important early life-history traits (offspring number, hatching success or offspring body mass) or female body mass in small populations. Our results have two important messages for conservation biology. First, they show that sexual traits can be used as sensitive indicators of population viability. Second, the indirect benefits of female choice in terms of good genes might partially compensate for the reduction of viability in declining populations. Also, our results support the view that deleterious effects of small population size are expressed at the end of the species' life history. © 2004 The Royal Society.},

abstract={A discovery in 2002 of a Trichinella spiralis-infected horse in Serbia offered an opportunity to conduct needed epidemiological studies on how horses, considered herbivores, acquire a meat-borne parasite. This enigma has persisted since the first human outbreaks from infected horse meat occurred in then 1970s. The trace back of the infected horse to a farm owner was carried out. Interviews and investigations on the farm led to the conclusion that the owner had fed the horse food waste in order to condition the horse prior to sale. Further investigations were then carried out to determine the frequency of such practices among horse owners. Based on interviews of horse producers at local horse markets, it was revealed that the feeding of animal products to horses was a common practice. Further, it was alleged that many horses, particularly those in poor nutritional condition would readily consume meat. A subsequent series of trials involving the experimental feeding of 219 horses demonstrated that 32% would consume meat patties. To confirm that horses would eat infected meat under normal farm conditions, three horses were offered infected ground pork balls containing 1100 larvae. All three became infected, and at necropsy at 32 weeks later, were still positive by indirect IFA testing, but not by ELISA using an excretory-secretory (ES) antigen. This result indicates that further study is needed on the nature of the antigen(s) used for potential serological monitoring and surveillance of horse trichinellosis, especially the importance of antigenic diversity. The experimentally-infected horses also had very low infection levels (larvae per gram of muscle) at 32 weeks of infection, and although the public health consequences are unknown, the question of whether current recommended inspection procedures based on pepsin digestion of selected muscle samples require sufficient quantities of muscle should be addressed. It is concluded that horses are more willing to consume meat than realized and that the intentional feeding of animal products and kitchen waste is a common occurrence among horse owners in Serbia (and elsewhere?). This is a high risk practice which demands closer scrutiny by veterinary and food safety authorities, including the implementation of rules and procedures to ensure that such feeds are rendered safe for horses, as is now required for feeding to swine. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The master circadian clock, located in the mammalian suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), generates and coordinates circadian rhythmicity, i.e., internal organization of physiological and behavioral rhythms that cycle with a near 24-h period. Light is the most powerful synchronizer of the SCN. Although other nonphotic cues also have the potential to influence the circadian clock, their effects can be masked by photic cues. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of scheduled feeding to entrain the SCN in the absence of photic cues in four lines of house mouse (Mus domesticus). Mice were initially housed in 12:12-h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food for 6 h during the light period followed by 4-6 mo of constant dark under the same feeding schedule. Wheel running behavior suggested and circadian PER2 protein expression profiles in the SCN confirmed entrainment of the master circadian clock to the onset of food availability in 100% (49/49) of the line 2 mice in contrast to only 4% (1/24) in line 3 mice. Mice from line 1 and line 4 showed intermediate levels of entrainment, 57% (8/14) and 39% (7/18), respectively. The predictability of entrainment vs. nonentrainment in line 2 and line 3 and the novel entrainment process provide a powerful tool with which to further elucidate mechanisms involved in entrainment of the SCN by scheduled feeding.},

abstract={Aggregations of zooplankton, micronekton and fish are frequently observed above seamounts, canyons and shelf breaks. The aggregations are produced by five different mechanisms, all driven by ocean currents. Upwelling is frequently generated when ambient currents impinge on abrupt topographies. Nevertheless, upwelling enhances local production of zooplankton and fish only over large topographies such as shelf breaks, where the residence time of the upwelled water is sufficiently long to allow enrichment in primary production to propagate up the food web and augment the growth of resident animals. Daily accumulations occur over topographies at shallow and intermediate depths when the topography blocks the morning descent of migrating zooplankton. This mechanism is common over seamounts. Two other mechanisms are driven by behavioral response to vertical currents when zooplankton swims vertically in order to maintain depth: accumulations by depth retention against upwelling are common at depths to which migrating zooplankton descend during the day, while depth retention against downwelling seems to operate only in the upper water column (e.g., along topographically generated fronts). The fifth mechanism is driven by the amplification of currents over abrupt topographies. Strong currents enhance population growth of resident animals by augmenting fluxes of suspended food. A feed-rest hypothesis is proposed to explain how site-attached planktivorous fish can benefit from strong currents at sites with ample quiescence shelters in which the fish rest during non-feeding intervals. Four of the above mechanisms generate "trophic focusing", a process by which prey from immense volumes of flowing water is accumulated (or trapped) in a relatively small confined area. The ensuing subsidy of prey propagates up the food web, supporting aggregations of higher predators, such as fish, marine mammals and fishermen. Abrupt topographies can have an important role in determining trophic interactions in the marine realm. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Experiments were carried out to study the effects of food signal concentration, animal nutritional status, and signal repetition on behavioural responses of the mud crab, Rhithropanopeus harrisii tridentatus. Starved crabs responded to a food stimulus by maxilliped movements, chela probing, cleaning movements by the first pair of walking legs, and locomotion. A low concentration of the stimulus elicited only detection, medium concentrations triggered far-field food search, and high concentration activated near-field food search. These results indicate that crabs use the stimulus concentration as a source of information about their distance from a food item. Fed animals reacted to a full-strength food stimulus by escaping from the place where such odour was released. No search behaviour was elicited. Such strategy can decrease the risk of encountering predators or cannibalistic conspecifics by animals that are not under the imminent danger of starving. Stimulus repetition had an inhibitory effect on crab behavioural reactions. The degree of blockade was decreasing with the increase in time between successive stimulus applications. These results indicate that crabs may have a learning mechanism, protecting them from repeating useless food search.},

Reported increases in the prevalence of autism, a highly heritable neuropsychiatric condition, are intensifying public focus on environmental exposures such as thimerosal. Immune profiles and family history in autism are frequently consistent with autoimmunity. We hypothesized that autoimmune propensity influences outcomes in mice following thimerosal challenges that mimic routine childhood immunizations. Autoimmune disease-sensitive SJL/J mice showed growth delay; reduced locomotion; exaggerated response to novelty; and densely packed, hyperchromic hippocampal neurons with altered glutamate receptors and transporters.

abstract={Background: Body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for gastro-oesophageal reflux but may simply be explained by diet and lifestyle. Aim: We aimed to determine the contribution of BMI. diet and exercise to GER. Methods: Community subjects (n = 211, mean age = 36 years, 43% males) completed validated questionnaires on gastro-oesophageal reflux, energy expenditure (Harvard Alumni Activity Survey), dietary intake (Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire) and measures of personality and life event stress. Diet, exercise, BMI and other potential risk factors for reflux were analysed using logistic regression analyses. Results: The overall mean (±s.d.) BMI was 26.6 (±5.7); 79 (37%) reported infrequent (<weekly) reflux and 16 (8%) reported frequent (≥weekly) reflux. The median caloric intake was 2097 cal/day and the median daily energy expenditure was 1753 cal/day. Among those with BMI > 25, 10% reported frequent reflux compared to 4% of those with BMI ≤ 25. In a model which included age, sex and Symptom Checklist-90 somatisation T-score, BMI was associated with reflux (OR per 5 units = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2, 3.0). In models which included diet and exercise variables, BMI but not diet or exercise was associated with reflux. Conclusion: BMI may be associated with symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux independent of diet and exercise.},

Depression - a disease that is particularly prevalent among women and is associated with socioeconomic factors - negatively influences the development of cardiovascular diseases, triggers cardiovascular events and influences rehabilitation. Lifestyle factors, which are positively or negatively correlated with cardiovascular disease, show a gender-specific prevalence and are related to psychosocial factors.

abstract={Cellular homeostasis is maintained through a complicated network of signaling, transport and enzymatic events that take place in different compartments of the cell. The result of this composite network determines the cellular behavior in response to environmental challenges. Within this network, many cellular functions are regulated at the transcriptional level and consequently the comprehension of the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation is fundamental to fully understand how the cell reacts to environmental changes. Moreover, it offers an opportunity to find novel targets for the design of better strategies to improve healthy human nutrition and to treat metabolic diseases. In this framework, nuclear receptors have emerged as key regulators of many cellular functions in response to lipid action. In this review, we will discuss the new concepts on the biology of the recently "adopted" nuclear receptors sensing oxysterols (LXR), bile acids (FXR) and fatty acids (PPARs) and their function in the integrated regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. We will also address the role played by other orphan nuclear receptors, such as FTF, SHP and HNF-4, acting in concert with these lipid-sensing nuclear receptors in the regulation of cellular metabolism.},

abstract={Life history theory predicts that reproductive effort should increase as life expectancy decreases. Empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis is still fragmentary. We measured the effects of different potential indexes of mortality risk on oviposition in a geometrid moth Scotopteryx chenopodiata L. We conducted two experiments: in one we manipulated mortality risk by clipping wings or depriving the moths of food; in the other we studied the effect of incidental injuries, and varied host quality and food availability. Physical injuries led to a higher oviposition rate and shorter latency (i.e. a shorter discrimination period before oviposition) on both a high-ranked and a low-ranked host. High mortality risk was associated with a shorter latency to oviposit on the low-ranked, but not on the high-ranked host. These effects remained significant when we controlled for the influences of estimated adult age and eggload. Insects deprived of food as adults increased oviposition activity in the first experiment but not in the second. Our results suggest that certain cues of an adverse environment, as well as the individual's terminal condition, can increase reproductive effort and reduce host selectivity in insects. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={Background: Ornithine α-ketoglutarate (OKG) improves nutritional status in malnourished patients. Published and unpublished data suggest OKG may have effects on the central nervous system that may contribute to its action. Objective: We investigated the effect of an OKG-enriched diet on behaviour in healthy rats. Design: Thirty male Wistar rats were randomised in three groups: the OKG group was fed for 5 days (D0-D5) at 90% of spontaneous food intake with an OKG-enriched diet (5 g/kg/d). The non-essential amino acids (NEAA) group was fed similarly with a regimen enriched with NEAA (glycine, alanine, histidine and serine) to be isonitrogenous to OKG group. The ad libitum (AL) group had no treatment and was fed ad libitum with a standard regimen throughout. Rats were tested at D4 for motor activity by actimetry, and at D5 first for spontaneous alternation behaviour measured in the Y -maze, and then for exploratory behaviour measured using the open-field test (stressful environment). Results: We found that OKG supplementation enhanced global motricity by actimetry (AL 772±55, NEAA 811±54 vs. OKG 966±24 arbitrary units, P<0.05) and total numbers of arms visited in the Y -maze (AL 26±2, NEAA 30±3 vs. OKG 38±3, P<0.05). The lack of any effect of the OKG-enriched diet in the open-field test shows that the enhancement of locomotion activity was most probably not due to an increase in anxiety or fear in the rats. Conclusion: An OKG-enriched diet can induce beneficial stimulant effects that may be involved in the mechanism of action of OKG. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={1. For many species, human-induced disturbances can severely influence an individual's pay-off; however, energy-cost variations from different disturbance types have rarely been reported. 2. We evaluated the dynamic behavioural responses of staging greater snow geese Anser caerulescens atlanticus to different types of disturbance in southern Quebec, Canada, between 1997 and 2000. We specifically considered the impact of a unique measure, a spring conservation hunt implemented in agricultural habitats in 1999. 3. We tracked 237 radio-tagged females for 2764 h and recorded 697 take-offs following fortuitous disturbance, scaring and hunting in three regions characterized by different habitats. Geese used cornfields in south-western Quebec, Scirpus marshes and hayfields in the upper St Lawrence estuary, and Spartina marshes and hayfields in the lower estuary. 4. Overall, disturbance levels increased in the upper and lower estuary during years with hunting, mostly through an increase in hunting and scaring activities. 5. The probability of geese returning to a refuge after disturbance in agricultural habitats increased in years with hunting except in the corn-growing region. The short-term energy gain of geese resuming feeding after disturbance was less than before disturbance, and this difference was greater in years with hunting. Distances flown after disturbance decreased with flock size and were longer after scaring and hunting than after fortuitous disturbances in the Scirpus region. 6. Overall, habitat use varied among years and associated estimated energy gain decreased markedly in both years with hunting in the Spartina and corn-growing region, but did not change in the Scirpus region. Changes in behaviour due to disturbance, and especially those associated with hunting, probably contributed to the reduced body condition of staging greater snow geese during years with hunting. 7. Synthesis and applications. From a methodological viewpoint, we highlight the importance of tracking the behaviour of individual animals after disturbance to properly evaluate its impact. From a conservation perspective, we provide empirical arguments to limit the hunting of breeding waterfowl during their prenuptial migration in order to facilitate their fattening and forthcoming reproduction. From a management standpoint, we suggest that a side-effect of disturbance induced by spring hunting to control overabundant populations may be reduced fattening and breeding output among birds that survive. Together, these data emphasize further the importance of measuring the direct and indirect effects of disturbance rather than assuming effects from the incidence of the disturbance alone.},

abstract={In this study we identify the size-dependent risk of winter starvation mortality as a strong selective pressure on age-0 rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) that could promote the risk-taking behaviour and allocation of energy to lipids previously observed in young trout cohorts. Age-0 trout subjected to simulated winter starvation conditions gradually depleted lipid reserves to a critical minimum lipid content below which death occurred. Small fish with lower lipid content exhausted lipid reserves earlier, and experienced high mortality rates sooner, than larger fish with greater lipid content. Consequently, winter starvation endurance was dependent upon size-dependent lipid reserves and winter duration. To validate the laboratory findings in the field, we stocked several size classes of hatchery-raised trout with known lipid content at the start of winter into two experimental lakes, and estimated survival and lipid depletion at winter's end. Larger age-0 trout had greater initial lipid reserves than smaller trout. Individuals depleted most of their lipid reserves over the winter, and experienced mortality that ranged from just under 60% for the largest individuals to just over 90% of the smallest individuals. Many survivors had lipid contents near, but none were below, the minimum lipid content determined in the laboratory.},

abstract={Many plants and animals are capable of developing in a variety of ways, forming characteristics that are well adapted to the environments in which they are likely to live. In adverse circumstances, for example, small size and slow metabolism can facilitate survival, whereas larger size and more rapid metabolism have advantages for reproductive success when resources are more abundant. Often these characteristics are induced in early life or are even set by cues to which their parents or grandparents were exposed. Individuals developmentally adapted to one environment may, however, be at risk when exposed to another when they are older. The biological evidence may be relevant to the understanding of human development and susceptibility to disease. As the nutritional state of many human mothers has improved around the world, the characteristics of their offspring-such as body size and metabolism-have also changed. Responsiveness to their mothers' condition before birth may generally prepare individuals so that they are best suited to the environment forecast by cues available in early life. Paradoxically, however, rapid improvements in nutrition and other environmental conditions may have damaging effects on the health of those people whose parents and grandparents lived in impoverished conditions. A fuller understanding of patterns of human plasticity in response to early nutrition and other environmental factors will have implications for the administration of public health.},

abstract={Behavioural observations were performed in an olfactometer to examine the effects of chemical stimuli from predators and conspecifics on the swimming activity of two larval anurans, the common frog, Rana temporaria, and the common toad, Bufo bufo. Both species of tadpoles showed a slight but non significant reduction in swimming behaviour when confronted to chemical cues from starved sympatric predators (larval spotted salamander, Salamandra salamandra; larval dragonfly, Anax imperator). In contrast, test solutions from starved Astacus leptodactylus, a recently introduced predator, produced no change at all in behaviour. As a whole, significant results indicate that indirect chemical signals resulting from the preying activity of the predator are mainly used for the chemical assessment of predation risk by tadpoles. Swimming activity of R. temporaria and B. bufo tadpoles was also found to be significantly decreased in response to chemical cues released by crushed conspecifics, or by A. leptodactylus within the day following ingestion of conspecific tadpoles. Our results suggest that the presence of conspecific alarm substances in water and predators' waste products play a pre-eminent role in the chemical detection of predators by these larval anurans.},

abstract={During the learning of instrumental tasks, rats are usually fasted to increase reinforced learning. However, fasting produces several undesirable side effects. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that control rats, i.e. full-fed and group-reared rats, will learn an autoshaping task to the same level as fasted or singly-reared rats. The interaction between fasting and single-rearing of rats was also tested. Results showed that control rats and fasted rats acquired the autoshaping task similarly, independently of rearing condition or gender. However, fasted or singly-reared rats produced fear-like behaviour, since male rats group-reared and fasted (85% body/wt, P < 0.05), male rats singly-reared (full fed, P < 0.05; 12 h fasted, P < 0.05; 85% body/wt, P < 0.05), female rats group-reared (12 h fasted, P < 0.05; 85% body/wt, P < 0.05) and female rats singly reared (full fed, P < 0.05; 12 h fasted, P < 0.05; 85% body/wt, P < 0.05) displayed reduced amounts of time exploring the open arms of the elevated plus-maze. In conclusion, control rats learned the autoshaping task to the same level as fasted or singly-reared rats. However, fasting or single-rearing produced fear-like behaviour. Thus, the training of control rats in autoshaping tasks may be an option that improves animal welfare.},

abstract={One of the major objective of domestication is the selection of lines with low aggressiveness and a high growth potential. Analyses of domesticated animals traits often illustrate numerous changes in behaviour due to rearing environment. However there are few reports of these changes in fish. In the present paper, we first describe how behaviour is affected by rearing and then discuss how sensory organs and behavioural abilities are modified during development under breeding conditions. Rearing conditions modify feeding behaviour particularly because food distribution do not necessary follow biological rhythm and food is often available in larger amount compared to wild-type situations. In particular food distribution mode may favour aggressiveness. Rearing conditions (stream, fish density...) are also susceptible to modify spatial distribution of fish and relationship between fish in their closed environment. In particular, fish often reduce their inter-individual distances which may also have detrimental influences on their aggressiveness. Several behavioural abilities seem to be affected by development in breeding conditions and this appears to be related to modification of sensory organs. This includes modification of the lateral line system, eye and smell. These modifications are often associated to a lowering of watchfulness threshold which in turn modifies behaviour and particularly escape responses from potential predators. A modification of chromatic adaptation has also been shown for flat fishes. In conclusion, the analysis of behavioural modifications is of utmost importance to identify indicators of domestication progress which must be taken into account to guarantee cultured fish welfare and thus rearing sustainability.},

abstract={Assessment of canine palatability is important for both the pet food and pharmaceutical industries; however, the current palatability assessment protocols are limited in their utility. The most common technique, the two-pan test, does not control for the satiating effects of food and may not be useful for long-term palatability analysis because nutritional or caloric characteristics of the diets may interfere with the results. Furthermore, the large quantities of foods consumed may be detrimental to the health of animals that do not self-limit their food intake. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a cognitive protocol could be used to determine food palatability in dogs. Five beagle dogs were trained on a three-choice objectdiscrimination learning task. After establishing object preferences, the preferred object was associated with no reward, a second object was associated with the dog's normal laboratory diet (Purina Agribrands Canine Lab Chow No. 5006; Agribrands Purina Canada, Inc., Woodstock, ON, Canada), and the third object was associated with a commercial (Hill's P/D; Hill's Pet Nutrition Inc., Topeka, KS) diet. In the discrimination-training phase, dogs were trained until they learned to avoid the no-reward object. They were subsequently given an additional 20 test sessions, which were used to determine food preference. In the reversal phase, which involved reversal learning, the object-food associations were modified, such that the object that was previously associated with Hill's P/D diet was now associated with the normal laboratory diet and vice versa. Once the dogs learned to avoid the no-reward object, they were tested for an additional 20 sessions. All subjects learned to avoid the no-reward object during the initial learning, and the number of choices to the object associated with the Hill's P/D diet was greater than the number of choices to the objects associated with the dry laboratory diet (P < 0.05) and no reward (P < 0.05), indicating a strong preference for the Hill's P/D diet. The object preferences were reversed in only three of five dogs when the food-choice associations were reversed, although the two phases did not differ significantly from one another. The protocol in the present study provides a robust measure of food palatability and circumvents many of the limitations associated with other palatability assessment techniques. The present protocol should be useful as a replacement or adjunct to other tests of palatability, but requires further validation by comparing the assessment of more similar and novel foods directly with other palatability tests. ©2004 American Society of Animal Science.

abstract={An estimated 140 000 dogs are used worldwide in research and testing every year. Although there is a growing trend of providing more complex environments for laboratory dogs, worldwide much dog husbandry and care fails to incorporate what is known about their natural behaviour and their behavioural and welfare needs. With this in mind, the BVAAWF/FRAME/ RSPCA/UFAW Joint Working Group on Refinement set out to identify and document ways in which dog husbandry and care can be refined to make significant reductions in suffering and improvements in animal welfare. The Working Group's report contains recommendations on housing and on physical environment, food and feeding, environmental enrichment and exercise, health and hygiene, identification and record keeping, breeding, balancing supply and demand, grouping, transport, handling and restraint, procedures, long-term use, rehoming, staff training, and areas for future research for refining dog husbandry and care. Advice is also given on interpreting dog signals, preventing and managing aggression, and controlling noise in dog facilities. Particular emphasis is placed on providing an enriched environment for dogs which permits them to express a wide range of normal behaviour and to exercise a degree of choice, and on combining this with a socialization, habituation and training programme. Together these measures should significantly reduce and/or eliminate fear-related behavioural responses and stereotypic behaviours. They will also have a positive effect on the behavioural development of the dogs, helping to ensure that calm, confident, and well-adjusted individuals are issued to the end-use areas. This in turn will assist in the collection of reliable and accurate experimental data from dog studies and will avoid unnecessary wastage of life. The report represents a valuable resource for staff training. It should be read and thought about, and the recommendations acted upon, by all those involved with the management, care and use of dogs bred and used for research and testing. Where standards fall below those detailed here, a programme of improvement should be put in place. This should aim to achieve a proper balance between conspecific and human social interaction for dogs, and provide pens and other environments developed with an understanding of the natural behaviours of the dog, and empathetic personnel trained and competent to care for them. Employing a canine behaviour specialist can help to achieve these aims. It may be necessary for managers of facilities to rethink the way that dog husbandry and care has been practised in the past in order to allocate the time, staffing and funding required to implement the programme. Only through sincere commitment, adequate resources and sufficient will to change can significant reductions in suffering and improvements in animal welfare be guaranteed.},

abstract={Goals: Using the quantitative and statistical method to study the psychopathology of this disorder, we feel that melancholy underlies all anorexia, a structural psychological failing in the primary narcissistic personality instituted at the beginning of life. Melancholy entails its opposite, mania, manifested in anorexia through exhausting physical exercise and a perpetual binge-purge cycle, with continuous vomiting that damages teeth and the oesophagus, leading to malnutrition, dependence on laxatives, colic and inflammation of the anus. Amenorrhea increases the levels of cortisol, thus facilitating osteoporosis. Other symptoms observed include: cold skin, pain on sitting, lanugo, hair loss, low blood pressure, bradycardia, prolapses of the mitral valve or pericardial effusion. Less commonly, oedema or anaemia, despite the sufficient intake of iron and proteins. Sleep disorders and abandonment of normal activities have also been reported. Scope: Population of 30 patients previously diagnosed as having anorexia nervosa according to DSM-IV or CIE-10 parameters, without election by gender, either institutionalized or attending day hospital. Over 18 years of age and with their mental personality structure somewhat consolidated so that the results would not be altered by a lack of stability in this variable. This is a first exploratory statistical analysis with a transverse description of only 30 anorexic patients without any contrasting control group and is therefore not conclusive. The variables will have to be adjusted through larger subsequent studies to weigh up our observations. Results: From melancholic mania, the patients feel unique and special, through being able to go so long without eating. There is a corporal pleasure in all asceticism, as consumption modifies the perception of enjoyment. This triumph in solitude may recycle the anorexic eating pathology and turn it into something hard to reverse. Poor self-esteem often surrounds this condition. Patients, fixated on the maternal image, tend to undervalue their own, unable to withstand the development of the body or the internal tension this entails. Conclusions: Controlled exercise, improved nutrition and hormone treatment are currently the combined therapies applied in AN, with agreement being reached with patients on a specific personal diet of low volume, attempting to ensure the necessary minimum of fat and carbohydrates. With simultaneous psychological attention through an integral multidisciplinary approach in order to reduce the high prevalence of partially treated cases that accumulate over time.},

abstract={Brittle asthma is a rare form of severe asthma characterized by a wide variation of Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF), in spite of heavy doses of steroides. Brittle asthmatic patients had very serious and often, life threatening, attacks. Type 1 brittle asthma is characterized by a mantained PEF variability despite therapy, and it affected mostly female, aged between 15 and 55 years. Type 1 is associated to skin prick tests positivity and food intolerance. Several studies have referred a correlation with personality disorders. The patients affected with type 1 have high morbidity, and frequently they have hospital admission for assessment and stabilitation their asthmatic condition. Type 2 brittle asthma is characterized by acute attacks that are very severe and could led to death or mechanical ventilation for respiratory insufficiency. Brittle asthma is very difficult to recognize and to treat. In type 1 brittle asthma, the therapy is based on inhaled and/or oral steroids, and β2-agonists, used with an inhaler or with subcutaneous infusion. The patients affected with type 1 had to be nearly monitered and treated. Patients affected with type 2 brittle asthma, are mostly free by simptoms, but they have severe attacks that led them to emergency treatment. Brittle asthma is a rare form of severe asthma, that the clinicians may recognize and treat very strictly, because of high morbidity and mortality.},

abstract={Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a major component of neuronal membranes. In rats, low brain levels of DHA during development produce alterations in the mesocortical and mesolimbic dopamine systems. In this study, male Long-Evans rats (n=6-7 per group) were raised from conception on diets with (control) or without α-linolenic acid, the dietary precursor of DHA. The deficient diet reduced brain DHA to 80% of that of control animals at maturity. At weaning (P21), half of the pups from each deficient litter were changed to a remediation diet enriched in DHA by the addition of fish oil. Beginning at P56, rats were subjected to a battery of behavioral tests. Catalepsy induced by haloperidol (3 mg/kg, i.p.) in deficient animals was 49% of that observed in control animals (P<0.05). Catalepsy in remediated animals was similar to that observed for control animals. In a test of locomotor activity in a novel environment, deficient animals exhibited 187% of the activity of control animals (P<0.05). Locomotor activity stimulated by D-amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) in deficient animals was 145% of that observed in control animals (P<0.05). Basal and amphetamine-stimulated activity of remediated animals was similar to that of deficient animals. Response to a thermal stimulus was not different between groups. These findings demonstrate that rats exposed from conception to a diet that produces a relatively modest decrease in brain DHA content exhibit alterations in adult behavior indicative of altered dopaminergic function. Some of these behavioral alterations were reversed by dietary remediation initiated at weaning. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Sperm traits (morphology, motility and concentration within ejaculates) and various correlates of male quality (age, body condition, spawning location and timing) were studied in bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, breeding in both the interior and periphery of six colonies in Lake Opinicon, Ontario, Canada. Sperm traits varied significantly more among than within males suggesting that some aspect of male phenotype might influence sperm morphology and behaviour. No measures of male body condition or size were correlated with any sperm or ejaculate traits, when controlling statistically for confounding variables. Sperm swimming speed increased significantly with male age and varied significantly among spawning bouts (controlling for sperm tail length) suggesting that some unknown aspects of male quality might influence the fertilization capacity of spermatozoa. Sperm concentration in ejaculates was significantly higher in males nesting in the interior rather than the periphery of a colony suggesting that those males might also have higher fertilization capacity correlated with their superior dominance status or the lower risk of sperm competition. Thus, older males nesting in the interior of a colony during the first spawning bout of the season are expected to be the best sperm competitors in this population, but the physiological reasons for this increased fertilization capacity remain unknown. © 2004 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

abstract={In order to assess the significance of local adaptation relative to environmental plasticity on the evolution of life history traits, we analysed the possible genetic basis of differences between pond- and stream-breeding fire salamanders (Salamandra salamandra) in Germany. These salamanders typically deposit their larvae in small streams, where they grow until they are sufficiently large to metamorphose. However, some populations in Western Germany use ponds as larval habitat. Because habitat quality of streams differs from that of ponds one expects life history differences in the pond animals, which may result either from a plastic response or through genetic differentiation (i.e. local adaptation). Using a phylogeographical analysis of mitochondrial D-loop sequences, we show that both stream and pond populations in Western Germany are derived from a single lineage that recolonized following the last glaciation. This finding suggests that pond breeding originated very recently. Our studies of habitat quality and metamorphic behaviour of larvae in natural ponds and streams disclosed that pond larvae experience a significantly reduced food supply and greater risk of drying than do stream larvae. Pond larvae metamorphose earlier at the cost of reduced mass. Common-environment experiments with pond and stream larvae show that metamorphic behaviour of pond larvae under limited-food conditions is determined genetically and is not simply a plastic response to the differing habitat conditions. These results show that phenotypic plasticity is less important than local adaptation in explaining differences in ecological diversification within this species and suggests the possibility of rapid evolution of genetic adaptations when new habitats are exploited.},

abstract={Objectives: Social-cognitive models of health behaviour agree in their assumption that health behaviours like preventive nutrition are best predicted from variables such as risk perception, self-efficacy, outcome expectancies and behavioural intentions. It is hypothesised that the influence of these variables on nutrition varies depending on the perception of health threats in everyday life. Methods: Study 1 (N= 600, longitudinal, interval = 6 months) examined the influence of socialcognitive predictors of preventive nutritional habits under normal circumstances, i.e. no acute specific health threat. Study 2(N= 195, longitudinal, interval = 4 months) was conducted in a similar way addressing meat consumption during a life stock epidemic as an example for an acute specific health threat hypothesised to influence preventive nutrition. Both studies were analysed by means of structural equation models. Results: In both studies, intentions were predictable from risk perception, outcome expectancies and self-efficacy. In Study 1, outcome expectancies were the best predictor for intentions, while in Study 2 self-efficacy best predicted intentions. Nutritional behaviour in both studies was best predicted by intentions and self-efficacy. However, Study 2 also found a significant direct effect for risk perception on the intake of meat and beef products which was not found in Study 1. Conclusions: This suggests that risk perception, although being of minor importance for the explanation of nutritional habits under normal circumstances plays an important role for the adoption and maintenance of behavioural responses to acute health threats.},

abstract={Background. Previous research has shown significant associations between depression and substance use and eating disordered behaviors. However, no research to date has described associations between depressive symptoms and nutritional intake or physical activity among adolescents in a nonclinical, population-based sample. Methods. Classroom surveys were completed by 4,734 ethnically diverse, middle- and high school students. Based on their depressive symptom scores, males and females were categorized with low-, moderate-, or high-depressive symptom status. Linear models were used to examine eating and health behavior variables by depressive symptom groups. Results. Depressive symptoms were positively associated with health-compromising attitudes such as perceived barriers to healthy eating and weight concerns, and health-compromising behaviors such as unhealthy weight-control behaviors and substance use, including caffeine. Depressive symptoms were negatively associated with health-promoting behaviors such as eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner. However, most associations between depressive symptoms and dietary micronutrients were not statistically significant. Health-promoting moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was negatively associated with depressive symptoms among males. Conclusions. Adolescents who report depressive symptoms are at risk for other health-compromising attitudes and behaviors and are also less likely to engage in health-promoting behaviors. Depressive symptoms may be an underlying trait in the expression of health behaviors among adolescents. © 2004 The Institute For Cancer Prevention and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: The Well-Integrated Screening and Evaluation for Women Across the Nation (WISEWOMAN) program aims to remove racial and ethnic disparities in health by addressing the screening and intervention needs of midlife uninsured women. This paper describes the WISEWOMAN program requirements, the design of the 12 projects funded in 2002, the use of a standardized data reporting and analysis system, risk factors among participants, effective behavioral strategies, and plans for the future. Methods: The WISEWOMAN demonstration projects are examining the feasibility and effectiveness of adding a cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention component to the early detection of breast and cervical cancer. Women aged 40-64 are eligible if they are enrolled in the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) in selected U.S. states and are financially disadvantaged and lack health insurance. The primary outcome measures are blood pressure, lipid levels, and tobacco use. Intermediate measures include selfreported diet and physical activity, measures of readiness for change, and barriers to behavior change. Results: During 2002, the 10 projects that were fully operational screened 8164 financially disadvantaged women and developed culturally and regionally appropriate nutrition and physical activity interventions for a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds. Twenty-three percent of the women screened had high total cholesterol, with 48% of these being newly diagnosed. Thirty-eight percent of the women had high blood pressure, with 24% being newly diagnosed. Approximately, 75% of participants were either overweight or obese, and in some sites up to 42% were smokers. Conclusions: The WISEWOMAN demonstration projects have been successful at reaching financially disadvantaged and minority women who are at high risk for chronic diseases. These projects face challenges because they are generally implemented by safety net providers who have limited resources and staff to conduct research and evaluation. On the other hand, the findings from these projects will be especially informative in reducing health disparities because they are conducted in those settings where the most socially and medically vulnerable women receive care. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={Traditionally, the etiology of adult cardiovascular disease is divided into genetic factors, present environment and, in particular with regard to psychological characteristics, circumstances during childhood. In most cases, however, such factors explain only a minor proportion of the disease risk. During the recent decade, over 100 epidemiological studies in different populations have shown an association between low birthweight in subjects born at term and increased risk of adult cardiovascular disease. These epidemiological findings together with related experimental work have brought up the concept of programming - a process whereby a stimulus or insult, at a sensitive or 'critical' period of development, has lasting or lifelong significance. For health psychologists, the idea of early effects is obviously not new. The novelty lies within the recognition of long-term biologically measurable effects of defined pregnancy conditions, which range from frank medical disorders such as pre-eclampsia to relatively minor variations in maternal nutrition. Mechanisms of Programming: The mechanisms of programming are still poorly understood. Putative ones include lifelong alterations in organ size and function, the different key endocrine systems, and perhaps behaviour and personality. From the point of view of health psychology, the most consistent data available to date considers programming of hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) which is a key candidate to mediate the link between small size at birth and adult cardiovascular disease. Intriguing novel findings relate to a broader context: there is emerging evidence suggesting that conditions during the fetal life may have a significant impact on an individual's temperament and personality. The speakers of this session will enlighten different aspects of this emerging field of 'joined-up' science between medicine, biology and psychology.},

abstract={Objectives: To evaluate the effects of age and the presence of feeding pathologies on the relational modes during meals in a sample of mother-child pairs (n = 333), comparing groups of children in the first three years of life with normal development (ND-group, n = 211) and clinical groups of children who presented a diagnosis of feeding disorder and failure to thrive (FD-group, n = 122), and to show an association between specific symptomatic characteristics of the mother, of the child and the dysfunctional modes of their relationship during meals in a subgroup of mother-child pairs (n = 50), selected at random from the total clinical sample and paired with a control group chosen for this study. Methods: All mother-child pairs in the sample were observed in twenty-minute video-recordings during a meal, using the procedure of the Feeding Scale in the Italian version. A subgroup of mothers, selected at random from the total clinical sample, and paired with a control group, were given two self-reporting instruments for the evaluation of their psychological symptom status: the Eating Attitude Test and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, as well as two instruments for the evaluation of the infant temperament and emotional/behavioral functioning: the Baby and Toddler Behavior Questionnaires (from 1 to 18 months) and the Child Behavior Checklist 1½-5 (from 18 to 36 months). Results: Analysis of variance showed that the FD-group present interactional dysfunctional patterns during feeding and raise higher scores in symptomatic characteristics both of the mother and of the child, compared to ND-group. A set of correlation analyses (Pearson coefficients) showed an association among specific symptomatic characteristics of the mothers (dysfunctional eating attitudes, anxiety, depression, hostility), of their children (in particular, anxiety/depression, somatic complaints and aggressive behavior) and of their dysfunctional relational modes during feeding (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our study confirms that analysis of the individual characteristics of the child, of the mother and of their relationship during the development of feeding patterns in the first three years of the child’s life is extremely important in the clinical assessment of early feeding disorders, in order to establish a valid diagnostic methodology and formulate strategies for targeted and effective intervention. Furthermore, the results emphasize the clinical utility of our research in early identification of infants and toddlers at risk for feeding problems. © 2004 American College of Nutrition.},

abstract={Women experiencing domestic violence and/or homelessness may have undiagnosed brain damage as a result of abuse over time. Traditionally, women experiencing domestic violence have been diagnosed and treated within a psychiatric paradigm in which the women's personality deficits were thought to contribute to repeated patterns of abuse. This paradigm is increasingly challenged as researchers find that brain damage frequently occurs in women experiencing domestic violence. Such cognitive impairment may prevent women from using higher executive skills to leave the abusive environment, obtain employment needed for economic independence, and live independently in the community. The present study is an assessment of an intervention designed to address the cognitive deficits that may contribute to a woman's inability to leave the abusive environment. The intervention addressed (a) safety planning, (b) drug and alcohol awareness, (c) safe sex practices, (d) assertiveness and advocacy skill training, (e) anger management, (f) stress management, (g) boundary establishment and limit setting, (h) vocational and educational skill training, (i) money management, (j) housing application, (k) leisure exploration, and (l) hygiene, medication routine, and nutrition. Goal attainment scaling (GAS) was used to evaluate participant outcomes. The participants' raw GAS scores were converted to standardized T scores to indicate whether the participants achieved their expected outcome or greater. Eighty-one percent of the participants attained T scores above 50, indicating that they achieved their most favorable outcome. Nineteen percent of the participants attained T scores of 50, indicating that they achieved their expected outcome. None of the participants attained T scores less than 50, indicating that all participants achieved their expected outcome or greater. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={One manner to study the role of serotonin (5-HT) in behavioral functions is through nutritional manipulation of its precursor tryptophan (TRP). By means of the method of acute TRP depletion, plasma TRP levels can be reduced in a reversible way in both humans and rats. In the present study a TRP-free protein-carbohydrate mixture was used to investigate the behavioral effects of lowering TRP and 5-HT concentrations in adult male rats. These animals were tested in models of anxiety (open field, home cage emergence test), depression (forced swimming test) and cognition (object recognition test and Morris water escape test). The TRP-free protein-carbohydrate mixture substantially reduced the ratio TRP/ΣLNAA within 2 and 4h by 75 and 60%, respectively. It was found that 4h after administration, the treatment did not affect anxiety-related behavior nor did it cause depressive-like behavior. Also, no treatment effect was found on spatial learning performance in a Morris water escape test. On the other hand, performance in an object recognition test was clearly impaired after TRP depletion. Taken together, these data suggest that acute lowered central 5-HT levels are not associated with changes in affective behavior (i.e. anxiety and depression), but do impair object memory in adult rats. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The experiment reported was designed to test two hypotheses: that prenatal undernutrition (a) increases emotional reactivity and (b) impairs cognitive flexibility in sheep. The mothers of one group were fed live weight maintenance requirements throughout pregnancy (control, C) while those of another group were fed 50% of that amount from days 1 to 95 of pregnancy and 100% from then onwards (prenatal undernutrition, PU). At 18 months of age, PU sheep were more active during restraint (P<0.05) and approached a novel stimulus more slowly (P=0.02). In response to a sudden stimulus, PU males and C females showed a higher initial level of locomotion compared to C males, which only gradually declined, while PU females started at a high initial rate, changing rapidly to immobility. In a T-maze, PU resulted in a shift of side preferences (laterality) from a general right-bias to neutrality in males and to a left-bias in females (P<0.05). In the two reversal tasks, C males and PU females had a preference for one side over the other, while PU males showed no preference. In contrast to C males, PU males failed to improve their learning speed from the first to the second reversal (P<0.05). It is concluded that PU can lead to increased emotional reactivity and changes in side preference in both sexes and impaired cognitive flexibility in males. Undernutrition during pregnancy, therefore, not only affects the welfare of the dam, but also the personality of her offspring. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The functional response of a consumer is the relationship between its consumption rate and the abundance of its food. A functional response is said to be of type I if consumption rate increases linearly with food abundance up to a threshold level at which it remains constant. According to conventional wisdom, such type I responses are more frequent among filter feeders than among other consumers. However, the validity of this claim has never been tested. We review 814 functional responses from 235 studies, thereby showing that type I responses are not only exceptionally frequent among filter feeders but that they have only been reported from these consumers. These findings can be understood by considering the conditions that a consumer must fulfil in order to show a type I response. First, the handling condition: the consumer must have a negligibly small handling time (i.e. the time needed for capturing and eating a food item), or it must be able to search for and to capture food while handling other food. Second, the satiation condition: unless its gut is completely filled and gut passage time is minimal, the consumer must search for food at a maximal rate with maximal effort. It thus has to spend much time on foraging (i.e. searching for food and handling it). Our functional response review suggests that only filter feeders sometimes meet both of these conditions. This suggestion is reasonable because filter feeders typically fulfil the handling condition and can meet the satiation condition without losing time, for they are, by contrast to non-filter feeders, able simultaneously to perform foraging and non-foraging activities, such as migration or reproduction.},

abstract={Commercially reared ostrich chicks are typically kept in barren, indoor environments. This experiment investigated the effects of environmental enrichment on the pecking behaviour, exploration, food consumption and novelty responses of ostrich chicks aged 10 to 21 days. Four groups of 20 randomly selected ostrich chicks were housed in heated huts at one day of age (Day 1), and at Day 10 were allowed access to sand-covered areas (30 m2) that were either barren (control: n = 2 groups) or enriched with cabbage, coniferous cones and sticks (enriched: n = 2 groups). Pecking behaviour was recorded by focal sampling the behaviour of five chicks per group for four 5 min periods per day on Day 10 and Day 13. All enriched chicks pecked at the cabbage, of which they consumed considerable amounts (26 ± 3 g/chick/day). The enriched chicks did not have higher overall pecking frequencies but tended to peck less at fixtures in the pen, compared to control chicks. Additionally, the enriched chicks showed increased exploration in terms of the percentage of chicks observed outside the heated huts. In a novel object test, enriched chicks stayed closer to and delivered more pecks at sorrel (Rumex acetosa) than did control chicks, whereas there was no difference between the treatment groups in their response to adult ostrich feathers. Enriched chicks consumed more food (79 ± 0.4g/chick/day) than did control chicks (67 ± 0.9 g/chick/day) during the experimental period. We suggest that environmental enrichment improves the welfare of ostrich chicks in terms of increasing exploration and reducing pecking at fixtures in the pen, without compromising food consumption. © 2004 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.},

abstract={Adipokinetic hormones (AKHs) are metabolic neuropeptides, mediating mobilization of energy substrates from the fat body in many insects. In delving into the roles of the Drosophila Akh (dAkh) gene, its developmental expression patterns were examined and the physiological functions of the AKH-producing neurons were investigated using animals devoid of AKH neurons and ones with ectopically expressing dAkh. The dAkh gene is expressed exclusively in the corpora cardiaca from late embryos to adult stages. Projections emanating from the AKH neurons indicated that AKH has multiple target tissues as follows: the prothoracic gland and aorta in the larva and the crop and brain in the adult. Studies using transgenic manipulations of the dAkh gene demonstrated that AKH induced both hypertrehalosemia and hyperlipemia. Starved wild-type flies displayed prolonged hyperactivity prior to death; this novel behavioral pattern could be associated with food-searching activities in response to starvation. In contrast, flies devoid of AKH neurons not only lacked this type of hyperactivity, but also displayed strong resistance to starvation-induced death. From these findings, we propose another role for AKH in the regulation of starvation-induced foraging behavior.},

abstract={Objective. Infants who are born small for gestational age (SGA) are at risk for developmental delays, which may be related to deficiencies in zinc, an essential trace metal, or to deficiencies in their ability to elicit caregiver responsiveness (functional isolation hypothesis). The objective of this study was to evaluate at 6 and 10 months of age the impact of a 9-month supplementation trial of 5 mg of zinc on the development and behavior of infants who were born SGA and to evaluate infants' ability to elicit responsive caregiver behavior. Methods. A randomized, controlled trial of zinc supplementation was conducted among 200 infants in a low-income, urban community in Delhi, India. Infants were recruited when they were full term (>36 weeks) and SGA (birth weight <10th percentile weight-for-gestational age). Infants were randomized to receive daily supplements of a micronutrient mix (folate, iron, calcium, phosphorus, and riboflavin) with or without 5 mg of zinc sulfate. The supplement was administered by field workers daily from 30 days to 9 months of age. At 6 and 10 months, infant development and behavior were measured in a clinical setting using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II. Caregiver responsiveness, observed on an Indian version of the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment scale, was measured during a home visit at 10 months. During both the clinic and home visits, caregivers reported on their infant's temperament. Results. There were no direct effects of zinc supplementation on the infants' development or behavior at either 6 or 10 months. In a subgroup analysis among the zinc-supplemented infants, lower birth weight infants were perceived to be more temperamentally difficult than higher weight infants; in the control group, birth weight was not associated with temperament. Heavier birth weight infants had better scores on all measures of development and behavior at 6 months and on changes in mental and motor development from 6 to 10 months, compared with lighter birth weight infants. Boys had better weight gain and higher scores on mental development and emotional regulation than girls. Infants who were from families of higher socioeconomic status (indexed by parental education, house size, and home ownership) had higher scores on mental development and orientation/engagement (exploratory behavior) than infants who were from families of lower socioeconomic status. In keeping with the functional isolation hypothesis, caregiver responsiveness was associated with infant irritability, controlling for socioeconomic status, gender, birth weight, and weight gain. Responsive mothers were more likely to perceive their infants to be temperamentally easy than less responsive mothers. Conclusion. Possible explanations for the lack of effects of zinc supplementation on infant development and behavior include 1) subtle effects of zinc supplementation that may not have been detected by the Bayley Scales, 2) interference with other nutritional deficiencies, or 3) no impact of zinc deficiency on infants' development and behavior. The link between birth weight and irritability among infants in the zinc supplementation group suggests that the response to zinc supplementation may differ by birth weight, with irritability occurring among the most vulnerable infants. Longer term follow-up studies among zinc-supplemented infants are needed to examine whether early supplementation leads to developmental or behavioral changes that have an impact on school-age performance. The relationship between infant irritability and low maternal responsiveness lends support to the functional isolation hypothesis and the importance of asking caregivers about infant temperament.},

Group differences were expected in reported injury incidence and in the prevalence and impact of contributing factors. As predicted, White mothers reported more injuries for a young child, and among Hispanic mothers, English language preference and use were associated with more reported injuries. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that risky behaviors, mother's judgment about child compliance, and stressful life events were better predictors of injuries than housing quality, but among Hispanics, the impact of certain factors (e.g., child temperament) was qualified by mother's acculturation level. Stress and child temperament explained injury differences between more- and less-acculturated Hispanic families but only partially accounted for differences between White mothers and less-acculturated Hispanics. Pediatric injury risk and protective factors seemed to operate in concert with cultural processes.},

abstract={This review focuses on the evolutionary causes and consequences of limited attention, defined as the restricted rate of information processing by the brain. The available data suggest, first, that limited attention is a major cognitive constraint determining animals' search for cryptic food, and, second, that limited attention reduces animals' ability to detect predators while involved in challenging tasks such as searching for cryptic food. These two effects of limited attention probably decrease animal fitness. Furthermore, a simulated evolutionary study provides empirical support for the prediction that focused attention by predators selects for prey polymorphism. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying limited attention have been widely studied. A recent incorporation of that mechanistic knowledge into an ecological model suggests that limited attention is an optimal strategy that balances effective yet economical search for cryptic objects. The review concludes with a set of testable predictions aimed to expand the currently limited empirical knowledge on the evolutionary ecology of limited attention. Copyright © 2004 S.

abstract={Accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides in the brain has been suggested to be the primary event in sequential progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we use Drosophila to examine whether expression of either the human Aβ40 or Aβ42 peptide in the Drosophila brain can induce pathological phenotypes resembling AD. The expression of Aβ42 led to the formation of diffused amyloid deposits, age-dependent learning defects, and extensive neurodegeneration. In contrast, expression of Aβ40 caused only age-dependent learning defects but did not lead to the formation of amyloid deposits or neurodegeneration. These results strongly suggest that accumulation of Aβ42 in the brain is sufficient to cause behavioral deficits and neurodegeneration. Moreover, Drosophila may serve as a model for facilitating the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying Aβ toxicity and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for AD.},

abstract={We consider a cooperatively breeding group and find the optimal pattern of reproductive parasitism by a subordinate helper as a function of its body size, and hence the share of reproduction obtained by the subordinate. We develop the model for the social system of the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher but the general framework is also applicable to other cooperative systems. In addition to behaving cooperatively by sharing tasks, sexually mature male cichlid helpers may directly parasitize the reproduction of dominant breeders in the group. We investigate the relative influence of life history and behavioural variables including growth, parasitism capacity, future reproductive fitness benefits and costs, relatedness and expulsion risk on the optimal reproductive strategy of subordinates. In a detailed analysis of the parameter space we show that a male helper should base its decision to parasitize primarily on an increase in expulsion risk resulting from reproductive parasitism (punishment), intra-group relatedness and the parasitism capacity. If expulsion risk is high then helpers should not parasitize reproduction at medium body size but should parasitize either when small or large. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Diana monkeys (Cercopithecus diana) produce different alarm calls to two predators: crowned eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus) and leopards (Panthera pardus). Yellow-casqued hornbills (Ceratogymna elata) are vulnerable to predation by crowned eagles but are not preyed on by leopards and might therefore be expected to respond to the Diana monkey eagle alarm call but not to the leopard alarm call. We compared responses of hornbills to playback of eagle shrieks, leopard growls, Diana monkey eagle alarm calls and Diana monkey leopard alarm calls and found that they distinguished appropriately between the two predator vocalizations as well as between the two Diana monkey alarm calls. We discuss possible mechanisms leading to these responses.},

abstract={A behavioral technique was developed that allowed the onset and recovery of tinnitus to be measured in individual rats treated with different doses of salicylate. Food-restricted rats were self-trained to lick for water during the time between scheduled delivery of food pellets, i.e., schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP). SIP-induced licking was placed under stimulus control by administering foot shock if licks occurred when sound (one of six stimuli, 40 dB SPL) was present; rats were allowed to lick during quiet. After the number of licks-in-quiet (correct response) exceeded 90% of total licks, rats were treated with saline and four different doses of salicylate (50, 100, 150 and 350 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.); 2 days). Performance was assessed before, during and after treatment. Licks-in-sound remained extremely low with saline and all four salicylate doses indicating that the sounds were audible under all treatment conditions. Licks-in-quiet remained high during the saline control and 50 mg/kg dose of salicylate, behavior consistent with the absence of tinnitus. However, licks-in-quiet showed a statistically significant decline with the 150 and 350 mg/kg dose, behavior consistent with the presence of tinnitus. Licks-in-quiet gradually recovered to baseline level 2-3 days following high-dose salicylate treatments, behavior consistent with the gradual disappearance of tinnitus. The salicylate dose needed to induce tinnitus and the length of recovery are consistent with previous reports, providing support for the method. The ability to obtain sequential estimates of tinnitus-like behavior in an animal after administering a tinnitus-inducing agent could aid in understanding the underlying neural mechanisms and assessing potential treatments. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={A wasting syndrome in moose (Alces alces L.) was investigated. Twenty-five animals exhibiting poor body condition and abnormal behaviour were killed, necropsied and sampled in the field. The abnormal behaviour comprised incoordination, ataxia, circling movements, apathy, lack of normal flight behaviour and recumbency. The diseased moose all exhibited a very poor condition or emaciation. Macroscopic lesions, resembling those of bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD)/mucosal disease, were present in the mucous membranes of all animals affected. Microscopic evidence was lacking. Marked oedema and hyperaemia was regularly found in the abomasal wall. Cerebellar abiotrophy was found in 14 animals and suspected in 6. Antibodies against BVD virus were detected in 9 of 21 examined diseased moose. Low to extremely low copper tissue levels were recorded, while molybdenum levels were high in some and low in other moose. It was concluded that starvation was the basic causative factor. The ability of plants such as birch (Betula spp.) and pine (Pinus spp.) to produce anti-herbivory compounds, contributing to a state of malnutrition, is discussed.},

abstract={The effects of predation risk on foraging behavior often result in a trade-off between obtaining food and seeking shelter and may alter the selectivity of herbivores for individual plant species. We experimentally measured forage selection by a small alpine herbivore, the collared pika (Ochotona collaris (Nelson, 1893)), using a cafeteria-style arrangement of six potential forage species at five levels of predation risk. Contrary to our prediction, haying pikas did not switch preferences for forage species of different nutritional quality as predation risk increased. However, the total amount of forage removed was inversely related to risk, and the addition of cover at treatments of greatest potential risk ameliorated the negative effects of higher predation risk. The reasons for increased preference for poorer quality forage species in 2002 relative to 2000 are currently unknown but may reflect changes in predator abundance, forage quality, or increased competition for limited forage resources.},

abstract={Sensitivity to reward (STR) - a personality trait firmly rooted in the neurobiology of the mesolimbic dopamine system - has been strongly implicated in the risk for addiction. This construct describes the ability to derive pleasure or reward from natural reinforcers like food, and from pharmacologic rewards like addictive drugs. Recently experts in the field of addiction research have acknowledged that psychomotor stimulant drugs are no longer at the heart of all addictions, and that brain circuits can also be deranged with natural rewards like food. The present study tested a model in which STR was expected to relate positively to overeating, which in turn would be associated with higher body weight in woman aged 25-45 years. As predicted, STR was correlated positively with measures of emotional overeating. Also, overweight woman were significantly more sensitive to reward than those of normal weight. Interestingly, however, the obese woman (Body Mass Index>30) were more anhedonic than the overweight woman (Body Mass Index>25<30). These findings are discussed in the context of neuroadaptations to overactivity of brain reward circuits. Results also indicate that STR may serve as a risk factor for overeating and overweight, especially in cultures such as ours where palatable, calorically-dense food is plentiful. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Objective: To examine the contribution to fruit and vegetable eating in children of potential predictive variables within the domains of demographics, parental feeding practices and personality traits. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Questionnaires were distributed to parents through 22 London nursery schools. Subjects: Questionnaires were completed and returned by 564 parents or principal caregivers of 2-6-year-old children. Results: Significant predictors of children's fruit and vegetable intake emerged from all three domains examined. Demographic variables associated with child's vegetable consumption were mother's education and child's age and gender. Only ethnicity was significantly associated with fruit consumption. Parental consumption, breast-feeding and early introduction to fruit and vegetables were related to intake of both. Family mealtimes were associated with higher intake of vegetables, but not of fruit. Two characteristics of children themselves (food neophobia and enjoyment of food) were strongly related to the consumption of fruit and vegetables. Subsequent multivariate analyses revealed that parental intake and child food neophobia independently predicted intake of both foods. In the presence of these, fruit consumption was affected by breast-feeding and early introduction to fruit, whereas vegetable consumption was related only to child's gender and enjoyment of food. Conclusions: These findings may be used to inform future interventions aimed at increasing children's consumption of fruit and vegetables. Parents should be made aware of the possible impact of their own behaviour on the eating habits of their children.},

abstract={Spontaneous hypoglycemia is uncommon in the general (nondiabetic) population, but iatrogenic hypoglycemia is rife in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, among whom hypoglycemia constitutes a barrier to optimal glycemic control. The obligate dependence on exogenous insulin, together with the current imperfection in insulin therapies, generates degrees of blood glucose fluctuations that often exceed physiological boundaries in these patients. Downward swings in blood glucose levels, if sustained, result in hypoglycemia and significant morbidity and mortality. Hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes indicates an imbalance between caloric supply and glucose use in response to insulin or exercise. Counterregulatory mechanisms that auto-correct iatrogenic hypoglycemia often become progressively impaired in these patients. This defective counterregulation, together with the imperfections in insulin delivery, set the stage for significant morbidity from iatrogenic hypoglycemia. Recurrent episodes of iatrogenic hypoglycemia induce a state of hypoglycemia unawareness and defective counterregulation, which defines the syndrome of hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF). The reduced awareness of, and counterregulatory responses to, hypoglycemia in patients with HAAF lead to worsening episodes of severe hypoglycemia. Approaches to the prevention of hypoglycemia include glucose monitoring, patient education, meal planning, and medication adjustment. In patients with HAAF, scrupulous avoidance of iatrogenic hypoglycemia may restore the symptomatic and counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia. Behavioral training focusing on recognition of the more subtle symptoms and signs of evolving hypoglycemia may be beneficial to some patients with HAAF. A methodical search for the pattern and etiology of iatrogenic hypoglycemia is a prerequisite for the identification of the best preventive approach. With proper education, patients with type 1 diabetes and their physicians can learn to prevent or minimize the risk of hypoglycemia while pursuing excellence in glycemic control.},

These studies, which varied in foods consumed, settings, and populations, indicated that common dietary restraint scales were largely uncorrelated with acute caloric intake. Results suggest that these scales are not valid measures of short-term dietary restriction and imply that it may be prudent to reinterpret findings from studies that use these scales, including those that suggest dietary restraint is a risk factor for bulimic pathology.},

abstract={Rationale: It has been demonstrated that major differences between mice of the C57BL/6J and DBA/2J inbred strains for amphetamine-induced place conditioning (preference and avoidance, respectively) are evident in standard housing conditions but abolished by temporary restricted feeding. This gene-experience model may be usefully exploited to dissect behavioral phenotypes related to place conditioning induced by addictive drugs. Objectives: This study evaluated a number of behavioral phenotypes related to amphetamine-induced place preference for strain differences (C57BL/6J vs DBA/2J) susceptible to be abolished by temporary food restriction. Methods: Mice of the two inbred strains were tested for: (1) conditioned taste aversion and place preference induced by amphetamine within the same dose-range; (2) preference for a novel compartment 24 h after a single exposure to only one of two compartments; (3) amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization and conditioned hyperactivity; and (4) locomotor activity during exploration of a novel environment. Results: The two strains showed consistent taste aversion at doses of amphetamine that promoted opposite strain-dependent place conditioning. Both strains spent more time exploring the novel rather than the known compartment of the place conditioning apparatus. Instead, only mice of the C57 strain showed amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization and conditioned hyperactivity. However, temporary food restriction did not affect strain differences for these phenotypes. Finally, C57 mice were more active than DBA in a novel environment and restricted feeding abolished this strain-dependent difference. Conclusions: These results relate individual differences for amphetamine-induced place conditioning with locomotor response to amphetamine and novelty.},

abstract={Omega (n)-3 and n-6 fatty acids are important membrane components of neurons and immune cells, and related to psychiatric and inflammatory diseases. Increased ratio of n-6/n-3 in the blood has been reported in depressed patients and in students following stress exposure. The n-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (ethyl-EPA) suppresses inflammation and has antidepressant properties. Interleukin (IL)-1β can stimulate corticosterone secretion, induce anxiety and stress-like behavior and inflammatory responses. This study was to evaluate the effect of diets enriched with coconut oil, ethyl-EPA and soybean oil on central IL-1β induced stress and anxiety-like behavior, induced changes in the concentration of prostaglandin (PG) E2 and corticosterone and the release of IL-10. Groups of rats were fed with either 5% coconut oil (as control diet), 0.2% EPA with 4.8% coconut oil or 1% EPA with 4% coconut oil and 5% soybean oil for 7 weeks. The central administration of IL-1β induced sickness, stress and anxiety-like behavior as indicated by a reduction in body weight, decreased time spent, and the number of entries, into the open arms of the elevated plus maze and decreased exploration and entry into the central zone of the "open field" apparatus. IL-1β also increased PGE2 and corticosterone concentrations and decreased the release of IL-10 from leucocytes. Food enriched with ethyl-EPA but not soybean oil, significantly attenuated most of these changes. These results demonstrate that ethyl-EPA has anti-inflammatory, anti-stress and anti-anxiety effects in rats.},

abstract={Birds selecting a nest site have to find the best compromise between the risk of encountering predation, the availability of food near to the nest and microclimatic requirements. As the optimal solution of this problem will vary with changes in predator abundance, we ask whether birds are capable of assessing such changes and of adjusting their nest-site choice accordingly. The reproductive success of dusky warblers Phylloscopus fuscatus, breeding in a mosaic of bushland and tundra habitat in the Russian Far East, varied greatly depending on the abundance of a nest predator, the Siberian chipmunk Tamias sibiricus. Using artificial nests we analysed which strategies dusky warblers should follow to avoid nest predation by chipmunks. We then compared the nest sites which dusky warblers actually had chosen in years with very high chipmunk densities (1998 and 1999) with those chosen in 1997, when chipmunks were almost absent from the study area. We found that safe nest-sites were preferred over those offering other advantages (microclimate, proximity to food) when the risk of predation was high, and we could not detect any confounding factor that might alternatively have caused these striking between-year differences. Our study suggests that even a short-lived passerine may be capable of choosing its nest site according to the actual predation risk. We show that such behavioural plasticity can lead to a paradoxical situation where better-protected nest-sites (selected in years and areas with high risk), on average, suffer greater predation than sites offering low safety. Thus, behavioural plasticity, if undetected, may result in serious misinterpretation of nest-predation patterns. A review of the literature suggests that adaptive plasticity in nest placement may be more widespread than is currently recognized.},

abstract={Winter is energetically challenging for small herbivores because of greater energy requirements for thermogenesis at a time when little energy is available. We formulated a model predicting optimal wintering body size, accounting for the scaling of both energy expenditure and assimilation to body size, and the trade-off between survival benefits of a large size and avoiding survival costs of foraging. The model predicts that if the energy cost of maintaining a given body mass differs between environments, animals should be smaller in the more demanding environments, and there should be a negative correlation between body mass and daily energy expenditure (DEE) across environments. In contrast, if animals adjust their energy intake according to variation in survival costs of foraging, there should be a positive correlation between body mass and DEE. Decreasing temperature always increases equilibrium DEE, but optimal body mass may either increase or decrease in colder climates depending on the exact effects of temperature on mass-specific survival and energy demands. Measuring DEE with doubly labeled water on wintering Microtus agrestis at four field sites, we found that DEE was highest at the sites where voles were smallest despite a positive correlation between DEE and body mass within sites. This suggests that variation in wintering body mass between sites was due to variation in food quality/availability and not adjustments in foraging activity to varying risks of predation.},

abstract={We present an individual-based, spatially-explicit model of the dynamics of a small mammal and its resource. The life histories of each individual animal are modeled separately. The individuals can have the status of residents or wanderers and belong to behaviorally differing groups of juveniles or adults and males or females. Their territory defending and monogamous behavior is taken into consideration. The resource, green vegetation, grows depending on seasonal climatic characteristics and is diminished due to the herbivore's grazing. Other specifics such as a varying personal energetic level due to feeding and starvation of the individuals, mating preferences, avoidance of competitors, dispersal of juveniles, as a result of site overgrazing, etc., are included in the model. We determined model parameters from real data for the species Microtus ochrogaster (prairie vole). The simulations are done for a case of an enclosed habitat without predators or other species competitors. The goal of the study is to find the relation between size of habitat and population persistence. The experiments with the model show the populations go extinct due to severe overgrazing, but that the length of population persistence depends on the area of the habitat as well as on the presence of fragmentation. Additionally, the total population size of the vole population obtained during the simulations exhibits yearly fluctuations as well as multi-yearly peaks of fluctuations. This dynamics is similar to the one observed in prairie vole field studies. © 2004 Académie des sciences. Published by Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Carotenoid-dependent plumage displays are widely assumed to be honest indicators of individual health or quality, which are used as cues during mate choice and/or agonistic signalling. Despite the fact that red, yellow and orange pigmentation of bills is common, and also variable between individuals, comparatively little is known about bill colouration as a condition-dependent trait. Furthermore, many studies of avian colouration are confounded by the lack of objective colour quantification and the use of overly simplistic univariate techniques for analysis of the relationship between the condition-dependent trait and individual quality variables. In this study, we correlated male blackbird bill colour (a likely carotenoid-dependent sexually selected trait) with body/condition variables that reflect male quality. We measured bill colour using photometric techniques, thus ensuring objectivity. The data were analysed using the multivariate statistical techniques of canonical ordination. Analyses based on reflectance spectra of male blackbird bill samples and colour components (i.e. hue, chroma and brightness) derived from the reflectance spectra were very similar. Analysing the entire reflectance spectra of blackbird bill samples with Redundancy Analysis (RDA) allowed examination of individual wavelengths and their specific associations with the body/condition variables. However, hue, chroma and brightness values also provided useful information to explain colour variation, and the two approaches may be complimentary. We did not find any significant associations between male blackbird bill colour and percent incidence of ectoparasites or cloaca size. However, both the colour component and full spectral analyses showed that culmen length explained a significant amount of variation in male blackbird bill colour. Culmen length was positively associated with greater reflectance from the bill samples at longer wavelengths and a higher hue value (i.e. more orange-pigmented bills). Larger males may have larger territories or be better at defending territories during male-male interactions, ensuring access to carotenoid food sources. Future studies should elucidate the relationship between bill colour and behavioural measures such as aggressiveness, territory size, song rate and nest attendance. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The motivation of juvenile rabbits to graze was tested by offering a choice of coarse mix or grass as rewards to rabbits fed a nutritionally adequate diet of carrots and hay. Before measuring the motivation of the 16 rabbits, eight were offered access to grass for 16 days and the remaining eight were kept in outdoor hutches. An initial preference test was then conducted using a Y-maze apparatus, in which the rabbits were offered a choice of grass or coarse mix for 3 min. The rabbits that had not previously been offered grass had a strong preference for the grass reward, whereas those that had chose coarse mix and grass equally. Measurement of rabbits' behaviour during the reward period revealed that rabbits spent longer eating if their reward was grass; this difference was particularly notable toward the end of the 3 min period. If they received a coarse mix reward, they spent more of the 3 min self-grooming, standing still and chewing the wire of the cage. Feeding rabbits with a coarse mix diet may therefore increase the likelihood of problem behaviours including inactivity and trichophagia. The rabbits were also trained in a novel operant test of motivation for the two rewards, in which they were required to circumnavigate an object several times before receiving a reward. The number of circumnavigations before a reward was offered was progressively increased, and rabbits were offered two opportunities to take the reward at each level. Although the rabbits were prepared to circumnavigate the object up to 11 times on average, there was little evidence that they would work harder for a grass reward than for a coarse mix reward. This may have been because they had previously had experience of grass during the preference tests. It is concluded that juvenile rabbits show a strong initial preference for a grass reward, compared with coarse mix, but that this preference disappears after brief exposure to grass. There was no strong evidence that rabbits will work harder to receive a grass reward than to receive a coarse mix reward.},

abstract={In Drosophila melanogaster food search behaviour, groups of flies swarm around and aggregate on patches of food. We wondered whether flies explore their environment in a cooperative way as interactions between individual flies within a population might influence the flies' ability to locate food sources. We have shown that the food search behavior in the fruit fly Drosophila is a two-step process. Firstly, 'primer' flies search the environment and randomly land on different food patches. Secondly, the remaining group of flies move to the most favorable food source and aggregate there. We call this a 'search-aggregation' cycle. Our data demonstrate that flies do not individually assess all available food resources. Rather, social interactions between flies appear to affect their choice of a specific food patch. A genetic analysis of this 'search-aggregation' behavior shows that flies carrying mutations in specific genes (for example, the dunce (dnc) gene which codes for a phosphodiesterase) were defective in this search-aggregation behavior when compared to normal flies. Future investigations of the neuronal signaling involved in this behavior will help us to understand the complexities of this aspect of Drosophila social behaviour.},

abstract={The present studies examine some parameters involved in flavor avoidance learning, using LiCl to induce malaise, in a novel nondeprivation protocol that allows direct comparison between rats and mice. The procedure involves daily presentation of a gelatin dessert that contains carbohydrate (Polycose) and a distinctive food flavor. Regular chow is additionally available at all times. Both rats and mice showed robust intakes of these gels with little change of gram intake as concentration of Polycose was varied in the range 2-30%; at the highest concentration, the caloric yield was ∼7% of normal daily intake in both species. Rats that were injected on three occasions with LiCl (0.75 meq/kg) 1 h after consumption of a flavored gel formed a complete and sustained conditioned flavor avoidance (CFA). In a two-flavor discrimination protocol, in which a second flavor was followed by injections of saline, rats showed complete avoidance of the LiCl-paired flavor and partial avoidance of the saline-paired flavor. Mice injected on three occasions with LiCl (6 meq/kg) 1 h after intake of a flavored gel formed a partial CFA; a more complete CFA was formed when there was no delay between removal of the flavor and the injection. Using this no-delay protocol, mice, like rats, showed avoidance of a saline-paired flavor in a two-flavor discrimination protocol, and the CFA was strong when the dose of LiCl was reduced to that used in rats (0.75 meq/kg). In comparable protocols, mice thus are able to form complete CFAs using low doses of LiCl that are comparable to CFAs observed in rats, but the interval between flavor and sickness over which associative learning can occur may be shorter in mice.},

abstract={We review socially biased learning about food and problem solving in monkeys, relying especially on studies with tufted capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) and callitrichid monkeys. Capuchin monkeys most effectively learn to solve a new problem when they can act jointly with an experienced partner in a socially tolerant setting and when the problem can be solved by direct action on an object or substrate, but they do not learn by imitation. Capuchin monkeys are motivated to eat foods, whether familiar or novel, when they are with others that are eating, regardless of what the others are eating. Thus, social bias in learning about foods is indirect and mediated by facilitation of feeding. In most respects, social biases in learning are similar in capuchins and callitrichids, except that callitrichids provide more specific behavioral cues to others about the availability and palatability of foods. Callitrichids generally are more tolerant toward group members and coordinate their activity in space and time more closely than capuchins do. These characteristics support stronger social biases in learning in callitrichids than in capuchins in some situations. On the other hand, callitrichids' more limited range of manipulative behaviors, greater neophobia, and greater sensitivity to the risk of predation restricts what these monkeys learn in comparison with capuchins. We suggest that socially biased learning is always the collective outcome of interacting physical, social, and individual factors, and that differences across populations and species in social bias in learning reflect variations in all these dimensions. Progress in understanding socially biased learning in nonhuman species will be aided by the development of appropriately detailed models of the richly interconnected processes affecting learning.},

abstract={Predator-induced defenses can result from non-contact cues associated with the presence of a feeding predator; however, the nature of the predator cue has not been determined. We tested the role of two non-contact cues, metabolites of digestion of conspecific prey released by the predator and alarm pheromones released by attacked conspecific prey, in the development of inducible defenses by exposing pinewoods tree frog (Hyla femoralis) tadpoles to non-lethal dragonfly (Anax junius) larvae fed either inside experimental bins or removed from the bins for feeding to eliminate alarm pheromones. The costs associated with the development of the induced morphology were also investigated by providing the tadpoles with two food levels intended to provide adequate or growth limiting resources. The generalized morphological response of H. femoralis tadpoles to predators included the development of bodies and tails that were both deeper and shorter, smaller overall body size, and increased orange tail fin coloration and black tail outline. Metabolites of digestion were sufficient to initiate development of inducible defenses; however, the combination of metabolites and alarm cue resulted in a greater response. Furthermore, growth and development were slowed in tadpoles that expressed the induced morphology; however, this growth cost was insufficient to preclude the development of the induced morphology when food resources were low. These results indicate that two aspects of the indirect predator cue work together to trigger a morphological anti-predator response.},

abstract={The risk of infanticide may alter foraging decisions made by females, which otherwise would have been based on nutritional requirements and forage quality and availability. In systems where meat resources are spatially aggregated in late summer and fall, female brown bears (Ursus arctos) would be faced with a trade-off situation. The need of reproductive females to accumulate adequate fat stores would likely result in a decision to frequent salmon streams and consume the protein- and lipid-rich spawning salmon. In contrast, aggregations of bears along salmon streams would create conditions of high risk of infanticide. We investigated consumption of salmon by brown bears on Admiralty and Chichagof Islands in Southeast Alaska from 1982 to 2000 using stable isotope analysis and radiotelemetry. While nearly all males (22 of 23) consumed relatively large amounts of salmon (i.e., &gt;10% relative contribution to seasonal diet), not all females (n =56) did so. Five of 26 females for which we had reproductive data, occupied home ranges that had no access to salmon and thus did not consume salmon when they were mated or accompanied by young. Of females that had access to salmon streams (n =21), all mated individuals (n =16) had δ15N values indicative of salmon consumption. In contrast, 4 out of 16 females with cubs avoided consuming salmon altogether, and of the other 12, 3 consumed less salmon than they did when they were mated. For 11 of 21 females with access to salmon streams we had data encompassing both reproductive states. Five of those altered foraging strategies and exhibited significantly lower values of δ15N when accompanied by young than when mated, while 6 did not. Radiotelemetry data indicated that females with spring cubs were found, on average, further away from streams during the spawning season compared with females with no young, but both did not differ from males and females with yearlings and 2-year-olds. Females with young that avoided salmon streams were significantly lighter indicating that female choice to avoid consumption of salmon carries a cost that may translate to lower female or cub survivorship. The role of the social hierarchy of males and females, mating history, and paternity in affecting the risk of infanticide and foraging decisions of female brown bears merit further investigation.},

abstract={Information on the widespread function of the suprachiasmatic (SCN) pacemaker has increased dramatically in the past decade for laboratory rodents and for humans. Interest is now also growing in the adaptive value of SCN pacemakers in wild species of free-living mammals in natural pristine habitat. The squirrel family, Sciuridae, is highly diverse in North America. Radiation into many specialized groups has evolved in response to the temporal and spatial characteristics of specific habitats. The sciurids thus offer possibilities for comparison of SCN function for closely related species from very different habitats. Results from field and laboratory investigations concerning the ecological significance of the SCN are reported here for three ground squirrel species. The semi-fossorial antelope squirrels of the American south-west deserts were arrhythmic in above ground activities after deletion of the SCN pacemaker. In a desert enclosure, predation rates rose dramatically for lesioned animals in comparison to intact controls. The semi-arborial chipmunks were prone to capture by mustelid burrow predators such as weasels after SCN-deletion, even though the chipmunks did not exhibit any above ground activity at night. The telltale cue for the predator was apparently arrhythmic restlessness within the complex home burrow. The semi-fossorial golden-mantled squirrels of the Cascade Mountains of western United States rely on profound, long-lasting hibernation for over-wintering. Periods of torpor alternate with brief euthermic arousal episodes lasting less than 24 h throughout the 5- to 8-month winter phase. Deletion of the SCN in golden-mantled squirrels resulted in aberrations of hibernation arousal patterns that were metabolically expensive and put individuals at risk of starvation immediately after emergence in spring.},

abstract={Temporary food restriction affects strain differences for behavioral phenotypes in the inbred strains of mice C57BL/6 (C57) and DBA/2 (DBA). Since food restriction is a routine procedure to motivate learning, we evaluated its influence on differences for spatial and non-spatial discrimination between these strains of mice by using two non-associative tasks: the Spatial Novelty Test (SNT) and the Spontaneous Object Recognition Test (SORT). The results confirmed the poor performance of the DBA mice in SNT. Nonetheless, DBA mice were perfectly able to recognize the novel object in SORT. By contrast, C57 mice were good performers in SNT but failed to recognize a novel object in SORT. Finally, food restriction selectively improved C57 performance in SNT and DBA performance in SORT. These results support the view that a food restricting procedure enhances strain differences for discrimination of configurational information. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study investigated the degree to which the behavior of a predator in the marine environment can be used to indicate the availability of prey. It examined this in Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) feeding on krill, with a view to understanding how behavioral choices could lead to a nonlinear functional response. The study showed how fur seals adjusted their time budgets to maximize the mean rate of energy intake in response to varying prey abundance. The behavioral indicator of prey abundance was the amount of time spent by fur seals at the bottom of dives after adjustment for dive depth. This indicator was well correlated with independent measures of prey abundance. The indicator was calibrated in terms of net rate of energy intake from information about energy expenditures in Antarctic fur seals and was used within the framework of optimal foraging theory to examine how female fur seals organized their foraging activity within and between bouts. Foraging in Antarctic fur seals conformed to many of the predictions from energy rate-maximizing behavior. For example, the apparent net rate of energy intake by fur seals declined with time spent in a patch, and the rate of energy intake on leaving a patch declined as apparent food availability in the environment declined. In addition, the time spent in patches increased as apparent food availability declined. Antarctic fur seals were able to adjust their behavior to track highly variable prey distributions and densities. The simple decision about when to leave a patch in relation to current environmental prey availability appears to be responsible for allowing fur seals to maintain saturation of the foraging rate as food density declines.},

abstract={It is well established that when most types of cells, including neurons, are exposed to a mild stress they increase their ability to resist more severe stress. This "preconditioning" phenomenon involves up-regulation of genes that encode cytoprotective proteins such as heat-shock proteins and growth factors. We found that a similar beneficial cellular stress response can be induced in neurons throughout the brain by a "meal-skipping" dietary restriction (DR) regimen in rats and mice. DR is effective in protecting neurons and improving functional outcome in models of stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. DR induces an increase in the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and heat-shock proteins in neurons. DR also stimulates neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and BDNF plays a role in this effect of DR. Physical exercise and environmental enrichment are two other manipulations that have been shown to induce BDNF expression in the brain, presumably because it is a mild cellular stress. When taken together with epidemiological and clinical studies in humans, the data from animal studies suggest that it may be possible to reduce the risk for age-related neurodegenerative disorders through dietary and behavioral modifications that act by promoting neuronal plasticity and survival. © 2004 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.},

abstract={Predation risk may compromise the ability of animals to acquire and maintain body reserves by hindering foraging efficiency and increasing physiological stress. Locomotor performance may depend on body mass, so losing mass under predation risk could be an adaptive response of prey to improve escape ability. We studied individual variation in antipredatory behaviour, feeding rate, body mass and escape performance in the lacertid lizard Psammodromus algirus. Individuals were experimentally exposed to different levels of food availability (limited or abundant) and predation risk, represented by reduced refuge availability and simulated predator attacks. Predation risk induced lizards to reduce conspicuousness behaviourally and to avoid feeding in the presence of predators. If food was abundant, alarmed lizards reduced feeding rate, losing mass. Lizards supplied with limited food fed at near-maximum rates independently of predation risk but lost more mass when alarmed; thus, mass losses experienced under predation risk were higher than those expected from feeding interruption alone. Although body mass of lizards varied between treatments, no component of escape performance measured during predator attacks (endurance, speed, escape strategy) was affected by treatments or by variations in body mass. Thus, the body mass changes were consistent with a trade-off between gaining resources and avoiding predators, mediated by hampered foraging efficiency and physiological stress. However, improved escape efficiency is not required to explain mass reduction upon predator encounters beyond that expected from feeding interruption or predation-related stress. Therefore, the idea that animals may regulate body reserves in relation to performance demands should be reconsidered. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={A prospective cohort study was conducted on horses starting in hurdle and steeplechase races on six UK racecourses in 2000 and 2001. Trainers or carers were questioned on the horses' pre-race routine and observational data were collected in the stables and parade ring. Some practices were common to many starters, such as withholding food and water before racing whereas other practices, such as schooling frequency, were more variable. There was a total of 2879 starts and a total of 83 injuries or medical events (28.8/1000 starts). The commonest types of injury were tendon/suspensory injuries and lacerations/wounds. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify the relationship between predictor variables and the risk of injury. Risk of injury or medical event was associated with distance of the race and weight carried. The risk of injury, excluding medical events, was associated with the speed of the race and foot conformation. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Azidothymidine (AZT) is administered to pregnant women with HIV to prevent the spread of infection to their fetuses. Since gestation is a period of critical neurodevelopment, it is important to determine the risk AZT exposure may pose to neurobehavioral function of the offspring. The current study focused on teratological risks of developmental AZT exposure to neurocognitive function. Male and female Swiss mice were administered AZT or vehicle (0, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day po given twice daily in equal amounts for 32 weeks before and during gestation). Adult male and female offspring (n=10/sex/treatment group) underwent neurobehavioral testing focused on determining learning and memory capabilities in the radial-arm maze. AZT exposure did not cause significant deficits during radial-arm maze acquisition. No impairment was seen in asymptotic levels of choice accuracy indicative of working memory function. Attempts to unmask subtle learning impairments following developmental AZT by the introduction of behavioral challenges such as reduction of motivational state (food restriction either 4-6 h or 22-24 h) or imposition of intrasession delays of 1.5 min to 2.5 h were unsuccessful. With a 4-week intersession delay, a significant AZT Treatment x Delay effect was seen with a significantly greater decline seen in the controls as compared to the 100 mg/kg/day AZT group. Locomotor activity on the radial-arm maze was significantly affected by AZT treatment (100 mg/kg/day) during the acquisition phase, but not during the other test phases. No behavioral alterations were seen related to stress as measured by the elevated plus maze. Vestibulomotor functioning on the balance beam remained unaltered. Using an extended dosing regimen including dosing of both sires and dams, as well as placing a greater demand on reproductive system performance with three continuous breedings, this study detected only subtle neurobehavioral impairments in mice after prenatal AZT exposure at clinically relevant doses. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The avoidance of surface waters by crustacean zooplankton is a common phenomenon both in marine and freshwaters. The contemporary paradigm interprets such behavior as an antipredator strategy. However, the phenomenon has also been reported in predator-free environments, which suggests that other variables may contribute to this depth-selection behavior. We investigated the possibility that ultraviolet radiation (UVR) could influence the avoidance of surface waters in three interconnected lakes differing in their transparency. Each lake was sampled 17 or 18 times. In the two most transparent lakes, the percentage of the population occurring in the surface layer decreased during spring and summer, but this pattern was not observed in the less transparent lake. Such differences in the patterns of surface-water avoidance were unrelated to the abundance and vertical distribution of the dominant planktivores (early stages of galaxiid fishes) as well as to temperature and food availability. They were inversely related, however, to the average UVR levels within the surface layer. A UV avoidance strategy was predicted for the copepod Boeckella gracilipes, on account of its low UV tolerance and lack of photoprotective compounds. Our results support this prediction and strongly suggest that surface avoidance by freshwater Patagonian zooplankton is not just a byproduct benefit of an antipredator behavior but is a direct response to high UVR levels.},

abstract={Birds are thought to choose nest sites that meet two main functions: providing security to both nest contents and incubating adults, and providing an appropriate microclimate for incubation. Many shorebirds nest in sites with no or little cover. In a lake in southern Spain, nearly 70% of the nests of Kentish plovers, Charadrius alexandrinus, were in sites with little or no cover, where ambient temperatures might be more than 50°C during very hot days, thus causing the incubating adults to suffer from heat stress. We tested the hypothesis that Kentish plovers nest mainly in exposed sites because this may allow the incubating birds to detect approaching predators early, and thus to reduce predation risk. When we occluded the view that incubating adults had from their nests, they took longer to detect approaching predators than when the view was unrestricted. Incubating adults were also more frequently killed by mammals in covered than in exposed nests. Females that nested in covered sites were in lower body condition than those nesting in exposed sites, possibly because they were unable to withstand the high ambient temperatures in exposed sites. Thus, the benefits of thermally favourable nest sites are reduced by the constraints of predation risk. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={We evaluated differences in larval habitats and life history of three species of spadefoot toads, then compared their life histories in a common garden study. Our field work defined the selective regime encountered by each species. Our Great Basin spadefoot (Spea intermontana) bred asynchronously in permanent streams and springs where there was no risk of larval mortality due to drying. The water chemistry remained fairly stable throughout the larval period. The western spadefoot toad, Sp. hammondii, bred fairly synchronously following heavy spring rains in temporary pools that remained filled an average of 81 d. Fifteen % of the breeding pools dried completely on or before the day the first larvae metamorphosed. The desert spadefoot toad, Scaphiopus couchii, bred synchronously after heavy summer showers in very short duration pools; 62% of the breeding pools dried completely on or before the day the first larvae metamorphosed. The concentration of ammonium nitrogen and CaCO3 increased markedly as the Sp. hammondii and S. couchii pools dried. S. couchii attained metamorphosis at a much earlier age and smaller size than the other two species. S. couchii also showed little variation in the age at metamorphosis but considerable variation in the size at metamorphosis, while the other two species varied in both age and size. The results identify some variables that could serve as cues of pool drying and demonstrate an association between breeding pool duration, breeding synchrony, development rate, and larval development. Our laboratory study yields information about the genetic basis of the differences in development and controlled comparisons of phenotypic plasticity. We manipulated food supply to study the plastic response of age and size at metamorphosis and hence construct the reaction norm for these variables as a function of growth rate. The growth rates ranged from below to above those observed in natural populations. As in the field, in the lab S. couchii attained metamorphosis at an earlier age and smaller size than the other two species. All three species had a similarly shaped reaction norm for size(y-axis) and age (x-axis) at metamorphosis, which was a concave upward curve. A consequence of this shape is that age at metamorphosis changes more readily at low levels of food availability and size at metamorphosis changes more readily at high levels of food availability. If we restrict our observations to just those growth rates that are seen in nature, then S. couchii has almost no variation in the age at metamorphosis but considerable variation in size at metamorphosis, while the other two species vary in both age and size at metamorphosis. All three species increased in size at metamorphosis with increased food levels. Our comparative reaction norm approach thus demonstrates that S. couchii has adapted to ephemeral environments by shifting its growth rate reaction norm so that age at metamorphosis is uniformly fast and is not associated with growth rate. The realized variation is concentrated in size rather than age at metamorphosis.},

abstract={Because brood parasitic nestlings are usually unrelated to their nestmates and to the provisioning adult, they are free from indirect costs of begging. Consequently, they are predicted to beg more intensely than host nestlings, and some models predict they will beg at an invariantly high level, regardless of short-term need. Previous work has shown intense begging by parasitic cowbirds, but short-term need was not controlled. In this study, we manipulated short-term need and measured begging intensity in two species pairs of host and parasitic nestlings: shiny cowbirds (Molothrus bonariensis) parasitizing larger hosts than themselves (rufous-bellied thrushes, Turdus rufiventris), and brown-headed cowbirds (M. ater) parasitizing smaller hosts than themselves (yellow warblers, Dendroica petechia). All four species increased their begging intensity with short-term need, though the change was much less pronounced between food-deprived and control treatments than between control and hand-feeding treatments. Shiny cowbirds begged more intensely than rufous-bellied thrushes following each treatment. In contrast, brown-headed cowbirds did not beg significantly more intensely than yellow warblers under any of the treatments. Intense begging by both species of parasites was as effective as host begging in stimulating the adults to make provisioning visits, but shiny cowbirds were less successful at acquiring food from adult thrushes. A wide array of factors may underlie the apparent differences in the begging behavior and success of brown-headed and shiny cowbirds, including relative size, experience, and local risk of nest predation. Our experiments clearly demonstrate, however, that these two species of parasitic cowbirds adjust their begging intensity based on short-term need. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract={The costs and benefits of group membership vary with the size of groups, and individuals are expected to modify their choice of groups in response to ecological factors such as food availability and predation risk. We experimentally examined context-dependent group size choice in a shoaling fish, the banded killifish, Fundulus diaphanus, by using nondirectional odour cues to simulate a food source or a successful attack by a predator (food or alarm treatments) in the laboratory. Group sizes were significantly smaller in the food treatment and larger in the alarm treatment than in control trials. When presented with food and alarm cues together, fish formed groups that were larger than control groups but smaller than those seen with alarm cues alone. These results are consistent with theoretical predictions based on the known benefits and costs of grouping and with previous laboratory work examining the individual shoal choice behaviour of single fish. To examine possible mechanisms of group formation, we developed an individual-based model of shoaling behaviour in which simulated fish were allowed to modify the area over which they interacted with neighbouring individuals. Group size distributions produced by the model were a good approximation of our experimental data. We suggest that local behavioural interaction rules of this type are a potential mechanism by which fish may individually adjust grouping behaviour without requiring extensive information on the position and movement of all possible shoalmates. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Results replicated previous analyses indicating the presence of a single factor, good internal consistency, and significant association with measures of body image and eating disturbance. Additionally, the FNAES accounted for unique variance beyond that explained by general fear of negative evaluation, and other measures of body image and eating disturbance, in the prediction of body shape dysphoria, dietary restraint, and trait anxiety. Study 2 further examined the validity of the FNAES, finding it to correlate significantly with measures of social physique anxiety, body image, eating attitude, and mood. The FNAES did not significantly correlate with body mass index (BMI). Regression analyses found the FNAES to predict levels of body image, eating attitude, and mood beyond variance explained by social physique anxiety. The FNAES appears to measure a conceptually unique aspect of body image that has not been indexed by previous measures and may serve a useful role in risk factor and preventive work. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Many animal species, from arthropods to apes, share food. This paper presents a new framework that categorizes nonkin food sharing according to two axes: (1) the interval between sharing and receiving the benefits of sharing, and (2) the currency units in which benefits accrue to the sharer (especially food versus nonfood). Sharers can obtain immediate benefits from increased foraging efficiency, predation avoidance, mate provisioning, or manipulative mutualism. Reciprocity, trade, status enhancement and group augmentation can delay benefits. When benefits are delayed or when food is exchanged for nonfood benefits, maintaining sharing can become more difficult because animals face discounting and currency conversion problems. Explanations that involve delayed or nonfood benefits may require specialized adaptations to account for timing and currency-exchange problems. The immediate, selfish fitness benefits that a sharer may gain through by-product or manipulative mutualism, however, apply to various food-sharing situations across many species and may provide a simpler, more general explanation of sharing. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={Social phobia (also known as social anxiety disorder) is still not clearly understood. It was not established as an authentic psychiatric entity until the diagnostic nomenclature of the American Psychiatric Association DSM III in 1980. In recent years, increasing attention among researchers has contributed to provide important information about the genetic, familial and temperamental bases of social phobia and its neurochemical, neuroendocrinological and neuroanatomical substrates, which remain to be further investigated. Up to date, there have been several findings about the possible influence of variables, including particularly genetic, socio-familial and early temperamental (eg behavioral inhibition) factors that represent risk for the later development of social phobia. Clinical neurobiological studies, based on the use of exogenous compounds such as lactate, CO2, caffeine, epinephrine, flumazenil or cholecystokinin/pentagastrin to reproduce naturally occurring phobic anxiety, have shown that patients with social phobia appear to exhibit an intermediate sensitivity between patients with panic disorder and control subjects. No difference in the rate of panic attacks in response to lactate, low concentrations of CO2 (5%), epinephrine or flumazenil was observed between patients with social phobia and normal healthy subjects, both being less reactive compared to patients with panic disorder. However, patients with social phobia had similar anxiety reactions to high concentrations of CO 2 (35%), caffeine or cholecystokinin/pentagastrin than those seen in patients with panic disorder, both being more intensive than in controls. Several lines of evidence suggest specific neurotransmitter system alterations in social phobia, especially with regard to the serotoninergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems. Although no abnormality in platelet serotonin transporter density has been found, patients with social phobia appear to show an enhanced sensitivity of both post-synaptic 5HT1A and 5HT 2 serotonin receptor subtypes, as reflected by increased anxiety and hormonal responses to serotoninergic probes. Platelet 5HT2 receptor density has also been reported to be positively correlated to symptom severity in patients with social phobia. During anticipation of public speaking, heart rate was elevated in patients with social phobia compared to controls. Norepinephrine response to the orthostatic challenge test or to the Valsalva maneuver was also greater in patients with social phobia. While normal β-adrenergic receptor number was observed in lymphocytes, a blunted response of growth hormone to clonidine, an α2-adrenergic agonist, was reported. This suggests reduced post-synaptic α2- adrenergic receptor functioning related to norepinephrine overactivity in social phobia. Decreased cerebrospinal fluid levels of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid have also been observed. There are relatively few reports of involvement of the adrenal and thyroid functions in social phobia, and all that has been noted is that patients with social phobia show an exaggerated adrenocortical response to a psychological stressor. Recent advances in neuro-imaging have contributed to find low striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding or low dopamine transporter site density in patients with social phobia. They have also demonstrated the involvement of the cortico-limbic pathways, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala, which show an increased activity in different experimental conditions. These brain regions have extensively been reported to play an important role in the cognitive appraisal in determining the significance of environmental stimuli, in the emotional and mnemonic integration of information, and in the expression of contextual fear-conditioned behaviors, which might be disrupted in the light of the phenomelogical aspects of social phobia. A substantial body of literature based on case reports, open and placebo-controlled trials, has now clearly examined the efficacy of major classes of psychotropic agents including monoamine oxidase inhibitors, β-blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines in social phobia. Until recently, irreversible non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors, of which phenelzine was the most extensively evaluated, were considered as the most efficacious treatment in reducing the symptomatology associated with social phobia in 50-70% of cases after 4 to 6 weeks. However, side effects and dietary restrictions limit their use. This led to the development of reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A, for which careful dietary monitoring is not required. Moclobemide has been the most widely studied but produced unconvincingly therapeutic effects on social phobic symptoms. To date, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be considered as a reasonable first-line pharmacotherapy for social phobia. There is growing evidence for the efficacy of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, citalopram, paroxetine and sertraline. They have beneficial effects with response rates ranging from 50 to 80% in social phobia. It has been recommended that the treatment period should be extended at least 6 months beyond the early improvement achieved within the first 4 to 6 weeks. The overall advantages include tolerability with a low risk of adverse events. The benzodiazepines clonazepam and alprazolam have also been proposed for the treatment of social phobia. Symptomatic relief occurred in 40 to 80% of the cases with a relatively rapid onset of action within the first two weeks. Untoward effects, discontinuation-related withdrawal symptoms and abuse or dependence liability constitute major concerns about the use of benzodiazepines, so they should be reserved for cases unresponsive to the safer medications cited above, β-blockers such as atenolol and propanolol have commonly been employed in performance anxiety, decreasing autonomic symptoms (eg, tachycardia, sweating and dry mouth). However, they are not effective in the generalized form of social phobia. Other pharmacologic alternatives seem helpful for the management of social phobia, including venlafaxine, gabapentin, bupropion, nefazodone or augmentation with buspirone. Preliminary studies point to promising effects of these agents. Larger controlled clinical trials are now needed to confirm their potential role in the treatment of social phobia.},

abstract={Protein malnutrition induces structural, neurochemical and functional alterations in the central nervous system, leading to behavioral alterations. In the present study, we used the elevated plus-maze (EPM) as a measure of anxiety to evaluate the interaction between acute immobilization and housing conditions on the behavior of malnourished rats. Pups (6 males and 2 females) were fed by Wistar lactating dams receiving a 6% (undernourished) or 16% (well-nourished) protein diet. After weaning, the animals continued to receive the same diets ad libitum until 49 days of age when they started to receive a regular lab chow diet. From weaning to the end of the tests on day 70, the animals were housed under two different conditions, i.e., individual or in groups of three. On the 69th day, half of the animals were submitted to immobilization for 2 h, while the other half were undisturbed, and both groups were tested 24 h later for 5 min in the EPM. Independent of other factors, protein malnutrition increased, while immobilization and social isolation per se decreased, EPM exploration. Analysis of the interaction of diet vs immobilization vs housing conditions showed that the increased EPM exploration presented by the malnourished group was reversed by acute immobilization in animals reared in groups but not in animals reared individually. The interaction between immobilization and housing conditions suggests that living for a long time in social isolation is sufficiently stressful to reduce the responses to another anxiogenic procedure (immobilization), while living in groups prompts the animals to react to acute stress. Thus, it is suggested that housing condition can modulate the effects of an anxiogenic procedure on behavioral responses of malnourished rats in the EPM.},

abstract={Apprehension is a behavioral response of a forager to risk of predation involving the allocation of the forager's attention away from foraging-related tasks and toward predator detection. It, along with time allocation, can be used by a forager to manage risk. Apprehension should increase, and time allocation should decrease with a forager's energetic state (marginal value of energy). We tested these predictions on Allenby's gerbils (Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi) by manipulating the energetic state of the gerbils through augmentations of millet seeds. We also manipulated two risk factors, the microhabitat of the foraging patch (bush or open) and the presence of barn owls (Tyto alba). We measured apprehension of gerbils using the selectivity of gerbils for trays that differed in the distribution of seeds that they contained and time allocation using the amount of seeds left behind in trays, the giving-up density (GUD). Gerbils harvested 4.6 times more seeds when supplemental seeds were available, 17.4% fewer seeds when owls were present, 25.8% fewer seeds from the open than the bush microhabitat, and 19.3% fewer seeds from trays when seed augmentations were also present. With regard to time allocation, gerbils had higher GUDs (allocated less time) when risk was higher: in the open microhabitat and in the presence of owls. Also, the response of gerbils to owls was affected both by the seed augmentation and by microhabitat. With regard to apprehension, the gerbils were more apprehensive when extra seeds were added. Their level of apprehension changed little in the bush microhabitat but increased greatly in the open microhabitat when energetic state was manipulated. Thus, gerbils use both time allocation and apprehension in response to predators. Changes in the energetic state of a forager led to the predicted increase in apprehension accordance with Clark's asset protection principle.},

abstract={On a private property with a stable population of wild Red-Legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) and an appropriate habitat for the survival of the species, reinforcement repopulations were carried out using 54 birds that were 2 to 3 mo old and reared on a commercial game farm. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of repopulations, the behavior in the wild of released partridges, and the possible causes of success or failure of reinforcement population operations. The releases were carried out during August and September of 2 consecutive years. All birds were equipped with radio transmitter collars to determine their behavior after release. Two release methods were used in yr 1: an acclimatization cage (AC) method and a direct release method on the day of the birds arrival (DR). The aim of the release in yr 2 was to collect data to determine the influence of year conditions using the DR method. Of the 54 released birds, none remained alive by the time of the reproductive period in the following spring, The mean survival time was 16.79 d for the AC method and was 11.89 and 5 d for the DR method in yr 1 and 2, respectively. Of the recorded mortalities, we assigned 81.13% to predation, 7.55% to hunting, and 11.32% to unknown causes of death, accidents, or starvation. Repopulation was not successful at providing a long-term increase in partridge numbers, with most birds falling victim to predation within 1 mo of release. Dispersion is the maximum distance from the release point at which each bird was located. The postrelease mean dispersion was 437.65 m for the AC method and was 647.57 and 266.07 m for the DR method in yr 1 and 2, respectively.},

abstract={The E4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is associated with neurodegeneration in part due to increased oxidative stress. Transgenic mice lacking ApoE (-/-) represent a model for the consequences of deficiencies in ApoE function. Dietary deficiency in folate and vitamin E has previously been shown to potentiate the impact of ApoE deficiency; ApoE-/- mice deprived of folate and vitamin E for 1 month demonstrated increased oxidative damage in brain tissue and impaired cognitive performance as compared to ApoE+/+ mice. Since individuals homozygous for E4 can demonstrate more increased risk for neurodegeneration and an earlier age of onset than individuals heterozygous for E4, we tested the impact of folate and vitamin E deprivation on ApoE+/- mice. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in brain tissue of ApoE+/- were significantly increased compared to ApoE+/+ mice, but this increase was less than that observed in ApoE-/- mice. By contrast, livers of ApoE+/- and -/- mice displayed an identical increase over that of +/+ mice. ApoE-/- mice, but not +/- or +/+ mice, exhibited impaired cognitive performance in maze trials when deprived of folate and vitamin E. These findings support the notion that homozygous deficiency of ApoE function can be more severe than heterozygous deficiency. They further suggest that the impact of partial deficiency in ApoE function may present a latent risk that may manifest only when compounded by other factors such as dietary deficiency.},

abstract={Enterobacter cloacae IFO 3320 exhibits chemotactic responses to inorganic phosphate (Pi) when starved of Pi. One Tn1737KH-induced mutant failed to exhibit Pi taxis even under conditions of Pi limitation. The mutant showed normal chemotactic responses to amino acids and citrate, suggesting that it is specifically defective in Pi taxis. Southern blot analysis revealed that the insertion Tn1737KH was located in the indigenous plasmid pEC01. The pEC01-cured strain of IFO 3320 did not show Pi taxis even under conditions of Pi limitation, indicating that pEC01 is required for Pi taxis in E. cloacae IFO 3320. This plasmid is 5002 bp long, consisting of four mobilization genes, mbeCABD, and an origin of replication homologous to ColE1-type plasmids. Pec01 contains no open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein with a highly conserved motif of methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), suggesting that a gene encoding a MCP responsible for Pi taxis is located on the chromosome. An ORF encoding a putative protein of 102 amino acids was responsible for the complementation of the pEC01-cured strain. The putative protein had a helix-turn-helix motif, suggesting that it is involved in the gene regulation of the Pi taxis MCP gene. © 2004, Japanese Society of Microbial Ecology &amp; The Japanese Society of Soil Microbiology.

abstract={The development in organic livestock production can be attributed to an increased consumer interest in organic products while, at the same time, increased farmers' interest in converting to organic production methods - often stimulated by governmental support or subsidies. It is important that organic production systems can fulfil the expectations of each of these stakeholders if organic livestock production is to increase further. This is of particular importance if organic pig and poultry production (other than egg) is to move from the present niche-production to a significant place in the food market, as in the case of beef and milk. It can be argued that the limited organic pork and poultry production is related to the fact that it is far more difficult for farmers to change the existing production systems for pig and poultry compared to production systems for cattle and other ruminants in a way that gives a harmonious balance between the different aims of organic farming. Conflicts may occur as to the most appropriate rearing practice in considerating the basic aspects of the innate behaviour of animals on one hand, the risk of pollution from the production on the other and, in addition, the aim of producing in sufficient quantities. These possible conflicts are reflected in the compromises made in national or EU regulations on organic farming. In the regulations for organic farming, the aspect of allowing a high degree of natural behaviour of the livestock is, among others, translated in the requirement that livestock, in certain periods of their life or of the year, should be allowed to graze or have access to an outdoor area. The most common outdoor systems for pig and poultry used in intensively managed organic production have some significant drawbacks in relation to environmental impact (risk of N-leaching and ammonia volatilisation), animal welfare (nose-ringed sows), high mortality in poultry and workload and management constraints. From recent experience of such systems, it is argued that there is a need for a radical development of the systems. There is a need for outdoor/free range systems (for the sake of the livestock), which are constructed and managed in such a way that the livestock, at the same time, exert a positive influence on other parts of the farming system. There is evidence that pregnant sows can fulfil their nutritional needs to a large extent by grazing, that co-grazing sows with heifers can diminish the parasite burden of the heifers, and that the pig inclination for rooting can be managed in a way that makes ploughing and other heavy land cultivation more or less superfluous. As regard poultry, there is an indication that quite big flocks can be managed efficiently in a way where the flock act as weeders in other crops or fight pests in orchards. These elements need to be further explored as a basis for future system development. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Male dispersal from the birth group is common in the majority of social mammals, and in many species, males also engage in secondary or breeding dispersal following natal emigration. However, the patterns and causes of secondary dispersal are poorly understood due to the difficulty in following emigrants. Here, we detail the patterns and causation of male secondary dispersal in several groups of white-faced capuchins observed between 1985 and 2000 in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. Subsequent to natal emigration, which occurs between 2 and 8 years of age (median 4.5 years), male white-faced capuchins embark on a life of continual movement. Although males of all age classes engage in voluntary secondary dispersal, the ways by which males enter groups varies according to their age class. Adult males (≥ 10 years old) are more likely to enter groups aggressively, and they display longer tenure than either subadult males (7-10 years of age) or juvenile males (1-7 years of age). Given our finding that adult males face the highest risks in terms of aggressive interactions with conspecifics, we examined several explanations as to why they continue to disperse throughout their lives. Our data best support the intragroup mating competition hypothesis for secondary dispersal, whereby males move frequently between groups as a means of increasing their reproductive opportunities. Males may also engage in frequent secondary dispersal to avoid mating with their maturing daughters, although this hypothesis was not strongly supported by the current data. Males of all age classes displayed very high levels of parallel dispersal, which probably serves to offset the high costs of dispersal (predation, starvation and/or aggression from conspecifics) and it may also serve as a means of retaining kinship among group males. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={Anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are disorders of eating and weight-related behavior that together afflict some 1-3% of women in the United States. One of the remarkable features about each of the eating disorders is how persistent the disordered eating behavior becomes once it has begun. Substantial psychological, social, and physiological disturbances are associated with eating disorders, and it has been very difficult to disentangle those factors that may result from the disturbed behavior from the factors that may have predisposed individuals to, or precipitated the development of, the disorder. This article will briefly review the definitions, phenomenology, and identified risk factors for development of each of the major eating disorders. Pathophysiology will be discussed, with a particular focus on candidate factors that might sustain disordered eating behavior, as informed by clinical and basic science research.

This paper examines the role of prenatal nutrition relative to psychiatric disorders and explores the relationship among nutrients, mood changes, and mood disorders. Epidemiologic studies have found that adults who were born with a normal, yet low birth weight have an increased susceptibility to diseases such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, and stroke in adulthood. Prenatal caloric malnutrition, low birth weight, and prematurity also increase the risk for neurodevelopmental disorders, schizophrenia, affective disorders, and schizoid and antisocial personality disorders. Placebo-controlled studies in medicated patients suggest that add-on treatment with omega-3 fatty acids, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid, may ameliorate symptoms of major depressive disorder. Additional studies are necessary to confirm any benefits for bipolar disorders. Copyright © 2004 by Current Science Inc.},
