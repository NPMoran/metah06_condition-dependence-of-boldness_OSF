Abstract = {{Objective. Although individuals differ substantially in their flavor and
   food preferences, the source of such differences remains a mystery. The
   present experimental study was motivated by clinical observations that
   early experience with formulas establishes subsequent preferences.
   Design. Infants whose parents had chosen to formula-feed them were
   randomized into 1 of 4 groups by the second week of life. One group was
   assigned to be fed a milk-based formula (Enfamil), whereas another was
   assigned to be fed (Nutramigen), a particularly unpleasant-tasting
   protein hydrolysate formula. The remaining groups were assigned to be
   fed Nutramigen for 3 months and Enfamil for 4 months; the timing of
   exposure differed between the groups. After 7 months of exposure,
   infants were videotaped on 3 separate days while feeding, in
   counterbalanced order, Enfamil, Nutramigen, and Alimentum, a novel
   hydrolysate formula.
   Results. For each of the 4 interrelated measures of behavior (intake,
   duration of formula feeding, facial expressions, and mothers' judgments
   of infant acceptance), previous exposure to Nutramigen significantly
   enhanced subsequent acceptance of both Nutramigen and Alimentum. Seven
   months of exposure led to greater acceptance than did 3 months.
   Conclusions. The bases for clinical difficulties in introducing
   hydrolysate formulas during older infancy are clarified in this study.
   More broadly, variation in formula flavor provided a useful model for
   demonstrating experimentally the effects of long-term exposure
   differences on later acceptance. Such early variation, under more
   species-typical circumstances (eg, via exposure to different flavors in
   amniotic fluid and mothers' milk), may underlie individual differences
   in food acceptability throughout the life span.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the contribution to fruit and vegetable eating in
   children of potential predictive variables within the domains of
   demographics, parental feeding practices and personality traits.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Setting: Questionnaires were distributed to parents through 22 London
   nursery schools.
   Subjects: Questionnaires were completed and returned by 564 parents or
   principal caregivers of 2-6-year-old children.
   Results: Significant predictors of children's fruit and vegetable intake
   emerged from all three domains examined. Demographic variables
   associated with child's vegetable consumption were mother's education
   and child's age and gender. Only ethnicity was significantly associated
   with fruit consumption. Parental consumption, breast-feeding and early
   introduction to fruit and vegetables were related to intake of both.
   Family mealtimes were associated with higher intake of vegetables, but
   not of fruit. Two characteristics of children themselves (food neophobia
   and enjoyment of food) were strongly related to the consumption of fruit
   and vegetables. Subsequent multivariate analyses revealed that parental
   intake and child food neophobia independently predicted intake of both
   foods. in the presence of these, fruit consumption was affected by
   breast-feeding and early introduction to fruit, whereas vegetable
   consumption was related only to child's gender and enjoyment of food.
   Conclusions: These findings may be used to inform future interventions
   aimed at increasing children's consumption of fruit and vegetables.
   Parents should be made aware of the possible impact of their own
   behaviour on the eating habits of their children.}},

Abstract = {{Among damselflies in natural lakes, Ischnura species grow faster than
   coexisting Enallagma species, but Enallagma species have higher survival
   under predation than Ischnura species. This growth/predation risk
   trade-off apparently allows these taxa to coexist in ponds and lakes
   across the Holarctic. However, laboratory studies presented here show
   that the mechanism assumed by most theoretical and empirical studies to
   mediate this trade-off, namely activity simultaneously modulating
   foraging returns and predation risk, does not operate in this system.
   Ischnura verticalis larvae were more active than larvae of Enallagma
   species in a short-term behavioral experiment, which explains why
   Ischnura experiences greater mortality from predation. However, this
   greater activity did not translate into higher feeding rates. Ischnura
   verticalis and Enallagma species ate comparable amounts of food in both
   the short-term behavioral experiment and a longer feeding and digestion
   experiment. In spite of no difference in the amount of food ingested or
   assimilated, I. verticalis larvae grew faster than Enallagma larvae
   because they were better able to physiologically convert assimilated
   food into their own biomass in the presence of mortality threats. From
   these studies we understand the phenotypic mechanisms determining the
   antagonistic patterns of relative growth and survival between these two
   genera, but why these patterns exist remains unclear.}},

Abstract = {{Commercially reared ostrich chicks are typically kept in barren, indoor
   environments. This experiment investigated the effects of environmental
   enrichment on the pecking behaviour, exploration, food consumption and
   novelty responses of ostrich chicks aged 10 to 2 1 days. Four groups of
   20 randomly selected ostrich chicks were housed in heated huts at one
   day of age (Day 1), and at Day 10 were allowed access to sand-covered
   areas (30 m(2)) that were either barren (control. n = 2 groups) or
   enriched with cabbage, coniferous cones and sticks (enriched. n = 2
   groups). Pecking behaviour was recorded by focal sampling the behaviour
   of five chicks per group for four 5 min periods per day on Day 10 and
   Day 13. All enriched chicks pecked at the cabbage, of which they
   consumed considerable amounts (26 +/- 3 g/chick/day). The enriched
   chicks did not have higher overall pecking frequencies but tended to
   peck less at fixtures in the pen, compared to control chicks.
   Additionally, the enriched chicks showed increased exploration in terms
   of the percentage of chicks observed outside the heated huts. In a novel
   object test enriched chicks stayed closer to and delivered more pecks at
   sorrel (Rumex acetosa) than did control chicks, whereas there was no
   difference between the treatment groups in their response to adult
   ostrich feathers. Enriched chicks consumed more food (79 +/- 0.4
   g/chick/day) than did control chicks (67 +/- 0.9 g/chick/day) during the
   experimental period. We suggest that environmental enrichment improves
   the welfare of ostrich chicks in terms of increasing exploration and
   reducing pecking at fixtures in the pen, without compromising food
   consumption.}},

   among Hispanics, the impact of certain factors (e.g., child temperament)

   Impact of zinc supplementation, birth weight, and caregiving practices}},
Journal = {{PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1297-1305}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Infants who are born small for gestational age (SGA) are at
   risk for developmental delays, which may be related to deficiencies in
   zinc, an essential trace metal, or to deficiencies in their ability to
   elicit caregiver responsiveness (functional isolation hypothesis). The
   objective of this study was to evaluate at 6 and 10 months of age the
   impact of a 9-month supplementation trial of 5 mg of zinc on the
   development and behavior of infants who were born SGA and to evaluate
   infants' ability to elicit responsive caregiver behavior.
   Methods. A randomized, controlled trial of zinc supplementation was
   conducted among 200 infants in a low-income, urban community in Delhi,
   India. Infants were recruited when they were full term (>36 weeks) and
   SGA (birth weight <10th percentile weight-for-gestational age). Infants
   were randomized to receive daily supplements of a micronutrient mix
   (folate, iron, calcium, phosphorus, and riboflavin) with or without 5 mg
   of zinc sulfate. The supplement was administered by field workers daily
   from 30 days to 9 months of age. At 6 and 10 months, infant development
   and behavior were measured in a clinical setting using the Bayley Scales
   of Infant Development II. Caregiver responsiveness, observed on an
   Indian version of the Home Observation for Measurement of the
   Environment scale, was measured during a home visit at 10 months. During
   both the clinic and home visits, caregivers reported on their infant's
   temperament.
   Results. There were no direct effects of zinc supplementation on the
   infants' development or behavior at either 6 or 10 months. In a subgroup
   analysis among the zinc-supplemented infants, lower birth weight infants
   were perceived to be more temperamentally difficult than higher weight
   infants; in the control group, birth weight was not associated with
   temperament. Heavier birth weight infants had better scores on all
   measures of development and behavior at 6 months and on changes in
   mental and motor development from 6 to 10 months, compared with lighter
   birth weight infants. Boys had better weight gain and higher scores on
   mental development and emotional regulation than girls. Infants who were
   from families of higher socioeconomic status (indexed by parental
   education, house size, and home ownership) had higher scores on mental
   development and orientation/engagement (exploratory behavior) than
   infants who were from families of lower socioeconomic status. In keeping
   with the functional isolation hypothesis, caregiver responsiveness was
   associated with infant irritability, controlling for socioeconomic
   status, gender, birth weight, and weight gain. Responsive mothers were
   more likely to perceive their infants to be temperamentally easy than
   less responsive mothers.
   Conclusion. Possible explanations for the lack of effects of zinc
   supplementation on infant development and behavior include 1) subtle
   effects of zinc supplementation that may not have been detected by the
   Bayley Scales, 2) interference with other nutritional deficiencies, or
   3) no impact of zinc deficiency on infants' development and behavior.
   The link between birth weight and irritability among infants in the zinc
   supplementation group suggests that the response to zinc supplementation
   may differ by birth weight, with irritability occurring among the most
   vulnerable infants. Longer term follow-up studies among
   zinc-supplemented infants are needed to examine whether early
   supplementation leads to developmental or behavioral changes that have
   an impact on school-age performance. The relationship between infant
   irritability and low maternal responsiveness lends support to the
   functional isolation hypothesis and the importance of asking caregivers
   about infant temperament.}},

Abstract = {{The experiment reported was designed to test two hypotheses: that
   prenatal undernutrition (a) increases emotional reactivity and (b)
   impairs cognitive flexibility in sheep. The mothers of one group were
   fed live weight maintenance requirements throughout pregnancy (control,
   Q while those of another group were fed 50\% of that amount from days 1
   to 95 of pregnancy and 100\% from then onwards (prenatal undernutrition,
   PU). At 18 months of age, PU sheep were more active during restraint (P
   < 0.05) and approached a novel stimulus more slowly (P = 0.02). In
   response to a sudden stimulus, PU males and C females showed a higher
   initial level of locomotion compared to C males, which only gradually
   declined, while PU females started at a high initial rate, changing
   rapidly to immobility.
   In a T-maze, PU resulted in a shift of side preferences (laterality)
   from a general right-bias to neutrality in males and to a left-bias in
   females (P < 0.05). In the two reversal tasks, C males and PU females
   had a preference for one side over the other, while PU males showed no
   preference. In contrast to C males, PU males failed to improve their
   learning speed from the first to the second reversal (P < 0.05).
   It is concluded that PU can lead to increased emotional reactivity and
   changes in side preference in both sexes and impaired cognitive
   flexibility in males. Undernutrition during pregnancy, therefore, not
   only affects the welfare of the dam, but also the personality of her
   offspring. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dietary restraint is defined as the cognitive tendency to restrict
   intake and is often accompanied by the breakdown of restraint, referred
   to as disinhibition, leading to overeating and overweight in adults.
   Given recent evidence suggesting that dietary restraint and
   disinhibition are emerging as early as middle childhood, this study
   examined the validity of the restraint construct as measured in girls
   between the ages of 5 and 9. Dietary restraint was assessed
   longitudinally by questionnaire and validity was established by
   correlating restraint with measures previously reported to be related to
   restraint including weight concerns, body esteem, self-reported dieting,
   and measures of dietary intake when girls were ages 5, 7, and 9.
   Participants were 153 girls from predominately middle class, and
   exclusively non-Hispanic white families living in central Pennsylvania.
   Correlational data were used to assess relationships between dietary
   restraint and weight concerns, body esteem, dietary intake, and dieting.
   Results from this study indicate that there is evidence for the validity
   of the dietary restraint construct among girls by age 9. Specifically,
   dietary restraint was highly and positively associated with body mass
   index, weight concerns and body dissatisfaction and negatively
   correlated with dietary intake, findings similar to those reported in
   the adult literature. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural observations were performed in an olfactometer to examine
   the effects of chemical stimuli from predators and conspecifics on the
   swimming activity of two larval anurans, the common frog, Rana
   temporaria, and the common toad, Bufo bufo. Both species of tadpoles
   showed a slight but non significant reduction in swimming behaviour when
   confronted to chemical cues from starved sympatric predators (larval
   spotted salamander, Salamandra salamandra; larval dragonfly, Anax
   imperator). In contrast, test solutions from starved Astacus
   leptodactylus, a recently introduced predator, produced no change at all
   in behaviour. As a whole, significant results indicate that indirect
   chemical signals resulting from the preying activity of the predator are
   mainly used for the chemical assessment of predation risk by tadpoles.
   Swimming activity of R. temporaria and B. bufo tadpoles was also found
   to be significantly decreased in response to chemical cues released by
   crushed conspecifics, or by A. leptodactylus within the day following
   ingestion of conspecific tadpoles. Our results suggest that the presence

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background. Substance abuse is present in most patients with bipolar
   disorder and associated with poor treatment outcome and increased risk
   Of Suicide. Increased impulsivity may be a link between bipolar disorder
   and substance abuse.
   Methods: First, we compared impulsivity as a stable trait (Barratt
   Impulsiveness Scale, BIS) and as state-dependent behavioral laboratory
   performance (immediate Memory-Delayed Memory task, derived from the
   Continuous Performance Task) in interepisode bipolar and nonbipolar
   subjects with and without substance abuse. Secondly, we compared
   impulsivity in interepisode and manic bipolar Subjects with and without
   substance abuse.
   Results: The BIS scores were increased in interepisode bipolar disorder
   and in subjects with histories of substance abuse, and were increased
   further in interepisode bipolar Subjects with substance abuse.
   Performance impulsivity was increased in subjects with substance abuse,
   regardless of whether they had bipolar disorder. Among Subjects with
   bipolar disorder, after correction for age, BIS scores were increased in
   those with substance abuse. Performance impulsivity was increased in
   manic compared with interepisode subjects, regardless Of Substance abuse
   history, and was increased in interepisode subjects with Substance abuse
   similarly to manic Subjects without substance abuse. These differences
   could not be accounted for by age., gender, or course of illness.
   Conclusions: Trait impulsivity is increased additively in bipolar
   disorder and substance abuse. Performance impulsivity is increased in
   interepisode bipolar disorder only if a history of substance abuse is
   present. This increased predisposition to impulsivity when not manic may
   contribute to the decrement in treatment outcome and compliance, and
   increased risk for suicide and aggression, in bipolar disorder with

   clinical groups of children who presented a diagnosis of feeding
   disorder and failure to thrive (FD-group, n = 122), and to show art

   of the child and the dysfunctional modes of their relationship during
   meals in a subgroup of mother-child pairs (n = 50), selected at random
   from the total clinical sample and paired with a control group chosen
   for this study.
   Methods: All mother-child pairs in the sample were observed in
   twenty-minute video-recordings during a meal, using the procedure of the
   Feeding Scale in the Italian version. A subgroup of mothers, selected at
   random from the total clinical sample, and paired with a control group,
   were given two self-reporting instruments for the evaluation of their
   psychological symptom status: the Eating Attitude Test and the Symptom
   Checklist-90-Revised, as well as two instruments for the evaluation of

   and Toddler Behavior Questionnaires (from 1 to 18 months) and the Child
   Behavior Checklist 11/2-5 (from 18 to 36 months).
   Results: Analysis of variance showed that the FD-group present
   interactional dysfunctional patterns during feeding and raise higher
   scores in symptomatic characteristics both of the mother and of the
   child, compared to ND-group. A set of correlation analyses (Pearson
   coefficients) showed an association among specific symptomatic

   Conclusions: Our study confirms that analysis of the individual
   characteristics of the child, of the mother and of their relationship

   the child's life is extremely important in the clinical assessment of
   early feeding disorders, in order to establish a valid diagnostic

Abstract = {{Background: The Well-Integrated Screening and Evaluation for Women
   Across the Nation (WISEWOMAN) program aims to remove racial and ethnic
   disparities in health by addressing the screening and intervention needs
   of midlife uninsured women. This paper describes the WISEWOMAN program
   requirements, the design of the 12 projects funded in 2002, the use of a
   standardized data reporting and analysis system, risk factors among
   participants, effective behavioral strategies, and plans for the future.
   Methods: The WISEWOMAN demonstration projects are examining the
   feasibility and effectiveness of adding a cardiovascular disease (CVD)
   prevention component to the early detection of breast and cervical
   cancer. Women aged 40-64 are eligible if they are enrolled in the
   National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) in
   selected U. S. states and are financially disadvantaged and lack health
   insurance. The primary outcome measures are blood pressure, lipid
   levels, and tobacco use. Intermediate measures include self-reported
   diet and physical activity, measures of readiness for change, and
   barriers to behavior change.
   Results: During 2002, the 10 projects that were fully operational
   screened 8164 financially disadvantaged women and developed culturally
   and regionally appropriate nutrition and physical activity interventions
   for a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds. Twenty-three percent of
   the women screened had high total cholesterol, with 48\% of these being
   newly diagnosed. Thirty-eight percent of the women had high blood
   pressure, with 24\% being newly diagnosed. Approximately, 75\% of
   participants were either overweight or obese, and in some sites up to
   42\% were smokers.
   Conclusions: The WISEWOMAN demonstration projects have been successful
   at reaching financially disadvantaged and minority women who are at high
   risk for chronic diseases. These projects face challenges because they
   are generally implemented by safety net providers who have limited
   resources and staff to conduct research and evaluation. On the other
   hand, the findings from these projects will be especially informative in
   reducing health disparities because they are conducted in those settings
   where the most socially and medically vulnerable women receive care.}},

Abstract = {{In order to assess the significance of local adaptation relative to
   environmental plasticity on the evolution of life history traits, we
   analysed the possible genetic basis of differences between pond- and
   stream-breeding fire salamanders (Salamandra salamandra) in Germany.
   These salamanders typically deposit their larvae in small streams, where
   they grow until they are sufficiently large to metamorphose. However,
   some populations in Western Germany use ponds as larval habitat. Because
   habitat quality of streams differs from that of ponds one expects life
   history differences in the pond animals, which may result either from a
   plastic response or through genetic differentiation (i.e. local
   adaptation). Using a phylogeographical analysis of mitochondrial D-loop
   sequences, we show that both stream and pond populations in Western
   Germany are derived from a single lineage that recolonized following the
   last glaciation. This finding suggests that pond breeding originated
   very recently. Our studies of habitat quality and metamorphic behaviour
   of larvae in natural ponds and streams disclosed that pond larvae
   experience a significantly reduced food supply and greater risk of
   drying than do stream larvae. Pond larvae metamorphose earlier at the
   cost of reduced mass. Common-environment experiments with pond and
   stream larvae show that metamorphic behaviour of pond larvae under
   limited-food conditions is determined genetically and is not simply a
   plastic response to the differing habitat conditions. These results show
   that phenotypic plasticity is less important than local adaptation in
   explaining differences in ecological diversification within this species
   and suggests the possibility of rapid evolution of genetic adaptations
   when new habitats are exploited.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Previous research has shown significant associations between
   depression and substance use and eating disordered behaviors. However,
   no research to date has described associations between depressive
   symptoms and nutritional intake or physical activity among adolescents
   in a nonclinical, population-based sample.
   Methods. Classroom surveys were completed by 4,734 ethnically diverse,
   middle- and high school students. Based on their depressive symptom
   scores, males and females were categorized with low-, moderate-, or
   high-depressive symptom status. Linear models were used to examine
   eating and health behavior variables by depressive symptom groups.
   Results. Depressive symptoms were positively associated with
   health-compromising attitudes such as perceived barriers to healthy
   eating and weight concerns, and health-compromising behaviors such as
   unhealthy weight-control behaviors and substance use, including
   caffeine. Depressive symptoms were negatively associated with
   health-promoting behaviors such as eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
   However, most associations between depressive symptoms and dietary
   micronutrients were not statistically significant. Health-promoting
   moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was negatively associated with
   depressive symptoms among males.
   Conclusions. Adolescents who report depressive symptoms are at risk for
   other health-compromising attitudes and behaviors and are also less
   likely to engage in health-promoting behaviors. Depressive symptoms may
   be an underlying trait in the expression of health behaviors among
   adolescents. (C) 2004 The Institute For Cancer Prevention and Elsevier

Abstract = {{To examine the role of individual variation in the dynamics of group
   information, I conducted a mark-recapture study and a series of
   laboratory and field experiments with Holocnemus pluchei spiders
   (Araneae: Pholcidae). These spiders can either share webs or live alone,
   and individuals shift frequently between these strategies. Spiders'
   decisions were influenced by size and recent feeding success. In the
   laboratory, small hungry spiders introduced into a web that held a
   larger conspecific resident were more likely than small well-fed spiders
   to abandon the web and build their own web. This behaviour pattern
   gradually reversed as spiders grew: large hungry spiders were more
   likely than large well-fed spiders to stay in the shared web. When I
   introduced spiders into empty webs,they were more likely to stay
   compared with spiders tested with conspecifics. However, hunger level
   also influenced behaviour even when conspecifics were not present.
   Food-deprived spiders were more likely to abandon webs and build their
   own, consistent with the idea that spiders were following a win-stay
   lose-shift strategy. In the field, spiders were more likely to stay in
   webs overnight when they were given supplemental food. In another
   experiment, spiders that we re found building webs in cleared areas were
   smaller and thinner than average. Finally, I tested whether the size of
   the intruder or the resident affected whether spiders joined webs. Large
   intruders were more successful if remaining,in webs than smaller
   intruders, although spiders of all sizes had some success in joining
   groups. Additional synthetic theoretical work is needed to integrate the
   complex processes underlying the formation and persistence of groups.

Abstract = {{Protein malnutrition induces structural, neurochemical and functional
   alterations in the central nervous system, leading to behavioral
   alterations. In the present study, we used the elevated plus-maze (EPM)
   as a measure of anxiety to evaluate the interaction between acute
   immobilization and housing conditions on the behavior of malnourished
   rats. Pups (6 males and 2 females) were fed by Wistar lactating dams
   receiving a 6\% (undernourished) or 16\% (well-nourished) protein diet.
   After weaning, the animals continued to receive the same diets ad
   libitum until 49 days of age when they started to receive a regular lab
   chow diet. From weaning to the end of the tests on day 70, the animals
   were housed under two different conditions, i.e., individual or in
   groups of three. On the 69th day, half of the animals were submitted to
   immobilization for 2 h, while the other half were undisturbed, and both
   groups were tested 24 h later for 5 min in the EPM. Independent of other
   factors, protein malnutrition increased, while immobilization and social
   isolation per se decreased, EPM exploration. Analysis of the interaction
   of diet vs immobilization vs housing conditions showed that the
   increased EPM exploration presented by the malnourished group was
   reversed by acute immobilization in animals reared in groups but not in
   animals reared individually. The interaction between immobilization and
   housing conditions suggests that living for a long time in social
   isolation is sufficiently stressful to reduce the responses to another
   anxiogenic procedure (immobilization), while living in groups prompts
   the animals to react to acute stress. Thus, it is suggested that housing
   condition can modulate the effects of an anxiogenic procedure on
   behavioral responses of malnourished rats in the EPM.}},

Abstract = {{In standardized ecotoxicological testing chemicals are investigated
   under optimal conditions for the test organisms despite the fact that
   environmental factors such as predation pressure and food availability
   are important parameters regulating natural populations. Food limitation
   and predator presence can induce shifts in life-history traits in
   various Daphnia species, especially trade-offs in reproductive biomass
   allocation. These adaptive responses are thought to ensure survival of
   the population in a highly variable environment. A xenobiotic dispersant
   (used in textile dyeing processes) also shifted the biomass allocation
   of Daphnia magna. To assess whether the dispersant could hinder D. magna
   adaptation to varying environmental conditions, we conducted experiments
   with food level and presence of Chaoborus larvae as environmental
   factors and simultaneous exposure to the dispersant. At low food level
   and in presence of the predator, D. magna produced fewer but larger
   sized neonates, regardless of dispersant exposure. The dispersant
   shifted biomass allocation towards more but smaller sized offspring in
   all experiments. However, the adaptive response to the environmental
   factors and the dispersant effect cancelled each other out in that they
   induced independently from each other opposite shifts in biomass
   allocation. In summary, the dispersant exposure resulted not in an
   inhibition of the adaptive response but in a reduction of the value of
   the response. Our study with this model substance demonstrates that

   stress which can result in effects likely to be overlooked in

Abstract = {{Social phobia (also known as social anxiety disorder) is still not
   clearly understood. It was not established as an authentic psychiatric
   entity until the diagnostic nomenclature of the American Psychiatric
   Association DSM III in 1980. In recent years, increasing attention among
   researchers has contributed to provide important information about the
   genetic, familial and temperamental bases of social phobia and its
   neurochemical, neuroendocrinological and neuroanatomical substrates,
   which remain to be further investigated. Up to date, there have been
   several findings about the possible influence of variables, including
   particularly genetic, socio-familial and early temperamental (eg
   behavioral inhibition) factors that represent risk for the later
   development of social phobia. Clinical neurobiological studies, based on
   the use of exogenous compounds such as lactate, CO2, caffeine,
   epinephrine, flumazenil or cholecystokinin/pentagastrin to reproduce
   naturally occurring phobic anxiety, have shown that patients with social
   phobia appear to exhibit an intermediate sensitivity between patients
   with panic disorder and control subjects. No difference in the rate of
   panic attacks in response to lactate, low concentrations of CO2 (5 \%),
   epinephrine or flumazenil was observed between patients with social
   phobia and normal healthy subjects, both being less reactive compared to
   patients with panic disorder. However, patients with social phobia had
   similar anxiety reactions to high concentrations of CO2 (35 \%),
   caffeine or cholecystokinin/pentagastrin than those seen in patients
   with panic disorder, both being more intensive than in controls. Several
   lines of evidence suggest specific neurotransmitter system alterations
   in social phobia, especially with regard to the serotoninergic,
   noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems. Although no abnormality in
   platelet serotonin transporter density has been found, patients with
   social phobia appear to show an enhanced sensitivity of both
   post-synaptic 5HT(1A) and 5HT(2) serotonin receptor subtypes, as
   reflected by increased anxiety and hormonal responses to serotoninergic
   probes. Platelet 5HT2 receptor density has also been reported to be
   positively correlated to symptom severity in patients with social
   phobia. During anticipation of public speaking, heart rate was elevated
   inpatients with social phobia compared to controls. Norepinephrine
   response to the orthostatic challenge test or to the Valsalva maneuver
   was also greater in patients with social phobia. While normal
   beta-adrenergic receptor number was observed in lymphocytes, a blunted
   response of growth hormone to clonidine, an alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist,
   was reported. This suggests reduced post-synaptic alpha(2)-adrenergic
   receptor functioning related to norepinephrine overactivity in social
   phobia. Decreased cerebrospinal fluid levels of the dopamine metabolite
   homovanillic acid have also been observed. There are relatively few
   reports of involvement of the adrenal and thyroid functions in social
   phobia, and all that has been noted is that patients with social phobia
   show an exaggerated adrenocortical response to a psychological stressor.
   Recent advances in neuro-imaging have contributed to find low striatal
   dopamine D-2 receptor binding or low dopamine transporter site density
   in patients with social phobia. They have also demonstrated the
   involvement of the cortico-limbic pathways, including the prefrontal
   cortex, hippocampus and amygdala, which show an increased activity in
   different experimental conditions.
   These brain regions have extensively been reported to play an important
   role in the cognitive appraisal in determining the significance of
   environmental stimuli, in the emotional and mnemonic integration of
   information, and in the expression of contextual fear-conditioned
   behaviors, which might be disrupted in the light of the phenomelogical
   aspects of social phobia. A substantial body of literature based on case
   reports, open and placebo-controlled trials, has now clearly examined
   the efficacy of major classes of psychotropic agents including monoamine
   oxidase inhibitors, beta-blockers, selective serotonin reuptake
   inhibitors and benzodiazepines in social phobia. Until recently,
   irreversible non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors, of which
   phenelzine was the most extensively evaluated, were considered as the
   most efficacious treatment in reducing the symptomatology associated
   with social phobia in 50-70 \% of cases after 4 to 6 weeks. However,
   side effects and dietary restrictions limit their use. This led to the
   development of reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A, for which
   careful dietary monitoring is not required. Moclobemide has been the
   most widely studied but produced unconvincingly therapeutic effects on
   social phobic symptoms. To date, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
   may be considered as a reasonable first- line pharmacotherapy for social
   phobia. There is growing evidence for the efficacy of the selective
   serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, citalopram,
   paroxetine and sertraline. They have beneficial effects with response
   rates ranging from 50 to 80 \% in social phobia. It has been recommended
   that the treatment period should be extended at least 6 months beyond
   the early improvement achieved within the first 4 to 6 weeks. The
   overall advantages include tolerability with a low risk of adverse
   events. The benzodiazepines clonazepam and alprazolam have also been
   proposed for the treatment of social phobia. Symptomatic relief occurred
   in 40 to 80 \% of the cases with a relatively rapid onset of action
   within the first two weeks. Untoward effects, discontinuation-related
   withdrawal symptoms and abuse or dependence liability constitute major
   concerns about the use of benzodiazepines, so they should be reserved
   for cases unresponsive to the safer medications cited above.
   beta-blockers such as atenolol and propanolol have commonly been
   employed in performance anxiety, decreasing autonomic symptoms (eg,
   tachycardia, sweating and dry mouth). However, they are not effective in
   the generalized form of social phobia. Other pharmacologic alternatives
   seem helpful for the management of social phobia, including venlafaxine,
   gabapentin, bupropion, nefazodone or augmentation with buspirone.
   Preliminary studies point to promising effects of these agents. Larger
   controlled clinical trials are now needed to confirm their potential
   role in the treatment of social phobia.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2200-2206}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Assessment of canine palatability is important for both the pet food and
   pharmaceutical industries; however, the current palatability assessment
   protocols are limited in their utility. The most common technique, the
   two-pan test, does not control for the satiating effects of food and may
   not be useful for long-term palatability analysis because nutritional or
   caloric characteristics of the diets may interfere with the results.
   Furthermore, the large quantities of foods consumed may be detrimental
   to the health of animals that do not self-limit their food intake. The
   purpose of this study was to determine whether a cognitive protocol
   could be used to determine food palatability in dogs. Five beagle dogs
   were trained on a three-choice object-discrimination learning task.
   After establishing object preferences, the preferred object was
   associated with no reward, a second object was associated with the dog's
   normal laboratory diet (Purina Agribrands Canine Lab Chow No. 5006;
   Agribrands Purina Canada, Inc., Woodstock, ON, Canada), and the third
   object was associated with a commercial (Hill's P/D; Hill's Pet
   Nutrition Inc., Topeka, KS) diet. In the discrimination-training phase,
   dogs were trained until they learned to avoid the no-reward object. They
   were subsequently given an additional 20 test sessions, which were used
   to determine food preference. In the reversal phase, which involved
   reversal learning, the object-food associations were modified, such that
   the object that was previously associated with Hill's P/D diet was now
   associated with the normal laboratory diet and vice versa. Once the dogs
   learned to avoid the no-reward object, they were tested for an
   additional 20 sessions. All subjects learned to avoid the no-reward
   object during the initial learning, and the number of choices to the
   object associated with the Hill's P/D diet was greater than the number
   of choices to the objects associated with the dry laboratory diet (P <
   0.05) and no reward (P < 0.05), indicating a strong preference for the
   Hill's P/D diet. The object preferences were reversed in only three of
   five dogs when the food-choice associations were reversed, although the
   two phases did not differ significantly from one another. The protocol
   in the present study provides a robust measure of food palatability and
   circumvents many of the limitations associated with other palatability
   assessment techniques. The present protocol should be useful as a
   replacement or adjunct to other tests of palatability, but requires
   further validation by comparing the assessment of more similar and novel
   foods directly with other palatability tests.}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{211-215}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{One of the major objective of domestication is the selection of lines
   with low aggressiveness and a high growth potential. Analyses of
   domesticated animals traits often illustrate numerous changes in
   behaviour due to rearing environment. However there are few reports of
   these changes in fish. In the present paper, we first describe how
   behaviour is affected by rearing and then discuss how sensory organs and
   behavioural abilities are modified during development under breeding
   conditions.
   Rearing conditions modify feeding behaviour particularly because food
   distribution do not necessary follow biological rhythm and food is often
   available in larger amount compared to wild-type situations. In
   particular food distribution mode may favour aggressiveness. Rearing
   conditions (stream, fish density...) are also susceptible to modify
   spatial distribution of fish and relationship between fish in their
   closed environment. In particular, fish often reduce their
   inter-individual distances which may also have detrimental influences on
   their aggressiveness.
   Several behavioural abilities seem to be affected by development in
   breeding conditions and this appears to be related to modification of
   sensory organs. This includes modification of the lateral line system,
   eye and smell. These modifications are often associated to a lowering of
   watchfulness threshold which in turn modifies behaviour and particularly
   escape responses from potential predators. A modification of chromatic
   adaptation has also been shown for flat fishes.
   In conclusion, the analysis of behavioural modifications is of utmost
   importance to identify indicators of domestication progress which must
   be taken into account to guarantee cultured fish welfare and thus
   rearing sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{Animals often feed more quickly when in larger groups. This group-size
   effect is often explained by safety advantages for groups but an
   alternative explanation is that animals feed faster in larger groups

   contrast, competition leads to the group-size effect only when
   individuals feed in groups of constant size. When individuals feed in
   groups that vary in size, the best strategy for dealing with competition
   is to feed intensely when in smaller groups and feed little when in
   larger (more competitive) groups. In all situations, the effects of
   competition interact with the effects of predation risk in a simple
   multiplicative way. Our results suggest that scramble competition is not
   a general explanation for the group-size effect on vigilance in

Abstract = {{Life history theory predicts that reproductive effort should increase as
   life expectancy decreases. Empirical evidence in support of this
   hypothesis is still fragmentary. We measured the effects of different
   potential indexes of mortality risk on oviposition in a geometrid moth
   Scotopteryx chenopodiata L. We conducted two experiments: in one we
   manipulated mortality risk by clipping wings or depriving the moths of
   food; in the other we studied the effect of incidental injuries, and
   varied host quality and food availability. Physical injuries led to a
   higher oviposition rate and shorter latency (i.e. a shorter
   discrimination period before oviposition) on both a high-ranked and a
   low-ranked host. High mortality risk was associated with a shorter
   latency to oviposit on the low-ranked, but not on the high-ranked host.
   These effects remained significant when we controlled for the influences
   of estimated adult age and eggload. Insects deprived of food as adults
   increased oviposition activity in the first experiment but not in the
   second. Our results suggest that certain cues of an adverse environment,

Abstract = {{In this study we identify the size-dependent risk of winter starvation
   mortality as a strong selective pressure on age-0 rainbow trout
   (Oncorhynchus mykiss) that could promote the risk-taking behaviour and
   allocation of energy to lipids previously observed in young trout
   cohorts. Age-0 trout subjected to simulated winter starvation conditions
   gradually depleted lipid reserves to a critical minimum lipid content
   below which death occurred. Small fish with lower lipid content
   exhausted lipid reserves earlier, and experienced high mortality rates
   sooner, than larger fish with greater lipid content. Consequently,
   winter starvation endurance was dependent upon size-dependent lipid
   reserves and winter duration. To validate the laboratory findings in the
   field, we stocked several size classes of hatchery-raised trout with
   known lipid content at the start of winter into two experimental lakes,
   and estimated survival and lipid depletion at winter's end. Larger age-0
   trout had greater initial lipid reserves than smaller trout. Individuals
   depleted most of their lipid reserves over the winter, and experienced

Abstract = {{Freshwater fairy shrimp that live in episodically filled rainpools are
   obligate bisexual animals that produce drought-resistant, encapsulated
   embryos called cysts. A fraction of these hatches upon each inundation,
   a bet-hedging strategy, and the resulting larvae grow in a concerted
   manner, forming a cohort. Here, we show that in the Sudan fairy shrimp,
   Streptocephalus proboscideus, about one-third of the cysts hatches
   shortly after being released from the brood-sac, without intervening
   period of drought. However, as long as the adult population overshoots a
   density of about one specimen per litre, the emerging nauplii are
   cannibalized by their parents. At such a density and above it, fairy
   shrimp filter the whole pond volume in less than 24 h and since it takes
   about the same amount of time for first-instar nauplii to moult to an
   immune size, they are all consumed. In addition to being
   auto-regulatory, this behaviour is adaptive: animals fed their own
   nauplii on top of an algal diet showed a 30\% increase in reproductive
   output, and an increase in somatic growth rate. This allocation almost
   quantitatively recouped the loss of inclusive fitness to cannibalism. In
   contrast, hatching percentages of cysts obtained from animals fed this

Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{689-700}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. For many species, human-induced disturbances can severely influence
   an individual's pay-off; however, energy-cost variations from different
   disturbance types have rarely been reported.
   2. We evaluated the dynamic behavioural responses of staging greater
   snow geese Anser caerulescens atlanticus to different types of
   disturbance in southern Quebec, Canada, between 1997 and 2000. We
   specifically considered the impact of a unique measure, a spring
   conservation hunt implemented in agricultural habitats in 1999.
   3. We tracked 237 radio-tagged females for 2764 h and recorded 697
   take-offs following fortuitous disturbance, scaring and hunting in three
   regions characterized by different habitats. Geese used cornfields in
   south-western Quebec, Scirpus marshes and hayfields in the upper St
   Lawrence estuary, and Spartina marshes and hayfields in the lower
   estuary.
   4. Overall, disturbance levels increased in the upper and lower estuary
   during years with hunting, mostly through an increase in hunting and
   scaring activities.
   5. The probability of geese returning to a refuge after disturbance in
   agricultural habitats increased in years with hunting except in the
   corn-growing region. The short-term energy gain of geese resuming
   feeding after disturbance was less than before disturbance, and this
   difference was greater in years with hunting. Distances flown after
   disturbance decreased with flock size and were longer after scaring and
   hunting than after fortuitous disturbances in the Scirpus region.
   6. Overall, habitat use varied among years and associated estimated
   energy gain decreased markedly in both years with hunting in the
   Spartina and corn-growing region, but did not change in the Scirpus
   region. Changes in behaviour due to disturbance, and especially those
   associated with hunting, probably contributed to the reduced body
   condition of staging greater snow geese during years with hunting.
   7. Synthesis and applications. From a methodological viewpoint, we
   highlight the importance of tracking the behaviour of individual animals
   after disturbance to properly evaluate its impact. From a conservation
   perspective, we provide empirical arguments to limit the hunting of
   breeding waterfowl during their prenuptial migration in order to
   facilitate their fattening and forthcoming reproduction. From a
   management standpoint, we suggest that a side-effect of disturbance
   induced by spring hunting to control overabundant populations may be
   reduced fattening and breeding output among birds that survive.
   Together, these data emphasize further the importance of measuring the
   direct and indirect effects of disturbance rather than assuming effects
   from the incidence of the disturbance alone.}},

   Aim: We aimed to determine the contribution of BMI, diet and exercise to

   Methods: Community subjects (n=211, mean age=36 years, 43\% males)
   completed validated questionnaires on gastro-oesophageal reflux, energy
   expenditure (Harvard Alumni Activity Survey), dietary intake (Harvard
   Food Frequency Questionnaire) and measures of personality and life event

   were analysed using logistic regression analyses.
   Results: The overall mean (+/-s.d.) BMI was 26.6 (+/-5.7); 79 (37\%)
   reported infrequent (<weekly) reflux and 16 (8\%) reported frequent
   (greater than or equal toweekly) reflux. The median caloric intake was
   2097 cal/day and the median daily energy expenditure was 1753 cal/day.
   Among those with BMI >25, 10\% reported frequent reflux compared to 4\%
   of those with BMI less than or equal to25. In a model which included
   age, sex and Symptom Checklist-90 somatisation T-score, BMI was
   associated with reflux (OR per 5 units=1.9, 95\% CI: 1.2, 3.0). In
   models which included diet and exercise variables, BMI but not diet or

Abstract = {{Pathogens can alter host behavior and affect the outcome of
   predator-prey interactions. Acute phase responses of hosts (e.g., a
   change in activity level or behavioral fever) often signal an infection,
   but the ecological consequences of host behavioral changes largely are
   unexplored, particularly for directly transmitted (i.e., single-host)
   pathogens. We performed three experiments to test the hypothesis that a
   pathogen, Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV), alters host behavior of
   Sonoran tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum stebbinsi Lowe, 1954) and
   enhances predation. In the first experiment, salamander larvae exposed
   to ATV experienced 48\% lower mortality from dragonfly Anax junius
   (Drury, 1773) larvae than those in controls. Second, uninfected and
   infected larvae exposed to the nonlethal (caged) presence of predators
   did not significantly differ in their distance from the predator.
   Infected salamanders significantly increased their activity level
   relative to those in controls in predator-free conditions. Finally,
   ATV-infected larvae preferred significantly warmer temperatures than
   uninfected larvae, but larvae reared at the thermal maximum for the
   virus all died. High host activity level yet retention of effective
   antipredator responses likely benefits ATV because this single-host
   pathogen relies on host survival for transmission. Preference for warmer
   temperatures may be associated with the host response to pathogens and
   may help fight infection.}},

Abstract = {{Aggregations of zooplankton, micronekton and fish are frequently
   observed above seamounts, canyons and shelf breaks. The aggregations are
   produced by five different mechanisms, all driven by ocean currents.
   Upwelling is frequently generated when ambient currents impinge on
   abrupt topographies. Nevertheless, upwelling enhances local production
   of zooplankton and fish only over large topographies such as shelf
   breaks, where the residence time of the upwelled water is sufficiently
   long to allow enrichment in primary production to propagate up the food
   web and augment the growth of resident animals. Daily accumulations
   occur over topographies at shallow and intermediate depths when the
   topography blocks the morning descent of migrating zooplankton. This
   mechanism is common over seamounts. Two other mechanisms are driven by
   behavioural response to vertical currents when zooplankton swims
   vertically in order to maintain depth: accumulations by depth retention
   against upwelling are common at depths to which migrating zooplankton
   descend during the day, while depth retention against downwelling seems
   to operate only in the upper water column (e.g., along topographically
   generated fronts). The fifth mechanism is driven by the amplification of
   currents over abrupt topographies. Strong currents enhance population
   growth of resident animals by augmenting fluxes of suspended food. A
   feed-rest hypothesis is proposed to explain how site-attached
   planktivorous fish can benefit from strong currents at sites with ample
   quiescence shelters in which the fish rest during nonfeeding, intervals.
   Four of the above mechanisms generate ``trophic focusing{''}, a process
   by which prey from immense volumes of flowing water is accumulated (or
   trapped) in a relatively small confined area. The ensuing subsidy of
   prey propagates up the food web, supporting aggregations of higher
   predators, such as fish, marine mammals and fishermen. Abrupt
   topographies can have an important role in determining trophic
   interactions in the marine realm. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights

Abstract = {{There is increasing awareness that combinations of biotic and time
   stress interact in shaping life history plasticity. Despite being
   widespread and abundant, the role of cannibalism in linking both types
   of constraints to life history plasticity has been largely neglected.
   Moreover, no studies disentangled direct (due to the extra meal) and
   indirect (due to the elimination of the competitor) life history effects
   of cannibalism, and little is known about their differential dependency
   on these constraints. We studied effects of cannibalism on the life
   history of the damselfly Lestes viridis under combinations of time
   stress (by manipulating the perceived time available in the growth
   season) and food stress. We reared larvae per two and disentangled
   direct and indirect effects of cannibalism by preventing cannibalism in
   half of the cups and by manipulating the per capita food increase after
   cannibalism. Cannibalism was more frequent under both time stress and
   food stress and our results show it may help cannibals to compensate for
   the negative effects of these constraints imposed on life history. Both
   direct and indirect benefits of cannibalism (increased development and
   growth rates, larger mass at emergence) were dependent on the timing of
   cannibalism, being more pronounced or only present when cannibalism
   occurred early. Moreover, we found that the ecological constraints (time
   stress and food stress) also differentially shaped some of the direct
   and indirect effects. Given the differential context-dependency of
   direct and indirect effects and the fact that direct and indirect life
   history effects may be both important in shaping life history,
   disentangling these effects is critical to mechanistically understand
   under which conditions cannibalism is expected to be adaptive or not.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Vertigo is one of the most frequent complaints in general
   medical practice and is often linked to psychiatric disorders. A
   longitudinal study of 67 patients with an acute vestibular disorder was
   undertaken to clarify if, after experiencing acute vestibular vertigo,
   certain patients have a higher likelihood of developing chronic,
   debilitating dizziness despite no evidence of a damaged peripheral
   vestibular system. Method: The severity of dizziness was determined in
   67 patients with vestibular neuronitis, 6 months after their release
   from hospital, using the Vertigo Symptom Scale from Yardley et al. The
   intensity of anxiety directly after vertigo was experienced,
   body-related cognitions, illness coping, personality structure, and the
   recovery of the organ of equilibrium were recorded in order to explain
   the severity of vertigo that occurred after 6 months. The function of
   the organ of equilibrium was assessed by using a caloric test. Results:
   Over a period of 6 months, 13 of the 67 patients (19.4\%) reported
   continuing dizziness after neuropathia vestibularis. Eleven of the 13
   patients showed high scores on a scale for measuring vertigo-related
   symptoms, which can be interpreted as being equivalent to anxiety. The
   variables of gender, catastrophic thoughts and a dependent personality
   accounted for 35\% of why vertigo became chronic. Conclusion:
   Neuropathia vestibularis represents a risk factor for the development of
   chronic vertigo. Chronic vertigo after neuropathia vestibularis appears
   to be equivalent to anxiety and is partly conditional on catastrophic
   thoughts at the beginning.}},

   and/or intensity of antipredator response to conspecific chemical alarm
   cues. Chemical alarm cue donors were sampled from high or low condition
   Populations. Pairs of juvenile cichlids were exposed to the skin
   extracts of high condition versus low condition donors, across a range
   of relative concentrations (200, 100, 50, 25, and 12.5\%), and a
   distilled water control. We found that cichlids exhibited overt
   antipredator behaviour beginning at a concentration of 25\% for the high
   condition cue, while a minimum response threshold concentration of 50\%
   was seen for low condition cue. The intensity of antipredator response
   was greater following exposure to the alarm cues of high condition
   stimulus versus low condition donors. Taken together, these findings
   suggest that the damage-released chemical alarm cues from high condition
   donors are qualitatively and quantitatively greater than those of low
   condition donors.}},

Abstract = {{The development in organic livestock production can be attributed to an
   increased consumer interest in organic products while, at the same time,
   increased fanners' interest in converting to organic production
   methods-often stimulated by governmental support or subsidies. It is
   important that organic production systems can fulfil the expectations of
   each of these stakeholders if organic livestock production is to
   increase further. This is of particular importance if organic pig and
   poultry production (other than egg) is to move from the present
   niche-production to a significant place in the food market, as in the
   case of beef and milk.
   It can be argued that the limited organic pork and poultry production is
   related to the fact that it is far more difficult for farmers to change
   the existing production systems for pig and poultry compared to
   production systems for cattle and other ruminants in a way that gives a
   harmonious balance between the different aims of organic fanning.
   Conflicts may occur as to the most appropriate rearing practice in
   considerating the basic aspects of the innate behaviour of animals on
   one hand, the risk of pollution from the production on the other and, in
   addition, the aim of producing in sufficient quantities. These possible
   conflicts are reflected in the compromises made in national or EU
   regulations on organic fanning. In the regulations for organic farming,
   the aspect of allowing a high degree of natural behaviour of the
   livestock is, among others, translated in the requirement that
   livestock, in certain periods of their life or of the year, should be
   allowed to graze or have access to an outdoor area. The most common
   outdoor systems for pig and poultry used in intensively managed organic
   production have some significant drawbacks in relation to environmental
   impact (risk of N-leaching and ammonia volatilisation), animal welfare
   (nose-ringed sows), high mortality in poultry and workload and
   management constraints.
   From recent experience of such systems, it is argued that there is a
   need for a radical development of the systems. There is a need for
   outdoor/free range systems (for the sake of the livestock), which are
   constructed and managed in such a way that the livestock, at the same
   time, exert a positive influence on other parts of the fanning system.
   There is evidence that pregnant sows can fulfil their nutritional needs
   to a large extent by grazing, that co-grazing sows with heifers can
   diminish the parasite burden of the heifers, and that the pig
   inclination for rooting can be managed in a way that makes ploughing and
   other heavy land cultivation more or less superfluous. As regard
   poultry, there is an indication that quite big flocks can be managed
   efficiently in a way where the flock act as weeders in other crops or
   fight pests in orchards. These elements need to be further explored as a
   basis for future system development. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Productivity of meat-type chicken dramatically improved, thanks to
   concomitant progress of the rearing methods, nutrition, genetics and
   veterinary medecine. The whole resulted in a strong reduction of
   slaughter age. As the latter is the main factor of sensory meat quality,
   it was the principal criterion of the qualitative segmentation of
   chicken production. Begun in the sixties, it resulted in differentiation
   between standard chickens, chickens with so-called `appellation
   d'origine controlee', `Label' chickens and certified chickens.
   More recently a second axis, related to the level of elaboration of
   products (whole carcass, jointed products or transformed products) has
   been developed. The productivity of the standard products is high but
   not so much higher than that of certified chicken. The difference could
   be compensated by the guarantees of traceability and production brought
   by certification. In term of quality also, part of the differences are
   vanishing, because the consumer's choices evolve and the difference in
   taste is especially marked for the thighs that are economically less
   important. However, the differences in transformation rate are in favour
   of faster-growing chickens. While the animal can express their natural
   behavior more when reared outside, they run an increased risk of
   microbial contaminations. With reference to all these results, it seems
   difficult to predict how the chicken production will evolve. But it
   appears clearly that the certified chicken. intermediary between
   standard chicken and Label chicken will develop.}},

Abstract = {{The strength of an animal's behavioural response to human presence has
   often been used as an index of an animal's susceptibility to
   disturbance. However, if behavioural responsiveness is positively
   related to the animal's condition, this may be an inappropriate index,
   as individuals showing little or no response may in fact be those with
   most to lose from changing their behaviour. We tested the link between
   individual state and responsiveness by manipulating condition via the
   provision of supplementary food for turnstones, Arenaria interpres, on
   rocky shores. Birds at one site were fed 450 g of mealworms at low tide
   every day for 3 days while birds at another site acted as a control. On
   the fourth day, using a standardized disturbance protocol, we recorded
   flush distances, flight lengths and the amount of time between predator
   scans for birds in both flocks. After a break of 3 days, the treatments
   were then swapped between sites and the procedure repeated for a total
   of six trials. Birds whose condition had been enhanced showed greater
   responsiveness to standardized human disturbance, flying away at greater
   distances from the observer, scanning more frequently for predators and
   flying further when flushed. These findings suggest that our current
   management of the impact of human disturbance may be based on inaccurate
   assessments of vulnerability, and we discuss the implications of this
   for refuge provision. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Increasing substrate structural complexity has been linked to higher
   densities of various refuge-seeking aquatic macroinvertebrates, many of
   which constitute major prey species in a variety of freshwater
   communities. We investigated (1) whether the three-spined stickleback,
   Gasterosteus aculeatus, a predator of such macroinvertebrates and an
   established model organism in studies of animal behaviour, is capable of
   discriminating between structurally complex and simple substrates, and
   (2) whether they show a substrate preference when foraging.
   Hunger-motivated sticklebacks presented with a choice of simple and
   complex substrate types preferentially foraged over complex substrates.
   This was seen when the prey density was equal on both substrate types,
   and when it was greater on the complex substrate. Where prey density was
   greater on the simple substrate, fish showed no preference for either.
   The preference for complex substrates existed in both the allocation of
   time spent foraging and in the direction and frequency of feeding
   strikes. No substrate preferences were seen in fish that were satiated,
   or when prey were absent from both substrates. This ruled out refuge as
   an explanation for the observed preference. We discuss the results in

Abstract = {{In group-living animals, competition for a scarce resource often results
   in the formation of dominance hierarchies. Dominant individuals garner
   more of that resource for themselves through the use of aggression,
   forcing subordinates to rely on nonaggressive strategies to secure it.
   Stealing from dominants is common, but subordinate thieves can risk
   attack if caught. How, then, do subordinates decide when and where to
   steal? We explored whether the opportunity to learn about the location
   and availability of food might facilitate food-stealing attempts by male
   blue gouramis, Trichogaster trichopterus, a freshwater tropical fish.
   Our results show that subordinates were able to use learned cues to
   mount highly effective `sneaky' tactics. By anticipating food location
   and availability, subordinates reduced the number of attacks they
   received as well as the amount of time they spent fleeing from
   dominants. More importantly, however, our results revealed unexpected
   plasticity in the cognitive mechanisms underlying this learning: like
   privately trained dominants, privately trained subordinates learned to
   approach food cues directly; however, on the very first occasion that
   subordinates were tested with a dominant present, they dramatically
   altered their previously learned direct approach to food cues,
   immediately adopting a different, sneaky tactic instead. Thus,
   subordinates were able to combine information about previous learning,
   namely an `expectancy' of food, with the probability of future attack
   and adjust their food-getting strategy accordingly. (C) 2004 The

   as litter-mate groups until 8 weeks of age when they were mixed into
   groups of eight animals. These groups were balanced for gender and

   pig was assigned high or low social status on the basis of relative
   success in aggressive interactions at mixing. Injury levels were
   assessed on a weekly basis from 8 to 2 1 weeks of age. Pigs were exposed
   to two group food competition tests after a period of food restriction
   at 10 weeks of age, and to an individual novel pen test at 11 weeks of
   age. Behavioural and plasma cortisol responses to both types of test
   were recorded. Low social status was associated with increased injuries
   to the head, neck and ears, and therefore reduced welfare. Pigs with low
   social status showed reduced resource-holding ability in the food
   competition test, and greater avoidance of a novel object during the
   novel pen test. It is suggested that avoidance of the novel object
   reflected `learned' fearfulness in these individuals. Environmental
   enrichment did not negate the effect of low social status on injury
   levels, but did appear to reduce the negative influence of low social
   status on stress during food restriction, and led to a reduction in
   fearfulness in response to the novel pen test. These results suggest

Abstract = {{Domesticated (farm) salmonid fishes display an increased willingness to

   experiments, we observed that domestic trout (selected for high growth
   rates) took greater risks while foraging and grew faster than a wild
   strain. However, survival consequences for greater growth rates depended
   upon the predation environment. Domestic trout experienced greater
   survival when risk was low, but lower survival when risk was high. This
   suggests that animals with high intrinsic growth rates are selected

Abstract = {{Reports of postpartum parental care in squamate reptiles (lizards and

   in black rock skinks, Egernia saxatilis, from southeastern Australia.
   These lizards live in small family groups, with adults defending
   territories against conspecifics. juvenile lizards live within their
   parents' territory and may thus be protected from infanticide. In staged
   encounters in the laboratory, adults frequently attacked unrelated
   juveniles but not their own offspring, and the parent's presence
   significantly reduced the incidence of this infanticidal aggression.
   This protection arose not through specific `parental' behaviours, but
   because adults tended to ignore juveniles when another (potentially
   threatening) adult was present. When two family groups were placed in
   the same enclosure, one family rapidly became dominant over the other.
   juveniles of the dominant family derived thermoregulatory and foraging
   benefits from their parents' status. Thus, some lizards do show
   postpartum parental care, and may thereby significantly benefit their
   progeny via reduced risk of infanticide and better access to thermal and

   originally nonpreferred prey item in 3-day-old and naive cuttlefish,
   demonstrating the flexibility of this initial behavioral preference in

   learning process involving a form of long-term memory, demonstrated for

   Experiments were designed to test the impact of dietary iron
   availability on the pathogenic process and functional outcome in a mouse

   ppm) amounts of iron for 6 weeks before the administration of MPTP, a
   mitochondrial toxin that damages nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and
   induces Parkinson-like symptoms. Low dietary iron increased serum total
   iron binding capacity (P<0.001). Consistent with neuronal protection,
   iron restriction increased sphingomyelin C16:0 and decreased ceramide
   C16:0. However, there was a 35\% decrease in striatal dopamine (DA) in

   that lacked cohesion and frequently formed subgroups. Subgroup formation
   was more strongly associated with predation risk than food availability.
   Although there were several hamadryas-like one-male units OMUs within
   the group, there was no evidence of a hamadryas multilevel society. Male
   and female members of OMUs were phenotypically more hamadryas-like than

   were consistent with the OMU substructure. Despite some promiscuous
   mating, mating was biased towards the hamadryas condition for all group
   members. Additionally, rates of immigration and emigration were very
   low, and mean pairwise relatedness within the group is rising. For
   measures of intersexual bonding, all members of the group were

Abstract = {{Evidence that fetal nutrition triggers permanent adjustments in a wide
   range of systems and health outcomes is stimulating interest in the
   evolutionary significance of these responses. This review evaluates the
   postnatal adaptive significance of fetal developmental plasticity from
   the perspective of life history theory and evolutionary models of energy
   partitioning. Birthweight is positively related to multiple
   metabolically costly postnatal functions, suggesting that the fetus has
   the capacity to distribute the burden of energy insufficiency when faced
   with a nutritionally challenging environment. Lowering total
   requirements may reduce the risk of negative energy balance, which
   disproportionately impacts functions that are not essential for survival
   but that are crucial for reproductive success. The long-term benefit of
   these metabolic adjustments is contingent upon the fetus having access
   to a cue that is predictive of its future nutritional environment, a
   problem complicated in a long-lived species by short-term ecologic
   fluctuations like seasonality. Evidence is reviewed suggesting that the
   flow of nutrients reaching the fetus provides an integrated signal of
   nutrition as experienced by recent matrilineal ancestors, which
   effectively limits the responsiveness to short-term ecologic
   fluctuations during any given pregnancy. This capacity for fetal
   nutrition to minimize the growth response to transient ecologic
   fluctuations is defined here as intergenerational ``phenotypic
   inertia,{''} and is hypothesized to allow the fetus to cut through the
   ``noise{''} of seasonal or other stochastic influences to read the
   ``signal{''} of longer-term ecologic trends. As a mode of adaptation,
   phenotypic inertia may help the organism cope with ecologic trends too
   gradual to be tracked by conventional developmental plasticity, but too
   rapid to be tracked by natural selection. From an applied perspective,
   if a trait like fetal growth is designed to minimize the effects of
   short-term fluctuations by integrating information across generations,
   public health interventions may be most effective if focused not on the
   individual but on the matriline. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Individual animals from the same population, sex, age and reproductive
   status often respond differently and consistently to predators. One
   important dimension of this behavioural variation is the shy-bold
   continuum. Innate differences in boldness might explain why individuals
   differ in their antipredator behaviour. In a laboratory experiment, we
   examined the sources of individual variation in antipredator behaviour
   of adult male lizards Lacerta monticola. We simulated in the laboratory
   repeated predatory attacks of low or high risk and analysed activity
   levels and refuge use in both situations. Multivariate analyses
   suggested the existence of two consistent and independent shy-bold
   continua. The first described a gradient from bold lizards that spent
   shorter times in the refuge after predatory approaches to shy lizards
   with longer emergence times, whereas the other described a gradient from
   bold lizards with a low propensity to hide when the predator was close
   but risk was low to shy lizards that hid more often. We analysed whether
   morphological characteristics, body condition and health (estimated from
   their T cell immunocompetence) of individuals might account for the
   differences observed. Bold individuals had smaller absolute body size,
   but relatively larger heads, better body condition and better health.
   Bold individuals with a low propensity to hide when risk was low had
   larger absolute body sizes, whereas relative head size, and body
   condition and health were not important. We suggest that the position of
   an individual in the shy-bold continua might reflect its optimal
   antipredator behaviour, which would be a function of its health, general
   quality and ability to evade predators. (C) 2004 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Wintering birds face a trade-off between starvation and predation risk.
   In Eurasian woodcocks, Scolopax rusticola, habitat use may reflect this
   trade-off because meadows, where most birds spend the night, are
   characterized by a higher risk of predation and a higher biomass of food
   (earthworms) than the woods, used by day. We monitored activity of 34
   woodcocks fitted with tiltswitch radiotags Young birds were more active
   than adults, probably because they were less efficient at foraging. In
   general, nocturnal activity was inversely correlated with air
   temperature and with daylight foraging activity, suggesting some
   compensatory mechanism, modulated by thermoregulatory constraints.
   Individual activity patterns differed, and we classified woodcocks
   according to three main wintering strategies: `always', `sometimes' or
   `never' visiting fields at night. The decision to fly to fields at night
   seemed to be taken every evening according to the amount of daylight
   foraging activity in woods and the air temperature. After feeding in a
   rich patch of food on a mild day, woodcocks did not have to risk going
   to meadows. Conversely, in patches of fewer food resources or at lower
   temperatures or both, woodcocks could not meet all their energy
   requirements without going to fields at night (where there was always
   sufficient food) and eventually, changing their diurnal sites.
   Therefore, the trade-off between feeding and predation risk depends on
   how efficiently birds find a rich patch of food in the forest and
   exploit it optimally during the day. (C) 2004 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Sexual cannibalism may influence expression of elaborate male traits by

   We paired virgin and previously mated adult females with males under
   seminatural conditions (laboratory containers with leaf litter). For
   males encountering virgin females, probability of attempted prematincy
   cannibalism varied with male size, body condition, tuft size,
   fluctuating asymmetry of tufts (FA) and female size (larger females
   attacked smaller males and males in poor condition with smaller, more
   asymmetrical tufts). Probability of successful cannibalism varied with
   the relative size of both sexes and female body condition, but not male
   tuft size (smaller males were cannibalized by larger females in better
   condition). Males with larger tufts (relative to body size) were more
   likely to mate, but no other traits (male or female) were associated
   with mating success. Postmating cannibalism risk was associated with
   female size and age, and male size, body, condition and tuft size
   (larger, older females cannibalized smaller males in poor condition with

   probability of cannibalism was influenced by size of both sexes and male
   tuft size (larger females cannibalized smaller males with smaller
   tufts). While no morphological characteristics (male or female)

   avoided going to the nest at certain times of the day and compensated by
   allocating more feeding effort to periods when predators were less

   high-risk habitat to significantly lower the risk of providing
   visitation cues to visually oriented corvid nest predators. These
   results indicate that some birds modify their daily nest visitation

Abstract = {{A clear relationship between intrauterine development and later life
   predisposition to long-term disease is well established. Weight at birth
   provides a surrogate measure for fetal development and low birth weight
   predicts changes in most endocrine axes in adulthood. The exposure of
   the fetus to elevated levels of either endogenous or synthetic
   glucocorticoids, pre and periconceptional nutritional status and
   immediate postnatal development including catch-up growth all contribute
   substantially to the development of adult onset disease. Fetal exposure
   to high levels of glucocorticoids has direct clinical relevance.
   Synthetic glucocorticoids (betamethasone/ dexamethasone) are
   administered to women at risk of preterm delivery to advance fetal
   maturation and reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality. However, in
   human pregnancy, evidence suggests that fetal exposure to synthetic
   glucocorticoids has detrimental effects on birth outcome, childhood
   cognition and long-term behavior. Studies in animals have established a
   link between prenatal exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids and
   alterations in fetal development as well as changes in placental
   function. These developmental alterations appear to be permanent.
   Whether this is the case in humans awaits long-term follow-up of
   children enrolled in randomized controlled trials of prenatal
   glucocorticoid therapy. The research challenges in this field are now
   centered on uncovering the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids are
   involved in programming the fetus for its future life, and discovering
   ways in which the effectiveness and safety of antenatal glucocorticoids

Abstract = {{Neuroadaptations occurring in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway following
   recurrent exposure to drugs of abuse have been correlated with a
   behavioral phenomenon known as behavioral sensitization. We have
   developed an animal model of prenatal cocaine exposure and, using a
   postnatal sensitization protocol, have examined the subsequent
   sensitivity of offspring to cocaine. Pregnant Swiss Webster dams were
   injected twice daily from embryonic day 8 to 17, inclusive, with cocaine
   (COC40: administered cocaine HCl at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day, and COC20:
   administered cocaine HCl at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day), or saline ( SAL).
   The SPF40 group ( saline pair-fed), a nutritional control group, was
   `pair-fed' with COC40 dams. Activity was recorded for 30 min during a
   3-day saline habituation, a 14-day `initiation' phase, when animals
   received cocaine ( 15 mg/kg) or saline every other day, and following a
   21-day `withdrawal' period when all mice were challenged with cocaine.
   COC40 offspring, as compared with SAL controls, did not habituate to a
   novel environment, demonstrated increased cocaine-induced stereotypy on
   Coc 1 (first cocaine injection), and blunted locomotor sensitization on
   challenge as measured by the percentage of each animal's baseline
   locomotion. Tissue samples of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and striatum
   (Str) of all four prenatal treatment groups were examined to determine
   whether alterations in the transcription factor CREB or glutamate
   receptor subunit, GluR1, induced by prenatal cocaine treatment may have
   contributed to the altered behavioral responses. Immunoblot quantitation
   revealed significantly increased constitutive CREB expression in the NAc

Abstract = {{Several empirical studies have demonstrated the existence of
   intraspecific variation in age and size at reproductive maturity for
   organisms experiencing different food environments and predation risk.
   For some species, these changes have been shown to arise primarily
   through changes in foraging activity. Theoretically, changes in age and
   size at maturity can arise through either behavioural or physiological
   responses. Here we analyse two models. The first is a conventional
   life-history model with no explicit recognition of the physiology of
   energy utilization by the organism - growth (i.e. weight gain) is simply
   the difference between assimilation and respiration, and there are no
   physiological restrictions on the timing of maturation. The changes in
   age and size at maturity in response to food availability and predation
   risk predicted by this model are consistent with published experimental
   data for one particular species, the midge Chironomus tentans. Numerical
   calculations with parameters appropriate to this species suggest that
   the optimal response is purely behavioural. The second model is a
   general, dynamic energy budget model that takes account of the energetic
   costs associated with development to reproductive maturity. With that
   model, we prove that the optimum partitioning of energy between growth
   and development is independent of predation risk and food availability,
   thereby demonstrating the generality of the previous finding with the
   life-history model. On the basis of the combined insight from the two
   models, we propose that fixed allocation to growth and development.
   despite variation in food availability and predation risk, is optimal
   for a broad class of life histories. Consequently, the absence of an
   allocation response to experimental manipulation of food or predators
   should not necessarily be taken as evidence for physiological or other
   constraints on life-history adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Until recently, the principal causes of degenerative disease were
   thought to act in adult life and to accelerate destructive processes,
   such as the formation of atheroma and rise in blood pressure. Recent
   observations that people who develop coronary heart disease grow
   differently to other people during fetal life and childhood have,
   however, led to a new `developmental' model for the disease. Low
   birthweight has been shown to be associated with increased rates of
   coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and altered glucose
   tolerance. These associations with low birthweight extend across the
   normal range of birthweight and reflect slow fetal growth rather than
   premature birth. The associations are thought to be consequences of
   developmental plasticity, the phenomenon by which one genotype can give
   rise to a range of different physiological or morphological states in
   response to different environmental conditions during development.
   Recent observations suggest that low birthweight, thinness at 2 years of
   age and an increase in body mass index (BMI) after the age of 2 years
   are each associated with the development of insulin resistance in later
   life. The prevention of a substantial proportion of type 2 diabetes and
   other disorders linked to insulin resistance may, therefore, depend on
   interventions during development. These include protecting the growth of
   babies during the first 2 years after birth by good infant feeding
   practices and preventing a rapid increase in BMI after the age of 2
   years. Improving fetal nutrition remains an important long-term goal.

   maintained by genotype-specific effects of variable resource levels
   (genotype-environment interaction). To do this, we measured genetic
   variation and covariation under two environmental conditions -
   relatively low and relatively high food availability. We found high
   levels of genetic variation for most traits, but we only found a
   significant G x E interaction across food levels for one trait (body
   size) for one population. The across-environment correlations for size
   were large and positive, indicating that the reaction norms for size did
   not cross. We also found that male colour pattern elements had nearly an
   order of magnitude more genetic variation than did male size.
   Heritability estimates indicated that Y-linked genes are responsible for

Abstract = {{For fishes settling over wide areas, spatial temperature variation can
   have a significant impact on growth rates during the early juvenile
   period. Size variation within cohorts and across years will depend on
   the thermal sensitivity of growth rate, the ability to move to favorable
   growth environments, and the potential to compensate for periods of
   reduced growth. We examined the growth, behavior and energy storage
   responses of juvenile Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis exposed to
   a thermally induced reduction in growth. Halibut reared for 12 wk at 2
   degrees C then acclimated to and grown at 10 degrees C (delayed
   treatment) were compared to fish reared continuously at 10 degrees C
   (controls). Growth rates at 2 degrees C were 25\% of those at 10 degrees
   C, resulting in a 2.4-fold difference in mass after 12 wk. Following
   acclimation to 10 degrees C, specific growth rates of delayed fish were
   20\% higher than controls. Complete compensation would have required 35
   wk, assuming maintenance of observed growth rate differences between
   treatments. Rapid growth during the compensation phase was probably due
   in part to a reduction in the allocation of energy to lipid storage:
   length-corrected lipid levels of delayed fish were 14\% lower than
   levels among control fish. Behavioral observations indicated that growth
   compensating fish were more active than control fish; this is assumed to
   reflect increased foraging activity. However, when presented with food,
   growth-compensating halibut did not initiate feeding more rapidly than
   control fish. The predation and starvation risks associated with
   increased activity and decreased energy storage appear to represent
   trade-offs with rapid compensatory growth in juvenile halibut.}},

Abstract = {{Intertidal invertebrates are model organisms for examining the
   environmental control of life-history traits because of the sharp
   gradients in biological and physical factors found in their habitat,
   including wave action, temperature, food availability, and predation.
   However, the effect of a particular factor on ecological and
   evolutionary processes is difficult to separate when multiple factors
   vary simultaneously. We examined shifts in life-history traits in the
   intertidal gastropod Littorina saxatilis Olivi across an intertidal
   shoreline where predation appears to have little influence. We
   determined the density, size, fecundity, and size at maturity of snails
   in 4 distinct zones across the shoreline and estimated growth rates in
   each zone. Size, fecundity, median size at maturity, and growth rate all
   exhibited pronounced clines across the shoreline with higher values in
   the lower zones, where food abundance was highest. Snail density,
   however, peaked in the mid-zones. The clines in life-history traits
   corresponded with food availability and environmental stress (wave
   forces and desiccation stress), and these factors were the likely
   determinants of the patterns observed. We also conducted a reciprocal
   transplant experiment between the extreme zones to assess if any
   differences in growth rate might have a genetic basis. Snails
   transplanted from the high zone to the low zone grew 7 times faster than
   snails that remained in the high zone and, more unexpectedly, 1.6 times
   greater than local snails from the low zone. Snails transplanted from
   the low zone to the high zone did not grow at all while local snails
   from the high zone had slow, although measurable, growth. These
   divergent responses of transplanted snails (i.e. counter-gradient
   variation) suggest that there may be differential size-dependent
   selection between the extreme zones with the greater wave forces of the
   low shore selecting against fast growth which would otherwise be
   supported by the abundance of food found there.}},

Abstract = {{Periods of poor nutrition during early development may have negative
   fitness consequences in subsequent periods of ontogeny. In insects,
   suppression of growth and developmental rate during the larval stage are
   likely to affect size and timing of maturity, which in turn may lead to
   reduced reproductive success or survivorship. In light of these costs,
   individuals may achieve compensatory growth via behavioural or
   physiological mechanisms following food limitation. In this study, we
   examined the effects of a temporary period of food restriction on
   subsequent growth and age and size at maturity in the larval damselfly
   Ischnura verticalis (Odonata: Coenagrionidae). We also asked whether
   this temporary period of reduced nutrition affected subsequent foraging
   behaviour under predation risk. I. verticalis larvae exposed to a
   temporary food shortage suffered from a reduced growth rate during this
   period relative to a control group that was fed ad libitum. However,
   increased growth rates later in development ensured that adult body size
   measurements ( head and pronotum widths) did not differ between the
   treatments upon emergence. In contrast, adult dry mass did not catch up
   to that of the controls, indicating that the increased growth rates for
   size dimensions occur at the cost of similar gains in mass. Predators
   reduced foraging effort of larvae, but this reduction did not differ
   between control larvae and those previously exposed to poor nutrition.}},

Abstract = {{Many species use refugia to avoid predators, but remaining in a refuge
   is costly because foraging and engaging in other beneficial activities
   are curtailed while in a refuge. Thus, we expect that the duration of
   refuge use will be optimized. We tested a key prediction of this
   optimization hypothesis in yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris
   (Audubon and Bachman, 1841), by providing supplemental food next to
   their burrows to manipulate the costs of remaining in a refuge. We then
   systematically walked towards a subject that was foraging on
   supplementary food or a subject that was not foraging on supplementary
   food until the individual disappeared into its burrow. We found a
   significant effect of our feeding treatment; subjects with supplementary
   food emerged from their burrows sooner than those without it. We also
   found a complex interaction between our feeding treatment and immergence
   distance (i.e., the distance subjects were at when they disappeared into
   their burrows). Individuals that tolerated close approaches emerged
   sooner when food was present, while those that were intolerant of
   approaching humans took longer to emerge and emerged sooner when food
   was not present. Juveniles emerged significantly sooner than adults,
   while there was no detectable difference between emergence times for
   adults and yearlings. This is the first demonstration in a mammal that
   hiding time is sensitive to the cost of remaining in the burrow. A
   number of previous studies on hiding times have focused on ectothermic
   species. More generally, our results suggest that endotherms are also
   likely to optimize the time that they remain in a refuge.}},

Abstract = {{Foraging behavior often reflects food availability in predictable ways.
   For example, in habitats where food availability is high, predators
   should attack prey more often and move more slowly than in habitats
   where food availability is low. To assess relative food availability and
   habitat quality, I studied the foraging behavior of breeding
   Prothonotary Warblers (Protonotaria citrea) in two forest habitat types,
   cypress-gum swamp forest and coastal-plain levee forest. I quantified
   foraging behavior with focal animal sampling and continuous recording
   during foraging bouts. I measured two aspects of foraging behavior: 1)
   prey attack rate (attacks per minute), using four attack maneuvers
   (glean, sally, hover, strike), and 2) foraging speed (movements per
   minute), using three types of movement (hop, short flight {[}less than
   or equal to1 m], long flight {[}>1 m]). Warblers attacked prey more
   often in cypress-gum swamp forest than in coastal-plain levee forest.
   Foraging speed, however, was not different between habitats. I also
   measured foraging effort (\% time spent foraging) and relative frequency
   of attack maneuvers employed in each habitat; neither of these variables
   was influenced by forest type. I conclude that Prothonotary Warblers
   encounter more prey when foraging in cypress-gum swamps than in
   coastal-plain levee forest, and that greater food availability results
   in higher density and greater reproductive success for birds breeding in
   cypress-gum swamp.}},

   Hypothesis: Reproductive output of the self-fertilizing hermaphroditic

   Organism: Sperm depletion and laying of unfertilized oocytes occurs in

   nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. This phenomenon has been much
   discussed as a possible contradiction to the usual expectation of
   selection for maximum fertility.
   Methods: Caenorhabditis elegans were maintained in a variety of food
   regimes. not just the ad libitum Escherichia coli typical of laboratory
   cultures. Sperm production, oocyte production and body size were
   measured for nematodes cultured on agar with feeding treatments of
   serially diluted bacteria suspensions. before and during gamete

   Results: Reproduction was sperm-limited only for nematodes in the
   highest food treatments (10(6) or more E coli cells per day); lower food
   treatments produced smaller worms with considerable excess sperm.
   Caenorhabditis elegans grown ill natural soil or compost microcosms
   achieved the same sizes as those in treatments that showed oocyte
   limitation, not the large sizes of those typical of C elegans in
   treatments that exhibited sperm limitation. Enriching soil or compost by
   adding E. coli produced appreciably larger C elegans, but only if
   numbers of other invertebrates - potential predators/competitors of C
   elegans - were minimized. Even with increased nutrients and reduced
   numbers of other invertebrates, only a few C. elegans in natural soil or
   compost were large enough to be consistent with sperm limitation.}},

Abstract = {{Weight loss is difficult to achieve and maintaining the weight loss is

   In this paper we have reviewed the literature on factors associated with
   weight loss maintenance and weight regain. We have used a definition of
   weight maintenance implying intentional weight loss that has
   subsequently been maintained for at least 6 months. According to our
   review, successful weight maintenance is associated with more initial
   weight loss, reaching a self-determined goal weight, having a physically
   active lifestyle, a regular meal rhythm including breakfast and
   healthier eating, control of over-eating and self-monitoring of
   behaviours. Weight maintenance is further associated with an internal
   motivation to lose weight, social support, better coping strategies and
   ability to handle life stress, self-efficacy, autonomy, assuming
   responsibility in life, and overall more psychological strength and
   stability. Factors that may pose a risk for weight regain include a
   history of weight cycling, disinhibited eating, binge eating, more
   hunger, eating in response to negative emotions and stress, and more
   passive reactions to problems.}},

Abstract = {{Recent theoretical and empirical work argues that growth rate can evolve
   and be optimized, rather than always being maximized. Chronically low
   resource availability is predicted to favour the evolution of slow
   growth, whereas attaining a size-refuge from mortality risk is predicted
   to favour the evolution of rapid growth. Guppies (Poecilia reticulata)
   evolve differences in behaviour, morphology and life-history traits in
   response to predation, thus demonstrating that predators are potent
   agents of selection. Predators in low-predation environments prey
   preferentially on small guppies, but those in high-predation
   environments appear to be non-selective. Because guppies can outgrow
   their main predator in low- but not high-predation localities, we
   predict that predation will select for higher growth rates in the
   low-predation environments. However, low-predation localities also tend
   to have lower productivity than high-predation localities, yielding the
   prediction that guppies from these sites should have slower growth
   rates. Here we compare the growth rates of the second laboratory-born
   generation of guppies from paired high- and low-predation localities
   from four different drainages. In, two out of four comparisons, guppies
   from high-predation sites grew significantly faster than their
   low-predation counterparts. We also compare laboratory born descendants
   from a field introduction experiment land show that guppies introduced
   to a low-predation environment evolved slower growth rates after 13
   years, although this was evident only at the high food level. The weight
   of the evidence suggests that resource availability plays a more
   important role than predation in shaping the evolution of growth rates.}},

   Thirteen large field mice were placed in enclosures and offered wild

Abstract = {{In theory, for any communication system, receivers cannot increase their
   responsiveness to signals without simultaneously increasing their risk
   of responding to inappropriate stimuli. This inevitable tradeoff may be
   an important selective pressure on signalling systems, but has rarely
   been studied. Nestling tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor, produce a
   begging display when their parents arrive at the nest with food, but
   they also beg to apparently inappropriate stimuli in the absence of
   parents, such as movements of the nest or broodmates. To explore the
   implications of these errors for begging, we experimentally determined
   how begging errors vary with nestling hunger and age, two factors that
   affect begging rate and intensity in response to parents. Specifically,
   we examined how begging rate and intensity varied in response to
   recordings of (1) a tree swallow adult landing on a nestbox and calling
   and (2) a common grackle, Quiscalis quiscala, a nest predator, landing
   on a nestbox, during a 1-h period of food deprivation and also across
   two ages (5-6 and 7-9 days posthatch). Nestlings increased the rate and
   intensity of their begging responses to both swallow and grackle
   stimulus sounds as time without food increased, although responses to
   the grackle sounds were always less than to the swallow sounds. Begging
   rate, but not intensity, increased with age for both swallow and grackle
   sounds; both measures of response were lower for the grackle sound at
   both ages. Thus, as nestlings become more responsive to parents, they
   also risk committing more errors. This trade-off supports theoretical
   predictions and may be an important selective force shaping
   parent-offspring signalling. (c) 2004 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{1. Models linking the behaviours of individual animals, their positions
   within socially complex groups and spatio-temporal variation in resource
   distribution offer a promising base for predicting population responses
   to changing environments. The ideal free and despotic distributions and
   their derivatives are particularly influential in this regard.
   2. Due to the difficulties of conducting work in the wild, for some
   groups of animals such models are often based on observations of animals
   in small-scale systems under conditions that are well controlled, but
   unnaturally simple.
   3. Using an experimental system based on field observations of home
   range size and variation in food availability, the present study tested
   whether models derived using small-scale laboratory observations are
   valid for juvenile Atlantic salmon in more natural conditions.
   4. Contrary to predictions, we found no differences in behaviour between
   the control fish (which experienced consistently rich feeding patches)
   and the experimental fish (which experienced unpredictable 10-fold
   changes in patch quality).
   5. Also contrary to predictions, in the variable condition, salmon used
   high quality patches (which were an order of magnitude better than low
   quality patches) only marginally (5\%) more than would be expected if
   they were to forage at random. There was significant variation in
   foraging strategies between individual fish, with 28\% of the population
   making non-random use of foraging patches.
   6. The only apparent systematic relationship between social rank and use
   of foraging patches was that fish that were both dominant and made many
   moves between feeding locations tended to leave rich patches less
   frequently than they left poor patches.
   7. Despite the low correlation between patch quality and movement, there
   was substantial movement of fish among patches. Forty-four per cent of
   moves followed aggressive interactions and most others were spontaneous,
   with no obvious motivating factor apparent.
   8. The study exposes a discrepancy between expectations derived from the
   basic concepts of patch choice theory and the behaviour of Atlantic
   salmon in the conditions pertaining in the present study.
   9. It is suggested that this discrepancy may arise both from the fact
   that applicability of patch choice models may be very sensitive to the
   stability of differences in patch quality and from uncertainties about
   the costs of habitat sampling.}},

Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{25-36}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Thermal constraints on the time available for activity have been
   proposed as a proximate mechanism to explain variation in suites of life
   history traits. The longer that an ectotherm can maintain activity, the
   more time it has to forage and the greater chance that it will encounter
   a predator and be eaten. Thus, the thermal environment may produce a
   trade off between growth and survival when variation in the environment
   favors increased activity. I used mark-recapture data from a demographic
   study of three natural populations of the sagebrush lizard (Sceloporus
   graciosus) and estimates of thermal opportunity for each population to
   evaluate whether variation in the thermal environment can explain
   patterns of growth and survival that occur over an elevational gradient.
   Lizards from the highest elevation population exhibited higher
   individual growth rates than those of lizards from lower elevation,
   while mortality rates increased with elevation for these populations.
   The covariation of fast growth and high mortality with increased thermal
   opportunity is the opposite trend expected if the thermal environment
   alone is to explain patterns of life history in these lizards.
   Additional factors including thermal heterogeneity in the distribution
   of microhabitats of lizards, adaptation to local environmental
   conditions, and a potential trade-off between resource acquisition and
   predation risk need to be addressed to obtain a satisfactory explanation
   of the causative mechanisms producing life history variation.}},

   mature brain. Components of the metabolic pathway for retinoids have
   been identified in adult brain tissues, suggesting that
   all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) can be synthesized in discrete regions of
   the brain. The distribution of retinoid receptor proteins in the adult
   nervous system is different from that seen during development; and
   suggests that retinoid signalling is likely to have a physiological role
   in adult cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum and
   associated brain regions. A number of neuronal specific genes contain
   recognition sequences for the retinoid receptor proteins and can be
   directly regulated by retinoids. Disruption of retinoid signalling
   pathways in rodent models indicates their involvement in regulating
   synaptic plasticity and associated learning and memory behaviours.
   Retinoid signalling pathways have also been implicated in the
   pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and depression.
   Overall, the data underscore the likely importance of adequate
   nutritional Vitamin A status for adult brain function and highlight
   retinoid signalling pathways as potential novel therapeutic targets for
   neurological diseases. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many grazing-management challenges stem from poor livestock distribution
   resulting in overuse of some areas and low utilization of others.
   Managing livestock-distribution patterns requires knowledge of pasture
   characteristics and animal behavior patterns. Behavioral patterns result
   from recognizable processes that include inherited attributes,
   individual and social learning systems, cue-consequence specificity,
   predispositions toward novel stimuli, and spatial memory. Through these
   behavioral mechanisms, animals form and revise preferences and aversions
   for specific locations in their foraging landscape. To accomplish
   habitat selection, domestic herbivores use sight and sound cues to seek
   and return to high-quality foraging locations. Nested within habitat
   selection are learned diet preferences and aversions by which ungulate
   herbivores associate taste with positive or negative postingestive
   feedback. The deliberate and careful modification of animal attributes
   and habitat characteristics could yield options for adaptive rangeland
   management. In this article, we describe the basic principles that
   underlie how animals make decisions about where to forage and how long
   to stay in a particular habitat. We also suggest management practices
   designed to modify animal behavior and alter habitat-use patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Many carnivorous arthropods can use chemical information from plants to
   locate their herbivorous prey. The composition of blends of
   herbivore-induced plant volatiles can vary with plant and herbivore
   species and thus carnivores are confronted with variable information
   about the presence of their prey. Such environmental variation is
   expected to favour learning. We investigated the learning ability of the
   predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis, a specialized natural enemy of
   polyphagous spider mites. We reared mites on different plant species,
   and subsequently tested their preference for volatiles from lima bean
   plants infested with either the prey herbivore Tetranychus urticae or
   the nonprey caterpillar Spodoptera exigua in a Y-tube olfactometer.
   Predators reared on lima bean preferred the volatiles induced by T
   urticae, whereas predators reared on cucumber did not. We also
   investigated the foraging behaviour of mites after a nonrewarding
   experience during the adult phase (i.e. food deprivation in the presence
   of S. exigua-induced volatiles from lima bean) or after a rewarding
   experience (i.e. feeding in the presence of T urticae-induced
   volatiles). The rewarding experience had a much larger impact on the
   foraging responses. Predatory mites with multiple experiences (i.e. a
   nonrewarding experience followed by a rewarding experience) had the
   strongest preference for T. urticae-induced versus S. exigua-induced
   volatiles. We conclude that these learning abilities enable the
   predatory mites to forage in an environment where their prey can feed on
   a different plant species than the one on which the predator developed,
   and where nonprey caterpillars are also present. (c) 2004 The

Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{For many animals, selecting whether to fora e during day or night is a
   critical fitness problem: at night, predation risks are lower but
   feeding is less efficient. Habitat selection is a closely related
   problem: the best location for nocturnal foraging could be too risky
   during daytime, and habitat that is safe and profitable in daytime may
   be unprofitable at night. We pose a theory that assumes animals select
   the combination of daytime and night activity (feeding vs. hiding), and
   habitat, that maximizes expected future fitness. Expected fitness is
   approximated as the predicted probability of surviving starvation and
   predation over a future time horizon, multiplied by a function
   representing the fitness benefits of growth. The theory ` s usefulness
   and generality were tested using pattern-oriented analysis of an
   individual-based model (IBM) of stream salmonoids and the extensive
   literature on observed diel behavior patterns of these animals.
   Simulation experiments showed that the IBM reproduces eight diverse
   patterns observed in real populations. (1) Diet activity (whether
   foraging occurs during day and/or night) varies among a population ` s
   individuals, and from day to day for each individual. (2) Salmonids feed
   in shallower and slower water at night. (3) Individuals pack more
   tightly into the best habitat when feeding at night. (4) Salmonids feed
   relatively more at night if temperatures (and, therefore, metabolic
   demands) are low. (5) Daytime feeding is more common for life stages in
   which potential fitness increases more rapidly with growth. (6)
   Competition for feeding or hiding sites can shift foraging between day
   and night. (7) Daytime feeding is more common when food availability is
   low. (8) Diet activity patterns are affected by the availability of good
   habitat for feeding or hiding, We can explain many patterns of variation
   in diel foraging behavior without assuming that populations or
   individuals vary in how inherently nocturnal or diurnal they are.
   Instead, these patterns can emerge from the search by individuals for
   good trade-offs between growth and survival under different habitat and
   competitive conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although there have been numerous reports in personality of
   mood disorders, there have been few reports in regard with personality
   of winter seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Furthermore, no reports
   have been published concerning summer SAD personality characteristics.
   Thus, this study was conducted to assess the personality of winter and
   summer SAD using Tri-dimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) that
   have been used in a variety of mental disorders.
   Methods: A total of 6135 Japanese were evaluated with TPQ, the Seasonal
   Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ) and the Self-rating Depression
   Scale (SDS). Winter, summer and non-SAD groups were classified by SPAQ.
   We compared the difference of personality trait among these three groups
   in consideration of gender, age and SDS score influence.
   Results: Winter SAD demonstrated higher ``Novelty Seeking{''} and ``Harm
   Avoidance{''}; summer SAD showed higher ``Harm Avoidance{''} than the
   non-SAD group. ``Harm Avoidance{''} in both SAD groups was re-analyzed
   using SDS score as a covariate, and ``Novelty Seeking{''} in winter SAD
   using age as a covariate. As a result, the significance of high
   ``Novelty Seeking{''} and high ``Harm Avoidance{''} in winter SAD was
   excluded. However, ``Harm Avoidance{''} remained the significant
   difference between summer and non-SAD.
   Limitation: SAD was diagnosed only by SPAQ and not by interview. The
   state-dependency of ``Harm Avoidance{''} was not confirmed in identical
   patients over lapse of time.
   Conclusion: Patients with winter SAD have high ``Hann Avoidance{''}
   dependent on the depressive state that is in accordance with
   non-seasonal depression. Patients with summer SAD have high ``Hann
   Avoidance{''} possibly independent from the depressive state. (c) 2004

Abstract = {{Early experience has a particularly great effect on most organisms.
   Normal development may be disrupted by early environmental influences;
   individuals that survive have to cope with the damaging consequences.
   Additionally, the responses required to cope with environmental
   challenges in early life may have long-term effects on the adult
   organism. A further set of processes, those of developmental plasticity,
   may induce a phenotype that is adapted to the adult environment
   predicted by the conditions of early life. A mismatch between prediction
   and subsequent reality can cause severe health problems in those human
   societies where economic circumstances and nutrition are rapidly
   improving. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of plasticity is,
   therefore, clinically important. However, to conduct research in this
   area, developmental plasticity must be disentangled from disruption and
   the adverse long-term effects of coping. The paper reviews these
   concepts and explores ways in which such distinctions may be made in

Abstract = {{Since David Lack first proposed that birds rear as many young as they
   can nourish, food limitation has been accepted as the primary
   explanation for variation in clutch size and other life-history traits
   in birds. The importance of food limitation in life-history variation,
   however, was recently questioned on theoretical grounds. Here, we show
   that clutch size differences between two populations of a neotropical
   thrush were contrary to expectations under Lack's food limitation
   hypothesis. Larger clutch sizes were found in a population with higher
   nestling starvation rate (i.e. greater food limitation). We
   experimentally equalized clutches between populations to verify this
   difference in food limitation. Our experiment confirmed greater food
   limitation in the population with larger mean clutch size. In addition,
   incubation bout length and nestling growth rate were also contrary to
   predictions of food limitation theory. Our results demonstrate the
   inability of food limitation to explain differences in several
   life-history traits: clutch size, incubation behaviour, parental feeding
   rate and nestling growth rate. These life-history traits were better
   explained by inter-population differences in nest predation rates. Food
   limitation may be less important to life history evolution in birds than
   suggested by traditional theory.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Recent literature reviews have questioned hostility as a
   risk factor for heart disease. However, controversy persists due to the
   rarity of large-scale prospective cohort studies of initially healthy
   populations.
   Methods: We prospectively investigated the association between hostility
   and cardiovascular (and all-cause) mortality among 20,550 men and women,
   41-80 years of age, participating in the European Prospective
   Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition in Norfolk (EPIC-Norfolk),
   United Kingdom study. Participants were recruited by post from general
   practice age-sex registers and subsequently attended health checks that
   included the assessment of coronary disease risk factors. Hostility
   assessment was completed by postal questionnaire.
   Results: During mean follow-up of 6 years, 1284 deaths were recorded
   including 481 from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hostility was not
   associated with CVD mortality, after adjustment for age and prevalent
   disease, in either men (rate ratio for a 1 SD decrease in hostility

   CVD mortality (independent of age, prevalent disease and cigarette
   smoking) for participants reporting very high hostility and for those
   aged less than 60 years.
   Conclusions: Hostility was not associated with an increased risk of

Abstract = {{Background: Variation in the perception of bitter tastes has been
   associated with eating behavior, body composition, and cardiovascular
   disease. Recent observations have implicated 2 common haplotypes of
   TAS2R38 in the determination of bitter compound-tasting ability.
   Objective: The objectives of the study were to examine, in the British
   Women's Heart and Health Study cohort, any association between TAS2R38
   haplotypes, coronary heart disease (CHD), CHD risk factors, and eating
   behavior and to examine whether the associations allow for estimation of
   the effects of variation in diet on the etiology of common disease.
   Design: We conducted a cross-sectional study of relations between
   TAS2R38 haplotypes and CHD, CHD risk factors, and eating behavior in
   3383 women from 23 British towns.
   Results: Genotyping at P49A and V262A in TAS2R38 (rs713598 and
   rsl726866) allowed construction of all 4 possible haplotypes. The 2 most
   common haplotypes corresponded with previously identified haplotypes
   related to bitter compound-tasting ability. No substantial evidence of
   association was found between these haplotypes and CHD (odds ratio for
   taste-defining haplotypes: 0.97; 95\% Cl: 0.78, 1.2), body mass index
   (difference between means of taste-defining haplotypes: -0.084; 95\% Cl:
   -0.45, 0.29), or a series of physiologic and dietary characteristics. A
   marginally lower risk of diabetes was observed among those with the
   nontaster haplotype than among those with the taster haplotype (odds

Abstract = {{Eggs of vertebrates contain steroid hormones of maternal origin that may
   influence offspring performance. Recently, it has been shown that
   glucocorticoids, which are the main hormones mediating the stress
   response in vertebrates, are transmitted from the mother to the egg in
   birds. In addition, mothers with experimentally elevated corticosterone
   levels lay eggs with larger concentrations of the hormone, which produce
   slow growing offspring with high activity of the hypothalamo-adrenal
   axis under acute stress. However, the effects and function of transfer
   of maternal corticosterone to the eggs are largely unknown. In the
   present study, we injected corticosterone in freshly laid eggs of
   yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis), thus increasing the
   concentration of the hormone within its natural range of variation, and
   analyzed the effect of manipulation on behavioral, morphological, and
   immune traits of the offspring in the wild. Eggs injected with
   corticosterone had similar hatching success to controls, but hatched
   later. Mass loss during incubation was greater for
   corticosterone-treated eggs, except for the last laid ones.
   Corticosterone injection reduced rate and loudness of late embryonic
   vocalizations and the intensity of chick begging display. Tonic
   immobility response, reflecting innate fearfulness, was unaffected by
   hormone treatment. Elevated egg corticosterone concentrations depressed
   T-cell-mediated immunity but had no detectable effects on humoral immune
   response to a novel antigen, viability at day 10, or growth. Present
   results suggest that egg corticosterone can affect the behavior and
   immunity of offspring in birds and disclose a mechanism mediating early
   maternal effects whereby stress experienced by females may negatively
   translate to offspring phenotypic quality.}},

   performed before surgery, on the second postoperative day, and on
   discharge from the intensive care unit. Preoperative serum
   concentrations of albumin were compared with those of a control group
   that consisted of 20 healthy and well-nourished children.
   Results: Preoperative albumin concentrations of patients were lower than
   those of the control group (3.4 0.25 g/dL versus 4.0 0.18 g/dL, P <
   0.05). Serum levels decreased on the second postoperative day and at
   discharge from the intensive care unit (3.1 0.65 g/dL and 3.2 0.44 g/dL,
   P < 0.05) compared with preoperative concentrations. Preoperative
   concentrations lower than 3.0 g/dL were associated with increased
   postsurgical infection (P = 0.0026) and with increased mortality (P =
   0.0138). Patients whose postoperative levels were lower than 3.0 g/dL
   had longer hospital stays compared with those whose concentrations were
   higher than 3.0 g/dL (14.5 1.3 d versus 10 2.2 d, P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: The results suggest that hypoalbuminemia is common among
   children who have heart disease and are at high surgical risk, and serum
   albumin concentrations lower than 3 g/dL may be related to outcome in
   the period after cardiac surgery. 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The prevalence of obesity is rising throughout the world. Indeed,
   obesity has reached epidemic proportions in many developed and
   transition countries. Obesity is a complex disease with multifactorial
   origin, which in many cases appears as a polygenic condition affected by
   environmental factors. Treatment or prevention of obesity is necessary
   to reverse or avoid the onset of type 2 diabetes and other
   obesity-related diseases. Weight loss is a complex trait that depends on
   many environmental, behavioural and genetic influences. An effective
   programme for the management of overweight and obesity must take into
   account all of these factors. Individual responses to weight loss
   interventions vary widely and reliable predictors of successful slimming
   are poorly understood. The individual genetic make-up participating in
   energy expenditure regulation, appetite control, lipid metabolism and
   adipogenesis, have been reported to affect the risk of treatment failure
   in some subjects. In addition, the genotype could also help to predict
   the changes in lipid profile, cardiovascular risk factors and insulin
   sensitivity in response to weight loss. Herein, the current evidence
   from human studies that support the existence of a genetic component and
   the participation of different polymorphisms in the prognosis of weight
   loss induced by interventions leading to a negative energy balance are
   reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{In hermit crabs, Clibanarius vittatus, activities associated with
   foraging for food and searching for a different gastropod shell are
   incompatible with mating activities. We hypothesized that due to the
   short mating season that mating would have priority over feeding or
   shell seeking. We compared the mating activities of groups of crabs in
   the absence of food and shell cues to mating activities of groups of
   crabs presented with food cues, shell cues, or a combination of food and
   shell cues. We measured the number of minutes of precopulatory behaviors
   executed and the number of pairs formed in these groups during 60
   minutes periods. Comparison of mating activity in the presence and
   absence of shell availability cues supported our hypothesis. Shell
   availability cues had no effect on the number of pairs formed or the
   number of minutes of precopulatory behaviors. However, responses to food
   cues did not support the hypothesis. Food cues from high quality food
   very significantly decreased both the number of pairs formed and the
   number of minutes of precopulatory behavior executed. This was true for
   both food cues alone or in combination with shell-availability cues. The
   dominance of food-related activities over reproductive activities was
   surprising given the short mating season of C. vittatus at the latitude

Abstract = {{The neuroendocrine protein secretogranin II is the precursor of several
   neuropeptides, including secretoneurin and a novel 66-amino acid
   peptide, EM66, the sequence of which has been highly conserved across
   the vertebrae phylum. The presence of EM66 has been detected in the
   adult and fetal human adrenal gland, as well as the rat pituitary and
   adrenal glands. The present study aimed to explore a possible
   neuroendocrine role of EM66 by analysing its occurrence and distribution
   within the jerboa hypothalamus, and its potential implication in the
   control of feeding behaviour. High-performance liquid chromatography
   analysis of jerboa hypothalamic extracts combined with a
   radioimmunoassay of EM66 revealed a single peak of immunoreactive
   material exhibiting the same retention time as recombinant EM66.
   Immunocytochemical labelling showed that EM66-producing neurones are
   widely distributed in several hypothalamic regions, including the
   preoptic area, the suprachiasmatic, supraoptic, parvocellular
   paraventricular and arcuate nuclei, and the lateral hypothalamus. Food
   deprivation for 5 days induced a significant increase in the number of
   EM66-containing neurones within the arcuate nucleus (105\% increase) and
   the parvocellular aspect of the paraventricular nucleus (115\%
   increase), suggesting that EM66 could be involved in the control of
   feeding behaviour and/or the response to stress associated with fasting.
   Altogether, these data reveal the physiological plasticity of the EM66
   system in the hypothalamus and implicate this novel peptide in the
   regulation of neuroendocrine functions.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Examine a model that encourages health at every size as
   opposed to weight loss. The health at every size concept supports
   homeostatic regulation and eating intuitively (ie, in response to
   internal cues of hunger, satiety, and appetite).
   Design Six-month, randomized clinical trial; 2-year follow-up.
   Subjects White, obese, female chronic dieters, aged 30 to 45 years
   (N=78).
   Setting Free-living, general community.
   Interventions Six months of weekly group intervention (health at every
   size program or diet program), followed by 6 months of monthly aftercare
   group support.
   Main outcome measures Anthropometry (weight, body mass index), metabolic
   fitness (blood pressure, blood lipids), energy expenditure, eating
   behavior (restraint, eating disorder pathology), and psychology
   (self-esteem, depression, body image). Attrition, attendance, and
   participant evaluations of treatment helpfulness were also monitored.
   Statistical analysis performed Analysis of variance.
   Results Cognitive restraint decreased in the health at every size group
   and increased in the diet group, indicating that both groups implemented
   their programs. Attrition (6 months) was high in the diet group (41\%),
   compared with 8\% in the health at every size group. Fifty percent of
   both groups returned for 2-year evaluation. Health at every size group
   members maintained weight, improved in all out-come variables, and
   sustained improvements. Diet group participants lost weight and showed
   initial improvement in many variables at 1 year; weight was regained and
   little improvement was sustained.
   Conclusions The health at every size approach enabled participants to
   maintain long-term behavior change; the diet approach did not.
   Encouraging size acceptance, reduction in dieting behavior, and
   heightened awareness and response to body signals resulted in improved
   health risk indicators for obese women.}},

Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{1-2, SI}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Stress reactions to the slaughter procedure influence ante- and
   post-mortem muscle metabolism and, consequently, the rate and extent of
   glycogen breakdown and pH decline, colour and drip loss. Effects are
   principally due to variations in ATPase activity and muscle glycogen
   reserves. Behavioural, physiological and metabolic responses to aversive
   situations depend on genetic background and prior experience of the
   animals. For example, reactivity to humans depends on breed; compared to
   Large White pigs, Durocs approach humans more. The effect of slaughter
   conditions on peri-mortem muscle metabolism depends also on breed;
   muscles of Durocs were relatively insensitive to slaughter conditions.
   Prior experience, such as repeated handling, modifies reactivity to
   familiar and unfamiliar humans. Repeated positive handling during
   rearing did not modify meat quality of Large Whites. Mild negative
   handling during rearing changed pre-slaughter muscle metabolism only if
   the negative handler was present at slaughter. Literature indicates that
   severe negative handling during rearing may influence peri-mortem muscle
   metabolism in the absence of the negative handler. Reactivity to humans
   measured in pigs with no handling experience, weeks or months before
   slaughter, may predict pre- or post-slaughter muscle metabolism. Thus,
   physical and visual contacts with the human, established by the pig,
   were negatively correlated with post-bleeding muscle temperature and
   ultimate pH. Fighting during mixing was positively correlated with
   ultimate pH and colour. Up to 42\% of variability in ultimate pH in pigs
   of similar genetic and rearing background could be explained by fighting
   during mixing and reactivity to humans. Fighting during mixing could be
   predicted by fighting during a food competition test and levels of
   exploration of an unfamiliar object. Overall, results show that the
   technological meat quality indicators studied were little influenced by
   positive or mildly negative handling experience during rearing. In
   contrast, genetic background, slaughter conditions and behavioural
   characteristics of the pig, established early in life, explained a large
   part of variability in a number of technological meat quality
   parameters. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fish assemblages of small temperate streams are strongly influenced by
   harsh winter conditions, which are tolerated by year-round resident
   species and avoided by seasonal migrants. We tested effects of season
   and longitudinal position on total biomass, species abundances and body
   condition of fish in two neighboring streams (Plum Run, Brintons Run) in
   southeast Pennsylvania, USA. In each stream we sampled four pools in a
   downstream reach in close proximity to a larger (6(th) order) stream and
   four pools in a more isolated upstream reach during fall, winter and
   spring. Total biomass depended strongly on pool volume, with which other
   habitat variables (area, maximum depth, extent of undercut bank) were
   also correlated. Downstream pools of Plum Run (mean volume 18.1 m(3),
   link magnitude 5) had 21 fish species, including 6 species of
   Centrarchidae that largely vacated the pools in winter. The assemblage
   in upstream pools of Plum Run and in both upstream and downstream pools
   of Brintons Run (mean volumes 5.6 m(3) 5.7 m(3) and 4.4 m(3),
   respectively; all link magnitude 2), consisted of 7 to I I species.
   These pools were dominated by Cyprinidae, generally lacked centrarchids
   and showed little seasonal variation. Three year-round resident
   cyprinids {[}Semotilus atromaculatus (Creek chub), Rhinichthys atratulus
   (Blacknose dace) and Clinostomus funduloides (Rosyside dace)] and the
   winter emigrant Catastomus commersonii (White sucker) were the most
   abundant species in the two streams. Body condition of all four species
   declined substantially in winter; effects of longitudinal position
   (upstream vs. downstream) on body condition were less pronounced and
   varied among species. Abundances of the three resident cyprinids were
   all negatively correlated with the abundances of large, potentially
   predatory, centrarchids. Occupation of downstream pools in the larger
   stream by the centrarchids during fall and spring, but emigration from
   the study area during winter, further modified the effects of winter on
   the fish assemblage.}},

Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{The timing of twilight transition behaviour of diurnal reef fish is
   likely to be determined by the trade-off between food intake and risk of
   predation. However, the correspondence between fish behaviour and
   light-dependent feeding is poorly documented. We used flume measurements
   of prey detection and consumption by small reef-dwelling
   zooplanktivorous fish to examine the effects of light and prey flux on
   the fish's in situ behaviour during twilight. Feeding rates increased
   from nearly nil to saturation as light level increased, corresponding to
   about 45 min of the morning twilight. Changes in feeding rates were
   mostly due to light-dependent changes in reactive distance. In the reef,
   fish emerged from their nocturnal shelter at lower light intensities
   than those at which they retreated at dusk. These light intensities at
   which the fish emerged and retreated in the field greatly exceeded the
   level required to detect prey. We examined whether the approach of
   measuring relative ratio of mortality risk to food gained can be applied
   to predict the observed patterns in the twilight transition behaviour of
   the fish studied. We suggest that both the times of emergence and
   retreat and the dawn-dusk asymmetry are the result of a direct response
   to temporal and spatial variations in predation risk; no evidence for
   fine-tuned adjustments to diel fluctuations in food availability by
   changes in the time of emergence and retreat was found. (c) 2005 The

   behaviour have been ignored so far. Sediment-dwelling chironomid larvae
   inhabit protective burrows from which they extend their bodies only to
   feed on deposited detritus and microalgae from the surrounding sediment.
   Here, we performed factorial laboratory experiments to study whether
   fish-borne chemical cues (kairomones) are responsible for behavioural
   trait changes of chironomid larvae, and whether chironomid larvae are
   able to assess the densities of fish predators and food resources and
   the trade-off between them. We exposed naive Chironomus riparius larvae
   to the chemical presence of zero, one, and ten predator fish ( Rutilus
   rutilus) and offered two resource levels ( low food, high food) for each
   treatment. Kairomones induced significant inherent behavioural trait
   changes in chironomid larvae. During the first 120 min after exposing
   chironomids to fish-conditioned water, we found a significant increase
   in digging activity with increasing predator density. After 3 days of
   exposure, the deepest chironomid burrows were found in treatments with
   the highest predator density. Chironomid larvae were significantly able
   to adjust their foraging behaviour to different predator densities and
   food concentrations and trade off between them; that is, when fish
   predators were more abundant or when more food resources were available,
   the foraging activities of larvae were significantly reduced. Our data
   suggest that chemically mediated trait changes (burrowing and foraging
   behaviour) may cascade through the littoral food web.}},

   Diagnosis of OCD has its own particular effect on lifetime risk for MDE

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{755-761}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Megaplanktivores such as filter-feeding sharks and baleen whales are
   at the apex of a short food chain (phytoplankton-zooplankton-vertebrate)
   and are sensitive indicators of sea-surface plankton availability. Even
   though they spend the majority of their time below the surface it is
   still not known how most of these species utilize vertical habitat and
   adapt to short-term changes in food availability.
   2. A key factor likely to control vertical habitat selection by
   planktivorous sharks is the diel vertical migration (DVM) of
   zooplankton; however, no study has determined whether specific
   ocean-habitat type influences their behavioural strategy. Based on the
   first high-resolution dive data collected for a plankton-feeding fish
   species we show that DVM patterns of the basking shark Cetorhinus
   maximus reflect habitat type and zooplankton behaviour.
   3. In deep, well-stratified waters sharks exhibited normal DVM (dusk
   ascent-dawn descent) by tracking migrating sound-scattering layers
   characterized by Calanus and euphausiids. Sharks occupying shallow,
   inner-shelf areas near thermal fronts conducted reverse DVM (dusk
   descent-dawn ascent) possibly due to zooplankton predator-prey
   interactions that resulted in reverse DVM of Calanus.
   4. These opposite DVM patterns resulted in the probability of
   daytime-surface sighting differing between these habitats by as much as
   two orders of magnitude. Ship-borne surveys undertaken at the same time
   as trackings reflected these behavioural differences.
   5. The tendency of basking sharks to feed or rest for long periods at
   the surface has made them vulnerable to harpoon fisheries. Ship-borne
   and aerial surveys also use surface occurrence to assess distribution
   and abundance for conservation purposes. Our study indicates that
   without bias reduction for habitat-specific DVM patterns, current
   surveys could under- or overestimate shark abundance by at least
   10-fold.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiological and clinical observations have led to the hypothesis
   that the risk of developing some chronic diseases in adulthood is
   influenced not only by genetic and adult lifestyle factors, but also by
   environmental factors acting in early life. These factors act through
   the processes of developmental plasticity and possibly epigenetic
   modification, and can be distinguished from developmental disruption.
   The concept of predictive adaptation has been developed to explain the
   relationship between early life events and the risk of later disease. At
   its base, the model suggests that a mismatch between fetal expectation
   of its postnatal environment and actual postnatal environment contribute
   to later adult disease risk. This mismatch is exacerbated, in part, by
   the phenomenon of `maternal constraint' on fetal growth, which
   implicitly provides an upper limit of postnatal nutritional environment
   that humans have adapted for and is now frequently exceeded. These
   experimental, clinical and conceptual considerations have important
   implications for prevention and intervention in the current epidemic of

Abstract = {{If environmental conditions vary, plasticity in life-history traits is
   predicted. A recent model indicates that males and females should differ
   in life-history traits, because sexes differ in optimal attributes
   depending on species ecology. In this study we test the impact of two
   biotic factors in combination (presence/absence of predators and
   low/high food level) on gender specific life-history traits in the
   damselfly Coenagrion puella (Odonata). Results show that predator
   presence and low food density decreased activity in both sexes.
   Additionally, individuals with less food grew more slowly, emerged
   later, remained smaller and had a higher mortality. At low food
   densities, however, and in contrast to former investigations,
   individuals from treatments with predator presence were the same size or
   larger than individuals without predators. Gender had a strong impact on
   larval activity and life-history traits and sexes differed in
   development. Females were less active and took longer to complete
   development, but emerged at a larger size, weight and fat content. This
   study highlights the importance of gender specific approaches in
   life-history research.}},

Abstract = {{Working animals provide an essential transport resource in developing
   countries worldwide. Many of these animals are owned by poor people and
   work in harsh environments, so their welfare is a cause for concern. A
   protocol was developed to assess the welfare of working horses, mules
   and donkeys in urban and peri-urban areas, using direct observation of
   health and behaviour parameters. In this study, 4903 animals used for
   draught, pack and ridden work in Afghanistan, Egypt, India, Jordan and
   Pakistan were assessed between December 2002 and April 2003. The data
   showed that donkeys were more likely than mules or horses to demonstrate
   avoidance or aggressive behaviour towards an observer, while horses were
   most likely to make a friendly approach. Fewer than 8\% of working
   equines had abnormal mucous membranes, ectoparasites or poor coat
   condition. Body lesions occurred predominantly in the areas of the
   breast/shoulder, withers and girth in all three species, with mules
   having the highest prevalence of lesions in these areas (22.5, 21.3 and
   28.4\%, respectively). Among horses and donkeys, the prevalence of these
   lesions was influenced by the type of work carried out. Lesions on the
   head, neck, ribs, flank and tail base were seen in less than 10\% of
   animals. Across all three species approximately 70\% of animals were
   thin, having a body condition score (BCS) of 2 or less on a scale of 1-5
   (1, very thin; 5, very fat) and more horses were in very thin condition
   (BCS 1) than mules or donkeys. Over 75\% of animals demonstrated limb
   deformities and abnormalities of gait. The results of this study are
   being used as the initial stage of a long-term strategy to inform
   priorities for welfare interventions in working equines and to establish
   a welfare benchmark. Subsequent stages will rank the welfare concerns
   identified, assess the contributing risk factors and implement specific
   interventions to address these risks. Following intervention, success in
   improving welfare will be measured by repetition of this protocol and
   comparison with the benchmark. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Given limited food, prey fishes in a temperate climate must take risks
   to acquire sufficient reserves for winter and/or to outgrow
   vulnerability to predation. However, how can we distinguish which
   selective pressure promotes risk-taking when larger body size is always
   beneficial? To address this question, we examined patterns of energy
   allocation in populations of age-0 trout to determine if greater
   risk-taking corresponds with energy allocation to lipids or to somatic
   growth. Trout achieved maximum growth rates in all lakes and allocated
   nearly all of their acquired energy to somatic growth when small in
   early summer. However, trout in low-food lakes took greater risks to
   achieve this maximal growth, and therefore incurred high mortality. By
   late summer, age-0 trout allocated considerable energy to lipids and
   used previously risky habitats in all lakes. These results indicate
   that: (i) the size-dependent risk of predation (which is independent of
   behaviour) promotes risk-taking behaviour of age-0 trout to increase
   growth and minimize time spent in vulnerable sizes; and (ii) the
   physiology of energy allocation and behaviour interact to mediate
   growth/mortality trade-offs for young animals at risk of predation and

Abstract = {{Dairy cows experience a high incidence of disease and metabolic
   disorders in the weeks immediately following calving, but early and
   accurate diagnosis remains a challenge. Cows suffering from metritis,
   one common disease following calving, exhibit reduced milk yield and
   reproductive performance. However, afflicted cows show few overt signs
   of illness and frequently go unnoticed in the absence of veterinary
   examination. To determine whether changes in feeding behavior could be
   used to identify animals at risk for metritis, attendance at the feed
   alley was monitored continuously for 26 Holstein cows during the
   transition period, beginning 2 wk before and ending 3 wk after calving.
   Every 3 +/- 1 d, cows were examined for metritis based on rectal body
   temperature and condition of vaginal discharge. Over the 3 wk of
   observations after calving, 69\% of cows showed some signs of metritis.
   These cows spent on average 22 min/d less time at the feed alley during
   the transition period than did non-metritic cows. For every 10-min
   decrease in average daily feeding time, cows were twice as likely to be
   diagnosed with metritis. A threshold of 75 min of average daily feeding
   time was 89\% sensitive and 62\% specific for detection of acute
   metritis. In conclusion, reduced time at the feeder can be used to
   identify dairy cows at risk for metritis. More research is required to
   determine how soon before calving at-risk cows can be identified and
   whether these behavioral differences can also be used in the early

Abstract = {{Terrestrial hermit crabs use mollusc shells to protect their soft bodies
   from predation and desiccation, but their use is costly. The energetic
   short-term cost of using shells has been demonstrated, yet this could
   theoretically be overcome by increasing feeding rate or food quality. In
   the long term, shells have the potential to constrain growth, which may
   in turn have a negative effect on fitness. Thus crabs should choose the
   lightest (least expensive to carry) shell amongst those of a size that
   permit growth. Since in nature lighter shells are also thinner-walled,
   these may provide insufficient protection from predation or desiccation,
   facing the crabs with a trade-off between protection and growth. This
   potential trade-off was investigated in the terrestrial hermit crab
   Coenobita compressus. Crabs were individually maintained in captivity
   for a variable period of between I and 7 months, during which light or
   heavy replicates of the preferred shell were available. In a second
   experiment, crabs were given a choice between a thick (and heavy) or a
   thin (and light) shell. In addition, the resistance and water retention
   capacity of thin and thick shells was compared. As predicted, crab
   growth was negatively correlated with the weight of the shell used, but
   crabs rejected the thin (light) shells. Thin shells were more likely to
   break when crabs used the normal `rolling' behaviour in response to
   perceived threats. In addition, thin shells lost water at a faster rate
   than thick ones. Since two putative functions of shell use in
   terrestrial hermit crabs are protection against predation and against
   desiccation, it is inferred that the preference for shells of
   intermediate weight in C. compressus results from a balance between the
   need to grow and the cost of carrying a brittle shell that is not
   sufficiently water tight.}},

Abstract = {{Rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss stocked into Flaming Gorge Reservoir,
   Utah-Wyoming, are thought to be in poor condition and to rarely
   overwinter. In 2001-2002, we evaluated factors that affect the growth
   and abundance of rainbow trout, both temporally and spatially, based on
   a series of field measurements and growth experiments. Based on our
   field measurements, the growth and condition of rainbow trout in Flaming
   Gorge Reservoir actually parallel those of rainbow trout of various
   strains in other systems, and some rainbow trout overwinter as many as 3
   years in the reservoir. Overall, rainbow trout appear to be spatially
   limited by physical factors (e.g., temperature) during only a few
   isolated times of the year and not in all areas of the reservoir.
   Although zooplankton were abundant throughout the reservoir, primary and
   secondary production vary spatially with concordant effects on fish
   growth and condition. Diet analysis indicated that rainbow trout consume
   primarily aquatic macroinvertebrates along with some zooplankton and
   demonstrate an extremely limited switch to piscivory at larger sizes.
   Rainbow trout reared in net-pens and limited to a diet of zooplankton
   lost weight in all three areas of the reservoir. In addition, the
   reservoir supports a large population of trophy lake trout Salvelinus
   namaycush, which probably affects the abundance of rainbow trout
   directly through consumption and the growth potential of rainbow trout
   indirectly through risk-averse behavior. The combination of spatial
   variation in reservoir productivity and habitat type, differing stocking
   strategies, and behavioral responses caused by predators appears to
   determine the varying success of stocked rainbow trout in the different
   areas of the reservoir. Our study suggests that stocking strategies may
   be most effective when specific characteristics of the prey and predator
   base, the suitability of different habitats, and the genetic strain are
   explicitly evaluated within the context of the targeted angler
   population.}},

Abstract = {{A number of standard behavioral tasks in animal research utilize food
   rewards for positive reinforcement. In order to enhance the motivation
   to participate in these tasks, animals are usually placed on a
   restricted diet. While dietary restriction (DR) has been shown to have
   beneficial effects on recovery after brain injury, life span and aging
   processes, it might also represent a stressor. Since stress can
   influence a broad range of behaviors, the purpose of this study was to
   assess whether DR may have similar effects on skilled movement. Adult
   male Long-Evans rats were trained and tested in a skilled reaching task
   both prior to and during a mild food restriction regimen that maintained
   their body weights at 90-95\% of baseline weight for eight days. The
   observations revealed that DR decreased reaching success and increased
   the number of attempts to grasp a single food pellet. The animals
   appeared to be more frantic when attempting to reach for food pellets,
   and the time taken to reach for 20 pellets decreased following the onset
   of DR. A second experiment investigating behaviors that do not require
   food rewards, including a ladder rung walking task and an open field
   test, confirmed that rats on DR display deficits in skilled movements
   and are hyperactive. These findings suggest that results obtained in
   motor tasks using food rewards need to be interpreted with caution. The
   findings are discussed with respect to stress associated with DR. (c)

Abstract = {{Any animal whose form or behavior facilitates the avoidance of predators
   or escape when attacked by predators will have a greater probability of
   surviving to breed and therefore greater probability of producing
   offspring (i.e., fitness). Although in theory the fitness consequences
   of any antipredation behavior can simply be measured by the resultant
   probability of survival or death, determining the functional
   significance of antipredation behavior presents a surprising problem. In
   this review we draw attention to the problem that fitness consequences
   of antipredation behaviors cannot be determined without considering the
   potential for reduction of predation risk, or increased reproductive
   output, through other compensatory behaviors than the behaviors under
   study. We believe we have reached the limits of what we can ever
   understand about the ecological effects of antipredation behavior from
   empirical studies that simply correlate a single behavior with an
   apparent fitness consequence. Future empirical studies must involve many
   behaviors to consider the range of potential compensation to predation
   risk. This is because antipredation behaviors are a composite of many
   behaviors that an animal can adjust to accomplish its ends. We show that
   observed variation in antipredation behavior does not have to reflect
   fitness and we demonstrate that few studies can draw unambiguous
   conclusions about the fitness consequences of antipredation behavior.
   Lastly, we provide suggestions of how future research should best be
   targeted so that, even in the absence of death rates or changes in
   reproductive output, reasonable inferences of the fitness consequences
   of antipredation behaviors can be made.}},

Abstract = {{The relative contribution of genetic and non-genetic factors in shaping
   personality traits is of fundamental relevance to biologists and social
   scientists. Individual animals vary in the way they cope with challenges
   in their environment, comparable with variation in human personalities.
   This variation has a substantial genetic basis. Here we describe
   experiments showing the strength of environmental factors (food
   availability and sibling competition) in shaping personality traits in a
   passerine bird (Parus major). We manipulated the early rearing condition
   in two lines (F4) bidirectionally selected for different personalities
   (fast line: high exploration speed and high aggression; slow line: low
   exploration speed and low aggression) with a food rationing protocol
   inducing an impairment in growth rate and an enhancement in levels of
   offspring solicitation (begging behaviour). Growth impairment was more
   marked in the slow line. In a first experiment each nest contained
   experimental and control siblings of the same line (within-nests
   design). Slow chicks became much faster than their parents in the
   exploration tests regardless of the treatment, whereas fast chicks had
   scores similar to their parents and showed no treatment effect. As it
   consequence, the line difference in exploration behaviour of the
   offspring was not apparent in the juvenile phase. Six months later the
   offspring of the slow line was still relatively fast, but lines differed
   in exploration, since the fast line became even more fast. Food-rationed
   birds of the fast line were more aggressive than both controls and their
   fathers, while treatment did not affect the slow line. In a second
   experiment, carried out only in the slow line, each nest contained
   either control or experimental siblings (between-nests design). Now,
   only the food-rationed chicks became faster in exploration. We suggest
   that the shift in the controls in the within-nests design wits due to
   enhanced sibling competition, forced by the experimental chick. Indeed,
   the control chicks in the first experiment begged more persistently and
   had higher exploration scores than the control chicks in the
   between-nests design. Environmental factors during ontogeny modulate the
   expression of phenotypic traits against the background of the reaction
   norm allowed by the genome even in selected lines of animals resulting
   in profound and reliable differences in behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we analysed the diet of breeding kestrels (Falco
   tinnunculus) in a Mediterranean area with the aim to evaluate the
   relative importance of both hunting area and individual feeding
   behaviour as factors affecting prey selection. Differently from the
   populations from middle and northern Europe which primarily feed on
   voles, the kestrels breeding in the Mediterranean region showed a wider
   diet composition. As expected, hunting area features influenced file
   diet composition and, in general, the kestrels were feeding on what was
   locally more abundant. However, we detected consistent differences in
   the diet composition between neighbouring breeding pairs which were also
   maintained in subsequent years. Since the neighbouring birds were
   sharing the same hunting grounds, the differences observed were likely
   to reflect individual preferences or capabilities in catching some prey
   type regardless of their actual availability. The presence of
   differences in diet composition between neighbouring pairs and their
   temporal consistency suggests that the hunting skills, and in general
   the feeding behaviour of kestrels, is likely to represent a trait
   characterising a behavioural type.}},

Abstract = {{Although studies on sperm competition examined a wide range of taxa,
   little is known about the selection pressures on male traits in systems

   Here, we experimentally studied how the risk of sperm competition
   affects male copulatory behavior in the sexually cannibalistic praying
   mantis Mantis religiosa. We recorded the onset and duration of
   copulations following the introduction of virgin, adult praying mantises
   into mating arenas with three different sex ratio treatments:
   polyandrous, monogamous, and polygynous. We did not detect any female
   phenotypic trait predicting cannibalism. The chance of male survival was
   related to his condition, with males in better condition being
   cannibalized significantly less often. In contrast, we did not identify
   any male trait that would favor some males to obtain copulations. Our
   results on copulation duration support sperm competition theory in that
   the copulations in the male-biased treatment, where the perceived risk
   of sperm competition was greatest, were significantly longer than those
   in single-male treatments. Importantly, males in better condition
   copulated significantly longer regardless of sex ratio. Overall, our

Abstract = {{Many nestlings respond to alarm calls with anti-predator behavior, but
   their physiological responses to much calls are poorly understood. Alarm
   calls could stimulate increased secretion of corticosterone to mobilize
   energy reserves in anticipation of all interaction with a predator.
   However, elevated corticosterone levels can be costly to nestlings
   because they induce catabolic reactions at a time when the birds are
   engaged in anabolic processes. Thus, there may be constraints oil the
   secretion of corticosterone if the catabolic costs outweigh the
   behavioral benefits. Furthermore, many studies use baseline
   corticosterone levels as a correlate of body condition, and if nestlings
   respond hormonally when they hear abrin calls rather than when they are
   first handled by (or catch sight of) an investigator, then determination
   of baseline hormone levels would be difficult. To investigate this
   phenomenon, we broadcast taped calls of either adult conspecific alarm
   calls or songs of hererospecifics to 15-20 d old American Kestrel (Falco
   sparverius) nestlings. Playbacks were started when adults were absent,
   but adults returned and produced alarm calls at two control and three
   experimental nests. Blood was collected from randomly selected nesdings
   at each nest 13 min after the onset of a playback and within 2 min of
   opening the nest box, and the plasma was assayed for corticosterone.
   There was no difference in corcicosterone values between nestlings that
   heard alarm calls and those that heard control vocalizations. Hearing
   natural kestrel alarm calls did not affect the results, although our
   small sample sizes resulted in low power to detect differences. These
   data indicate chat 1520 d old Kestrels do not increase corticosterone
   secretion in response to adult conspecific alarm calls, and suggest chat
   studies of corticostcrone secretion in nestling kestrels will not be
   affected by the occurrence of adult alarm-calling.}},

Abstract = {{Red drum larvae (Sciaenops ocellatus) were exposed to environmentally

   (2-chloro-4-ethylamin-6-isopropylamino-S-triazine) to evaluate its

   potential, and resting respiration rate. Settlement size larvae (7 turn
   total length) were given an acute exposure of atrazine at 0, 40, and 80
   mu g l(-1) for 4 days. Tests of 96 h survival confirmed that these
   naturally occurring concentrations were sublethal for red drum larvae.
   Growth, routine swimming, antipredator responses to artificial and
   actual predators, and resting respiration rate were monitored I and 3
   days after onset of exposure. Atrazine exposure significantly reduced
   growth rate. Atrazine-exposed larvae also exhibited significantly higher
   routine swimming speeds, swam in more convoluted paths, and were
   hyperactive. Responses to artificial and actual predators were not
   affected by atrazine exposure nor were resting respiration rates. The
   higher rate of travel (86\% higher in atrazine-treated larvae) resulted
   in higher predicted encounter rates with prey (up to 71\%) and slow
   moving predators (up to 63\%). However, hyperactivity and faster active
   swimming speeds of exposed larvae indicated that naturally occurring
   sublethal levels of atrazine will result in an elevated rate of energy
   utilization (doubling the total metabolic rate), which is likely to
   increase the risk of death by starvation. Moreover, atrazine effects on
   growth will prolong the larval period, which could reduce the juvenile
   population by as much as 24\%. We conclude that environmentally
   realistic levels of atrazine induce behavioral and physiological effects

Abstract = {{In the clinic, obesity and anorexia constitute prevalent problems whose

   rather, much can be gained by combining both perspectives to understand
   the pathophysiology of over- and underweight. The present review
   summarizes recent advances in this field including the characterization
   of peripheral metabolic signals to the brain such as leptin, insulin,
   peptide YY, ghrelin and lipid mediators as well as the vagus nerve;
   signalling of the metabolic sensors in the brainstem and hypothalamus

Abstract = {{The present work investigates how a fallow deer (Dama dama) population

   each age and sex class. The numbers of different age and sex classes of
   deer recorded inside and outside the sector affected by human presence
   throughout the 20-year period of study were compared. A differential
   response was recorded among classes. Adult females and juveniles left
   this area (reducing their presence from 37\% of all deer observed to
   11\% for adult females and from 19\% to 3\% for juveniles) when human
   pressure became higher, whereas the opposite result was true for males

   the increase of predation risk evoked a marked spatial Sexual
   segregation in the fallow deer population. Females and juveniles used
   relatively predator-safe habitats, whereas males used habitats with
   higher predation risk but better food quality. Furthermore, as females
   increased their presence outside the disturbed sector, males gradually
   abandoned the undisturbed area, increased use of the disturbed sector,
   and maximized foraging opportunities by going to areas where indirect

Abstract = {{Omnivores, including humans, have an inborn tendency to avoid noxious or

   however, in response to physiological needs. Here we describe a method
   for assessing risk-sensitive food acquisition in Drosophila
   melanogaster. Food-deprived fly larvae become more likely to feed on
   noxious foods ( adulterated with quinine) as the duration of deprivation
   increases. The neuropeptide F receptor NPFR1, a mammalian neuropeptide Y
   (NPY) receptor homolog, centrally regulates the response to noxious food
   in D. melanogaster. Overexpression of NPFR1 was sufficient to cause
   nondeprived larvae to more readily take in noxious food, whereas loss of
   NPFR1 signaling led to the opposite phenotype. Moreover, NPFR1 neuronal
   activity may be directly regulated by the insulin-like signaling
   pathway. Upregulation of insulin-like receptor signaling in NPFR1 cells
   suppressed the feeding response to noxious food. Our results suggest
   that the coordinated activities of the conserved NPY- and insulin-like
   receptor signaling systems are essential for the dynamic regulation of
   noxious food intake according to the animal's energy state.}},

Abstract = {{Food intake is normally influenced by a multitude of complex endogenous
   neurochemical systems, in addition to numerous external environmental
   stimuli, including olfaction. Since most olfactory neurons process
   odorant exposures through Ca2+-mediated mechanisms via Ca2+ channels, a
   novel approach at influencing the ingestive behaviors of animals might
   therefore involve altering olfactory acuity via Ca2+ channel blockade.
   We tested the ability of a Ca2+ channel blocker, diltiazem, to alter
   food intake in hyperphagic rats when administered using the intranasal
   (i.n.), intraperitoneal (i.p.), oral (p.o.) or intracerebroventricular
   (i.c.v.) routes of administration. Male Sprague Dawley rats, which had
   been food-deprived for 4 h at the beginning of the dark cycle, were
   administered different doses of diltiazem (0 - 8 mg/animal or 0-40
   mg/kg) and the amounts of food consumed were measured. While food intake
   at 1, 2 and 4 h post drug administration was significantly decreased in
   a dose-dependent manner after i.n. administration, the i.p., p.o., and
   i.c.v. routes did not affect food intake. In another experiment, rats
   trained to eat their daily meal during the first 4 h at the onset of the
   dark cycle and treated daily with i.n. diltiazem (0 - 8 mg/ animal)
   prior to food introduction exhibited a significantly decreased rate of
   weight gain in a dose-dependent manner over a 14-day period. Both i.n.
   and i.p. diltiazem significantly increased the plasma drug concentration
   at 1 h, however there was no significant difference between these routes
   of administration. Additional studies failed to demonstrate any
   detrimental effects of i.n. diltiazem (0- 8 mg/ animal) on conditioned
   taste aversion, locomotion or gross neurological/behavioral competence
   using the rota-rod test. While a local action on the nasal odorant
   receptors is most likely the site of diltiazem's action, further studies
   are needed to determine the exact mechanism of action of i.n. diltiazem.

Abstract = {{The biology and behavior of the longhorned beetle Dectes texanus LeConte
   (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) was studied on two host plants that suffer
   economic losses from this pest; sunflower, Helianthus annuus, and
   soybean, Glycines max. Reciprocal crosses of D. texanus collected from
   the two plants all produced viable progeny, indicating that conspecific
   insects attack both crops. Pupae from soybean stalks weighed about 40\%
   less than those from sunflower, and adults fed on soybean lived a mean
   Of 23 days, compared to a mean Of 53 days (males) and 76 days (females)
   for those fed sunflower. A female's larval host plant had no effect on
   her tendency to ovipuncture plants of either type in a greenhouse trial.
   A field-tested population collected exclusively from sunflower contained
   three types of females in similar proportions: those that laid eggs only
   on sunflower, those that laid only on soybean, and those that laid
   equally on both host plants. Females in field trials fed more on the
   plant they had fed on in the laboratory, but soybean-fed females fed
   more on soybean than did sunflower-fed females. Females fed soybean also
   made more ovipunctures on soybean plants in field trials than
   sunflower-fed females, but their responses to sunflower plants were
   similar. Females displayed higher total ovipositional activity when they
   encountered sunflower first in the field, and lower total activity when
   they encountered soybean first. Feeding scores were significantly
   correlated with ovipunctures and eggs on both plant types. We conclude
   that sunflower is the preferred host plant, although females will accept
   soybean when it is the only available food. The results suggest that D.
   texanus is still in the initial stages of a host range expansion with
   female host selection behavior demonstrating both genetic influences and
   phenotypic flexibility. Sunflower represents a nutritionally superior,
   ancestral host plant and relatively high fitness costs are still
   associated with utilization of the novel host plant, soybean, costs that
   may be offset by benefits such as reduced intraspecific competition.
   These potential benefits and their consequent implications for D.
   texanus host range evolution are hypothesized and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We study whether and how physiological demands affect foraging decisions
   under predation risk, by evaluating the effect of starvation on the rate
   of food consumption and prey-size preferences and the potential
   trade-off between starvation and predation risk on foraging behavior in
   the whelk Acanthina monodon, a gastropod inhabiting the intertidal rocky
   shores of central Chile. These whelks appear to adjust their foraging
   strategy to physiological (nutritional) demand and predation risk.
   Starvation reduced the effect of predation risk on the rate of food
   consumption by A. monodon. Thus, in the absence of the predator sea
   star, the rate of food consumption by starved and satiated whelks was
   similar. When a predator was present, starved whelks fed faster than
   satiated whelks. Our results indicate that foraging behaviour represents
   an integrated and hierarchical response to environmental conditions and
   the physiological conditions of the forager.}},

Abstract = {{The ``cost-benefit{''} hypothesis states that specific body organs show
   mass changes consistent with a trade-off between the importance of their
   function and cost of their maintenance. We tested four predictions from
   this hypothesis using data on non-breeding greylag geese Anser anser
   during the course of remigial moult: namely that (i) pectoral muscles
   and heart would atrophy followed by hypertrophy, (ii) leg muscles would
   hypertrophy followed by atrophy, (iii) that digestive organs and liver
   would atrophy followed by hypertrophy and (iv) fat depots be depleted.
   Dissection of geese captured on three different dates during wing moult
   on the Danish island of Saltholm provided data on locomotory muscles and
   digestive organ size that confirmed these predictions. Locomotory organs
   associated with flight showed initial atrophy (a maximum loss of 23\% of
   the initial pectoral muscle mass and 37\% heart tissue) followed by
   hypertrophy as birds regained the powers of flight. Locomotory organs
   associated with running (leg muscles, since geese habitually run to the
   safety of water from predator-type stimuli) showed initial hypertrophy
   (a maximum gain of 37\% over initial mass) followed by atrophy. The
   intestines and liver showed initial atrophy (41\% and 37\%
   respectively), consistent with observed reductions in daily time spent
   feeding during moult, followed by hypertrophy The majority of the 22\%
   loss in overall body mass (mean 760 g) during the flightless period
   involved fat utilisation, apparently consumed to meet shortfalls between
   daily energetic needs and observed rates of exogenous intake. The
   results support the hypothesis that such phenotypic plasticity in size
   of fat stores, locomotor and digestive organs can be interpreted as an
   evolutionary adaptation to meet the conflicting needs of the wing moult.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental enrichment falls into four general categories: foraging
   opportunities, structural complexity, sensory stimulation/novelty, and
   social companionship. Each may have distinct behavioural effects. We
   examined the use of these four enrichment types, and their effects on
   activity budgets (foraging, general activity, pacing), social proximity
   preference (time spent observing companions through a window), and fear
   (flight distance in a predator surprise test, consumption of novel food)
   in adult Japanese quail. Foraging and structural enrichments were used
   extensively (29 and 26\% of scans, respectively), as were the dustbaths
   available in all pens (16\%). Use of enrichments and the dustbath was
   consistent over 24 h and over 17 d (partial r > 0.42, p < 0.00 1).
   Foraging enrichment increased foraging (F-3,F-89 = 5.66, p < 0.01) and
   general activity (F-3,F-89 = 4.75, p < 0.01). Foraging and structural
   enrichment decreased pacing (F-3,F-89 = 6.33, p = 0.001). Novelty
   enrichment had no significant effects. Social housing reduced use of
   enrichments (enrichment treatment x hous-housing type F-3,F-89 = 3.30, p
   < 0.05) and dustbaths (F-1,F-89 = 4.59, p < 0.05), suggesting resource
   monopolisation. Male birds ate more novel food (F-1,F-45 = 5.43, p <
   0.05) and spent more time observing social companions (F-1,F-45 = 7.88,
   p < 0.01) than females, who used enrichments (F-1,F-89 = 13.35, p <

   active than males (F-1,F-89 = 34.83,p < 0.001). Results indicate that
   the use and behavioural effects of enrichment vary by enrichment type in
   caged quail. Foraging enrichment had the most positive behavioural
   effects while social housing had some negative effects. Furthermore,

Abstract = {{The effects of diet on horse behaviour have not previously been
   quantified in detail. In this study, we examined the behaviour of 17
   foals from the age of 2 to 40 weeks. Each foal received either a starch
   and sugar (SS) diet or a fat and fibre (FF) diet. The two diets
   contained similar digestible energy, crude protein and micronutrients,
   but differed in the fat and non-structural carbohydrate balance. The
   baseline behaviour of the foals was observed every 2 weeks by focal
   animal sampling. Additional behavioural observations were conducted when
   the foals were weaned by one of two methods. Approximately 2 months
   after weaning, the temperament and tractability of the young horses was
   assessed using standardised tests. Responses to a novel object, to a
   novel person, and during a handling test were observed and quantified.
   Horses grew well on both diets with no apparent effects of diet on
   growth rate or baseline behaviour. Immediately after weaning, horses
   receiving the FF diet cantered less frequently (F = 5.10; p < 0.05), for
   a shorter duration (F = 7.23; p < 0.05) and appeared to be more settled.
   Foals that were barn-weaned appeared more stressed than foals that were
   paddock-weaned. In the temperament tests, horses receiving the FF diet
   spent significantly more time investigating (F = 6.78; p < 0.05), and

   handling test was significantly lower (F = 8.72; p = 0.01). Overall, the

Abstract = {{Cover provides shelter, food, nesting opportunities and protection from
   predators. The behavioural response of small mammals to reduced cover
   has been well documented. However, very little is known about the effect
   of cover on community and population dynamics. Australian small mammals
   generally inhabit extremely dynamic ecosystems, where cover and food
   supplies are greatly affected by fire. Species are described as early or
   late seral specialists, generally returning to a disturbed area once
   their habitat requirements are met. Habitat requirements have loosely
   been interpreted as cover and food supply, however, these factors are
   not mutually exclusive and few studies have attempted to determine the
   driving factors behind small mammal succession. In this study, we
   manipulated specific aspects of cover in the eucalypt forests of Fraser
   Island and show that the behaviour and population dynamics of small
   mammals were greatly affected. A reduction of cover from grass-trees
   (Xanthorrhoea johnsonii) did not affect small mammal species
   composition, however, the abundance and size structure distribution of
   the dominant species (Rattus fuscipes) decreased. Patch use by rodents
   also decreased after cover was reduced. Rattus fuscipes must trade-off
   remaining in an environment with increased risk of predation, or
   disperse to an area with greater cover but increased competition.
   Juveniles dominated (> 60\%) populations of R. fuscipes after cover was
   reduced, however, size distributions of control sites were relatively
   more even (< 25\% juvenile). While adult R. fuscipes are either killed
   by predators or disperse to other areas, juveniles that remained or
   immigrated to an area of reduced cover gained a selective advantage over
   those in control sites, because reduced competition with adults
   increased body condition of juvenile R. fuscipes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Serum cholesterol is reported to be associated with
   suicidality, but studies conducted among general healthy population are
   rare. We examined the association between serum cholesterol and
   suicidality in a national sample of the general population of US.
   Methods: We used the data of 3237 adults aged 17 to 39 years, who
   completed a mental disorder diagnostic interview and had blood specimens
   collected after a 12-h fast, as a part of the Third National Health and
   Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994. The serum concentrations of
   total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and
   low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were dichotomized according
   to the recommended levels of the National Cholesterol Education Program.
   A polytomous logistic regression was employed to control for covariates.
   Results: Independent of socio-demographic variables, health risks and
   nutrition status, and a history of medical and psychiatric illness
   (including depression), a significant association between low HDL-C (<=
   40 mg/dl) and increased prevalence of suicide attempts was observed in
   women (OR=2.93, 95\% CI=1.07-8.00). No significant evidence was found to
   support an association between cholesterol and suicide ideation in
   women. Serum cholesterol was unrelated with either suicide ideation or
   attempts in men.
   Limitation: The inherent limitation of cross-sectional design prevented
   the authors from investigating causality.
   Conclusions: Low HDL-C is significantly associated with suicide attempts
   in women. Further studies are necessary to explore the clinical

Abstract = {{Context: Mature ghrelin has been shown to stimulate eating and to

   total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in subjects of the
   Amish Family Diabetes Study.
   Objective: Our objective was to determine whether mutations in GHRL
   might influence eating behavior and risk for metabolic syndrome,
   obesity, diabetes, and related traits.
   Design: We genotyped 856 Amish samples for three missense polymorphisms
   in GHRL, Arg51Gln, Leu72Met ( rs696217), and Gln90Leu ( rs4684677) and
   performed association analyses with eating behavior traits and metabolic
   syndrome as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult
   Treatment Panel III guidelines.
   Subjects: Our subjects were adult participants in the Amish Family
   Diabetes Study.
   Results: The allele frequencies of these variants were 0.03, 0.04, and
   0.03, respectively. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was lower among
   those carrying the 51Gln allele ( 3.8 vs. 15.8\%; age- and sex-adjusted
   odds ratio = 0.22; P = 0.031). Hunger scores tended to be lower among
   51Gln allele carriers but did not reach statistical significance ( P =

   prevalence of metabolic syndrome ( 23.2 vs. 13.4\%; age- and
   sex-adjusted odds ratio = 2.57; P = 0.02) as well as higher fasting
   glucose, lower high-density lipoprotein, and higher triglyceride levels
   ( P = 0.02, P = 0.007, and P = 0.04, respectively). The two variants

Abstract = {{Predators influence the distribution of prey directly if predation
   reduces local population density, or indirectly if the presence of
   predators induces behavioral or physiological responses to predation
   risk. We analyzed whether the foraging behavior of wood mice (Apodemus
   sylvaticus) was affected by the presence and activity of small-spotted
   genets (Genetta genetta) at ``risky{''} baiting stations monitored with
   automatic cameras. Sampling stations in 6 x 6 grids spaced at 250 m were
   arranged in 3 habitat types (shrubland, pine woodland, and holm oak
   woodland). Grids were sampled systematically by means of groups of 2-9
   cameras monitoring sampling stations during a week. We obtained 377
   independent contacts of wood mice and 35 independent contacts of at
   least 8 different genets. Patterns of habitat use by genets and wood
   mice were spatially discordant, because only 2 cameras detected both.
   Wood mice visited baits more often and during longer periods in groups
   of sampling stations where genets were not detected than in groups where
   genets were detected within the same week. Mean time spent foraging by
   genets negatively influenced both the number of foraging bouts per night
   and the mean duration of such bouts by mice using nearby baits. Finally,
   temporal patterns of activity of mice along the night were different
   depending on whether genets were foraging nearby. Temporal patterns of
   mice when and where genets were absent were positively correlated with
   patterns of genet activity, whereas mice patterns were negatively
   correlated with genet patterns when and where genets were present.
   Sampling dates, habitat types, and moonlight levels did not seem to have
   influenced these results. Wood mice showed spatial and temporal changes
   in foraging behavior in response to the presence of genets, and
   decisions about how often and how long to forage were affected by
   foraging activity of genets. Results obtained provided direct evidence
   of a foraging game of stealth and fear between mice and their predator
   that could help to explain mice distribution in Mediterranean postfire
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Inter-individual variation in levels of sex hormones results from
   differences in genetic, developmental, and environmental factors. We
   tested a hypothesis that programming of the fetal neuroendocrine axis
   may predispose some women to produce higher levels of steroid hormones
   during their menstrual cycles as adults. One hundred forty-five
   regularly menstruating 24- to 36-year-old women collected daily saliva
   samples for one menstrual cycle. Data on women's birth weights and birth
   lengths were obtained from medical records. A positive relationship was
   observed between ponderal index at birth (an indicator of nutritional
   status, calculated as birth weight/(birth length)(3)) and levels of
   estradiol (E2) in menstrual cycles, after controlling for potential
   confounding factors. Mean E2 was 16.4 pmol/l in the low ponderal index
   tertile, 17.3 pmol/l in the moderate ponderal index tertile, and 19.6
   pmol/l in the high ponderal index tertile (the high ponderal index group
   had significantly higher E2 than both low and moderate ponderal index
   groups, P = 0.0001). This study shows a positive association between
   ponderal index recorded for women at birth and levels of E2 measured
   during their menstrual cycles as adults. This suggests that conditions
   during fetal life influence adult production of reproductive hormones
   and may contribute to inter-individual variation in reproductive
   function. In addition, because large size at birth is one of the factors
   linked with an increased risk of breast cancer, our findings provide a
   physiological link for the observed positive relationship between

Abstract = {{Previous studies have suggested that the developmental pattern of insect
   body parts is influenced by food conditions during the nymphal stages.
   In this study, we compared the developmental patterns of five body parts
   (body length, fore-femur length, mid-femur length, hind-femur length,
   and angle of claw) in the predatory insect Lethocerus deyrolli
   Vuillefroy fed three diets (tadpoles, Odonata nymphs, and
   tadpole-Odonata nymph mixture) during the nymphal stages. Significant
   age by sex interactions were detected in body length, fore-femur length,
   mid-femur length, and bind-femur length, indicating developmental
   patterns of these traits varied between sexes. Significant age by food
   interactions were detected in body length and hind-femur length and were
   marginally significant in mid-femur length, showing developmental
   patterns of these traits varied among food types. None of the
   interactions were significant in angle of the claw. A predation
   experiment was performed using double-claw nymphs as a control and
   one-claw nymphs (adult type) as a treatment. Double-claw nymphs
   successfully caught both large and small tadpoles, whereas one-claw
   nymphs caught small tadpoles more frequently than large tadpoles. Our
   results suggest that the claw development, which is very likely related
   to predatory function, may be less affected by nutritional conditions,
   and that double claws during nymphal stages may be indispensable to
   increased predation success.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the impact of grazing and substrate supply on the size

   Without grazers and with a sufficient substrate supply, bacteria grew
   mainly in the form of medium-sized rods (4 to 7 mu m), with a smaller
   proportion (< 10\%) of filamentous forms. Grazing experiments with the
   bacterivorous flagellate Ochromonas sp. showed that freely suspended
   cells of < 7 mu m were highly vulnerable to grazers, whereas filamentous
   cells were resistant to grazing and became enriched during predation. A
   comparison of long-term growth in carbon-limited chemostats with and
   without grazers revealed that strikingly different bacterial populations
   developed: treatments with flagellates were composed of > 80\%
   filamentous cells. These attained a biomass comparable to that of
   populations in chemostats without grazers, which were composed of
   medium-sized rods and c-shaped cells. Carbon starvation resulted in a
   fast decrease in cell length and a shift towards small rods, which were
   highly vulnerable to grazing. Dialysis bag experiments in combination

Abstract = {{In temperate regions, winter presents animals with a number of
   challenges including depressed food abundance, increased daily energy
   requirements, higher frequency of extreme weather events and shortened
   day length. Overcoming these constraints is critical for overwintering
   survival and scheduling of future breeding of long-lived species and is
   likely to be state dependent, associated with intrinsic abilities such
   as food acquisition rates. We examined the relationship between
   environmental and intrinsic factors on overwintering foraging and
   subsequent breeding phenology of the European shag Phalacrocorax
   aristotelis, a diurnal marine predator. We tested a range of hypotheses
   relating to overwintering foraging time and location. We found that
   individuals greatly increased their foraging time in winter to a peak of
   more than 90\% of available daylight at the winter solstice. The
   seasonal patterns of foraging time appear to be driven by a combination
   of light levels and weather conditions and may be linked to the
   availability of the shag's principal prey, the lesser sandeel Ammodytes
   marinus. There was no evidence that shags dispersed south in winter to
   increase potential foraging time. Foraging time decreased after the
   winter solstice and, crucially, was correlated with subsequent breeding
   phenology, such that individuals that spent less time foraging in
   February bred earlier. The relationship was much stronger in females
   than males, in line with their more direct control of timing of
   breeding. Our results demonstrate that pre-breeding intrinsic foraging
   ability is critical in determining breeding phenology.}},

Abstract = {{Most species reproduce seasonally, even in the tropics where activity
   occurs year-round. Squamate reptiles provide ideal model organisms to
   clarify the ultimate (adaptive) reasons for the restriction of
   reproduction to specific times of year. Females of almost all
   temperate-zone reptile species produce their eggs or offspring in the
   warmest time of the year, thereby synchronizing embryogenesis with high
   ambient temperatures. However, although tropical reptiles are freed from
   this thermal constraint, most do not reproduce year-round. Seasonal
   reproduction in tropical reptiles might be driven by biotic factors
   (e.g., peak periods of predation on eggs or hatchlings, or food for
   hatchlings) or abiotic factors (e.g., seasonal availability of suitably
   moist incubation conditions). Keelback snakes (Tropidonophis mairii,
   Colubridae) in tropical Australia reproduce from April to November, but
   with a major peak in May-June. Our field studies falsify hypotheses that
   invoke biotic factors as explanations for this pattern: the timing of
   nesting does not minimize predation on eggs, nor maximize food
   availability or survival rates for hatchlings. Instead, our data
   implicate abiotic factors: female keelbacks nest most intensely soon
   after the cessation of monsoonal rains when soils are moist enough to
   sustain optimal embryogenesis (wetter nests produce larger hatchlings,
   that are more likely to survive) but are unlikely to become waterlogged
   (which is lethal to eggs). Thus, abiotic factors may favor seasonal
   reproduction in tropical as well as temperate-zone. animals.}},

Abstract = {{Female sand tilefish (Malacanthus plumieri) inhabiting a deep channel in
   the fringing reef at Glover's Atoll, Belize (channel females) spawned
   planktonic eggs more frequently than those occupying the shallow
   sand-rubble slopes adjacent to patch coral reefs inside the atoll lagoon
   (reef-slope females). We tested five non-exclusive hypotheses to explain
   habitat differences in female spawning frequency. We found no evidence
   that spawning frequency variation was a consequence of differences in
   food availability, variation in male fertility, or the intensity of
   predation on spawned eggs. On reef slopes, barracuda stalked tilefish
   near their benthic burrows, whereas these piscivores attacked channel
   tilefish by diving suddenly from higher in the water column. Differences
   in the hunting behavior of barracuda suggested that the behavior of
   tilefish females might be influenced by temporal variation in predation
   risk (risk allocation hypothesis). Consistent with this hypothesis,
   reef-slope females had a much higher frequency of retreats to burrows in
   response to barracuda, spent more time burrowing and ventured less far
   from these refugia in response to a simulated predatory threat. As
   predicted by the risk allocation hypothesis, reef-slope females also had
   lower and more variable frequencies of foraging bites, and shorter and
   more variable travel distances to forage than channel females. Estimated
   mortality from predation was over nine times higher in channel tilefish.
   Consistent with the hypothesis that investment in current vs. future
   reproduction is influenced by rates of adult mortality (mortality risk
   hypothesis), channel females invested more supplemental energy in egg
   production whereas reef-slope females invested more in growth. Our
   results indicate that behavioral and life-history traits of female
   tilefish show phenotypic plasticity depending upon the nature and

Journal = {{MAMMAL REVIEW}},

Volume = {{36}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Trade-off theory has been extensively used to further our
   understanding of animal behaviour. In mammalian herbivores, it has been
   used to advance our understanding of their reproductive, parental care
   and foraging strategies. Here, we detail how trade-off theory can be
   applied to herbivore-parasite interactions, especially in foraging
   environments.
   2. Foraging is a common mode of uptake of parasites that represent the
   most pervasive challenge to mammalian fitness and survival. Hosts are
   hypothesized to alter their foraging behaviour in the presence of
   parasites in three ways: (i) hosts avoid foraging in areas that are
   contaminated with parasites; (ii) hosts select diets that increase their
   resistance and resilience to parasites; and (iii) hosts select for foods
   with direct anti-parasitic properties (self-medication). We concentrate
   on the mammalian herbivore literature to detail the recent advances made
   using trade-off frameworks to understand the mechanisms behind
   host-parasite interactions in relation to these three hypotheses.
   3. In natural systems, animals often face complex foraging decisions
   including nutrient intake vs. predation risk, nutrient intake vs.
   sheltering and nutrient intake vs. parasite risk trade-offs. A trade-off
   framework is detailed that can be used to interpret mammal behaviour in
   complex environments, and may be used to advance the self-medication
   hypothesis.
   4. The use of trade-off theory has advanced our understanding of the
   contact process between grazing mammalian hosts and their parasites
   transmitted via the faecal-oral route. Experimental manipulation of the
   costs and benefits of a nutrient intake vs. parasite risk trade-off has
   shown that environmental conditions (forage quality and quantity) and
   the physiological state (parasitic and immune status) of a mammalian
   host can both affect the behavioural decisions of foraging animals.
   5. Naturally occurring trade-offs and the potential to manipulate their
   costs and benefits enables us to identify the abilities and behavioural
   rules used by mammals when making decisions in complex environments and
   thus predict animal behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{The large temporal and spatial variability in marine productivity
   encountered by marine predators may negatively influence breeding
   success. The Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella (AFS), a marine
   predator in the Southern Ocean (SO) ecosystem with a circumpolar
   distribution, exhibits a short, 4 mo lactation coinciding with increased
   summer marine productivity. The diet of AFS, and the distance to
   significant and productive oceanographic features, such as the Antarctic
   Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ), varies considerably between populations. We
   studied the foraging activity, foraging efficiency and the pup
   provisioning strategies of lactating AFS at a key breeding site in the
   southern Indian Ocean, the Kerguelen Archipelago. Foraging parameters
   were examined in relation to interannual variability in oceanographic
   conditions and prey availability in the PFZ over 3 consecutive breeding
   seasons (1998 to 2000). The location of foraging zones, diving activity,
   diet and foraging efficiency varied significantly between years,
   concurrently with annual changes in sea-surface temperature (SST) and
   prey availability. The strongest recorded El Nino Southern Oscillation
   event in 1997-1998 coincided with anomalously warm waters in the
   vicinity of the Archipelago. Deeper diving by females, reduced maternal
   and pup body condition, and minimal pup growth rates and low catch per
   unit effort of the primary prey species, lanternfishes (Myctophidae)
   were all recorded in this period. Maternal size was positively related
   to the growth performance of pups only in this period, indicating the
   importance of age/size and/or experience in mediating environmental
   fluctuations. Foraging efficiency over a foraging cycle and variability
   in mean provisioning rates (trip duration), were identified as proxies
   of prey availability within the foraging range of seals, emphasising the
   effectiveness of the use of AFS foraging behaviour as an indicator of
   both food and oceanographic variability and climatic anomalies. The
   increasing frequency of anomalously warm SST events in sectors of the
   SO, however, may elicit specific behavioural responses from `central
   place foragers' (i.e. species that return to breeding sites to feed
   their young) to avoid sustained poor body condition of females and their

Abstract = {{Wildlife feeding has become an integral part of the range of activities
   offered to protected area visitors. In marine protected areas (MPAs),
   fish feeding may cause changes in the behavior, and thus the density and
   distribution, of coastal fish species. We evaluated spatial variability
   in human-positive fish behavior around the Ustica Island MPA (Italy) and
   the potential indirect effects of behavioral change on other species.
   Two mensurative experiments demonstrated that ca. 1/3 of the species
   present in fish-feeding areas exhibited human-positive behavior, losing
   instinctive fear in the presence of humans and encircling people in the
   water even when food was not provided. A manipulative experiment
   demonstrated that this behavioral response was learned rapidly.
   Damselfishes were negatively affected by the unnatural aggregation of a
   labrid species, as these aggregations frequently attacked and destroyed
   the benthic nests of the damselfish. Thus, fish feeding can have both
   direct and indirect effects. Therefore the MPA management goals need to
   be explicitly stated on a case-by-case basis. If the aim of a reserve is
   only to promote awareness of marine life and the benefits of
   conservation to the public, activities such as fish feeding may be
   regarded as desirable, since the human-positive behavior brought about
   by this activity guarantees a visual spectacle for visitors.
   Fish-feeding locations, however, cannot be regarded as natural and may
   reduce the effectiveness of a reserve for scientific research.}},

Abstract = {{For newly settled coral reef fishes, survival advantages may be

   behavioral characteristics associated with different condition levels,
   bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum recruits were collected
   immediately after settlement from reefs in the upper Florida Keys, USA,
   and transported to the laboratory for experimental analysis.
   Quantification of swimming capabilities was coupled with otolith
   analysis to identify early life history traits associated with swimming
   performance, Fish with the highest critical swimming speeds were those
   that grew faster as larvae, had shorter pelagic larval durations, and
   were smaller at settlement, although these individuals represented only
   10\% of the total sample. To further investigate condition-associated
   behaviors, a feeding treatment established fish of 2 different condition
   levels for comparison. Recruits fed for 1 wk at higher levels grew
   faster, had greater standardized weight (Fulton's condition factor), and
   swam faster than food-deprived recruits. In additional behavioral
   trials, high condition recruits evaded a simulated predator threat at
   faster speeds than the low condition recruits. High condition fish also
   exhibited less risk-taking behavior by sheltering more in the presence
   of a predator threat and consuming less food. For both high and low
   condition recruits, the number that sought shelter increased and food
   consumption rates decreased in the presence of a predator threat. These
   results link early life history traits and physiology with associated
   condition-based differences in behavior, likely underlying the

Abstract = {{Objective: Eating in the absence of hunger (EAH) may be a behavioral
   trait through which obesity-promoting genes promote positive energy
   balance. The primary aim of this study was to compare children born at
   high vs. low risk for obesity with respect to EAH at 5 years of age.
   Research Methods and Procedures: This was an observational investigation
   of families enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania and The
   Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Infant Growth Study. Five-year-old
   children born at high (N = 28) or low (N = 25) risk for obesity on the
   basis of maternal prepregnancy body weight were evaluated at a
   hospital-based laboratory. Children consumed 11 snack foods ad libitum
   after consuming an ad libitum dinner and reporting fullness. Parents
   reported on snack foods at home and their own eating styles. Nutritive
   sucking at 3 months of age was evaluated by computerized apparatus.
   Results: EAH in high-risk boys (mean +/- standard error = 326 +/- 66 kJ]
   was more than twice that of low-risk boys (mean +/- standard error = 151
   +/- 39 kJ), p = 0.03. Among girls, there was a trend for EAH to be
   associated with increased parental limitations on daughter snack food
   consumption at home (p = 0.06). EAH was unrelated to 3-month sucking
   behavior.
   Discussion: Genes that promote childhood obesity may partially exert
   their influence through EAH, an effect that was limited to boys born at
   risk for obesity. The unique influences of genes and home environment on
   this trait should be disaggregated in subsequent studies.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the many features that the behaviour of the standard particle
   swarm algorithm shares with grouping behaviour in animals (e.g. social
   attraction and communication between individuals), this biologically
   inspired technique has been mainly used in classical optimisation
   problems (i.e. finding the optimal value in a fitness landscape). We
   present here a novel application for particle swarms: the simulation of
   group-foraging in animals. Animals looking for food sources are modelled
   as particles in a swarm moving over an abstract food landscape. The
   particles are guided to the food by a smell (or aura), which surrounds
   it and whose intensity is proportional to the amount of food available.
   The results show that this new extended version of the algorithm
   produces qualitatively realistic behaviour. For example, the simulation
   shows the emergence of group-foraging behaviour among particles.}},

Abstract = {{While prisoner's dilemma has frequently been used in studies of animal
   behavior, past work in the area fails to address the question of
   differential utility. As animals' needs change, their behavior also
   changes. A hungry animal may be less likely to cooperate than a full
   one. In this study an abstract species is modelled using an energy
   balance computation that assigns a state of hungry, full, or neither to
   a given animal together with a modified finite state representation for
   a prisoner's dilemma strategy that implements distinct but linked
   strategies for each possible state. The strategy used is conditioned on
   the animal's current hunger state. An evolutionary algorithm is used to
   generate effective strategies for this deterministic form of
   differential utility prisoner's dilemma. A tool called fingerprinting is
   used to document the strategies that arise. It is shown that the
   strategies that arise for the three possible hunger states have
   different distributions in a catalog of strategies found in other
   prisoner's dilemma runs and also differ from a baseline experiment in
   which agents are evolved to play prisoner's dilemma without any form of
   differential utility.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Primary alexithymia has been proposed as a trait-like risk
   factor for various psychiatric disorders. Alternatively, secondary
   alexithymia has been conceptualized as an inadequate coping reaction to
   a stressful situation. This study investigated the level and the type of
   alexithymia associated with occupational stress. Method. On 2 occasions,
   69 patients with work-related stress and 62 healthy participants
   completed self-report instruments to measure alexithymia (20-item
   Toronto Alexithymia Scale), burnout complaints (Maslach Burnout
   Inventory) and general distress complaints (Depression Anxiety Stress
   Scales, Checklist Individual Strength). Group differences in alexithymia
   were analyzed using ANOVAs. The type of alexithymia was investigated by
   (a) determining absolute and relative stability, (b) exploring state
   dependence by adjusting alexithymia for burnout and distress complaints
   and (c) associating recovery of complaints with change in alexithymia.
   Results: Alexithymia was significantly elevated among patients. In the
   patient group, absolute stability of two alexithymia dimensions
   (identifying feelings, describing feelings) and relative stability of
   one alexithymia dimension (identifying feelings) was lower than in the
   healthy group. Cross-sectional group differences became small and
   nonsignificant after adjustment for distress complaints. Among patients,
   change in alexithymia was moderately associated with symptom recovery.
   Conclusion: Elevated alexithymia among patients with occupational stress
   is highly state dependent, which indicates the presence of secondary
   alexithymia. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual conflict occurs when individuals of one sex express traits that
   reduce the fitness of individuals of the other sex. In many poeciliid
   fish, males harass females for copulations, which is thought to reduce
   female fitness by lowering foraging efficiency and increasing predation
   risk, energetic expenditure and the likelihood of disease transmission.
   Mating may also be costly for males, who often engage in aggressive
   interactions with other males in addition to expending energy pursuing
   females. We examined the effects of three operational sex ratios on male
   behaviour, female fitness and male body condition in the western
   mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, during a 10-week experiment. Despite a
   significant reduction in male harassment, female growth and reproductive
   success decreased as the proportion of females increased. Results
   suggest that increases in female density had a strong, negative effect
   on female fitness, overwhelming any potential costs of male harassment.
   Aggressive behaviour between males increased and male copulation rate
   decreased as the proportion of males increased, suggesting that
   operational sex ratio influences the number of copulations that a male
   attempts by altering the frequency of agonistic interactions with other
   males and the number of females available to mate. We did not detect a
   difference in male body condition between treatments. Sources of female
   density dependence and consequences of variation in operational sex

Title = {{Current issues in fish welfare}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Human beings may affect the welfare of fish through fisheries,
   aquaculture and a number of other activities. There is no agreement on
   just how to weigh the concern for welfare of fish against the human
   interests involved, but ethical frameworks exist that suggest how this
   might be approached.
   Different definitions of animal welfare focus on an animal's condition,
   on its subjective experience of that condition and/or on whether it can
   lead a natural life. These provide different, legitimate, perspectives,
   but the approach taken in this paper is to focus on welfare as the
   absence of suffering.
   An unresolved and controversial issue in discussions about animal
   welfare is whether non-human animals exposed to adverse experiences such
   as physical injury or confinement experience what humans would call
   suffering. The neocortex, which in humans is an important part of the
   neural mechanism that generates the subjective experience of suffering,
   is lacking in fish and non-mammalian animals, and it has been argued
   that its absence in fish indicates that fish cannot suffer. A strong
   alternative view, however, is that complex animals with sophisticated
   behaviour, such as fish, probably have the capacity for suffering,
   though this may be different in degree and kind from the human
   experience of this state.
   Recent empirical studies support this view and show that painful stimuli
   are, at least, strongly aversive to fish. Consequently, injury or
   experience of other harmful conditions is a cause for concern in terms
   of welfare of individual fish. There is also growing evidence that fish
   can experience fear-like states and that they avoid situations in which
   they have experienced adverse conditions.
   Human activities that potentially compromise fish welfare include
   anthropogenic changes to the environment, commercial fisheries,
   recreational angling, aquaculture, ornamental fish keeping and
   scientific research. The resulting harm to fish welfare is a cost that
   must be minimized and weighed against the benefits of the activity
   concerned.
   Wild fish naturally experience a variety of adverse conditions, from
   attack by predators or conspecifics to starvation or exposure to poor
   environmental conditions. This does not make it acceptable for humans to
   impose such conditions on fish, but it does suggest that fish will have
   mechanisms to cope with these conditions and reminds us that pain
   responses are in some cases adaptive (for example, suppressing feeding
   when injured).
   In common with all vertebrates, fish respond to environmental challenges
   with a series of adaptive neuro-endocrine adjustments that are
   collectively termed the stress response. These in turn induce reversible
   metabolic and behavioural changes that make the fish better able to
   overcome or avoid the challenge and are undoubtedly beneficial, in the
   short-term at least.
   In contrast, prolonged activation of the stress response is damaging and
   leads to immuno-suppression, reduced growth and reproductive
   dysfunction. Indicators associated with the response to chronic stress
   (physiological endpoints, disease status and behaviour) provide a
   potential source of information on the welfare status of a fish. The
   most reliable assessment of well-being will be obtained by examining a
   range of informative measures and statistical techniques are available
   that enable several such measures to be combined objectively.
   A growing body of evidence tells us that many human activities can harm
   fish welfare, but that the effects depend on the species and
   life-history stage concerned and are also context-dependent. For
   example, in aquaculture, adverse effects related to stocking density may
   be eliminated if good water quality is maintained. At low densities, bad
   water quality may be less likely to arise whereas social interactions
   may cause greater welfare problems.
   A number of key differences between fish and birds and mammals have
   important implications for their welfare. Fish do not need to fuel a
   high body temperature, so the effects of food deprivation on welfare are
   not so marked. For species that live naturally in large shoals, low
   rather than high densities may be harmful. On the other hand, fish are
   in intimate contact with their environment through the huge surface area
   of their gills, so they are vulnerable to poor water quality and water
   borne pollutants.
   Extrapolation between taxa is dangerous and general frameworks for
   ensuring welfare in other vertebrate animals need to be modified before
   they can be usefully applied to fish.
   The scientific study of fish welfare is at an early stage compared with
   work on other vertebrates and a great deal of what we need to know is
   yet to be discovered. It is clearly the case that fish, though different
   from birds and mammals, however, are sophisticated animals, far removed
   from unfeeling creatures with a 15 s memory of popular misconception. A
   heightened appreciation of these points in those who exploit fish and in
   those who seek to protect them would go a long way towards improving
   fish welfare.}},

Abstract = {{Bayesian decision theory can be used to model animal behaviour. In this
   paper we give an overview of the theoretical concepts in such models. We
   also review the biological contexts in which Bayesian models have been
   applied, and outline some directions where future studies would be
   useful. Bayesian decision theory, when applied to animal behaviour, is
   based on the assumption that the individual has some sort of ``prior
   opinion{''} of the possible states of the world. This may, for example,
   be a previously experienced distribution of qualities of food patches,
   or qualities of potential mates. The animal is then assumed to be able
   use sampling information to arrive at a ``posterior opinion{''},
   concerning e.g. the quality of a given food patch, or the average
   qualities of mates in a year. A correctly formulated Bayesian model
   predicts how animals may combine previous experience with sampling
   information to make optimal decisions. We argue that the assumption that
   animals may have ``prior opinions{''} is reasonable. Their priors may
   come from one or both of two sources: either from their own individual
   experience, gained while sampling the environment, or from an adaptation
   to the environment experienced by previous generations. This means that
   we should often expect to see ``Bayesian-like{''} decision-making in

Abstract = {{There is a large body of evidence indicating that predator behavior may
   strongly influence patterns and processes at the population and
   community level. Site selection is a major component of fitness in
   sit-and-wait predators, especially when relocation is rare. Although
   several review articles dealt with these issues in web-building spiders,
   this is the first attempt to summarize the effects of biotic and abiotic
   factors on site selection and relocation in another group of
   sit-and-wait predators, the pit-building antlions (Neuroptera:

   relatively little effect on pit relocation and that physical properties
   of the habitat or competition often override its effect. We suggest that
   owing to a variety of constraints such as physiological constraints or
   difficulties in assessing site quality, site selection and relocation
   are not necessarily optimal and thus food intake rate is not maximized.
   We call for a multi-factorial study on a single species in order to
   pinpoint the dominant factors and to assess to what extent they

   research directions, such as studying whether pit relocation is an
   adaptive response, when controlling for possible phylogenetic effects.}},

Abstract = {{Plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) offer plants chemical defences
   against herbivores, and are known to influence intake and diet choice in
   both insect and mammalian herbivores. However, there is limited
   knowledge regarding how PSMs influence herbivore foraging decisions.
   Herbivore foraging decisions, in turn, directly impact on which
   individual plants, and plant species, are selected for consumption. We
   took advantage of the natural variation in sideroxylonal concentrations
   in the foliage of Eucalyptus melliodora (Cunn. ex Schauer) to
   investigate feeding patterns of a marsupial folivore, the common
   ringtail possum, Pseudocheirus peregrinus (Boddaert 1785). Foliage,
   collected from six trees, contained between 0.32 and 12.97 mg g-DM-1
   sideroxylonal. With increasing sideroxylonal concentrations, possums
   decreased their total intake, rate of intake and intake per feeding
   bout, and increased their cumulative time spent feeding. Possums did not
   alter their total feeding time, number of feeding bouts or time per
   feeding bout in response to increasing sideroxylonal concentrations.
   Results demonstrate important behavioural changes in foraging patterns
   in response to sideroxylonal. These behavioural changes have important
   implications, in relation to altered foraging efficiency and potential
   predation risk, for herbivores foraging in the field. As a result, the
   spatial distribution of dietary PSMs across a landscape may directly
   influence herbivore fitness, and ultimately habitat selection of

   selection when exploiting resource patches with a mix of items that

Abstract = {{Wild-caught animals are often given a settling in period before
   experimental trials are initiated. We used wild-caught chaffinches
   (Fringilla coelebs) to investigate (a) the effect of settling in period
   duration on the likelihood that chaffinches foraged during experimental
   trials and (b) whether settling in period duration influenced measures
   of foraging and vigilance behaviour recorded from those experiments. The
   probability of collecting foraging data from an individual's first trial
   fell below 50\% if it had been in captivity for more than 12 days prior
   to that trial, whereas the probability was > 75\% if trials were
   completed within two days of capture. The successful collection of
   foraging data from subsequent trials was also dependent on the number of
   days an individual spent in captivity prior to its first trial and on
   whether that individual foraged in its first trial, suggesting that some
   individuals were more inclined to forage in captivity. Individuals that
   foraged in their first trial had a 94\% higher success rate in
   subsequent trials than those that did not. However, settling in period
   duration did not significantly influence the peck rate, mean search
   period or mean vigilance period of individuals that did forage. Our
   results show that allowing a settling in period actually reduced the
   likelihood of collecting foraging data from chaffinches and that
   commencing experiments shortly after capture increased data collection
   efficiency. We discuss the possibility that the inability to collect
   data from certain birds following a settling in period could lead to
   potentially important biases in results. particularly if propensity to
   forage is linked to an individual's coping strategy or personality. We
   conclude that it may not always be beneficial to allow wild-caught
   animals to habituate to captivity before commencing experiments. In some
   cases, testing animals soon after capture may increase the likelihood of
   data collection, reducing both the number of study animals required and

Abstract = {{Where predation is a major limiting factor, it has been postulated that
   woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788)) reduce
   movements to minimize contact with predators and exhibit fidelity to
   seasonal ranges. We examined fidelity behaviour within season and among
   years of woodland caribou based on locations of 65 radio-collared
   individuals in British Columbia, Canada. We used average linear
   distances between all possible pairs of radiolocations of individuals to
   assess fidelity. Among-year interlocation distances were similar to
   within-season interlocation distances during summer, indicating that
   caribou did not shift their distribution during seasons when they were
   most vulnerable to predation. Among-year interlocation distances were
   significantly greater than within-season interlocation distances during
   both early winter and late winter, indicating that individual caribou
   shifted their distribution among winters. The amount that an
   individual's distribution shifted among winters varied among and within
   individuals over different years. During early winter this behavioural
   plasticity was correlated with snow accumulation, with individuals
   having greater interlocation distances in years with high snow
   accumulation. Our results indicate that site fidelity outside the
   calving season is unlikely solely influenced by predator avoidance. We
   suggest that seasonal shifts in the importance of limiting factors vary
   from predation in summer to food in winter.}},

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{32}},

Pages = {{374-383}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Nematodes represent a very abundant group of soil organisms and
   non-parasitic species are important for soil quality and in the soil
   food web. In recent years, it has been shown that nematodes are
   appropriate bioindicators of soil condition and they are also suitable
   organisms for laboratory toxicity testing. The aims of this paper are to
   overview and critically assess methods and approaches for researching
   soil nematode ecotoxicology. In natural ecosystems, nematode abundance
   and community structure analyses were proved to be sensitive indicators
   of stress caused by soil pollutants and ecological disturbance.
   Community structure analyses may be approached from a functional or
   ecological point of view; species are divided into groups according to
   their feeding habits or alternatively the maturity index is calculated
   according to their ecological strategy. Many environmental factors have
   the potential to affect nematode community, which consequently results
   in high space and time variability. This variance is major handicap in
   field ecotoxicological studies because pollutant-nematode relationships
   are obscured. For prospective risk assessment of chemicals, several
   toxicity tests with nematodes were developed and are increasingly used.
   Sensitivity of these tests is comparable to tests with other soil
   species (e.g. enchytraeids, earthworms and springtails) while tests are
   less demanding to space and time. Most studies have focused on metal
   toxicity but organic compounds are almost overlooked. Endpoints used in
   tests were often mortality, reproduction or movement, but more sublethal
   endpoints such as feeding or biomarkers have been used recently too.
   Although there is an increasing amount of knowledge in soil nematode
   ecotoxicology, there is still a lot of various issues in this topic to
   research. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{It is becoming increasingly clear that conditions experienced during
   embryonic development can be of major importance for traits subsequent
   to parturition or hatching. For example, in mammals, offspring from
   stressed mothers show a variety of changes in behavioural,
   morphological, and life-history traits. The effects of maternal stress
   on trait development are believed to be mediated via transfer of
   glucocorticoids, the main hormones released during the stress response,
   from mother to offspring. However, also other physiological maternal
   responses during stress could be responsible for changes in offspring
   phenotype. We investigated the direct effects of corticosterone on
   offspring development, without other confounding factors related to
   increased maternal stress, by injection of corticosterone in eggs of the
   ovoviviparous lizard Lacerta vivipara. Corticosterone-manipulated
   offspring did not show impaired development, reduced body size or body
   condition at parturition. However, corticosterone-treated offspring
   showed altered anti-predator behaviour, as measured by the time required
   to emerge from shelter after a simulated predator attack. Differential
   steroid exposure during development, possibly mediated by maternal
   stress response, may explain some of the variation in behaviour among
   individuals in natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. Little is known about how physical activity (PA), sedentary
   behavior, and various adolescent health risk behaviors are associated.
   The objective of this study was to examine relationships between PA and
   sedentary behavior patterns and an array of risk behaviors, including
   leading causes of adolescent morbidity/ mortality.
   METHODS. Nationally representative self-reported data were collected (
   National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health; wave I: 1994 - 1995;
   II: 1996; N = 11 957). Previously developed and validated cluster
   analyses identified 7 homogeneous groups of adolescents sharing PA and
   sedentary behaviors. Poisson regression predicted the relative risk of
   health risk behaviors, other weekly activities, and self-esteem across
   the 7 PA/sedentary behavior clusters controlling for demographics and
   socioeconomic status. Main outcome measures were adolescent risk
   behaviors (eg, truancy, cigarette smoking, sexual intercourse,
   delinquency), other weekly activities ( eg, work, academic performance,
   sleep), self-esteem.
   RESULTS. Relative to high television ( TV) and video viewers,
   adolescents in clusters characterized by skating and video gaming, high
   overall sports and sports participation with parents, using neighborhood
   recreation center, strict parental control of TV, reporting few
   activities overall, and being active in school were less likely to
   participate in a range of risky behaviors, ranging from an adjusted risk
   ratio (ARR) of 0.42 ( outcome: illegal drug use, cluster: strict
   parental control of TV) to 0.88 ( outcome: violence, cluster: sports
   with parents). Active teens were less likely to have low self-esteem (
   eg, adolescents engaging in sports with parents, ARR: 0.73) and more
   likely to have higher grades ( eg, active in school, ARR: 1.20).
   CONCLUSIONS. Participation in a range of PA-related behaviors,
   particularly those characterized by high parental sports/exercise
   involvement, was associated with favorable adolescent risk profiles.
   Adolescents with high TV/video viewership were less likely to have
   positive risk behavior outcomes. Enhancing opportunities for PA and
   sport may have a beneficial effect on leading adolescent risk behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Trait anger has been shown to predict coronary heart disease;
   however, there are no prior studies evaluating anger as a risk factor
   for type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study was to determine if
   anger proneness predicted type 2 diabetes using prospective analyses.
   Methods: We analyzed data on trait anger, assessed by questionnaire, in
   a longitudinal, bi-racial cohort study of 11,615 initially non-diabetic
   adults aged 48-67, who were subsequently followed for 6 years for the
   development of type 2 diabetes.
   Results: There was no relation between overall trait anger and the
   subsequent risk of diabetes; however, individuals in the highest tertile
   of trait anger temperament scores had a 34\% increased risk of
   developing diabetes compared to those in the lowest tertile (Relative
   hazard {[}RH]=1.34; 95\% confidence interval: 1.10, 1.62), following
   adjustment for age, race, gender, and education. The relation between
   anger temperament and diabetes remained significant following adjustment
   for behavioral factors (smoking, physical activity, and caloric intake)
   (RH = 1.31; 95\% Cl: 1.08, 1.60) but was non-significant after
   additional adjustment for waist-to-hip ratio and body-mass index (RH =
   1.18; 95\% Cl: 0.97, 1.44).
   Conclusions: While we found no relation between overall trait anger and
   incident diabetes, persons who had higher anger temperament subscale
   scores had a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes, which was
   largely explained by adiposity. Anger temperament may deserve further

Abstract = {{The memory deficits induced by cannabinoid agonists have been found in
   several behavioral paradigms. Nevertheless, there is evidence that not
   all types of memory are impaired after cannabinoid administration. The
   aim of this study was to investigate whether the cannabinoid agonist WIN
   55212-2 (WIN) is able to influence the acquisition of fear conditioning
   using tone and contextual versions. For tone-fear conditioning, male
   Wistar rats were placed in the conditioning chamber and after 3 min, a
   sound (CS) was presented for 10s that terminated with a 1-s electric
   footshock (1.5 mA). For contextual-fear conditioning, a similar
   procedure was used but no sound was presented. Twenty-four hours after,
   the animals were re-exposed to the respective CS (tone or conditioning
   chamber) and the freezing behavior was registered. A subsequent
   experiment investigated a possible state-dependent effect of WIN by
   administering WIN or control solution 30 min before conditioning and
   before testing. WIN (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg) administered i.p. 30 min before
   impaired contextual fear conditioning but did not modify the freezing
   behavior elicited by tone presentation. These animals did not show any
   state-dependent effects of WIN. Further, the impaired contextual
   conditioning was prevented by preadministration of SRI41716A (1.0 mg/kg,
   i.p.) or SRI47778 (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.), selective cannabinoid CB I receptor
   antagonists. The present findings highlight that cannabinoid agonists
   effects are selective for the hippocampus-dependent aversive memories in
   rats. This effect appears to be related to the activation of CB1
   cannabinoid receptors and confirms that cannabinoids might provide a
   novel approach for the treatment of unpleasant memories. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{In cooperatively breeding species, parents may be assisted by other
   individuals to feed the young. How breeding parents react when they
   receive help is poorly understood. Evidence suggests that parents
   usually maintain their feeding effort when starvation of chicks is
   common, and reduce it when other risks such as predation are more
   important for chick survival, although some recent examples do not fit
   this pattern. In no case, however, have parents been found to increase
   their effort when they have helpers. We investigated this issue in a
   rarely studied cooperative breeder, the azure-winged magpie, Cyanopica
   cyanus. Breeders increased their provisioning rate when aided by
   helpers. However, chick starvation was rare and it was equally so in
   nests with and without helpers. The incidence of predation, conversely,
   was significantly lower in the presence of helpers. Helpers provisioned
   at a lower rate than parents but buffered the effect of adverse
   conditions in bad years in the nests they assisted. To our knowledge,
   these findings show for the first time that parents can increase their
   investment in the current brood in the presence of helpers, a result
   that does not seem to have been covered by current theory of cooperative
   breeding. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{In animals such as birds that are capable of adjusting energy reserves
   behaviourally in response to starvation risk and predation risk, mass is
   a measure of an individual's perception of the risks in its environment.
   Although it is often necessary to capture and handle animals to allow
   the scientific study of animal behaviour, little is known about how this
   affects the individual's perception of the risks in its environment or
   how this changes subsequent behaviour. In this study we remotely
   monitored the mass of individual wild great tits, Pants major, for 10
   days after capture, handling and release and then used
   starvation-predation risk trade-off theory to investigate how
   individuals perceived the risks in their environment. Mass increased
   significantly after capture and remained higher for 7 days before
   returning to precapture levels. We conclude that the capture and
   handling event was perceived as an interruption to foraging induced by
   an encounter with a predator which heightened starvation risk. Although
   this forced interruption to foraging was a relatively small proportion
   of available foraging time (< 6\%), the subsequent response produced a
   large (66\% of normal diurnal mass gain) and sustained change in mass.
   The results highlight the key role that foraging interruptions play in
   an individual's assessment of risks when trading off starvation against
   predation. They may also help to explain why some investigations of the
   effect of perceived predation risk on body mass in captive birds have
   produced inconsistent results. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of

   increases predation mortality in foraging redshanks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{713-723}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The effect of competition for a limiting resource on the population
   dynamics of competitors is usually assumed to operate directly through
   starvation, yet may also affect survival indirectly through
   behaviourally mediated effects that affect risk of predation. Thus,
   competition can affect more than two trophic levels, and we aim here to
   provide an example of this.
   We show that the foraging success of redshanks Tringa totanus (L.)
   foraging on active prey was highest in the front of flocks, whereas this
   was not the case for redshanks foraging on inactive prey. Also, when
   foraging on active prey, foraging success in a flock decreased as more
   birds passed through a patch, while overall foraging success was not
   lower on subsequent visits to the same patch. Thus, redshanks foraging
   on active prey suffered from interference competition, whereas this was
   not the case for redshanks foraging on inactive prey.
   This interference competition led to differences in activity: redshanks
   attaining a lower foraging success had a higher walking rate. Greater
   activity was associated with wider flock spacing and shorter distances
   to cover, which has previously been shown to increase predation risk and
   mortality from sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus (L.).
   We conclude that behavioural adaptations of prey species can lead to
   interference competition in foraging redshanks, and thus can affect
   their predation risk and mortality through increased activity. This
   study is one of the first to show how interference competition can be a
   mechanism for behaviourally mediated indirect effects, and provides
   further evidence for the suggestion that a single species occupying an
   intermediate trophic level may be simultaneously top-down controlled by
   a predator and bottom-up controlled by a behavioural response of its
   prey.}},

Abstract = {{Food insecurity is a daily reality for hundreds of millions of people
   around the world. Although its most extreme manifestations are often
   obvious, many other households facing constraints in their access to
   food are less identifiable. Operational agencies lack a method for
   differentiating households at varying degrees of food insecurity in
   order to target and evaluate their interventions. This chapter provides
   an overview of a set of papers associated with a research initiative
   that seeks to identify more precise, yet simple, measures of household
   food insecurity. The overview highlights three main conceptual
   developments associated with practical approaches to measuring
   constraints in access to food: 1) a shift from using measures of food
   availability and utilization to measuring ``inadequate access{''}; 2) a
   shift from a focus on objective to subjective measures; and 3) a growing
   emphasis on fundamental measurement as opposed to reliance on distal,
   proxy measures. Further research is needed regarding 1) how well
   measures of household food insecurity designed for chronically
   food-insecure contexts capture the processes leading to, and experience
   of, acute food insecurity, 2) the impact of short-term shocks, such as
   major floods or earthquake, on household behaviors that determine
   responses to food security questions, 3) better measurement of the

Abstract = {{A central issue in predator-prey interactions is how predator associated
   chemical cues affect the behaviour and life history of prey. In this
   study, we investigated how growth and behaviour during ontogeny of a
   damselfly larva (Coenagrion hastulatum) in high and low food
   environments was affected by the diet of a predator (Aeshna juncea). We
   reared larvae in three different predator treatments; no predator,
   predator feeding on conspecifics and predator feeding on
   heterospecifics. We found that, independent of food availability, larvae
   displayed the strongest anti-predator behaviours where predators
   consumed prey conspecifics. Interestingly, the effect of predator diet
   on prey activity was only present early in ontogeny, whereas late in
   ontogeny no difference in prey activity between treatments could be
   found. In contrast, the significant effect of predator diet on prey
   spatial distribution was unaffected by time. Larval size was affected by
   both food availability and predator diet. Larvae reared in the high food
   treatment grew larger than larvae in the low food treatment. Mean larval
   size was smallest in the treatment where predators consumed prey
   conspecifics, intermediate where predators consumed heterospecifics and
   largest in the treatment without predators. The difference in mean
   larval size between treatments is probably an effect of reduced larval
   feeding, due to behavioural responses to chemical cues associated with
   predator diet. Our study suggests that anti-predator responses can be
   specific for certain stages in ontogeny. This finding shows the
   importance of considering where in its ontogeny a study organism is
   before results are interpreted and generalisations are made.
   Furthermore, this finding accentuates the importance of long-term
   studies and may have implications for how results generated by
   short-term studies can be used.}},

Abstract = {{Yoldia hyperborea (Loven) is a protobranch bivalve of circumboreal
   distribution and an important bioturbator of muddy sediments of
   cold-water embayments in Newfoundland, Canada, where it is exposed to a
   strong seasonal input of sinking phytoplankton during spring, sporadic
   events of sediment resuspension, and sediment of low nutritional value
   during winter. To explain field-observed patterns of population
   dynamics, we quantified the behavioural response of Y. hyperborea to
   pulses of settling algae and sediment resuspension events, and
   hypothesised that Y. hyperborea behaviour is modified during settling of
   nutrient-rich organic matter. Yoldia hyperborea responded rapidly to the
   arrival of settling microalgae by extending its siphons into the water
   column. Once the pulse of algal material reached the sediment the
   animals partially emerged, extended the palp proboscides over the
   sediment surface and maintained close contact with the area of highest
   algal concentration. In contrast, the activity of animals not exposed to
   settling algae or to resuspended sediment was primarily restricted to
   strata below the sediment surface. Thus the predominant subsurface
   feeding behaviour of Yoldia hyperborea is switched to surface
   deposit-feeding as a response to cues contained in microalgae. Results
   suggest active suspension-feeding during algal sedimentation events,
   although deposit-feeding resumes once the algae are no longer in
   suspension, and suspension-feeding is probably of little nutritional
   significance. The rapid behavioural response of Y hyperborea to the
   influx of high quality food, such as fresh microalgae, is probably an
   adaptive foraging strategy to a food-limited environment and suggests
   higher bioturbation rates of surface sediments during spring, a key role
   being played by the protobranch in redistribution of labile
   phytodetritus within the benthos. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Animals make economic decisions on where to feed based on balancing
   intake rates with the risk of starvation, When foraging, they must also
   manage time allocation to feeding, antipredator behaviour and resource
   guarding. These behaviours are usually believed to be mutually
   exclusive. The most intense foraging effort is predicted to occur in
   low-risk situations, while more antipredator behaviour is seen in
   high-risk situations. We studied the time allocation of individual
   light-bellied brent geese, Branta bermicla hrota, and the proportion of
   the flock engaged in foraging and vigilance behaviour in high- and
   low-risk habitats. Geese faced with a depleted resource in a low-risk
   intertidal situation responded by foraging in a higher-risk terrestrial
   habitat. Individual intake rates and levels of agonistic interactions
   were higher during terrestrial feeding, but group vigilance was
   maintained, with certain flock positions showing disproportionate levels
   of vigilance. In contrast to previous studies, agonistic interactions
   were more frequent when the geese were feeding on a nonpatchy resource,
   suggesting that different mechanisms drive agonistic encounters in
   different habitats. We discuss these results in the context of a growing
   population with limited resources. By remaining behaviourally plastic,
   the geese are able to adapt novel trade-off strategies to use
   alternative prey types. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Sperm competition is a well-recognised agent in the evolution of sperm
   and ejaculate structure, as well as variation in female quality. Models
   of the evolution of ejaculate expenditure predict that male body
   condition, female fecundity and the risk and intensity of sperm
   competition may be the ultimate factors shaping optimal ejaculate size.
   We investigated sperm allocation in Austro-potamobius italicus, a
   freshwater crayfish exhibiting a coercive mating system and external
   fertilisation, in relation to male and female traits and copulation
   behaviour under laboratory conditions. We found that mating males were
   sensitive to female size and produced larger ejaculates when mating with
   larger females, which were more fecund in terms of number of eggs
   produced. We found no evidence for female egg production being
   sperm-limited, as the number of eggs was not dependent on male sperm
   expenditure. Copulation duration and number of ejaculations reliably
   predicted the amount of sperm transferred and both these behavioural
   measures positively covaried with female body size. These results
   indicate that male freshwater crayfish can modulate their sperm
   expenditure in accordance with cues that indicate female fecundity. In
   addition, a novel finding that emerged from this study is the decrease
   in sperm expenditure with male body size, which may either suggest that
   large, old male crayfish are better able than small males to economise
   sperm at a given mating to perform multiple matings during a
   reproductive season, or that they experience senescence of their

Abstract = {{There has been considerable discussion of the factors that influence the
   hunting behaviour of male chimpanzees. Explanations invoking social
   benefits hinge upon the potential for males to share meat with sexually
   receptive females in exchange for mating ('meat for sex'), or to share
   meat with other males in exchange for social support ('male social
   bonding'). Ecological factors may also affect hunting: chimpanzees may
   hunt more frequently (1) in response to food shortages ('nutrient
   shortfall'); (2) when energy reserves are high ('nutrient surplus'); (3)
   in habitat types with good visibility and increased prey vulnerability;
   and/or (4) when ecological factors favour cooperative hunting. We used
   25 years of data on chimpanzees in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, to
   examine the relative importance of social and ecological factors in the
   decision to hunt red colobus monkeys, Colobus badius. The presence of
   sexually receptive females was associated with a significant decrease in
   hunting probability, suggesting that males face a trade-off between
   hunting and mating ('meat or sex' rather than `meat for sex'). Hunting
   by specific males did not vary with adult male party size, providing
   evidence against the male social-bonding hypothesis. After controlling
   for the effects of party size, diet quality was not associated with the
   probability of hunting or hunting successfully. Hunts were more likely
   to occur and to succeed in woodland and semideciduous forest than in
   evergreen forest, emphasizing the importance of visibility and prey
   mobility. Finally, per capita meat availability decreased with adult
   male party size, suggesting that hunting was not cooperative. These
   results provide evidence against social explanations for hunting in
   favour of more simple ecological alternatives. (c) 2006 The Association

Abstract = {{Current foraging models limit the decision-making process of animals to
   the food searching and consuming phase. The post-consummatory phase of
   feeding may influence optimal meal size for some species as a
   morphologic change often results from feeding. In snakes, a single prey
   item can lead to abrupt increases in body mass, thus influencing
   locomotor performance. Identifying factors affecting locomotor
   performance can help predict behaviors that should maximize an animal's
   chance of evading predators. Although many snakes ingest large
   percentages of their body mass, not much work has examined the
   post-consummatory effects of ingesting bulky prey differing in relative
   mass. I examined the locomotor performance and antipredator tactics of
   hatchling trinket snakes (Elaphe helena) after subjecting snakes to mice
   prey varying by relative mass differences of 20-35\%, 50-59\% or 70-79\%
   of an individual hatchling's body mass. Snakes in treatment groups were
   compared with snakes in a control group (0\%). Meal size-affected
   locomotor parameters such as burst speed, endurance, and endurance times
   for hatchlings that ingested 50-59\% and 70-79\% of their body mass (p <
   0.001). Recent feeding also affected the types of antipredator modes
   employed. Hatchlings in the 0\% and 20-35\% treatments exhibited
   behaviors that were categorized as active and threatening, while
   hatchlings in the 50-59\% and 70-79\% treatments exhibited stationary,
   neutral, and cryptic behaviors. Although snakes may become more
   reclusive following a meal, this study demonstrates that relative prey
   mass affects the ability of hatchling trinket snakes to flee from a
   predator. In turn, these results suggest that the post-consummatory
   effects of foraging should be considered in optimal foraging models for
   organisms that consume a substantial portion of their body mass during a
   single feeding.}},

   A high-energy diet entailed growth advantages only if predation risk did
   not constrain energy acquisition, whereas diet quality affected
   primarily the extension of the larval period. Predation risk influenced
   juvenile shape, most likely via the effects on growth and
   differentiation rates. Juvenile frogs emerging from predator
   environments had shorter legs and longer bodies than those from the
   nonpredator tanks. However, these morphological changes did not
   translate into differences in relative jumping performance. Neither

   chemodetection of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in this calanoid copepod and
   quantified its behavioral response to plumes of DMS using

Abstract = {{Individuals with night eating syndrome (NES) display a time-delayed

   prevalence estimates have been reported among bariatric surgery
   candidates, and some evidence suggests that NES is positively associated
   with obesity, negatively associated with weight loss efficacy, and
   follows a chronic course. In order to evaluate current NES theory, and
   the association between NES and bariatric surgery, literature searches
   were conducted to identify relevant literature published in English up
   to 2005. Because of inconsistencies in NES characterization, and
   significant heterogeneity in study design and methods, a qualitative
   assessment of NES and its relation to bariatric surgery was then
   undertaken. Within the literature, variable NES definitions highlight
   the distinct lack of clarity as to which behavioral features constitute
   a clinically meaningful entity. Prevalence estimates appear high among
   persons seeking bariatric surgery; however, no consistent pre- or
   postoperative demographic, clinical, or psychological factors reliably
   differentiate NES from non-NES. Further examination of the clinical
   significance, correlates, and course of NES in general and surgical
   samples is important, given the link with obesity. The ways in which NES
   departs from ``normal{''} eating behavior must be clarified. Behavioral
   and psychological traits of NES need elucidation, and the establishment
   of agreed diagnostic criteria is essential for research to move forward.

   this phase of the nesting cycle is regulated by a trade-off between the
   benefits of brooding/guarding and those of foraging. We manipulated
   offspring age in grey-headed albatrosses, Thalassarche chrysostoma, by
   swapping chicks between nests. Parents given chicks 6 days older than
   their own shortened brooding by only 1.2 days, and parents given chicks
   6 days younger than their own extended brooding by 1.4 days. Despite
   being relatively unresponsive to chick age, parents adjusted brooding in
   relation to calendar date and to chick condition. The results suggest
   that adults do not use chick age per se as a cue, but instead probably
   use an internal timer, and fine-tune the decision to end brooding
   according to date and chick mass. The duration of brood guarding did not
   correlate with adult body condition, suggesting that adults had a
   sufficient safety margin to allow them to respond to chick needs without
   compromising their own residual reproductive value. Chick survival at
   the end of brood guarding was strongly dependent on calendar date (early
   and late chicks suffered higher mortality), which suggests that
   grey-headed albatrosses benefit from breeding synchronously. We conclude
   that the length of the brood-guarding period is dependent on chick
   condition and seasonal variation in chick predation risk. (c) 2006 The

Abstract = {{Amphibians are known to exhibit phenotypic plasticity in response to
   variations in predation pressure. Data also indicate that developmental
   changes can be induced by embryonic exposures to predator non-contact
   cues. However, the possible consequences of such exposures on larval
   behavioural activity and sensitivity to chemical cues from predators
   have remained unexplored. These laboratory experiments examine the
   effects of predation cues experienced during embryonic development on
   some morphological and behavioural traits in hatchlings and tadpoles of
   the common frog (Rana temporaria). Eggs were raised until hatching in
   the nonlethal presence of either a sympatric predator (larval spotted
   salamander, Salamandra salamandra), or an allopatric predator Ouvenile
   Turkish crayfish, Astacus leptodactylus), or crushed conspecific
   tadpoles. Predators were kept either starved, or fed with R. temporaria
   tadpoles. Embryonic treatments had significant consequences on weight
   and total length of hatchlings, as well as on the general activity of
   tadpoles. Olfactometric tests showed that the behavioural responses of
   tadpoles to chemical cues from the two predators tested were not
   significantly affected by embryonic treatments. In contrast, embryonic
   experience showed a significant influence on the behavioural response of
   tadpoles to chemical cues from crushed conspecifics. These results
   indicate that the morphology of hatchlings depends on the species and
   diet of the predators present during embryonic development and
   demonstrate for the first time that the subsequent activity and
   chemically mediated antipredator behaviour of tadpoles can be influenced
   by embryonic experience of the predation risk.}},

Abstract = {{Nature-based tourism has experienced a greater increase, and, even
   although it might have deleterious effects for many wildlife species,
   its consequences remains little explored. Many lizard species are
   endangered and tourism has been proposed as a potential factor
   responsible of the decline of several lizards' populations, but no study
   has examined the effect of tourism on lizards' behaviour, body condition
   and health state. Many lizards respond to people as if they were
   predators, by readily escaping to refuges. However, an increase in the
   frequency of these antipredatory strategies can lead to a loss of body
   condition, which may have important consequences for short and long term
   fitness. We analysed the effects of tourism on escape behaviour of
   common wall lizards, Podarcis muralis, as well as on their body
   condition and health state (ectoparasites, blood parasites, and cell
   mediated immune response). Results showed that lizards did not modify
   their escape behaviour in response to tourism. Lizards had similar
   approach and flight distances, and escape strategies regardless of the
   level of tourism pressure. However, lizards inhabiting areas with high
   tourism levels, where they presumably needed to perform antipredatory
   behaviours more often, showed higher intensity of infection by ticks and
   lower body condition at the end of the breeding period. Moreover,
   lizards with poorer body condition had lower cell mediated immune
   responses. Therefore, tourism seems to have deleterious effects on body
   condition and on host-parasite relationships in this lizard species.
   These effects should be taking into account when designing walking paths
   in protected areas. Our study reports evidence that regardless lizards
   showed similar escape behaviour in tourist than in natural areas, their
   body condition and health state should be also examined to accurately
   assess the actual effects of tourism on lizards' populations. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{Small size at birth is linked with an increased risk of chronic diseases
   in later life. Poor maternal nutrition during gestation may contribute
   to restricted fetal growth, leading to increased disease susceptibility
   in later Life. Animal studies have shown that undernutrition during
   gestation is associated with reduced life span and increased disease
   susceptibility. The Dutch famine is a unique counterpart for animal
   models that study the effects of restricted maternal nutrition during
   different stages of gestation.
   This paper describes the findings from a cohort study of 2414 people
   born around the time of the Dutch famine. Exposure to famine during any
   stage of gestation was associated with glucose intolerance. We found
   more coronary heart disease, a more atherogenic lipid profile, disturbed
   blood coagulation, increased stress responsiveness and more obesity
   among those exposed to famine in early gestation. Women exposed to
   famine in early gestation also had an increased risk of breast cancer.
   People exposed to famine in mid gestation had more microalbuminuria and
   obstructive airways disease.
   These findings show that maternal undernutrition during gestation has
   important effects on health in later life, but that the effects on
   health depend on its timing during gestation. Especially early gestation
   seems to be a vulnerable period. Adequate dietary advice to women before
   and during pregnancy seems a promising strategy in preventing chronic
   diseases in future generations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Optimality theory rests on the assumptions that short-term foraging
   decisions are driven by variation in environmental quality, and that

   assumptions, however, are rarely tested in a field setting. We linked
   behavioral foraging decisions in food patches with measures of
   environmental quality covering larger spatial (resource density) or
   temporal (growth parameters) scales. In 10 lakes, we measured the food
   density at which benthic fish give up foraging in experimental food
   patches (giving-up density, GUD), quantified the biomass of benthic
   invertebrates, and calculated the maximum individual size (L-infinity)
   of bream (Abramis brama L.), a typical benthivore in these lakes. We
   found positive relationships between resource density and both GUD and
   L-infinity, and a positive relationship between L-infinity and GUD. Prey
   characterized as vulnerable to predation contributed most to the
   relationships between resource density and either GUD or L-infinity. A
   path analysis showed that resource density and L-infinity directly
   explained 54\% and 28\%, respectively, of the variation in GUD, whereas
   86\% of the variation in L-infinity was explained by resource density,

Abstract = {{1. An organism's ability to adjust its physiological traits to changes
   in environmental conditions is central for its ecological success.
   However, the effect of ecological interactions on physiological
   flexibility has rarely been investigated. Here we carry out a factorial
   experiment to analyse how food limitation (a potential result of
   competition) and tail loss (a potential result of sub-lethal predation)
   affect anatomical and physiological traits of the South American lizard
   Liolaemus nitidus.
   2. The size of several internal organs was affected by food
   availability. Small intestine mass increased with food consumption,
   allowing animals to keep constant digestibility at greater levels of
   digesta, which in turn permitted higher rates of food assimilation.
   Organs related to energy storage reached larger sizes in autotomized
   animals with high food availability, but tail regeneration rate after 3
   weeks did not change with food availability.
   3. Metabolic rate was affected by tail loss, and animals regenerating
   their tail showed higher metabolic rates than tailed ones. Because this
   increase in metabolic rate was independent of internal organ mass, a
   local effect of tail regeneration process (e.g. cell proliferation) on
   metabolic rate is suggested.
   4. When anatomical and metabolic data are jointly considered it follows
   that lizards adopt different physiological strategies, changing both
   energetic inputs and expenditures. This fact illustrates the complex
   interplay between ecological factors and physiological flexibility,
   which ultimately determine an organism's fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Ability to store resources that will be used for reproduction represents
   a potential life history adaptation because storage permits feeding and
   reproduction to be decoupled spatially and/or temporally. The two ends
   of a continuum involve acquiring all resources prior to reproduction
   (capital breeding) or acquiring all resources during the reproductive
   period (income breeding). Traditional life history theory examines
   tradeoffs between costs and benefits of such strategies, but this theory
   has not been integrated into life history studies of ants, even though
   founding queens have the analogous strategies of fully claustral
   (capital breeding) and semi-claustral (income breeding). This study
   demonstrates that facultatively semi-claustral queens of the
   seed-harvester ant Pogonomyrmex desertorum exhibit phenotypic plasticity
   during colony founding because unfed queens produced few, small minims,
   whereas ad libitum fed queens produced larger, heavier minims and
   additional brood. Fed queens also lost less mass than unfed queens
   despite their producing more brood. Overall, foraging provides queens
   with a suite of benefits that likely offset potential negative effects
   of foraging risk.
   Life history studies across a diverse array of taxa show that capital
   breeding is consistently associated with low availability and/or
   unpredictability of food, i.e., environmental conditions that favor
   prepackaging of reproductive resources. Such a broad and consistent
   pattern suggests that similar factors favored the evolution of fully
   claustral (capital breeding) colony founding in ants. Overall, these
   data suggest that ant researchers should revise their conventional view
   that fully claustral colony founding evolved because it eliminated the
   need for queens to leave the nest to forage. Instead, colony founding
   strategies should be examined from the perspective of environmental
   variation, i.e., availability and predictability of food. I also provide
   a functional scenario that could explain the evolution of colony
   founding strategies in ants.}},

Abstract = {{Poor fetal environments are thought to produce adaptive changes in human
   developmental trajectories according to the Predictive Adaptive Response
   hypothesis. Although many studies have demonstrated correlations between
   indicators of fetal environment and negative adult health outcomes, the
   adaptive significance of these outcomes is unclear. Our study explicitly
   tests the adaptive nature of fetal programming in humans. We show that
   differences in nutritional status at birth are associated with adaptive
   differences in the sensitivity of adult ovarian function to energetic
   stress. Women who were born as relatively fat babies do not exhibit
   ovarian suppression in response to moderate levels of physical activity
   at adulthood, in contrast to women who were born as skinnier babies. The
   levels of estradiol in women born in the highest tertile of ponderal
   index (an indicator of neonatal nutritional status) were 37\% and 46\%
   higher, respectively, than levels of estradiol in women born in the low
   and middle ponderal index tertiles. These findings suggest that fetal
   programming of reproductive function results in developmentally plastic,
   but essentially adaptive, shifts in set points of ovarian response to
   energetic stress, such that women who were gestated under conditions of
   energetic constraint show greater sensitivity to energetic stress in
   adulthood. Our results have practical implications in terms of
   behavioral strategies for reducing the risk of breast cancer. We suggest
   that the amount of activity necessary to reduce levels of estrogen,
   which may in turn reduce cancer risk, can depend on a woman's

Abstract = {{Small birds show the greatest rates of body mass gain at dawn and before

   second one, and thus may change the shape of daily fattening
   trajectories. A frequent problem for researchers is setting the periods
   of the day when each of the main environmental factors operates, because
   its effects usually decay or increase smoothly from dawn to dusk. We
   solved this problem by fitting the body mass to time of day with a model
   generated with a differential approach. This model shows the typical
   bimodal pattern of daily fattening routines in small birds and allows
   calculation of the inflexion point, that is, the time of day when the
   trajectory ends the decelerated period of body mass gain and. starts the
   accelerated increase in body weight. A delay or advance in the

   the inflexion point of the body mass trajectory should be delayed in
   response to a decrease in food availability increasing body mass as soon
   as possible when food is scarce. This effect might be stronger in
   subordinate than in dominant birds. We tested both predictions with four

   brood size manipulation affects not only the number of young per nest
   but also their body condition, we analysed an extended data set to
   disentangle these two factors. This analysis showed that, independently
   of brood size, nestlings in poor condition and those reared in broods
   where sibling differed markedly in weight were more likely to disappear
   from the colony. Nestling disappearance also occurred predominantly in
   nests close to the colony entrances. Although nestling swifts can wander
   in the colony and become adopted in neighbouring nests, we found no
   evidence that wandering per se increased the risk of falling out of the
   colony. Our study therefore highlights a novel cost of scramble
   competition. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Theoretical and experimental evidence suggests that an increase in
   flight costs will decrease flight performance, and that birds should
   trade-off the benefits of body reserves to minimize these costs.
   Alternatively, birds could avoid starvation by increasing food intake,
   thereby maintaining body reserves, and/or decreasing flight activity to
   compensate for the greater per unit flight costs. To test the effect of
   increased flight costs on body mass regulation and on flying and feeding
   activity, we experimentally manipulated wing area in a free-ranging
   wintering population of coal tits, Periparus ater, and in captive birds
   living in a less restrictive environment (large outdoor aviaries). In
   the field, body mass decreased when wing area was reduced, but heavier
   birds lost more weight than lighter birds as a consequence of an
   allometric increase in flying costs. However, wing area reduction had no
   effect on body mass in the aviaries. Birds also flew less when wing area
   was reduced and those with higher wing loadings decreased flying
   frequency more markedly. We suggest that the goal of small resident
   birds living in a Mediterranean montane climate would be to maintain
   daily fat reserves within narrow limits during autumn and winter, even
   under contrasting ecological conditions. 2006 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Although previous studies of individual differences in preferences for
   masculinity in male faces have typically emphasized the importance of
   factors such as changes in levels of sex hormones during the menstrual

   Adaptation to either masculine or feminine faces increases preferences
   for novel faces that are similar to those that were recently seen. Here,
   we replicate this effect and demonstrate that adaptation to masculine or
   feminine faces also influences the extent to which masculine faces are
   perceived as trustworthy. These adaptation effects may reflect a
   proximate mechanism that contributes to the development of face
   preferences within individuals, underpins phenomena such as
   imprinting-like effects and condition-dependent face preferences, and
   shapes personality attributions to faces that play an important role in
   romantic partner and associate choices. Furthermore, our findings also

Abstract = {{Birds may react to the presence of humans with an immediate primary
   behavioural reaction and with physiological responses, such as the
   activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. This study
   investigates the suite of behavioural and adrenocortical responses to
   the presence of humans and to handling in two subspecies of blue tits
   Parus caeruleus, a small hole-nesting passerine, during the period of
   feeding their nestlings. The first aim was to investigate whether the
   presence of humans near their nests elicits an adrenocortical response
   and whether the increase in circulating corticosterone is correlated
   with the behavioural reaction of the birds. The second aim was to
   determine the time-lag between the onset of capture and handling stress
   and the increase in circulating corticosterone levels. The third aim was
   to try to explain individual variation in the adrenocortical response to
   handling with 9 intrinsic and extrinsic factors (sex, age, body size,
   measures of body condition, time of day, and date). One half of the
   parents showed a behavioural reaction to our presence near the nest,
   such as alarming, and hesitating to enter the nestbox. However, the
   degree of behavioural reaction before handling was not related to
   circulating corticosterone levels which remained low. The results
   confirm that primary behavioural and adrenocortical reactions to the
   presence of predators are independent of each other. A comparison with
   published findings supports the hypothesis that birds react to predators
   with an adrenocortical response only in a situation that is imminently
   life-threatening. Hence, the primary behavioural response of the bird to
   a predator may determine whether or not an adrenocortical response is
   elicited. An adrenocortical response to handling started 3 min after
   capture in the nest box. Individual variation in baseline corticosterone
   levels could be explained by subspecies and body condition (fat stores),
   variation in handling-induced corticosterone levels by subspecies, body
   condition, body size, and time of day. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Substantial work has shown that rats although identical in stock, sex,
   age, and housing conditions can differ considerably in terms of behavior
   and physiology. Such individual differences, which can be detected by
   specific behavioral screening tests, are rather stable, that is, they
   probably reflect a behavioral disposition or trait. Here, we asked
   whether and how such differences might affect performance in a task of
   spatial learning and memory, the radial maze. As in our previous work,
   we used the degree of rearing activity in a novel open field to assign
   male adult outbred Wistar rats into those with high versus low rearing
   activity (HRA/LRA rats). They were then tested in a plus-maze for
   possible differences in anxiety-related behavior. Finally, and most
   importantly, they were food deprived and underwent maze training using
   an 8-arm radial maze with four non-baited and four baited arms. One of
   these arms consistently contained a larger bait size than the other
   three. In the open field, HRA rats not only showed more rearing
   behavior, but also more locomotor activity than LRA rats. In the
   plus-maze, HRA rats again showed more locomotion, but did not differ in
   open arm time or percentage of open arm entries, that is, conventional
   measures of anxiety-related behavior. In the radial maze, HRA rats
   consistently needed less time to consume all pellets than LRA rats,
   which was due to faster locomotion on the arms and less time spent at
   the food pits (especially in baited arms) of HRA rats. During the
   initial days of training, they were also more efficient in obtaining all
   food pellets available. Furthermore, HRA rats visited more arms and made
   relatively less reference memory errors than LRA rats. This allowed them
   to forage food quickly, but was paralleled by more working memory errors
   than in LRA rats. In general, working memory errors were more frequent
   in the arm with the large bait size, but there were no indications that
   HRA and LRA rats responded differently dependent on reward size.
   Finally, LRA rats lost slightly more weight than HRA rats during the
   period of food deprivation. These results are discussed with respect to
   the role of cognitive and motivational mechanisms, which as
   subject-inherent factors can contribute substantially to
   inter-individual variability in the radial maze. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Intraguild predation (IGP) is common among generalist predators and an
   important issue in food web theory, because IGP may destabilise
   communities by increasing extinction of species. Also, IGP may interfere
   with the effectiveness of generalist predators as biological control
   agents. In general, occurrence of IGP in laboratory or field studies is
   inferred from abundance data or direct observations only. We
   investigated if tracing stable isotopes allows distinction between
   different types of predation and confirmation of IGP. Wolf spiders were
   chosen as model organisms for generalist predators; IGP of third instar
   A. cuneata on second instar P. palustris was investigated in a
   laboratory experiment. The availability of alternative prey and the
   complexity of the microhabitat were manipulated, since both factors are
   thought to facilitate coexistence of predators.
   Stable isotope analysis documented predation of A. cuneata on P.
   palustris and predation on alternative prey by both juveniles. Both the
   presence of alternative prey and the availability of shelter reduced
   mortality of juvenile P. palustris during the first week. During the
   second week mortality increased in complex structure without alternative
   prey presumably due to enhanced activity and cannibalism among starving
   P. palustris. Thus, microhabitat complexity and prey abundance may
   foster coexistence of wolf spiders in the field.
   In conclusion, stable isotope analysis was proven a powerful tool to
   investigate animal behaviour without direct observation. The method
   allowed disentangling predator feeding behaviour when more than one type
   of prey was present.}},

Abstract = {{Imperiled species that have been translocated or established in
   captivity can show rapid alterations in morphology and behavior, but the
   proximate mechanisms of such phenotypic changes are rarely known. Devils
   Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis) are endemic to a single desert pool
   and are characterized by a small body, large head and eyes, and lack of
   pelvic fins. To lessen the risk of extinction, additional populations of
   C. diabolis were established in artificial refuges. Yet, pupfish in
   these refuges rapidly shifted to a larger body, smaller head and eyes,
   and greater body depth. Here we examined how food availability and
   temperature, which differ between these habitats, influence
   morphological development in closely related Amargosa River pupfish
   (Cyprinodon nevadensis amargosae). We were interested in knowing whether
   these environmental factors could developmentally shift Amargosa River
   pupfish toward the morphology typical of pupfish in Devil's Hole. By
   regulating food ration, we created groups of pupfish with low, medium
   and high growth rates. Pupfish with low growth showed proportionally
   larger head and eyes, smaller body depth, and reduction in pelvic fin
   development. Elevated temperature further inhibited pelvic fin
   development in all treatments. Pupfish in the low growth group also
   showed reduced levels of thyroid hormone, suggesting a possible
   physiological mechanism underlying these morphological changes. To test
   this mechanism further, pupfish were reared with goitrogens to
   pharmacologically inhibit endogenous thyroid hormone production. Pupfish
   given goitrogens developed larger heads and eyes, shallower bodies, and
   reduced pelvic fins. Taken together, our results suggest that changes in
   environmental factors affecting the growth and thyroid hormone status of
   juvenile pupfish may play a developmental role in generating the
   morphological differences between C. diabolis in Devil's Hole and the
   refuges. These findings illustrate the need to incorporate a mechanistic
   understanding of phenotypic plasticity into conservation strategies to
   preserve imperiled fishes.}},

   availability of n-3 PLTFAs on brain fatty acid composition and the
   consequent effects on locomotor activity in male and female Long-Evans
   rats. Rats were raised from conception using purified diets and breeding
   protocols designed to produce four groups with distinct brain
   phospholipid compositions varying in DHA content and/or the proportion

Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{725-731}},

Abstract = {{Background: In an exploratory positron emission tomography study of
   postprandial regional cerebral blood flow, which is a marker of neuronal
   activity. obese men differed from lean men in several brain regions,
   including the prefrontal cortex. The subjects received a meal
   proportional to their body size; therefore, the meal volume was
   different for each person.
   Objective: We investigated whether differences in the brain responses of
   obese and lean men to a meal represent satiety or feelings of gastric
   distension.
   Design: We studied 9 lean ((x) over bar +/- SD body fat: 15 +/- 5\%;
   age: 33 +/- 10 y) and 9 obese (body fat: 31 +/- 4\%; age: 32 +/- 10 y)
   men given a fixed amount (400 mL) of a liquid meal. We compared their
   results with those in 11 lean (body fat: 16 +/- 5\%; age: 35 +/- 8 y)
   and 11 obese (body fat: 33 +/- 5\%; age: 28 +/- 5 y) previously studied
   men given a meal proportional to their body size. We performed analyses
   by using a two-level, random-effects approach in the STATISTICAL
   PARAMETRIC MAPPING software package and a significance level of P <=
   0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons.
   Results: Compared with lean men, obese men had consistently less
   postprandial activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
   irrespective of meal size.
   Conclusion: Because the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been
   implicated in the inhibition of inappropriate behavior, satiety, and
   meal termination, differential responses of neuronal activity to food
   intake in this area may contribute to a propensity for obesity or to the
   difficulty in losing weight experienced by obese men.}},

Abstract = {{Food and predators are thought to have independent effects on avian
   reproductive success. Several studies have now shown that extra food can
   reduce nest predation rates. Most hypotheses suggest that this is due to
   changes in adult and/or nestling behaviour. A critical test as to
   whether behaviour is key, is to examine when predation events occur for
   birds with and without extra food. If behaviour is important, extra food
   should lead to fewer nest predation events during the day, when birds
   are active, but have no effect at night. We conducted a food
   supplementation experiment on song sparrows and tested for food effects
   on timing of nest predation events, adult antipredator behaviour and
   nestling begging behaviour. Food supplementation significantly reduced
   the relative frequency of daytime nest predation especially during
   incubation. During incubation, fed females had shorter foraging bouts
   and longer bouts on the nest, and these behaviours were associated with
   a reduced probability of being preyed upon. During brooding, we found
   trends (P < 0.1) towards lower daytime predation and greater adult nest
   attendance for fed birds than for unfed birds, but nestling begging did
   not differ with food treatment. Our results show that food availability
   does influence nest predation through its effect on antipredator
   behaviour. We highlight the importance of examining adult behaviour and
   vulnerability to predation at both stages of the nesting period because
   behavioural changes with extra food were extreme at the egg stage and
   were more effective at reducing nest predation than were behavioural
   changes at the nestling stage. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose of review Childhood externalizing behavior (aggression,
   hyperactivity, and conduct disorder) has been increasingly viewed as a
   public health problem because of its etiology and outcome. The
   association between malnutrition and externalizing behavior has begun to
   receive attention. This review summarizes recent empirical findings on
   malnutrition as a risk factor for the development of externalizing
   behavior, with an emphasis on micronutrient deficiency, and explores
   brain dysfunction as a possible mechanism.
   Recent findings Externalizing behavior is associated with both
   macromalnutrition (e.g. protein) and micromalnutrition (e.g. iron and
   zinc). Both prenatal and postnatal malnutrition is implicated. The
   long-term effects of malnutrition on behavior could be reversible. The
   effects of docosahexaenoic acid/omega-3 long-chain essential fatty acid
   on externalizing behavior are more mixed. From animal and human
   findings, it is hypothesized that malnutrition impairs neurocognitive
   functioning by reducing neurons, alternating neurotransmitter
   functioning, and increasing neurotoxicity, and that such neurocognitive
   impairments predispose to externalizing behavior.
   Summary Different lines of evidence support the view that poor nutrition
   contributes to the development of child behavior problems. More
   randomized, controlled trials that manipulate nutritional intake and
   evaluate behavior in children are needed to evaluate the etiological

Abstract = {{Using experimental methods, body size, nutritional state (hunger) and
   light level were investigated as possible determinants of the extent to
   which juvenile lingcod Ophiodon elongatus used structural refuges. In
   the laboratory, older, larger individuals (134-162 mm total length, L-T)
   exhibited a higher propensity for structure use than did smaller
   juvenile fish (78-103 mm L-T). In fish of both body sizes, increasing
   hunger levels caused fish to emerge more readily from refuges than
   satiated individuals, with this effect most prominent for smaller fish.
   Diel patterns of ambient illumination were simulated in the laboratory,
   and refuge use by large individuals decreased significantly in response
   to lower nocturnal light levels, a pattern that was not observed in the
   smaller size class. These results indicate an ontogenetic shift in
   refuge use. During the summer, as post-settlement fish grew larger, they
   tended to increase affinity for structurally complex habitat, and also
   showed divergent patterns of behaviour in relation to hunger and light

Abstract = {{Laboratory animals, when subjected to behavioural tests, are often
   motivationally primed by a period of prior water or food restriction. To
   date, it is still debatable which restriction protocol (water versus
   food) is more appropriate for different species. In general, a protocol
   is considered appropriate if animal discomfort is kept to a minimum
   whilst motivation for the task is maximised. Here we present a
   comparison study of the effects of water versus food restriction
   protocols in mice. The characterisation of the physiological and
   behavioural effects of food and water restriction in mice is beneficial
   for both institutional animal care centres and the scientific community.
   We have investigated body weight fluctuations in three groups of
   C57BL/6J female mice (water-restricted, food-restricted and control) in
   two different protocols (20 h versus 22 h of restriction per day) over 2
   consecutive weeks. Subsequently, a selected number of mice from each
   group were subjected to a battery of behavioural tests to investigate
   exploratory, emotional and dominance behaviours, in addition to learning
   and memory processes. Body weight fluctuations suggested that mice
   tolerate a water restriction regimen better than a comparable food
   restriction regimen. Furthermore, behavioural performances demonstrated
   that food-restricted mice show a reduction in the exploration of a new
   environment and particular aspects of their timing memories are
   distorted. Finally, both water- and food-restricted mice tended to be
   more offensive than control mice when paired with an opponent in a
   social dominance test condition. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Carotenoids are important for various functions during chick
   development. Since these pigments cannot be synthesized, they can be
   considered limited resources that the mother optimally allocates between
   herself and her offspring (maternal effect). Some studies have examined
   the effects of carotenoids on growth and immune function but little is
   known about their role in behaviour. In this study of the grey
   partridge, we conducted two supplementation experiments: (1) laying
   females were fed with beta-carotene enriched or impoverished diets; (2)
   chicks were fed directly with P-carotene enriched or impoverished diets.
   We then evaluated the effects of this carotenoid on chick growth,
   immunocompetence and anti-predator behaviour (reactions to a raptor
   model). In the first experiment, the P-carotene enriched diet given to
   mothers did not cause any difference in chick physiology. In the second
   experiment, beta-carotene supplementation of chicks had a significant
   beneficial effect on their growth and immune response, although their
   behavioural reactions did not differ in relation to the diet. Therefore,
   P-carotene supplementation had beneficial effects on growth and
   immunocompetence only when directly supplied to chicks. The beneficial
   effect reported in other species for begging or pecking behaviours was
   not confirmed for the anti-predator behaviour of grey partridge chicks.

Abstract = {{The use of tool or tool-like food processing behaviours can render
   animals vulnerable to theft (kleptoparasitism) because (1) large,
   nutritious items are usually involved, (2) value is added to the food
   due to long and/or complex handling, and (3) physical control of items
   is often temporarily lost during handling. In Barbados, Carib grackles
   (Quiscalus lugubris) immersing items in water before consumption (a
   behaviour known as food dunking) lose a larger proportion of items to
   conspecific food thieves than grackles that do not dunk. In this paper,
   we first show that dunking in Carib grackles functions as a proto-tool
   food-processing technique that speeds up ingestion. We then examine five
   potential predictors of kleptoparasitism: only conspecific density and
   loss of physical control on food were found to influence the probability
   that birds would be attacked and successfully robbed of food by
   conspecifics. Grackles could reduce the probability of kleptoparasitism,
   by holding items in the bill while dunking and engaging in head-up
   displays. These behaviours were used flexibly depending on variation in
   the risk of kleptoparasitism. We suggest that costs like the ones
   incurred from theft might limit the profitability and frequency of tool
   and proto-tool food processing behaviours, creating a context where
   counter-strategies might be selected. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{To develop a conceptual understanding of the interaction between

   (Ursus arctos) to experimentally introduced tourism at Douglas River in

   of behavioral changes were measured. GPS collars were deployed to track
   temporal and spatial resource use and scan and focal observations were
   used to quantify foraging efficiency, Vigilance behavior, and bear use
   of various food resources. Total food intake was quantified by combining
   data on food resource use based on GPS locations and foraging efficiency
   was measured using spotting scopes from long distances. Seasonal food
   availability and quality were monitored and utilized as co-variates in

   intake did not differ between pre-treatment and treatment years despite

Abstract = {{Feeding behavior of carnivorous and herbivorous organisms is commonly
   explained in terms of nutritional requirements. However, feeding
   behavior of omnivorous organisms is difficult to predict and may not be
   based on nutritional requirements alone. To assess the plasticity of
   feeding behaviors exhibited by an omnivore, we conducted a feeding
   experiment using juvenile signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniuscidus
   (Dana, 1852)), both alone and in the presence of conspecifics and
   predators. Crayfish were presented with three types of food
   (chironomids, mayflies, and woody debris) in experimental enclosures,
   and the food type consumed and time to consumption were recorded.
   Although the same overall food choice (chironomid larvae) was made in
   all trials, the time it took for the juvenile crayfish to make a food
   selection was longer in the presence of adult conspecifics (both male
   and female) and adult cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii (Richardson,
   1836)). Food selection also took longer, although not significantly, in
   the presence of conspecific juvenile crayfish, and no changes in
   behavior were noted in the presence of young-of-the-year (YOY) cutthroat
   trout. The altered behavior of the juvenile crayfish observed in the
   presence of adult fish and crayfish can lead to context-dependent
   effects of this omnivore on its community. Ecologists must be
   increasingly aware that the feeding of omnivores may not be solely based
   on nutritional criteria.}},

Abstract = {{Larvae of the California newt (Taricha torosa) exhibit striking
   predator-avoidance behavior, escaping to refuges in response to a
   chemical cue from cannibalistic adults. In laboratory flow-tank
   experiments, stream water collected near free-ranging adults induced
   hiding responses in 100\% of the larvae tested. Solutions prepared by
   bathing adults (in field and laboratory) also evoked strong hiding
   behaviors. Insensitive to adult feeding status (fed or starved), and
   clearly not an excretory product, the chemical cue was released from
   adult skin (i.e., in swabs of adult backs, sides, and bellies).
   Tetrodotoxin (TTX) was found in skin swabs of adults and in bathwater at
   1 x 10(-7) mol/L using reversed-phase high-pressure liquid
   chromatography (HPLC). Concentrations of 1 x 10(-7) to 1 x 10(-9) mol/L
   TTX standard, and equivalent dilutions of bathwater, triggered hiding
   behaviors in larvae, with no subsequent sublethal toxicity. The presence
   of TTX-sensitive cells within larval olfactory epithelium was confirmed
   by behavioral experiments and electrophysiological recordings. In
   contrast, larvae did not hide in response to two other, structurally
   mimetic compounds (saxitoxin and mu-conotoxin GIIIB). Ontogenetically,
   larval behavioral responses to TTX and bathwater were strongest during
   weeks 3-5, diminishing to nil during week 7. No longer susceptible to
   adult cannibalism, larval indifference to the cue coincided with their
   ability to climb out of water and onto land.
   Thus, newt larvae escape cannibalism by detecting a poison (TTX) well
   known as a chemical defense for conspecific adults. Eliciting a
   behavioral response in one case and inhibiting neural activity in the
   other, this compound results in opposing physiological effects, with
   avoiding predation as the common goal. Accordingly, TTX joins a select
   group of keystone molecules, each having critical, but different,
   ecological consequences at multiple trophic levels. The unique
   combination of bioactive properties makes a compelling case for
   asymmetrical selection as a force driving the evolution of adult-larval
   trophic interactions.}},

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Stallion castration is one of the most common surgical procedures
   performed on horses. The opening of the abdominal cavity and the work
   with finger thick blood-vessels make this operation liable to frequent
   complications. Regularly, castrations have serious, often deadly
   complications such as: haemorrhage; prolapse of intestine or omentum;
   wound infection; funiculitis and peritonitis. Laparoscopic castration
   leaving the testicles in situ is a less invasive alternative to more
   conventional techniques of castration. However, with large horses and in
   individual cases the laparoscopic method leaves remnants of active
   testicular tissue and has the disadvantage of not completely eliminating
   stallion behaviour. The aim of this study was to evaluate a laparoscopic
   castration technique for smaller stallion breeds with regard to its
   practicability, advantages and disadvantages, complications and
   postoperative behaviour of the stallions. The study involved 15 two year
   old Icelandic stallions and 5 one-year-old stallions of a small horse
   breed. For better visualization within the abdomen the animals were
   starved for a period of 36 hours prior to the operation. All stallions
   were sedated and laparoscopically castrated standing in the stocks. The
   operation was preceded by the establishment of a capnoperitoneum and of
   two transabdominal ports under local anaesthesia: one for the
   laparoscope and one for the instruments. The plica vasculosa including
   the deferent duct was ligated as close as possible to the anulus
   vaginalis by a double Roeder knot. The testicles remained in situ. The
   operated horses underwent a daily check-up within the first week post
   surgery. A final examination took place 6 months after the operation.
   The following parameters were measured: Body temperature before and
   within the first 8 days after the operation; testosterone levels before
   and 8 days after the operation; the size of the testicles before and 6
   months after the operation. Additionally an HCG stimulation test was
   carried out 6 months post surgery in order to identify possible remnants
   of active testicular tissue. There were no major or life threatening
   complications during the castration. Difficulties occurred owing to poor
   visualization because of bleeding from small vessels of the plica
   vasculosa; an insufficient overview because of a full bladder or
   intestines; or through an unintentional loosening of the ligature after
   the ends of the suture were trimmed. In one case a one sided lameness of
   the hind limb was observed but disappeared the following day. All
   incisions healed by primary intention. With practice by the surgeon a
   decrease in average operation time from 153 minutes in the beginning
   down to 50 minutes was observed after 20 operations. The day after the
   operation all patients showed an average increase of body temperature of
   0.63 degrees C. The procedure did not always result in complete
   resorption of testicular tissue. Six months after the castration eight
   cases still had one testicle. In three cases two testicles remained. In
   6 of 18 cases (33\%) the HCG simulation test was positive 6 months after
   the operation indicating incomplete castration With regard to
   complications in wound healing, haemorrhage or intestinal prolapse this
   method of castration appears very safe. A further risk is minimized by
   avoiding general anaesthesia. Furthermore there is a relatively short
   convalescence because there are only small incisions in the abdominal
   wall.
   Disadvantages to this procedure include: the requirement of considerable
   staff and equipment; considerable surgical expetise; the need of an HCG
   simulation test to check the result of the castration. The contractual
   duties accepted with the undertaking of a castration of a healthy
   stallion are firstly to eliminate reproductive ability and secondly to
   prevent reproductive instinct and stallion behaviour. In this regard it
   is critical to note that 4 of the 20 laparoscopically castrated
   stallions still exhibited stallion behaviour and that 6 animals showed a
   positive HCG stimulation test. The described method is to be used only
   after a thorough explanation to the owner. In most cases a castration
   through orchidectomy under general anaesthesia with suturing of the
   processus vaginalis and suturing of the wound will be the better
   alternative in spite of the anaesthetic risk. The result of routine
   surgery is more certain, faster and forensically less contestable.}},

Abstract = {{Animals can find food using information from the food itself or from
   conspecifics that are also looking for food. Social information can be
   actively communicated or based on unavoidable by-products of feeding
   activities. We present three experiments that explore the relative
   importance of odour gradients and social information as Bufo americanus
   tadpoles locate food sources. In the first experiment, tadpoles rapidly
   aggregated at food patches and discriminated between the qualities of
   two food patches spaced 15 cm apart in the field. In a second
   experiment, the initial presence of tadpoles at one food patch enhanced
   aggregation for 1 h, compared to an identical food patch without
   tadpoles spaced 114 cm apart. In a third experiment, the time required
   to initial contact with a single food patch did not change over a
   16-fold range of food concentration, suggesting that B. americanus
   tadpoles have a limited ability to locate food from a distance using
   information from the food itself. Finding food and discriminating food
   patch quality from a distance is probably a major adaptive advantage of
   sociality in B. americanus tadpoles, although the presence or absence of
   active signalling remains to be determined. (c) 2006 The Association for

   abandonment of the energy-flow hypothesis is premature. For a simple
   tritrophic rocky intertidal food chain, we show that the efficiency of
   energy transfer is strongly influenced by predation risk and consumer
   density. Effects tied to predation risk were particularly strong,
   explaining 32\% of the variation in growth efficiency ( compared to 15\%
   for density effects) and reducing it by 44-76\%. Hence, the stress (
   fear of being eaten) that predators impose on prey may be instrumental
   in limiting energy transfer up the food chain and thus contribute to the
   shortening of food chains.}},

Abstract = {{modulating learning and memory. However, little is known about the
   production of corticoids during early development in free-living
   animals, particularly during sensitive periods of acquisition of
   important behaviors. In a four-year study of Belding's ground squirrels,
   Spermophilus beldingi, a non-invasive assay of glucocorticoids was used
   to quantify age and population differences among juveniles from three
   California locations. Fecal-cortisol metabolites are elevated during a
   short period when juveniles first emerge aboveground from their natal
   burrows at about 4 weeks of age. This period of cortisol elevation
   coincides with when young are learning survival behaviors such as
   anti-predator responses and foraging strategies. Population differences
   in juvenile cortisol levels, which may reflect local variation in
   habitat quality and predator environments, were not evident until 2
   weeks after emergence. Elevated cortisol at the age of emergence was
   also observed in juveniles born and reared in captivity without exposure

   discussed, including mobilization of glucose for natal emergence and
   later facilitation of growth and energy storage during the short summer
   before hibernation. In some species, elevated corticoids can also

   renal function that accompanies aging. These processes might be
   exacerbated by programmed changes in vascular structure and function,
   and alterations in endocrine and metabolic homeostasis. Programmed
   effects might be initiated as early as the periconceptual phase of
   development, and could involve epigenetic changes in gene expression or
   altered stem cell allocation. Better understanding of these processes
   could lead to the development of novel diagnostic and preventive
   measures, and to early detection of at-risk individuals. By monitoring
   blood pressure, weight, and renal function in children, it might be
   possible to reduce the risk of cardiovascular and renal disease in later
   life.}},

Abstract = {{The animat approach constitutes an intriguing attempt to study and
   comprehend the behavior of adaptive, learning entities in complex
   environments. Further inspired by the notions of co-evolution and
   evolutionary ``arms races{''}, we have developed Symbiosis, a virtual
   ecosystem that hosts two self-organizing, combating species - preys and
   predators. All animats live and evolve in this shared environment, they
   are self-maintaining and engage in a series of vital activities -
   nutrition, growth, communication - with the ultimate goals of survival
   and reproduction. The main objective of Symbiosis is to study the
   behavior of ecosystem members, especially in terms of the emergent
   learning mechanisms and the effect of co-evolution on the evolved
   behavioral strategies. In this direction, several indicators are used to
   assess individual behavior, with the overall effectiveness metric
   depending strongly on the animats net energy gain and reproduction rate.
   Several experiments have been conducted with the developed simulator
   under various environmental conditions. Overall experimental results
   support our original hypothesis that co-evolution is a driving factor in
   the animat learning procedure.}},

Booktitle = {{ADVANCES IN DECISION ANALYSIS: FROM FOUNDATIONS TO APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2007}},
Pages = {{253-278}},
Abstract = {{The subjective expected utility (SEU) model rests on very strong
   assumptions about the consistency of decision making across a wide range
   of situations. The descriptive validity of these assumptions has been
   extensively challenged by behavioral psychologists during the last few
   decades, and the normative validity of the assumptions has also been
   reappraised by many statisticians, philosophers, and economists,
   motivating the development of more general utility theories and decision
   models. These generalized models are characterized by features such as
   imprecise probabilities, nonlinearly weighted probabilities,
   source-dependent risk attitudes, and state-dependent utilities,
   permitting the pattern of the decision maker's behavior to change with
   the decision context and to perhaps satisfy the usual SEU assumptions
   only locally. Recent research in the emerging field of neuroeconomics
   sheds light on the physiological basis of decision making, the nature of
   preferences and beliefs, and interpersonal differences in decision
   competence. These findings do not necessarily invalidate the use of
   SEU-based decision analysis tools, but they suggest that care needs to
   be taken to structure preferences and to assess beliefs and risk
   attitudes in a manner that is appropriate for the decision and also for
   the decision maker.}},

Abstract = {{Biomedical science has little considered the relevance of life history
   theory and evolutionary and ecological developmental biology to clinical
   medicine. However, the observations that early life influences can alter
   later disease risk-the ``developmental origins of health and disease{''}
   (DOHaD) paradigm-have led to a recognition that these perspectives can
   inform our understanding of human biology. We propose that the DOHaD
   phenomenon can be considered as a subset of the broader processes of
   developmental plasticity by which organisms adapt to their environment
   during their life course. Such adaptive processes allow genotypic
   variation to be preserved through transient environmental changes. Cues
   for plasticity operate particularly during early development; they may
   affect a single organ or system, but generally they induce integrated
   adjustments in the mature phenotype, a process underpinned by epigenetic
   mechanisms and influenced by prediction of the mature environment. In
   mammals, an adverse intrauterine environment results in an integrated
   suite of responses, suggesting the involvement of a few key regulatory
   genes, that resets the developmental trajectory in expectation of poor
   postnatal conditions. Mismatch between the anticipated and the actual
   mature environment exposes the organism to risk of adverse
   consequences-the greater the mismatch, the greater the risk. For humans,
   prediction is inaccurate for many individuals because of changes in the
   postnatal environment toward energy-dense nutrition and low energy
   expenditure, contributing to the epidemic of chronic noncommunicable
   disease. This view of human disease from the perspectives of life
   history biology and evolutionary theory offers new approaches to
   prevention, diagnosis and intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Prey organisms are confronted with time and resource allocation
   trade-offs. Time allocation trade-offs partition time, for example,
   between foraging effort to acquire resources and behavioral defense.
   Resource allocation trade-offs partition the acquired resources between
   multiple traits, such as growth or morphological defense. We develop a
   mathematical model for prey organisms that comprise time and resource
   allocation trade-offs for multiple defense traits. Fitness is determined
   by growth and survival during ontogeny. We determine optimal defense
   strategies for environments that differ in their resource abundance,
   predation risk, and defense effectiveness. We compare the results with
   results of simplified models where single defense traits are optimized.
   Our results indicate that selection acts in favor of integrated traits.
   The selective advantage of expressing multiple defense traits is most
   pronounced at intermediate environmental conditions. Optimizing single
   traits generally leads to a more pronounced response of the defense
   traits, which implies that studying single traits leads to an
   overestimation of their response to predation. Behavioral defense and
   morphological defense compensate for and augment each other depending on
   predator densities and the effectiveness of the defense mechanisms. In
   the presence of time constraints, the model shows peak investment into

Abstract = {{Postnatal manipulation studies involving human handling suggest that
   rats adjust the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system in response
   to environmentally induced variations in maternal behaviour but adverse
   environmental conditions can constrain this potentially adaptive
   mechanism. We studied whether other variations in postnatal maternal
   environment have similar effects on maternal behaviour and the
   offspring's behavioural and HPA responses to stressors. We housed Lister
   hooded dams and their litters in systems made of a nest cage (NC) and an
   exploration cage (EC) connected by a tunnel and varied access to food
   either spatially or temporally until postnatal day 8. Dams recein
   periods each day (IEC-fed dams). Although EC-fed dams spent more time in
   the EC and less time ived food ad libitum in the NC (NC-fed dams) or EC
   (EC-fed dams) or intermittently during nine 30-mat the nest site than
   NC-fed dams, FC-fed dams nursed in longer bouts which may indicate a
   more active nursing style. Intermittent feeding resulted in reduced food
   intake, but did not affect maternal behaviour. Compared to NC-fed
   offspring, EC-fed offspring showed reduced HPA reactivity and
   fearfulness, whereas IEC-fed offspring showed increased HPA reactivity
   compared to EC-fed offspring. These findings support the view that
   moderately challenging maternal environments may down-regulate the

   adverse environmental conditions (e.g. food restriction) may exert
   opposing effects, independent of maternal behaviour. (c) 2006 The

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{215-225}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We studied individual and herd level behavioural responses of elk to
   spatial and temporal variation in the risk of predation by wolves over
   three winters in the Upper Gallatin drainage, Montana, U.S.A. Within a
   given drainage, elk of both sexes moved into or closer to protective
   cover (timber) in response to wolf presence. Cow elk responded to
   elevated risk by increasing vigilance in exchange for foraging, and
   large mixed (cow, calf, spike) herds substantially decreased in size. In
   contrast, when wolves were present, bulls did not increase vigilance
   levels, or decrease feeding, and small bull-only groups slightly
   increased in size. As a consequence, small bull-only herds and large
   mixed-sex herds converged on a similar size when wolves were present. We
   think this response is a balancing of the benefits of risk dilution with
   increased detectability or attractiveness of larger herds to wolves.
   Based on proportions in the population, wolves overselected bulls and
   underselected cows as prey. Thus, bulls showed weaker antipredator
   responses than cows, despite facing a greater risk of predation. Using
   marrow fat content from elk killed by wolves as an indicator of body
   condition, bulls were in significantly worse body condition than cows
   throughout the winter, and condition deteriorated for both sexes as
   winter progressed. Overall, we conclude that antipredator behaviours
   carry substantial foraging costs, that bulls, because of their poorer
   body condition, are less able to pay these costs than cows, and that
   differences in ability to pay foraging costs probably explain
   sex-specific differences in antipredator behaviours. (c) 2006 The

Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{Recent food scares have increased consumer concern about meat safety.
   However, the Greek `traditional' meat supply chain from producers to
   local butchers does not seem to realise the pressing consumer demand for
   certified meat quality. Or is it that, in such food chains, this demand
   is not so pressing yet? The present paper seeks to answer this question
   based on a survey conducted in the Athens area, involving a sample of
   268 participants responsible for food purchasing decisions. The survey
   mainly aims to develop an integrated model of factors that affect
   consumer-perceived meat quality and to develop the profile of different
   consumer segments in relation to these perceptions. The substantial
   findings of the survey include the fact that, despite their enormous per
   capita consumption, the majority of consumers are not particularly
   involved in the meat-purchasing process. Rather they attach importance
   to visual intrinsic quality cues evaluated in a pre-purchasing context.
   In this respect, intrinsic quality cues are assigned a role similar to
   that of quality certification; coupled with the choice of traditional
   channels and the resulting personal relation with the butcher, they can
   be understood as efforts to decrease risk of the purchasing decision.
   Moreover, consumers with such behaviour seem to relate domestic country
   of origin of meat mostly with perceptions of general safety. Finally, a
   small, but promising trend with substantial marketing implications of
   frequent purchases of chicken and pork at supermarkets should not be
   ignored. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance and behaviour of mammalian prey species such as the
   European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are known to be regulated by the
   availability of both food for maintenance and reproduction and shelter
   for protection against predators and harsh weather. However, the effect
   of vegetation structure and temporal variations in food availability on
   habitat selection and spatial behaviour are still poorly understood. The
   present study investigated the relationship between rabbit spatial
   ecology and vegetation structure and food quality and quantity in three
   neighbouring areas in SW Spain that differed in the distribution and
   amount of refuge sites and food patches. In all, 35 rabbits were
   radiotracked in the three study areas and home range and core area sizes
   in different seasons and at different times of the day estimated.
   Spatial behaviour was then compared with parameters of vegetation cover
   and food quantity and quality. Lastly, rabbit habitat selection at two
   Levels was studied: home range selection and selection within home
   ranges. Home range size varied from one study area and season to
   another, but was not dependent on either sex or the availability or
   quality of food. We suggest that differences in home range size between
   study areas respond to differences in vegetation cover, with smaller
   home ranges in areas with higher proportion of sheltering vegetation. It
   was found that habitat selection patterns varied between the three areas
   in terms of the need for rabbits to exploit to a maximum the scarcest
   resource in each situation, thereby optimising access to both feeding
   and refuge patches. This pattern was manifest at the home range level of
   habitat selection but not at the level of selection within home ranges.
   Findings were consistent with the high behavioural plasticity of the
   European rabbit in its native habitats and provide useful information

Pages = {{464-474}},
Abstract = {{Ecological conditions and food quality have influence on age and size at
   metamorphosis of organisms with complex life cycles. However, little is
   known about the foraging behaviour and how diet choice is influenced by
   the ecological conditions. The present study poses two major questions:
   (1) how do different diets (high protein, low protein and both diets
   together) influence larval performance, and (2) how does diet choice
   change with ecological conditions (interference competition, predation
   and pond drying)? To address the second question, we offered both types
   of food to tadpoles under the different circumstances. We measured food
   consumption of the two food types, along with the growth rate and
   developmental stage of tadpoles. We expected that under unfavourable
   growth conditions, larvae would select high-protein food, which would
   promote development and allow individuals to escape these high-risk
   environments. High-protein food promotes development, but results in
   smaller tadpoles, whereas low-protein food promotes growth with slower
   development. The mixture of the two is better only in terms of growth
   rate. Our study of tadpoles showed that diet selection may not be
   constant but can vary depending on the ecological context in predictable
   ways. When exposed to interference competition and drying ponds,
   tadpoles fed on food that enhanced development, whereas in the control
   group and in predation treatments, they fed selectively on food that
   favoured growth. Our data indicate that diet selection by tadpoles may
   confer adaptive responses to ecological changes. Such
   selection/responses would increase growth, development, and survival.

Abstract = {{Purpose of review The aim of this review is to highlight the traditional
   and newly recognized suicide risk factors in patients with mood
   disorders.
   Recent findings Current research findings clearly suggest that suicidal
   behaviour in patients with mood disorder is a `state-dependent'
   phenomenon. Recently, there is, however, a growing body of evidence that
   besides the well accepted clinically explorable suicide risk factors in
   mood disorders (e.g., severe depression, prior suicide attempt, comorbid
   anxiety, substance use, personality disorders and so on), mixed state of
   depression could also be an important precursor of suicidal behaviour.
   This might be particularly true in unrecognized cases of bipolar
   depressives, when antidepressant monotherapy (unprotected by mood
   stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics) can worsen the clinical picture
   and rarely induce an aggressive or self-destructive behaviour.
   Summary In the majority of patients with mood disorders, suicidal
   behaviour is predictable and preventable, with a good chance. A careful
   and systematic exploration of suicide risk factors in patients with mood
   disorder helps clinicians to identify patients at high suicide risk. A
   successful, acute and long-term treatment of these patients
   substantially reduces the suicidal behaviour even in this high-risk

Abstract = {{Stone's sheep (Ovis dalli stonei) are susceptible to anthropogenic
   disturbances, but few data have been available to help minimize impacts.
   We used the movements of individuals to define use and availability, and
   resource-selection functions (RSF) and the information-theoretic
   approach to examine seasonal habitat selection and interannual variation
   in selection of attributes by groups of Stone's sheep. Movement rates of
   Stone's sheep followed consistent yearly patterns, with highest rates
   occurring in summer and fall. Models that contained vegetation,
   topography, and risk of predation best explained resource selection.
   Topographic features ranked better, however, than components of
   vegetation or risk of predation from grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and
   wolves (Canis lupus) at explaining habitat selection. Selection
   strategies were variable among groups of Stone's sheep and between years
   within groups even though consistencies in selection for steep slopes,
   ridge-like topography, south aspects, and upper elevations were common.
   This research provides the first comprehensive analysis of habitat
   selection by Stone's sheep, which show strong fidelity to seasonal
   ranges but also exhibit behavioural plasticity in selection of
   attributes within those ranges.}},

Abstract = {{Events in early life are associated with changes in the risk of disease
   in later life. There is increasing evidence that these associations are
   mediated by permanent transcriptional changes in metabolic pathways, in
   some cases linked to epigenetic alterations. We have proposed that this
   phenomenon of `developmental induction' is not a manifestation of
   pathophysiological processes but rather represents the consequence of
   developmental decisions made during fetal and early postnatal life to
   maximize subsequent fitness. However, this fitness advantage is lost if
   the early and later environments are mismatched. Rats undernourished in
   utero by maternal underfeeding develop features of the metabolic
   syndrome, especially if fed on a high-fat diet, but transient neonatal
   treatment with leptin reverses induction of this adverse metabolic
   phenotype. This observation demonstrates that developmental programming
   is reversible and provides strong support for the match-mismatch or
   predictive model for the origins of developmental programming. Copyright

Title = {{Relationship between stopover site choice of migrating sandpipers, their

Journal = {{ISRAEL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{245-261}},
Abstract = {{Measures of animal behavior can be used in a variety of situations to
   make inferences about the environment and population status. Work by our
   research group shows that migratory shorebirds adjust their usage of,
   and behavior at, stopover sites in response to environmental conditions.
   Motivated by this, we built an individual-based model of migrating
   shorebirds moving through a sequence of alternating small and large
   stopover sites. Birds at larger sites are safer from predators, but we
   assumed that less food is available than at small sites. In the model,
   both predation risk and food intake are density-dependent, and the
   behavior of migrants is controlled by two rules: one that determines
   whether a bird will depart a stopover site, and one that controls the
   individual's foraging versus vigilance intensity. The optimal behavior
   is calculated by maximizing a payoff function that depends on arrival
   date and arrival energy stores at the final site. We used this model to
   predict mass gain, foraging intensity, and usage by migrants of small
   and large sites under various conditions. We examined the effects of a
   flyway-wide reduction in the amount of food, a flyway-wide increase in
   predation danger, and the effects of lowering the overall population
   size. The mass action of many individuals, each optimizing its migration
   timing and routing, leads to the emergence of distinctive patterns of
   behavior and site choice under these differing environmental conditions.
   When food availability is reduced throughout the flyway, Our model
   predicts that foraging intensity increases at every stopover site,
   thereby forcing birds to accept greater danger to maintain the fitness
   benefit of a timely arrival to the breeding area. A flyway-wide increase
   in predation danger results in fewer migrants choosing (and/or migrants
   staying a shorter time at) small stopover sites, balanced by a higher
   usage of large sites. These effects contrast with what is observed under
   true population declines, when the usage of both small and large sites
   declines.}},

Abstract = {{People with serious mental illnesses have higher rates of morbidity and
   premature mortality compared with the general population. This
   population loses from 13 to over 20 years of life compared with their
   nonpsychiatric cohorts. A multitude of factors contribute to this silent
   tragedy. A major problem is that multiple barriers exist, making it
   difficult for individuals with serious mental illness to access quality
   health care. Additionally, compared with the average American, people
   with serious mental illness are more likely to engage in unhealthy
   lifestyle practices, such as lack of regular physical activity, poor
   nutrition and overeating, smoking and other substance abuse, irregular
   and inadequate steep, and failure to visit health care practitioners
   regularly. These unhealthy behaviors and the added burden of
   antipsychotic medication side effects increase the risk for cardiac and
   metabolic diseases. However, best-practice models exist that provide the
   knowledge and tools to assist people with serious mental illness in
   making informed decisions about healthier lifestyle behaviors, including
   addressing tobacco use and excess weight. The challenge is how to
   integrate these practices effectively into routine behavioral health
   care. The growing problem of premature death calls for urgent public
   action to transform the current mental health care system into a more
   integrated system of care. Because of their holistic training and
   approach to care, nurses are well prepared to work collaboratively with
   both mental and physical health care providers and systems. In the new
   mental health care system, both psychiatric and physical health care
   providers will need to broaden their treatment paradigm to address the
   whole person. An integral part of behavioral health services will be to
   ensure that the health status of all individuals is assessed, that there
   are medical monitoring protocols in place for people taking
   antipsychotic medication, that each individual has a primary care
   provider, and that there is an effective mechanism in place for
   communication between behavioral health and primary care providers. A
   transformation of the existing mental health care system toward a system
   that utilizes a coordinated, multi-disciplinary, holistic approach not
   only may effectively bridge the existing gap between mental and physical
   health, but also may ultimately save lives.}},

Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{Some water fleas Daphnia change their head morphology to reduce
   predation risk in response to chemical substances (kairomones) released
   from larvae of the invertebrate predator Chaoborus (Insecta: Diptera).
   We tested for evidence of the costs associated with elongation of the
   head spine in Daphnia galeata and the consequences of these costs on the
   inducibility of head spine elongation in predictable and unpredictable
   environments. We exposed D. galeata in outdoor experimental ponds to
   conditions under which predation pressure by Chaoborus larvae and the
   concentration of kairomones from this predator were controlled for about
   70 days. In the laboratory, we then used Daphnia clones collected from
   the outdoor ponds to investigate the inducibility of head spine
   formation in response to Chaoborus kairomones.
   The inducibility of head spine formation increased in D. galeata from
   the ponds that had contained both predators and kairomones, whereas in
   water fleas from the ponds containing only kairomones the plasticity
   (inducibility) of head spine formation decreased compared with that in
   the control ponds. These results suggest that the production of a
   defensive head spine, its phenotypic plasticity, or both entail some
   costs. Contrary to our predictions, exposure to Chaoborus kairomones in
   the laboratory resulted in head lengths that were not significantly
   different among any of the clones from the three outdoor treatments.
   We found no evidence for costs associated with head spine elongation in
   terms of fecundity, time to maturity, or intrinsic rate of natural
   population increase. Average within-clone partial correlations
   calculated for head length and intrinsic rate of natural population
   increase, corrected for body length, were not significantly negative,
   indicating no cost of defence. This was probably because food conditions
   in the laboratory were so good that the costs of defence could not be
   detected. Furthermore, community-level changes, such as changes in food
   conditions caused by manipulation of the predation regime in the outdoor
   ponds, might have worked as selection pressures and confounded the
   results.}},

Abstract = {{The use of bright coloration to warn predators of toxic prey, termed
   aposematism, is a defensive strategy well studied in terrestrial
   ecosystems. Some marine animals have contrasting color patterns and
   chemical defenses but few studies have tested the behavior of marine
   predators in response to aposematic coloration. In this study we tested
   fish feeding behavior in response to different types of cues including
   contrasting color patterns and sponge and nudibranch chemical extracts
   in the field at 2 reefs on Guam. Using agar-based food to keep food
   quality consistent, chemical extracts and 2 out of 5 contrasting color
   patterns reduced feeding by natural assemblages of reef fish at both
   reefs. Phyllidia varicosa (from Palau), P. elegans (Guam) and
   Phyllidiella pustulosa (Palau) crude extracts deterred feeding by fish,
   but P. pustulosa extracts from Guam did not. To determine if a chemical
   extract can act as an olfactory defense we videotaped fish behavior as
   they approached food containing nonpolar extracts of Acanthella
   cavernosa, the dietary sponge of Phyllidiella granulatus. Fish
   approached and then tasted the food with the chemical extract
   significantly less often than the control and the crude extract of
   another sponge Stylissa massa. In feeding assays with a contrasting
   color pattern combined with the chemical extract at natural

   feeding. Reef fish can use multimodal signa Is including visual, taste

Title = {{Schizophrenia and phenotypic plasticity: Schizophrenia may represent a

   allows both bioenergetic thrift and a defensive behavioral strategy}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL HYPOTHESES}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{69}},

Pages = {{383-394}},
Abstract = {{It is well recognized that investigation into the relationship between
   early life programming and subsequent neurological disorders may have
   powerful implications for understanding the human vulnerability to
   psychopathology. The present article will propose that schizophrenia may
   be adaptively programmed by early environmental adversity permitting
   physiological and behavioral characteristics that would have created a
   fitness advantage in the ancestral environment under conditions of
   nutritional scarcity and severe environmental stress. This proposition
   will be analyzed in terms of phenotypic plasticity theory which explains
   how and why specific environmental stressors can alter normal gene
   expression resulting in an alternative phenotype that is better suited
   for an adverse environment. The primary neurophysiological symptoms of
   schizophrenia can be induced in animals through exposure to prenatal and
   postnatal stressors, and that schizophrenia itself is known to be
   associated with exposure to stress during development, supports the view
   that the ``disorder{''} may represent a predictive, adaptive response to
   adversity. In fact, maternal malnutrition, maternal stress, multiparity,
   short birth interval and stress provoking postnatal events are well
   recognized epidemiological risk factors for schizophrenia that may
   represent cues for the initiation of epigenetic programming.
   Behavioral and physiological characteristics of schizophrenia will be
   analyzed and interpreted as protective in the context of environmental
   hardship. For instance, the hypometabotic areas of the schizophrenic
   brain - the hippocampus and the frontal lobes - are the same areas that
   are known to become adaptively hypometabolic in response to starvation,
   stress and variations in ecological rigor in birds and mammals.
   Individuals with schizophrenia are also highly genetically inclined to
   develop the metabolic syndrome, which is widely thought to allow
   developmentally deprived mammals to conserve energy under poor
   circumstances. It is well known that schizophrenia features an
   up-regulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and an exaggerated
   stress response - both alterations thought to represent predictive,
   adaptive responses to stress in mammals - which may have increased
   attentiveness to the environment and created a defensive,
   vigilance-based behavioral strategy. The habituation deficits
   characteristic of schizophrenia - which can be induced in other mammals
   through stress - may represent a cognitive strategy that alerts the
   organism to salient, potentially informative stimuli and that permits it
   to be more impulsive and vigilant. Inability to calm instinctual drives,
   ignore arousing stimuli, and inhibit transient desires are all core
   characteristics of the disorder, which predict social and vocational
   disabilities in modern times, but may have amounted to a robust, selfish
   strategy in prehistoric times. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{The crisis of the female self in fin de siecle Austrian women writers'
   narratives}},
Journal = {{MODERN AUSTRIAN LITERATURE}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1+}},
Abstract = {{The crisis of identity and its consequence, the fragmentation of the
   self, were major themes explored by fin de siecle Austrian writers.
   Inspired in particular by Nietzsche (the loss of transcendence), Freud
   (the splitting of the ego into its conscious and subconscious parts),
   and Ernst Mach (with his statement that ``The Ego must be given up,{''}
   ({''}das Ich ist unrettbar{''}), the ``joyous apocalypse{''} of the
   Habsburg Empire was reflected in its literature as the loss of a unified
   self on the one hand, and the longing for wholeness on the other.
   Gotthart Wunberg has pointed out the following characteristics of
   Austrian fin de siecle modernity in literature: a consciousness of the
   lack of unity and disparity in the world determined by historical
   discontinuity, and a dissociation of the personality, a ``relativity of
   values,{''} and a ``lack of qualities{''} (104). He cites Hugo von
   Hofmannsthal, Robert Musil, and Hermann Broch as the principal authors
   whose works embody these characteristics. One could certainly add Arthur
   Schnitzler to this list, in particular his novella Leutnant Gustl
   (1900), often referred to as the first narrative in the German literary
   context to use the stream-of-consciousness technique.
   Whereas much has been written on the topic of the crisis of the self in
   relation to male authors such as those mentioned above, along with
   others included in the literary canon, thus defining this crisis as
   male-centered, the numerous turn-of-the-century women writers have been
   ignored by the writers of literary history and have been only recently
   rediscovered by feminist scholars. One reason for this omission, cited
   by Livia Wittman, may be that many fictional texts written by women of
   this period do not apply any new literary techniques, but rather ``seem
   to fit into the mold of `classic realism' with its illusion of language
   as medium of communication between narrator and reader, with its
   hierarchy of discourses, and with its necessary closure{''} (49). Such
   narratives construct a unified subject, a position adopted by several
   authors of the turn of the century, some of whom were also active
   members of the women's movement, such as Irma von Troll Borostydni in
   her novellas ``Hohenluft{''} (1907) and Stutzen der Moral{''} (1900),
   and Grete Meisel-Hess in her novel Fanny Roth (1902).(1) The
   construction of a strong and whole female subject in these narratives
   reflects a position that parallels the contemporaneous women's movement
   in its ``attempt to gain entry into the dominant discourses, be it in
   law, higher education, professional work, sexual autonomy, artistic
   achievement{''} (Wittman 52)all areas from which women had been excluded
   or in which they had been marginalized, at best, for centuries.
   However, there are narratives written by women in which we can also
   observe a deconstruction of the concept of the unified subject, a
   position that corresponds to the modernity paradigm of the crisis of the
   self. From the vast corpus of fin de siele women's literature (see
   Schmid-Bortenschlager and Bubenicek), three narratives in particular
   demonstrate this crisis of the female self. Eine fur viele: Aus dem
   Tagebuche eines Madchens, by Vera; ``Venus am Kreuz,{''} by Else
   Kotanyi; and Tagebuch-blatter einer Emanzipierten, by Elsa Asenijeff In
   the latter, Brigitte Spreitzer recognizes as part of the crisis of the
   self elements such as hypersensitivity, cultural pessimism, and a desire
   for death, and links these elements to the mainstream style of
   turn-of-the-century Viennese modernity, in particular that of Jung-Wien
   (Texturen 74-75). I will argue that these very same elements are just as
   present in Kotanyi and Vera. Moreover, all three narratives use the same
   literary form, the (fictional) diary, which allows the inclusion of a
   more subjective element in which ``spontaneity and reflection do not
   exclude each other{''} (Weigel 66). In all three narratives the
   splitting of the self is thus told by a first-person narrator.
   There is an important difference between the crisis of the female self
   in these narratives and the crisis of the male self in contemporaneous
   canonical texts. The male protagonists, such as Hofmannsthal's Lord
   Chandos, Schnitzler's Gustl, or, somewhat later, Musil's Ulrich,
   experience a loss of unity as the consequence of their estrangement from
   social values and concepts that, for them, have lost their validity
   (such as, for Chandos, the power of linguistic referentiality or, for
   Gustl, the codes of ethical conduct). Moreover, particularly in the case
   of Musil's Ulrich and his ``Urlaub von seinem Leben{''} (47), such
   estrangement implies a conscious choice to distance himself from roles
   defined by a society that he cannot identify with anymore and that he
   can only partake in as an observer. In addition, Ulrich can rely on the
   appropriation and objectification of the feminine via the women in his
   life, particularly his sister Agathe.(2) In the three selected texts by
   Vera, Kotanyi, and Asenijeff, the female protagonists do not have such
   choices, nor can they count on any help from men to solve their identity
   crisis-if anything, quite the contrary. They struggle with the roles
   imposed upon them, roles that are directly connected to their
   femaleness. Their gradual fragmentation is a result of patriarchal
   constrictions imposed on female creativity, sexuality, and desire,
   and/or of male sexual violence. In these texts the crisis of the female
   self is thus defined in more specific, gendered terms than the crisis of
   the male self in the canonical texts.
   In my analysis I will be adopting theoretical concepts from Jessica
   Benjamin and Jacques Lacan, both of whom come from the field of
   psychoanalysis, which is particularly focused on questions of the self
   and identity formation. From Benjamin various prestigious literary
   papers and giving lectures. She also became involved in anti-war groups
   and experimented with texts for the cinema. Following her breakup with
   Klinger (who then married a much younger model), she entered into a long
   legal battle with him, interrupted by the war, for financial support. In
   1921 she was declared mentally unstable and deprived of her rights.
   Three years later, neglected and malnourished, she was forcibly
   hospitalized in the psychiatric clinic of the University of Leipzig. She
   was subsequently put into different institutions, always against her
   vehement protests. She died in 1941 in Braunsdorf near Freiberg.
   10. Viriphobia, the hatred of men, is a term created by David D. Gilmore
   in Misogyny: The Male Malady (2001). On viriphobia and its relationship
   to other fin de siecle discourses, see Schwartz, ``Austrian Fin de
   siecle Gender Heteroglossia.{''}
   11. Asenijeff makes such a connection in other narratives, such as her
   short story ``Daseinselend{''} (1896).
   12. I discuss this in more detail in the article mentioned in note 10.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - In order to study its cure response and to understand its
   kinetic behaviour, this paper seeks to examine how a multifunctional

   N,4-bis(4-(bis(2-oxiranylmethyl)amino)-2-chlorobenzyl)-3-chloro-N-(2-oxi
   ranylmethyl)benzenamine (BCCOMB), synthesised from amine functional
   chloroaniline formaldehyde condensate (AFCFC) and epichlorohydrine, is
   cured with AFCFC as curing agent.
   Design/methodology/approach - For effective curing, AFCFC (12.5 phr,
   part per 100 resin) was added to BCCOMB resin and mixed thoroughly for
   15 minutes. The clear viscous solution was then subjected to DSC
   analyses for kinetics study of the curing reaction.
   Findings - The AFCFC was successfully utilised as curing agents for
   BCCOMB as the DSC curves show complete curing exotherm. The presence of
   oxirane group in the BCCOMB was able to react with active hydrogen atoms
   of amine. This led to conversion of liquid monomers of thermoset resin
   into three-dimensional network.
   Research limitations/implications - in the present discussion, the
   curing study of BCCOMB had been done using AFCFC as a curing agent.
   However, other curing agents, synthesised from other amine and aldehyde,
   could also be used to see whether they would be effective for curing
   study of BCCOMB.
   Originality/value - The method for curing study of multifunctional epoxy
   resin (BCCOMB) was novel and the cured epoxy network could find numerous
   applications as surface coating and adhesive on to an intricate
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the isolation of placental folate receptors 25 y ago and
   progress in defining the mechanism of folate delivery, considerable gaps
   remain in the literature for each level of the maternal-placental-fetal
   unit. Although a critical role of placental folate receptors in
   maternal-to-fetal folate transport was shown by use of the isolated
   perfused-placental cotyledon model a decade ago, in vivo confirmation is
   still needed. Knockout of folate receptors in mice, and knockdown of
   folate receptors by delivery of antisense oligonucleotides at gestation
   day 8 or antibodies to folate receptor, results in profound
   developmental abnormalities in the fetus, ranging from neural tube
   defects to neurocristopathics such as cleft-lip and cleft-palate,
   cardiac septal defects, and eye defects. These abnormalities can be
   prevented by ensuring the entry of folate into cells via alternative
   pathways. Controlled dietary folate restriction studies also identified
   adverse effects on reproductive performance, implantation, and fetal
   growth and other subtler (microscopic) defects in murine fetal
   development. Longitudinal follow-up showed that gestational folate
   deficiency results in behavioral changes-an anxiety phenotype-during
   adulthood in these mice, which supports the Barker hypothesis. The
   extent to which these findings are relevant to humans is unclear,
   however. Nevertheless, the high incidence of neural tube defects among
   North Indian women, who chronically subsist on one-third to one-half of
   the optimum folate needed to prevent birth defects, underscores the
   magnitude of the public health problem and emphasizes the urgent
   challenge to define the most efficient way to ensure adequate dietary
   folate for hundreds of millions of such women at risk in developing
   countries.}},

Title = {{Aggressive females seize central positions and show increased vigilance

Volume = {{73}},

Abstract = {{Decreased risk of predation is a key benefit of group living, and
   selfish herd theory predicts competition for the relative safety of
   central positions. Spatial position also affects behaviour, as
   individuals trade-off their feeding and vigilance to mitigate the risk
   of predation. Female eiders, Somateria mollissima, often pool their
   broods and share brood rearing, and anti-predatory vigilance is a core
   parental care activity. Females are assumed to trade-off vigilance and
   feeding, as efficient recovery of condition is crucial for energetically
   stressed postincubating females. Evidence shows that a female's own
   ducklings are closer to her than unrelated young in amalgamated broods
   and that predation of ducklings by gulls is edge biased, so a female's
   spatial position should correlate with the survival prospects of her
   brood. We identified determinants of female spatial position
   (aggression, structural size, body weight, age, clutch size) within
   multifemale brood-rearing coalitions, and explored whether spatial
   position affected female activities. Female aggression frequency was the
   only significant predictor of centrality in brood-rearing coalitions,
   and female age was positively associated with aggression. Investment in
   vigilance, but not investment in feeding, increased with spatial
   centrality; instead, central females devoted less time to other
   activities (resting, preening and moving). We conclude that central
   eider females do not need to trade-off vigilance and feeding. Heavy body
   weight did not guarantee a favourable position in brood-rearing
   coalitions, which may help explain our previous finding that female
   eiders in best body condition when their brood hatches tend their brood
   alone. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

Abstract = {{Nuptial feeding can evolve as sensory traps where the male exploits the
   female's foraging motivation in a sexual context. The nuptial prey gift
   of the nursery-web spider Pisaura mirabilis is wrapped in white silk,
   and it has been suggested that males initially exploit the maternal care
   instinct by producing a nuptial gift that resembles the female's eggsac.
   In mating experiments we examined whether males exploit the female's
   foraging motivation or the female's maternal care instinct. We carried
   out a gift-switching experiment, where males presented an eggsac, a
   wrapped fly or an unwrapped fly as nuptial gifts. Females fed on eggsacs
   as well as on prey gifts. Mating success was similar for males with both
   wrapped and unwrapped gifts, indicating that wrapping per se does not
   increase male mating success. In a food manipulation experiment, we
   investigated the effect of the female's hunger level on male mating
   success. Hungry females were more likely to accept a gift and copulate;
   hence the female's hunger state is decisive for male mating success. Our
   results strongly suggest that the female's foraging motivation is the
   true context for the maintenance of the nuptial gift. (c) 2006 The

Abstract = {{Environmental enrichment programs provide benefits to both captive
   animals and the facilities that house them, but cost time and resources
   to design, implement, and maintain. As yet, there have been few
   theoretically based guidelines to assist animal care staff in
   establishing cost-efficient enrichment methods that both elicit the
   desired behavioral changes and maintain their success over time. We
   describe several well-studied principles from the field of experimental
   analysis of behavior, including intrinsic reinforcement, extrinsic
   reinforcement, habituation, extinction, and schedules of reinforcement
   that could be very useful for evaluating the short- and long-term
   effectiveness of enrichment. We use this theoretical framework to
   generate testable hypotheses and provide examples of enrichment studies
   relevant to our predictions. In particular, we suggest that enrichment
   devices that offer extrinsic reinforcement (food, social access, etc. as
   a result of performing behaviors) should produce greater and more
   prolonged changes in behavior than devices that rely on the behavior
   itself being reinforcing to the animal. For techniques that provide no
   extrinsic reinforcement, using stimuli that are novel, are more
   different from the environment, have been withheld or altered in some
   way, or are presented less frequently may help reduce habituation. For
   techniques that provide extrinsic reinforcement, making reinforcement
   more difficult to obtain and providing more or higher quality
   reinforcers may increase the long-term success of the enrichment
   program. In addition, enrichment may be more effective if animal care
   staff avoid continuously reinforcing behaviors after they are
   established, enriching immediately after feeding, and exposing animals
   to enrichment when reinforcement is no longer available. While the
   current enrichment literature supports the application of behavior
   analytic theory, empirical evaluation of many of our predictions is
   still needed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many similarities exist between the overconsumption of food, which

   the effects of anorectic drugs on responding maintained by high
   incentive, but nutritionally unnecessary, food reinforcers using an Fl
   15(fixed-ratio 10:S) schedule of reinforcement, similar to that used in
   studies on the incentive properties of drugs of abuse. Rats were trained
   to respond on a lever to gain access to two high incentive foods -
   chocolate chip cookies and cheese. Under the Fl 15(FR 10:S) schedule,
   every 10th response (fixed-ratio 10) delivered a tone and light
   conditioned stimulus. The first ratio completed 15 min after the start
   of the session produced the conditioned stimulus and opened a door to
   give access to a piece of cookie. After 5 min to consume the high
   incentive food, a second 15-min interval was started, terminating in
   access to a second reinforcer, cheese. Once trained, the rats were given
   free access to laboratory chow in the home cage. They continued to work
   for the high incentive foods for a period of over 1 year, showing a
   pattern of responding appropriate to an FI(fixed-ratio) schedule.
   Naloxone (1.0 mg/kg), fenfluramine (1 and 2 mg/kg), D-amphetamine (0.25

   responding, especially in the second interval. In contrast, complete
   removal of the high incentive food from the test procedure did not
   immediately reduce the rate of responding, tending to increase it in the
   second of the intervals. Apparently, the drugs did not reduce responding
   by reducing the experienced magnitude of the high incentive food, but
   more probably by reducing the animals' motivation. Behavioural

Abstract = {{That there is a heritable or familial component of susceptibility to

Abstract = {{We analyzed whether habitat deterioration due to ski slopes affected
   lizards' behavior, and whether these changes in behavior had
   consequences for the body condition and health state of lizards. Results
   suggested that habitat deterioration in ski slopes not only implied a
   loss of optimal habitat for lizards, but also led to an increase in
   perceived risk of predation. Males seemed to adjust their movement
   patterns to differences in risk, increasing their movement speed during
   their displacements across risky areas within ski slopes, but as a
   consequence, they incurred loss of body condition. A laboratory
   experiment supported that fleeing at high speeds in areas without
   refuges can be a factor responsible for reduced body condition. However,
   changes in body condition did not affect sprint speed of lizards. Our
   study provides new evidence that behavioral strategies to cope with
   increased predation risk, due to human-induced habitat deterioration,
   may affect body condition of lizards. Our results have applications for
   the design of conservation plans for this endangered lizard species.
   Environmental impact studies should be performed before opening new ski
   slopes, but taking into account not only the presence of lizards but
   also their body condition. An effective way to decrease the effects of

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Psychological correlates of obesity remain under controversy. As eating
   behaviors and dieting history have been previously related to obesity
   status, these dietary variables may contribute to identify overweight
   and obese individuals who are at higher risk of having an impaired
   psychological well-being.
   Objective: The main purpose of this cross-sectional study was to verify
   the hypothesis of a relationship between weight status and psychological
   well-being, and to examine whether cognitive dietary restraint,
   disinhibition, susceptibility to hunger and dieting history could be
   related to psychological well-being
   Design and subjects: In a sample of 101 postmenopausal women, we
   performed anthropometric measurements (weight, height and body mass
   index (BMI)), and measured psychological well-being (PER Questionnaire).
   The Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) and a questionnaire about
   dieting history (dieters: had already been on a diet; non-dieters: had
   never been on a diet) were also administrated.
   Results: A trend for a significant relationship was observed between BMI
   and psychological well-being (r = - 17; P = 0.08). Significant negative
   relationships were observed for disinhibition, susceptibility to hunger
   and all their subscales with psychological well-being (- 0.28 <= r <= -
   0.48), whereas no significant differences in psychological well-being
   were observed between dieters and non-dieters. Finally, women displaying
   a higher score for habitual susceptibility to disinhibition (which is
   the subscale of TFEQ that was the most closely related to psychological
   well-being) had a lower level of psychological well-being, regardless of
   their weight status.
   Conclusion: These results show that, as well as being related to weight
   status, TFEQ-factors are also related to psychological well-being. More
   specifically, individuals who display higher levels of disinhibition may
   be at higher risk of having an impaired psychological well-being.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Decades of research have produced substantial data on elk (Cervus
   elapbus) diets in winter, when foraging conditions are most likely to
   affect population dynamics. Using data from 72 studies conducted in
   western North America between 1938 and 2002, we collated data on elk
   diets and environmental variables. We used these data to quantify diet
   selection by elk and to test whether variation in elk diets is
   associated with habitat type, winter severity, period of winter, human
   hunting, and study method. Graminoids (grasses and grass-like plants
   such as sedges) dominated elk diets and consistently occurred at a
   higher proportion in the diet than in elk foraging habitats, indicating
   preference. Forbs commonly made up <= 5\% of the diet, with no evidence
   for preference; we conclude that forb use is largely incidental to
   grazing for graminoids. Browse was consumed in proportion to its
   availability, implying that the amount of browse in the diet was
   primarily determined by habitat use rather than selection. Comparing the
   diets of elk and sympatric ruminants, elk consistently selected
   graminoids more strongly than sympatric ruminants with the exception of
   bison (Bison bison), suggesting that elk are not environmentally forced
   to adopt the graminoid-biased diet that they normally select. The
   proportion of open meadows and grasslands on winter ranges was strongly
   and positively associated with graminoid consumption by elk. The
   proportion of graminoids in the diet was significantly lower in elk
   experiencing severe winter conditions or predation risk from human
   hunting. The period of winter (early, middle, and late) had only small
   effects on elk diets, as did the method by which the diet was
   determined. Overall, variation in elk diets is well-explained by a
   consistent tendency to select graminoids if available, modified by
   winter habitat type, predation risk, and winter severity, which can
   constrain habitat selection and access to grazing opportunities. To
   fully understand variation in foraging behavior, biologists should
   recognize these broad patterns when interpreting resource selection
   data. Managers should recognize that inconspicuous behavioral responses
   to environmental stimuli can alter the diet in ways that probably carry
   nutritional consequences.}},

Abstract = {{The brain takes a primary position in the organism. We present the novel
   view that the brain gives priority to controlling its own adenosine
   triphosphate (ATP) concentration. It fulfils this tenet by orchestrating
   metabolism in the organism. The brain activates an energy-on-request
   system that directly couples cerebral supply with cerebral need. The
   request system is hierarchically organized among the cerebral
   hemispheres, the hypothalamus, and peripheral somatomotor,
   autonomic-visceromotor, and the neuroendocrine-secretomotor neurons. The
   system initiates allocative behavior (i.e. allocation of energy from
   body to brain), ingestive behavior (intake of energy from the immediate
   environment), or exploratory behavior (foraging in the distant
   environment). Cerebral projections coordinate all three behavioral
   strategies in such a way that the brain's energy supply is guaranteed
   continuously. In an ongoing learning process, the brain's request system
   adapts to various environmental conditions and stressful challenges.
   Disruption of a cerebral energy-request pathway is critical to the
   development of obesity: if the brain fails to receive sufficient energy
   from the peripheral body, it compensates for the undersupply by
   increasing energy intake from the immediate environment, leaving the
   body with a surplus. Obesity develops in the long term. (c) 2007

Abstract = {{Some animals give specific calls when they discover food or detect a
   particular type of predator. Companions respond with food-searching
   behaviour or by adopting appropriate escape responses. These signals
   thus seem to denote objects in the environment, but this specific
   mechanism has only been demonstrated for monkey alarm calls. We
   manipulated whether fowl (Gallus gallus) had recently found a small
   quantity of preferred food and then tested for a specific interaction
   between this event and their subsequent response to playback of food
   calls. In one treatment, food calls thus potentially provided
   information about the immediate environment, while in the other the
   putative message was redundant with individual experience. Food calls
   evoked substrate searching, but only if the hens had not recently
   discovered food. An identical manipulation had no effect on responses to
   an acoustically matched control call. These results show that chicken
   food calls are representational signals: they stimulate retrieval of
   information about a class of external events. This is the first such
   demonstration for any non-primate species. Representational signalling
   is hence more taxonomically widespread than has previously been thought,
   suggesting that it may be the product of common social factors, rather

Abstract = {{New World monkeys exhibit a color vision polymorphism. It results from
   allelic variation of the single-locus middle-to-long wavelength opsin
   gene on the X chromosome. Females that are heterozygous for the gene
   possess trichromatic vision. All other individuals possess dichromatic
   vision. The prevailing hypothesis for the maintenance of the color
   vision polymorphism is through a consistent fitness advantage to
   heterozygous trichromatic females. Such females are predicted to be more
   efficient than dichromats when detecting and selecting fruit. Recent
   experiments with captive callitrichid primates provided support for this
   hypothesis by demonstrating that color vision phenotype affects
   behavioral responses to contrived food targets. Yet, the assumptions
   that trichromatic females acquire more calories from fruit, or that
   number of offspring is linked to caloric intake, remain untested. Here,
   we assess if, in the wild, heterozygous trichromatic individuals in a
   group of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) enjoy an energetic
   advantage over dichromats when foraging on fruit. Contrary to the
   assumptions of previous theoretical and experimental studies, our
   analysis of C. capucinus foraging behavior shows that trichromats do not
   differ from dichromats in their fruit or energy acquisition rates. For
   white-faced capuchins, the advantage of trichromatic vision may be
   related to the detection of predators, animal prey, or fruit under
   mesopic conditions. This result demonstrates the importance of using a
   fitness currency that is relevant to individual animals to test

   (Perca fluviatilis L.) display adaptive plasticity in gut length when
   exposed to different food types. Perch fed a less digestible food type
   developed relatively longer guts compared to fish fed a more easily
   digested food type. This divergence in gut length was also apparent
   under natural conditions because perch inhabiting the littoral and
   pelagic habitats of a lake differed in resource use and relative gut
   length. Despite that the digestive system in perch is plastic, we found
   that individuals switching to a novel food type might experience an
   initial fitness cost of the diet switch in the form of a temporary
   reduction in body condition. These results show the importance of gut
   length plasticity for an ontogenetic omnivore but also a cost that might
   prevent diet switching in polymorphic populations. (c) 2007 The Linnean

Abstract = {{In amphibians and fishes, evidence is increasing that chemical cues from
   injured conspecifics can play a role in the chemical labelling and
   learned recognition of unfamiliar predators. In this laboratory study,
   we tested the prediction that prior chemical exposure to a non-native
   predator feeding on conspecific tadpoles will subsequently allow
   tadpoles of the common toad (Bufo bufo) to recognize the chemical cues
   specifically released by this starved predator. Furthermore, we
   investigated the vulnerability of this chemically-mediated process to
   herbicide contamination. With these aims in view, groups of tadpoles
   were kept either unexposed or exposed for ten days to chemical cues from
   Turkish crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus) previously fed on tadpoles,
   both in uncontaminated water and in the presence of four sublethal
   concentrations of amitrole (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg.l(-1)). We then
   assessed the effects of the six conditioning treatments on general
   activity and behavioural response to chemical cues from starved
   crayfish. Larval treatments did not affect the general activity of the
   tadpoles. By contrast, the treatments had significant effects on the
   behavioural response to the test solution prepared form starved
   crayfish. The only tadpoles to show an antipredator behavioural response
   to the chemical stimulation from starved crayfish belonged to the groups
   derived from chemical exposure to tadpole-fed crayfish in uncontaminated
   water and in contaminated water with the lowest concentration of
   amitrole (0.01 mg.l(-1)). Conversely, this chemical stimulation produced
   no behavioural change in the control group or in the groups derived from
   exposure to tadpole-fed crayfish in contaminated water containing 0.1, 1
   and 10 mg.l(-1) of amitrole. This study demonstrates that chemical cues
   released during the predator's feeding activity can subsequently be used
   by common toad tadpoles in the recognition of an unfamiliar predator. In
   addition, our results show that the presence of sublethal amitrole
   concentrations can impair this recognition process. Such a pesticide
   effect might be especially detrimental for amphibian populations
   threatened by invasive predators.}},

Abstract = {{Avian incubation attentiveness has important fitness consequences
   through its influence on the number and quality of hatched young and
   energetic costs imposed on parents. Nest attentiveness is highly
   variable across species and geographical regions. We reviewed the
   literature and found a worldwide pattern that nest attentiveness of
   passerines is generally lower in south temperate and tropical regions
   than in north temperate regions. We also conducted a food manipulation
   experiment to assess the extent to which nest attentiveness may reflect
   proximate responses versus an evolved behaviour. We used the karoo
   prinia, Prinia maculosa, in South Africa, which has very low nest
   attentiveness (similar to 49\%) compared with that of many passerine
   birds. We provided supplemental food during early incubation to
   experimental females and compared nest attentiveness and on- and
   off-bout lengths of experimental and paired control females. Nest
   attentiveness of females at food-provisioned nests was significantly
   higher than that of control females (57\% versus 49\%).
   Food-supplemented females also spent significantly less time off the
   nest than did control females, whereas mean on-bout lengths did not
   differ. However, mean nest attentiveness of food-provisioned females was
   still substantially below that of other similar bird species worldwide.
   Food can be an important proximate influence on parental care behaviour,
   but proximate influences of food do not explain broad latitudinal
   patterns of attentiveness. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Predation plays a key role in shaping mammalian communities through prey
   killed and through the decisions and choices of both predators and prey.
   We used an extensive data set from observed hunts of a diurnal large
   African carnivore, the cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus, in combination with
   analysis techniques originally developed in the field of economics
   (discrete choice models) to examine predation decisions within the
   context of the immediate environment and the reproductive and hunger
   status of individuals. This is one of the first attempts at an
   integrated understanding of the suite of ecological and behavioural
   factors that influence hunting decisions in a large carnivore. The
   decision of a cheetah to hunt or not was influenced by the abundance of
   their main prey, the reproductive status of the cheetah and the presence
   of competitors and predators, but not by the hunger level of the
   cheetah. Given that the decision to hunt is taken, prey choice is then
   driven by the time of year, the sex of the predator, the abundance of
   prey and the presence of competitors. We believe that discrete choice
   models may provide a new step forward in our ability to understand the
   decisions that animals make in their natural environment. (c) 2007 The

Abstract = {{The general consensus is that brain serotonin (5-HT) inhibits feed
   intake in teleost fishes and other vertebrates. Dietary manipulations
   with the 5-HT precursor tryptophan (TRP) have, however, yielded
   contradictory effects on feed intake, while studies of the endocrine
   response to stress indicate that the effects of TRP-enriched feed are
   context dependent. A characteristic behavioural response to stress is a
   reduction in feed intake, and in the present study we investigated
   whether pre-treatment with TRP-enriched feed affected stress-induced
   changes in feeding behaviour in brown trout (Salmo trutta). After
   acclimatisation in observation aquaria, isolated fish were fed control
   or TRP-supplemented feed for 7 d, whereupon they were transferred to a
   novel environment, in which all fish were fed control feed. Transfer to
   a new environment resulted in decreased feeding in both the TRP
   pre-treated and the control-treated group. However, this decrease was
   more pronounced in the control-treated group. Previous experiments have
   concluded that stimulation of brain 5-HT systems by TRP enhancement does
   not affect feed intake in salmonid fishes, but in these studies food
   intake was observed in unstressed animals only. The present study
   suggests that pre-treatment with dietary TRP attenuates stress-induced
   anorexia. Hence, it appears that the effect of dietary manipulations of
   TRP on feeding behaviour is dependent on the stress levels experienced
   by experimental animals. These behavioural data are discussed in the
   context of the involvement of 5-HT in appetite regulation.}},

   examine how IKC affected the mortality, behavior, and movements of
   clinically affected animals. Morbidity was 39\%, and all sex and age
   classes were affected. The population declined 23\%, with most mortality
   in the adult female (1 M, 11 F) segment of the population. Of the
   diseased animals that were marked (n = 27), 44\% recovered and 44\%
   died. Predation (50\%) and starvation (33\%) were the primary causes of
   mortality of diseased bighorn sheep. Bighorn sheep that were infected
   spent less time feeding and moved less than noninfected animals during
   the epizootic. Managers might be able to minimize losses of infected
   animals through predator control. To minimize losses to starvation,
   managers should refrain from any activity that disturbs infected animals

Abstract = {{For animals with complex life cycles, recent models of sexual

   In the territorial dragonfly Libellula depressa (Odonata) exhibiting a
   flexible development time we tested for male-biased sexual
   size-dimorphism and sex differences in larval activity, development
   time, and growth rate. Based on models we predicted that males achieved
   their larger size compared to females by a longer development rather
   than being more active. Results revealed that males took longer to
   develop and achieved a larger size than females but were not more
   active. Compared to males, females exhibited a higher growth rate which
   was not achieved by an activity-mediated increased food intake. We
   conclude that sexual size-dimorphism in species with a flexible

Abstract = {{Developmental vitamin D (DVD) deficiency alters brain development and

   manipulating the withdrawal and reintroduction of vitamin D in the diet
   of female Sprague-Dawley rats, their offspring were subjected to four
   different prenatal vitamin D conditions: (a) control (normal vitamin D
   throughout gestation); (b) early-DVD deficiency; (c) late-DVD
   deficiency; and (d) full-DVD deficiency. We show that the standard
   measure for vitamin D status, 25(OH)D-3, can be significantly
   manipulated within 7 days by dietary intervention. We also show that
   levels of the active form of this vitamin, 1,25(OH)(2)D-3, replete
   within the same time frame as 25(OH)D-3 but are slower to deplete.
   Developmental milestones remained normal across all four dietary groups.
   Concerning the adult behavioural phenotype, both full- and late-DVD
   deficiency were associated with MK-801 induced hyperlocomotion. Overall,
   these data suggest that vitamin D deficiency restricted to late
   gestation only is sufficient to disrupt adult brain functioning in the

Abstract = {{Different emotions are accompanied by different bodily states and it is
   unclear which brain structures are involved in both, the cerebral
   representation of the bodily change and the representation of its
   perception. Structures connecting bodily signals and interoceptive
   awareness could trigger, in a feedforward manner, behavioral responses
   appropriate to maintain a desired state of the cardiovascular system.
   The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study aimed at
   identifying brain structures that are mutually activated during
   interoceptive awareness of heartbeats and during cardiovascular arousal.
   Additionally, we searched for brain regions connecting interoception
   with feelings. During the interoceptive task (directing attention
   towards heartbeats in relation to an exteroceptive task) the thalamus,
   the insula, the medial frontal/dorsal cingulate and the inferior frontal
   gyrus, as well as the somatomotor cortex were activated. The conjunction
   of the interoceptive awareness of heartbeats and cardiovascular arousal
   revealed structures presumably connecting both conditions, i.e. the
   right thalamus, insula, somatomotor cortex, and the dorsal cingulate as
   well as medial frontal gyrus. Furthermore, the degree of interoceptive
   awareness predicted the degree of activation of both the insula and the
   medial frontal/dorsal cingulate gyrus. Negative feelings correlated with
   the BOLD response of the interoceptive awareness condition in the dorsal
   cingulate gyrus extending into the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. We
   provide evidence that the insula, the dorsal cingulate gyrus, and the
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex are specifically involved in processing
   cardiac sensations. The dorsal cingulate gyrus and the dorsomedial

Abstract = {{Many different physiological changes have been observed in wild
   waterfowl during the flightless stage of wing moult, including a loss of
   body mass. We aimed to determine whether captive barnacle geese (Branta
   leucopsis) would show the characteristic decrease in body mass during
   their wing moult, even though they had unlimited and unrestricted access
   to food. Fourteen captive geese were weighed at 1-2-week intervals for
   two complete years. During the flightless period of the moult, body mass
   decreased by approximately 25\% from the pre-moult value. To understand
   the basis of this change, the rate of oxygen consumption was measured
   during daytime and nighttime at six points in the second year, and at
   three points (before, during and after wing moult) behavioural
   observations were made. Measurements of the rate of oxygen consumption
   showed an 80\% increase above that of the nonmoulting periods of the
   year. We propose that metabolism was increased during moult because of
   the cost of feather synthesis. Although food was available, the captive
   birds chose not to forage and instead increased the proportion of time
   spent resting. It is likely that this behaviour in response to wing
   moult is a strategy to avoid predation in the wild. Thus, the innate
   nature of this behaviour has potential survival value for wild birds of
   this species. We conclude that the increase in metabolism led to the use
   of endogenous energy reserves because the birds reduced rather than
   increased their food intake rates, and as a result, the barnacle geese
   lost body mass during wing moult.}},

Abstract = {{Animals use behavioural plasticity to cope with conflicting selective
   pressures. We investigated how prey availability affects the spinning of
   cobwebs, whose architecture influences both prey capture and defence.
   Fed western black widows spun cobwebs containing more silk than did
   fasted spiders. However, fed spiders invested relatively less silk in
   the sheets and sticky gumfooted threads of webs and relatively more silk
   in supporting threads than did fasted spiders. The material properties
   of silk spun by fed and fasted spiders were relatively similar, but silk
   threads spun by fed spiders were twice as thick as those of fasted
   spiders, increasing web strength by 225\%. Finally, spiders fed late in
   the experiment did not reproduce, even though they received the same
   amount of food as spiders fed earlier, 43\% of which reproduced. The
   reallocation of silk in cobwebs away from sheets and sticky gumfooted
   threads, which function in prey capture, to supporting threads, which
   surround spiders with defensive clouds of silk, is consistent with
   reduced foraging effort and increased predation risk avoidance by fed
   spiders. Furthermore, this behavioural shift occurs as spiders are
   reproducing, when spiders can most afford the costs of reduced prey
   capture and would most benefit from enhanced protection. Our results
   contrast with those of previous studies on orb-weaving spiders, which
   found reductions in the sizes of webs as spiders caught more food. Thus,
   the architectures of spider webs reflect many selective pressures, the
   effects of which may vary with physiological state. (C) 2007 The

Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity has been the object of considerable interest over
   the past several decades, but in few cases are mechanisms underlying
   plastic responses well understood. For example, it is unclear whether
   predator-induced changes in gastropod shell morphology represent an
   active physiological response or a by-product of reduced feeding. We
   address this question by manipulating feeding and growth of intertidal
   snails, Littorina obtusata, using two approaches: (i) exposure to
   predation cues from green crabs Carcinus maenas and (ii) reduced food
   availability, and quantifying growth in shell length, shell mass, and
   body mass, as well as production of faecal material and shell
   micro-structural characteristics (mineralogy and organic fraction) after
   96 days. We demonstrate that L. obtusata actively increases
   calcification rate in response to predation threat, and that this
   response entails energetic and developmental costs. That this induced
   response is not strictly tied to the animal's behaviour should enhance
   its evolutionary potential.}},

Abstract = {{Perch Perca fluviatilis of age 0+ years were caught in a gravel pit lake
   in June (unimodal size distribution) and in July (bimodal size
   distribution) to analyse morphological differences between the two
   growth cohorts. Independent of size, 0+ year perch developed a deeper
   body and perch of the large size cohort had an even deeper body than
   perch of the small size cohort. This might have been adaptations to
   either piscivory or planktivory, but might also be a hint that 0+ year
   perch of the small size cohort were undernourished and that they
   developed on a different trajectory than individuals of the large size
   cohort. In a second step the study was extended with a mesocosm
   experiment. This part of the study was designed to provide preliminary
   evidence for the extent to which morphological variations may be due to
   the consumption of different food resources when other factors such as
   habitat use could be neglected. Two groups of 0+ year perch in four
   mesocosms were fed for 40 days with the same biomass of either plankton
   or cyprinids. Although the experimental groups at the end of the
   experiment did not differ in size, they differed in morphology. The
   mouth of the piscivorous 0+ year perch became larger, the pectoral fins
   and the centre of mass of the posterior abdomen were shifted backwards.
   These results provide further evidence that the type of food is
   important and might lead to further functional adaptations in
   morphology.}},

Abstract = {{The spider crab Inachus phalangium is common in the sublitoral fringe of

   Studies concerning its activity patterns and the role of the host sea
   anemone are lacking. Our study aimed at investigating activity rhythms
   and resources utilization of I. phalangium reared in captivity. The main
   behavioral traits exhibited by I. phalangium are performed mostly at
   night. Two experiments were designed, one examined the time budget of
   various behavioral acts and the degree of association with the sea
   anemone, the other analyzed the behavioral response to algae and
   anemones. We showed that algae have a crucial role in the biology of I.
   phalangium and that crabs are ready to leave the protection of their
   host to obtain them. Algae represent both the major component of the
   diet and one of the most utilized sources of masking material of I.
   phalangium, which provide, together with specialized cryptic behaviors,
   protection against predators. Although our data suggest that the
   association with A. viridis is not obligatory, but the role of the
   snakelocks sea anemone in the life of I. phalangium is still central,
   both as an anti-predatory defense and as a nutritional source. The
   association of I. phalangium with algae and the anemone is a facultative

Abstract = {{Predator-generated variation in prey energy intake remains the dominant
   explanation of adaptive response to predation risk in prey life history,
   morphology and physiology across a wide range of taxa. This
   ``behavioural hypothesis{''} suggest that chemical or visual signals of
   predation risk reduce prey energy intake leading to a life history
   characterized by a small size and late age at maturity. However,
   size-selective predation can induce either smaller size-early age or
   large size-late age life history. The alternative ``physiological
   hypothesis{''} suggests that size-selective cues decouple the
   relationship between energy and life history, acting instead directly on
   development. Here we use a series of experiments in a fish-daphnid
   predator-prey system to ask whether size-selective predator cues induce
   a physiological mediation of development, overshadowing behaviourally
   based changes in food intake. We found fish chemical cues reduce the net
   energy intake in Daphnia magna, suggesting a behaviourally mediated
   reduction in energy. Experimental manipulation of food levels show
   further that reductions in food lead to later but smaller size at
   maturity. However, in line with the physiological hypothesis, we show
   that D. magna matures earlier and at a smaller size when exposed to fish
   predation cues. Furthermore, our data shows that they do this by
   increasing their development rate (earlier maturity) for a given growth
   rate, resulting in a smaller size at maturity. Our data, from a classic
   size-selective predation system, indicate that predator-induced changes
   in this system are driven by physiological mediation of development
   rather than behavioural mediation of energy intake.}},

Abstract = {{There is now considerable evidence that elements of the heritable or

   development shape disease risk in later life. The underlying mechanisms
   are thought to involve epigenetic modifications in nonimprinted genes

   expression without altering DNA sequences. These changes result in
   life-long alterations in gene expression. Such nongenomic tuning of
   phenotype through developmental plasticity has adaptive value because it
   attempts to match an individual's responses to the environment predicted
   to be experienced. When the responses are mismatched, disease risk
   increases. An example of such mismatch is that arising either from
   inaccurate nutritional cues from the mother or placenta before birth, or
   from rapid environmental change through improved socioeconomic
   conditions, which contribute substantially to the increasing prevalence
   of type-2 diabetes. obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence

Abstract = {{Childhood obesity is growing rapidly worldwide. Although there have been
   enormous advances in the genetic underpinnings of obesity in recent
   years, the pathways that lead to obesity are still not completely
   understood. one of the ongoing challenges is the lack of a comprehensive
   definition of the obese phenotype that encompasses intermediary
   phenotypic expressions of biological and behavioral nature. Interactions
   between genetic and environmental factors, including nutrient exposures
   and dietary behaviors, can influence the development of the obese
   phenotype. Specifically, genes play a decisive role in the etiology of
   childhood obesity under the permissive circumstances of an obesogenic
   environment (increase in energy intake with a decrease in physical
   activity). Like many diseases, the causes of obesity are complex and
   their investigation requires novel approaches. Given the many
   contributors to obesity (weight gain, weight loss, weight maintenance,
   variability in body composition), as well as the dynamic nature of this
   issue, genomic tools must continue to be employed to evaluate all
   dimensions of the obesity phenotype, such as biochemical
   characteristics, susceptibility markers, nutrient intake, feeding
   practices and gene-environment interactions. Fundamental knowledge of
   the types of genes involved and available gene-diet interaction studies
   in children's obesity are reviewed. Although there is a paucity of
   existing literature in this specific domain of childhood obesity,
   ongoing investigations utilizing large cohorts have potential for
   providing the knowledge needed for targeted interventions in the future.}},

Volume = {{73}},

Abstract = {{Both sexes of the turquoise-browed motmot, Eumomota superciliosa,
   display their long-racketed tail in an exaggerated side-to-side wag
   display in two contexts. In the. rst, the wag display is performed in
   the presence of predators (predator-elicited wag display), and evidence
   supports the hypothesis that the signal functions as a pursuit-deterrent
   signal (Murphy 2006, Behavioral Ecology, 17, 547-553). In the second,
   the wag display is performed in the apparent absence of predators
   immediately before feeding nestlings ( prefeeding wag display). I tested
   four hypotheses on the adaptive significance of the prefeeding wag
   display: ( 1) a dishonest, preemptive, pursuit-deterrent signal given in
   case predators are present; ( 2) a nonfunctional mis. re of the
   predator-elicited wag display; ( 3) a signal that alerts nestlings to
   the delivery of food; ( 4) a sexually selected signal that advertises
   parental quality to potential mates. There was no support for the
   hypotheses that the prefeeding wag display was directed to nestlings or
   potential mates. The wag display was generally performed where nestlings
   could not detect the signal and the display did not vary with the sex of
   the displaying bird, the presence of the mate, or the size of the food
   carried in the signaller's bill. Evidence presented in this paper is
   most consistent with the hypothesis that the predator-elicited wag
   display and the prefeeding wag display are performed as a response to
   the presence or the potential presence of a predator. I discuss the
   possibility that the prefeeding wag display functions as a dishonest,
   pursuit-deterrent signal. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Although numerous species of sea urchins often cover themselves with
   small rocks, shells and algal fragments, the function of this covering
   behaviour is poorly understood. Diving observations showed that the
   degree to which the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis covers
   itself in the field decreases with size. We performed laboratory
   experiments to examine how the sea urchin's covering behaviour is
   affected by the presence of predators, sea urchin size, wave surge,
   contact with moving algae blades and sunlight. The presence of two
   common sea urchin predators did not influence the degree to which sea
   urchins covered themselves. Covering responses of sea urchins that were
   exposed to a strong wave surge and sweeping algal blades were
   significantly greater than those of individuals that were maintained
   under still water conditions. The degree to which sea urchins covered
   themselves in the laboratory also tended to decrease with increasing
   size. Juveniles showed stronger covering responses than adults, possibly
   because they are more vulnerable to dislodgement and predation. We found
   that UV light stimulated a covering response, whereas UV-filtered
   sunlight and darkness did not, although the response to UV light was
   much weaker than that to waves and algal movement. Our observations
   suggest that the covering behaviour of S. droebachiensis has evolved as
   an adaptation to protect it from mechanical injuries associated with
   abrasion and dislodgement, and to a lesser extent as a defence against
   UV radiation. The covering behaviour may reduce the sea urchin's ability
   to move and this would limit its ability to forage and to. ee from
   predators. In this case, the covering behaviour may have evolved as a
   trade-off between locomotion and limiting environmental stresses. (C)

Abstract = {{Animals show specific morphological, physiological and behavioural
   adaptations to diurnal or nocturnal activity. Cathemeral species, i.e.
   animals with activities distributed over the 24-h period, have to
   compromise between these specific adaptations. The driving evolutionary
   forces and the proximate costs and benefits of cathemerality are still
   poorly understood. Our goal was to evaluate the role of predator
   avoidance, food availability and diet quality in shaping cathemeral
   activity of arboreal mammals using a lemur species as an example. For
   this, two groups of collared lemurs, Eulemur collaris, were studied for
   14 months in the littoral forest of southeastern Madagascar. Data on
   feeding behaviour were collected during all-day and all-night follows by
   direct observation. A phenological transect containing 78 plant species
   was established and monitored every 2 weeks to evaluate food
   availability during the study period. Characteristics of food items and
   animal nutritional intake were determined via biochemical analyses. The
   ratio of diurnal to nocturnal feeding was used as response variable in
   the analyses. The effects of abiotic environmental variables were
   removed statistically before the analyses of the biotic variables. We
   found that diurnal feeding lasted longer during the hot-wet season
   (December-February), whereas nocturnal feeding peaked during the hot-dry
   and cool-wet seasons (March-August). Although the lemurs foraged mostly
   in lower forest strata during daylight and used emergent trees
   preferably at night, the variables which measured animal exposure to
   birds of prey failed to predict the variation of the ratio of
   diurnal/nocturnal feeding. Ripe fruit availability and fiber intake are
   the two variables which best predicted the annual variation of the lemur
   diurnality. The data indicate that feeding over the whole 24-h cycle is
   advantageous during lean periods when animals have a fibre-rich,
   low-quality diet.}},

   with EDs. Baseline assessment included anthropometry, the Eating
   Disorder Examination (EDE), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the
   TCI. Treatment was based on the transdiagnostic cognitive behavior
   theory and treatment of ED, adapted for an inpatient setting. Treatment
   effects were tested by paired ANOVA, adjusted for covariates. No effects

   Harm Avoidance (F = 18. 17, p < 0.001), Persistence (F = 7.71, p =

Abstract = {{Background: Individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) exhibit severe
   disturbances in appetite regulation, including delayed meal termination,
   early return of hunger after a meal, seeking and hoarding food and
   eating of non-food substances. Brain pathways involved in the control of
   appetite in humans are thought to include the hypothalamus, frontal
   cortex (including the orbitofrontal, ventromedial prefrontal,
   dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas), insula, and
   limbic and paralimbic areas. We hypothesised that the abnormal appetite
   in PWS results from aberrant reward processing of food stimuli in these
   neural pathways.
   Methods: We compared functional MRI blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD)
   responses while viewing pictures of food in eight adults with PWS and
   eight normal weight adults after ingestion of an oral glucose load.
   Results: Subjects with PWS demonstrated significantly greater BOLD
   activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex than controls when
   viewing food pictures. No significant differences were found in serum
   insulin, glucose or triglyceride levels between the groups at the time
   of the scan.
   Conclusions: Individuals with PWS had an increased BOLD response in the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex compared with normal weight controls when
   viewing pictures of food after an oral glucose load. These findings
   suggest that an increased reward value for food may underlie the
   excessive hunger in PWS, and support the significance of the frontal
   cortex in modulating the response to food in humans. Our findings in the
   extreme appetite phenotype of PWS support the importance of the neural
   pathways that guide reward related behaviour in modulating the response
   to food in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Antarctic limpets, Nacella concinna, from the Admiralty Bay (King George
   Island, South Shetlands) for at least part of the year (austral winter)
   co-exist with predatory sea stars Lysasterias sp. Our laboratory and
   field experiments established that the presence of Lysasterias sp. or
   its odour had considerable influence upon their behaviour. Limpets'
   responses, consisting of shell mushrooming, shell rotation and flight,
   were distinctly different from their reaction to other stimuli, such as
   food and conspecific odours, or mechanical stimulation. Moreover, a
   significant impact of sea star presence on limpets' activity was
   observed, with limpets fleeing to a distance of 60 cm from the predator.
   Such reactions allow limpets to lower the incidence of sea star
   predation, but at the cost of presumptive disrupting of foraging and an
   additional energy expended for locomotion. A visible difference was
   noted between two limpet populations, with the rockpool limpets
   responding only after physical contact with being touched by a sea star,
   and the subtidal ones responding at a distance of up to 20 cm.}},

Abstract = {{In this review we evaluate whether universal behavioral and metabolic
   mechanisms exist, which permit marine proto- and metazooplankton to
   persist in continuously food-limited environments such as the North
   Pacific Subtropical Gyre and other oligotrophic ocean systems. We
   re-visit the issue of what processes account for low steady-state
   abundance of the dominant groups of planktonic grazers: phagotrophic
   protists and copepods, by examining evidence for the four processes
   proposed by Strom et al. (2000): grazing thresholds, behavioral response
   to prey patchiness, top-down control of grazers, and mixotrophy
   (combination of photosynthesis and phagotrophy in protists) and/or
   omnivory (switching between alternate prey types). Published
   observations reveal that grazing thresholds, below which feeders reduce
   their feeding efforts and, with that, their metabolic expenditures, do
   exist. There are also studies suggesting that both protistan and small
   metazoan plankton feeders may take advantage of patchiness of food
   particles and are frequently mixotrophic and/or omnivorous. Predator
   patchiness in response to prey patches may facilitate top-down control
   of grazers. Finally, we discuss processes, which may lead to low quasi
   steady-state abundances of food particles and feeders.}},

   foraging studies on birds in the dry and wet fringing forests and
   savanna habitats of the Amurum Forest Reserve, Laminga, Nigeria, were
   used to evaluate whether widespread food abundance will affect their
   behaviour in these apparently-different habitats. The effect of the dry
   season on feeding activity and the effects of temperature within, and
   between, days were also investigated. Results showed that GUDs were
   highest in dry fringing forests, intermediate in wet fringing forests,
   and lowest in savanna. This difference may have been as a result of a
   difference in food abundance between habitats. The availability of water
   in the wet fringing forests may have affected the feeding behaviour of
   the birds in the wet gully habitat compared with those of the dry gully.
   The behaviour of birds in response to time of day was affected by
   temperature, as there was no difference between GUDs in open and covered
   habitats in the mornings at lower temperatures, but lower GUDs were
   recorded in cover (at higher temperatures) in the afternoon when birds
   may - due to thermoregulatory costs - retreat to cover more often.
   However, temperature had no effect on GUDs over season. A reduction in
   GUDs towards the end of the dry season, as food resources deplete, gives
   further credence to the observation that food abundance affects

Abstract = {{Food availability can strongly affect predator-prey dynamics. When
   change in habitat condition reduces the availability of one prey type,
   predators often search for other prey, perhaps in a different habitat.
   Interactions between behavioural and morphological traits of different
   prey may influence foraging success of visual predators through
   trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs), such as prey activity and
   body coloration. We tested the hypothesis that foraging success of
   stream-dwelling cutthroat trout (Onchorhyncus clarki) on cryptically
   coloured, less-active benthic prey (larval mayfly; Paraleptophebia sp.)
   can be enhanced by the presence of distinctly coloured, active prey
   (larval stonefly shredder; Despaxia augusta). Cutthroat trout preyed on
   benthic insects when drifting invertebrates were unavailable. When
   stonefly larvae were present, the trout ate most of the stoneflies and
   also consumed a higher proportion of mayflies than under mayfly only
   treatment. The putative mechanism is that active stonefly larvae
   supplied visual cues to the predator that alerted trout to the mayfly
   larvae. Foraging success of visual predators on cryptic prey can be
   enhanced by distinctly coloured, active benthic taxa through
   unidirectional facilitation to the predators, which is a functional
   change of interspecific interaction caused by a third species. This
   study suggests that prey-predator facilitation through TMIIs can modify
   species interactions, affecting community dynamics.}},

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{63-69}},

Abstract = {{By facilitating avoidance of kin competition and inbreeding, natal
   dispersal can have direct fitness consequences. Mechanisms that optimize
   indirect fitness may be equally important. When relatives compete for
   the same resources (kin competition), evolution of elevated dispersal
   rates can be favoured, so that most resource competition is among
   nonrelatives. When offspring are incapable of dispersing, maternal
   behaviour may influence natal dispersal in a positive way, by spreading
   offspring throughout the habitat. By combining laboratory and field
   observations, we studied dismounting behaviour of spiderlings from the
   maternal abdomen (i.e. maternal care) and mobility patterns of female
   wolf spiders, Pardosa monticola. Laboratory observations on the duration
   of maternal care indicated that spiderlings desert the maternal abdomen
   gradually within 185 h of hatching. Detailed behavioural monitoring
   within the spider's habitat showed that females carrying spiderlings on
   their back were more mobile with greater directionality of movement than
   females of other reproductive states. This alteration in female
   mobility, together with the gradual dismounting of offspring from the
   abdomen, indicates maternally induced natal `hitchhiking' dispersal.
   These findings show that maternal effects may influence natal dispersal
   not only through condition dependence, but also by the active spreading
   of offspring throughout the habitat before they actively (decide to)
   disperse. This gradual dismounting of offspring is evolutionarily
   beneficial for the avoidance of kin competition. (C) 2007 The

   craving instead of specific food craving. The factor structure, validity
   and reliability of the modified questionnaires, renamed as the Trait and
   State General Food Cravings Questionnaires (G-FCQ-T and G-FCQ-S), were
   investigated in three separate studies. Firstly, exploratory factor
   analyses were conducted, which yielded a G-FCQ-T with a four-factor
   structure, that was considerably shorter as compared to the original
   (nine-factor) FCQ-T, and a G-FCQ-S of which the factor structure was
   highly comparable to the original FCQ-S. Secondly, in an attempt to
   replicate the factor structures of the G-FCQ-T and the G-FCQ-S as found
   in Study 1, confirmative factor analyses were performed. Results
   indicated adequate fits for both questionnaires. In addition, the
   test-retest reliability of both versions was satisfactory and an
   analysis of the construct validity generally revealed the expected
   results. In Study 3, the validity of the state version of the G-FCQ was
   further investigated by relating scores on this questionnaire to indices
   of food deprivation and satiation. Results indicated that the G-FCQ-S
   indeed measures food craving as a variable state, which is influenced by
   situational and temporal variables. Altogether, it can be concluded that
   the G-FCQ-T and G-FCQ-S are both reliable and valid measures of general

Abstract = {{Competition is predicted to affect the expression of inducible defenses,
   but because costs of behavioral and morphological antipredator defenses
   differ along resource gradients, its effects on defenses may depend on
   the traits considered. We tested the predictions from different defense
   models in tadpoles of the common frog Rana temporaria, which exhibit
   both types of defenses. In an outdoor experiment, we exposed the
   tadpoles to nonlethal predators (Aeshna dragonfly larvae) and to a
   gradient of intraspecific competition. Morphological responses did not
   follow any of the expected patterns, since investment in defense was not
   affected by resource level. Instead, tail depth decreased in the absence
   of predators. Behavioral defenses followed a state-dependent model.
   Overall, the defense strategy of the tadpoles revealed a shift from
   morphological and behavioral defenses at low tadpole density to
   morphological defense only at high density. This difference probably
   reflects the different efficiency of the defenses. Hiding is an
   effective means of defense, but it is unsustainable when resources are
   scarce. Morphological responses become more important with increasing
   density to compensate for the increase in behavioral risk-taking. Our
   results indicate that competition can strongly affect reaction norms of
   inducible defenses and highlight the importance of integrating
   ecological parameters that affect the cost-benefit balance of phenotypic
   plasticity.}},

   affect the performance in subsequent stages with important repercussions

   most influential in determining patterns of survival in a cohort of reef
   fish, we compared the characteristics of Pomacentrus amboinensis
   surviving early juvenile stages on the reef with those of the cohort
   from which they originated. Individuals were collected at hatching, the
   end of the planktonic phase, and two, three, four, six and eight weeks
   post-settlement. Information stored in the otoliths of individual fish
   revealed strong carry-over effects of larval condition at hatching on
   juvenile survival, weeks after settlement (i.e. smaller-is-better).
   Among the traits examined, planktonic growth history was, by far, the
   most influential and long-lasting trait associated with juvenile
   persistence in reef habitats. However, otolith increments suggested that
   larval growth rate may not be maintained during early juvenile life,
   when selective mortality swiftly reverses its direction. These changes
   in selective pressure may mediate growth-mortality trade-offs between
   predation and starvation risks during early juvenile life. Ontogenetic
   changes in the shape of selectivity may be a mechanism maintaining
   phenotypic variation in growth rate and size within a population.}},

Abstract = {{If changes in animal behavior resulting from direct human disturbance
   negatively affect the persistence of a given species or population, then
   these behavioral changes must necessarily lead to reduced demographic
   performance. We tested for the effects of human disturbance on Olympic
   marmots (Marmota olympus), a large ground-dwelling squirrel that has
   disappeared from several areas where recreation levels are high. We
   assessed the degree to which antipredator and foraging behavior and
   demographic rates (survival and reproduction) differed between sites
   with high recreation levels (high use) and those with little or no
   recreation (low use). Compared with the marmots at low-use sites,
   marmots at high-use sites displayed significantly reduced responses to
   human approach, which could be construed as successful accommodation of
   disturbance or as a decrease in predator awareness. The marmots at
   high-use sites also looked up more often while foraging, which suggests
   an increased wariness. Marmots at both types of sites had comparable
   reproductive and survival rates and were in similar body condition.
   Until now, the supposition that marmots can adjust their behavior to
   avoid negative demographic consequences when confronted with heavy

Abstract = {{Flexible time budgets allow individual animals to buffer the effects of
   variable food availability by allocating more time to foraging when food
   density decreases. This trait should be especially important for marine
   predators that forage on patchy and ephemeral food resources. We
   examined flexible time allocation by a long-lived marine predator, the
   Common Murre (Uria aalge), using data collected in a five-year study at
   three colonies in Alaska (USA) with contrasting environmental
   conditions. Annual hydroacoustic surveys revealed an order-of-magnitude
   variation in food density among the 15 colony-ye'ars of study. We used
   data on parental time budgets and local prey density to test predictions
   from two hypotheses: Hypothesis A, the colony attendance of seabirds
   varies nonlinearly with food density; and Hypothesis B, flexible time
   allocation of parent murres buffers chicks against variable food
   availability. Hypothesis A was supported; colony attendance by murres
   was positively correlated with food over a limited range of
   poor-to-moderate food densities, but independent of food over a broader
   range of higher densities. This is the first empirical evidence for a
   nonlinear response of a marine predator's time budget to changes in prey
   density. Predictions from Hypothesis B were largely supported: (1)
   chick-feeding rates were fairly constant over a wide range of densities
   and only dropped below 3.5 meals per day at the low end of prey density,
   and (2) there was a nonlinear relationship between chick-feeding rates
   and time spent at the colony, with chick-feeding rates only declining
   after time at the colony by the nonbrooding parent was reduced to a
   minimum. The ability of parents to adjust their foraging time by more
   than 2 h/d explains why they were able to maintain chick-feeding rates
   of more than 3.5 meals/d across a 10-fold range in local food density.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the association between
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and eating disorders in
   a large adolescent population of girls with and without ADHD. Method: We
   estimated the incidence of lifetime eating disorders (either anorexia or

   Comparisons between ADHD girls with and without eating disorders were
   then made on measures of comorbidity, course of ADHD, and growth and
   puberty. Results: ADHD girls were 3.6 times more likely to meet criteria
   for an eating disorder throughout the follow-up period compared to
   control females. Girls with eating disorders had significantly higher
   rates of major depression, anxiety disorders, and disruptive behavior
   disorder compared to ADHD girls without eating disorders. Girls with
   ADHD and eating disorders had a significantly earlier mean age at
   menarche than other ADHD girls. No other differences in correlates of

Abstract = {{The complex interplay between neural and endocrine responses following
   food intake regulates ingestive behaviour and ultimately determines
   subsequent energy intake. These processes include cognitive,
   gastrointestinal-derived and metabolic mechanisms. Such physiological
   responses to the ingestion of food initiate short-to medium-term
   inhibition of intake (satiety). However, in clinical states in which
   systemic inflammation is evident there is a more profound satiety
   response and a clear absence of motivation to eat that is evident as
   loss of appetite. These negative influences on energy intake can
   contribute to poor nutritional status, and consequently poor physical
   function, and impact on rehabilitation and recovery. Cytokine mediators
   of the inflammatory response directly influence feeding behaviour at the
   hypothalamic nuclei and may explain the lack of motivation and desire
   for food. However, additional detrimental effects on appetite are
   brought about because of alterations in intermediary metabolism present
   in inflammation-induced catabolism. This process forms part of the host
   response to inflammation and may explain symptoms, such as early
   satiety, frequently reported in many patient groups. In clinical states,
   and cancer in particular, pharmacological strategies have been employed
   to ameliorate the inflammatory response in an attempt to improve energy
   intake. Some success of this approach has been reported following
   administration of substrates such as EPA. Novel strategies to improve
   intake through administration of anti-cytokine drugs such as thalidomide
   may also be of benefit. However, drugs that oppose the actions of
   neurotransmitter pathways involved in central induction of satiety, such
   as 5-hydroxytryptamine, have failed to improve intake but appear to
   enhance enjoyment of food. Such findings indicate that therapeutic
   nutritional targets can only be achieved where novel pharmacological
   therapies can be supported by more innovative and integrated dietary
   management strategies. Many of these strategies remain to be elucidated.}},

Abstract = {{Columbina passetina and C. minuta (Aves, Columbidae) are two Neotropical
   species of Ground Doves with similar morphology, behavior and natural
   history. However, they exhibit notably different distributions on
   Caribbean islands. While C. passerina is found on a majority of them, C.
   minuta is restricted in the Caribbean to Trinidad. We hypothesized that
   an explanation for this extreme difference in ranges is due to
   differences in at least three traits often associated with successful
   island colonization: morphological structures that promote long flight
   efficiency, dietary plasticity and water requirements. We tested the
   first factor by comparing several wing measurements and the other two
   factors with experiments on wild-caught birds in controlled conditions.
   We did not find significant differences in wing measures. However, C.
   passerina showed greater dietary plasticity, a wider diet breadth and
   lower daily water requirements than C. minuta. Keeping in mind that
   island colonization success may be shaped by many variables, we
   concluded that the success of C. passerina maintaining populations on so
   many Caribbean islands is at least partially explained by its ability to
   survive in environments with unpredictable food changes and severe fresh
   water limitations as usually found on some Caribbean islands.}},

Abstract = {{There is now much evidence that early life undernutrition elevates risk
   of diseases like cardiovascular disease. Less clear is whether the
   underlying developmental plasticity in metabolism and physiology evolved
   to serve an adaptive function, beyond these effects on pathophysiology.
   This review builds from principles of life history theory to propose a
   functional model linking early environments with adult biology. An
   organism has metabolic potential in excess of survival requirements,
   called productivity, that supports growth before being shunted into
   reproduction after growth ceases. This concept from inter-specific
   studies leads to the prediction that plasticity in growth rate will be
   positively correlated with components of future adult reproductive
   expenditure. Consistent with this idea, evidence is reviewed that early
   nutrition or growth rate predict offspring size in females, and
   increased somatic investment related to reproductive strategy in males.
   Thus, population birth weight and sexual size dimorphism are predicted
   to increase in response to improvements in early nutrition. A striking
   feature of the continuity of metabolic production is its perpetuation
   not merely during the lifecycle but across generations: in females,
   growth rate predicts future nutritional investment in reproduction,
   which in turn determines fetal growth rate in the next generation.
   Growth and reproduction serve as mutually-defining templates, thus
   creating a phenotypic bridge allowing ecologic information to be
   maintained during ontogeny and transmitted to offspring. Resetting of
   metabolic production in response to maternal nutritional cues may serve
   a broader goal of integrating nutritional information within the
   matriline, thus providing a more reliable basis for adjusting long-term
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals have to trade- off energy intake against the risk of
   predation when foraging. However, in group-living species, social
   interference will limit the range of choices for subordinate
   individuals. The trade- off between foraging and predation risk may be
   even more complex in species that associate in family groups because
   relatives can provide benefits to each other that are withheld from
   nonrelatives. As a consequence, nonrelatives may be forced to take
   greater risks to gain similar amounts of energy as relatives. Here, I
   investigate how the energy-risk trade- off varies among individuals in a
   social, group- living species, the Siberian jay, Perisoreus infaustus.
   Groups in this species consist of a breeding pair, together with
   retained offspring and/ or nonrelated immigrants. I manipulated food
   quality at feeding sites that differed in their visibility to predators
   and observed the differences in foraging patterns between different
   group members. Adults and their offspring fed more often at the
   protected feeding site when it contained high- quality food, but
   switched to the more exposed site when this site offered higher quality
   food than the protected site. In contrast, immigrants spent a similar
   amount of time at each feeding site, independent of food quality. Birds
   generally spent more time waiting for access to the high- quality food
   source and protected feeding site, and family members generally harassed
   immigrants that tried to access these sites. None the less, all birds
   had a similar overall food intake, suggesting that immigrants pay
   substantially higher costs than other members to attain the equivalent
   level of energy intake. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{In studies of refuge use as a form of antipreclator behavior where prey

   games have focused on mammals, we studied the hiding behavior of the
   yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris), a ground-dwelling rodent.
   We tested the prediction that marmots vary hiding time as a function of
   predator approach speed and presence and absence of food outside their
   refuge and that marmots hide differently depending on their relative
   condition. We conducted ``fast approaches{''} and ``slow approaches{''}

   Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that the interaction between
   the approach speed and the presence and absence of food influenced
   hiding behavior; body condition had a smaller, but nonsignificant

   potential fitness consequences of these decisions. The model suggested

Abstract = {{The ex situ population of maned wolves is not self-sustaining due to

   have shown that environmental enrichment can promote natural parental
   behaviors in zoo animals. The objective of this study was to determine
   the effects of environmental enrichment on behavioral and physiological
   responses of maned wolves. During an 8-week experimental period, daily
   behavior observations and fecal sample collection were conducted on four
   adult wolves (2.2) individually housed in environments without
   enrichment. After 2 weeks, the wolves were chronologically provided with
   2-week intervals of hiding dead mice around the exhibit, no enrichment,
   and introduction of boomer balls. Responses of the wolves to enrichment
   were assessed based on activity levels and exploratory rates, as well as
   the level of corticoid metabolites in fecal samples collected daily
   throughout the study period. Providing wolves with environmental
   enrichment significantly increased exploratory behaviors (P < 0.05),
   especially when mice were hidden in the enclosure. Fecal corticoid
   concentrations were increased during periods of enrichment in males (P <
   0.05), but not in females. Overall, there were no correlations between
   behavioral responses to enrichment and fecal corticoid levels.
   Behavioral results suggest that environmental enrichment elicits
   positive effects on the behavior of captive maned wolves. There is
   evidence suggesting that providing animals with ability to forage for

Abstract = {{Human depression and anxiety disorders show inherited biases across
   generations, as do antisocial disorders characterized by aggression.
   Each condition is preceded in children by behavioral inhibition or
   aggressive behavior, respectively, and both are characterized by
   separation anxiety disorders. In affected families, adults and children
   exhibit different forms of altered autonomic nervous system regulation
   and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity in response to stress.
   Because it is difficult to determine mechanisms accounting for these
   associations, animal studies are useful for studying the fundamental
   relationships between biological and behavioral traits. Pharmacologic
   and behavioral studies suggest that infant rat ultrasonic vocalizations
   (USV) are a measure of an early anxiety-like state related to separation
   anxiety. However, it was not known whether or not early ultrasound
   emissions in infant rats are markers for genetic risk for anxiety states
   later in life. To address these questions. we selectively bred two lines
   of rats based on high and low rates of USV to isolation at postnatal (P)
   10 days of age. To our knowledge, ours is the only laboratory that has
   ever selectively bred on the basis of an infantile trait related to
   anxiety. The High and Low USV lines show two distinct sets of patterns
   of behavior, physiology and neurochemistry from infancy through
   adulthood. As adults High line rats demonstrate 4
   ``anxious{''}/{''}depressed{''} phenotypes in behavior and autonomic
   nervous system (ANS) regulation to standard laboratory tests. In Lows,
   on the other hand, behavior and autonomic regulation are consistent with
   an ``aggressive{''} phenotype. The High and Low USV lines are the first
   genetic animal models implicating long-term associations of contrasting
   ``coping styles{''} with early attachment responses. They thus present a
   potentially powerful model for examining gene-environment interactions
   in the development of life-long affective regulation. (c) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The corticotropin-releasing factor ( CRF) system is the primary central
   mediator of stress-like states, coordinating behavioral, endocrine, and
   autonomic responses to stress. Although induction of anorexia is a well
   documented effect of CRF receptor agonist administration, the central
   sites and behavioral processes underlying this phenomenon are poorly
   understood. The present studies addressed this question by examining the
   neuroanatomical, behavioral, and pharmacological mechanisms mediating
   decreases in feeding produced by the CRF1/CRF2 receptor agonist
   urocortin. Separate groups of food-restricted male Sprague Dawley rats
   were given infusions of urocortin ( 0, 50, 125, 250 ng/0.5 mu l) into
   the lateral septum (LS) and immediately afterward were rated on a wide
   array of behaviors (locomotion, rearing, grooming, stereotypies)
   including a microstructural analysis of ingestive behavior. Intra-LS
   urocortin infusion dose-dependently reduced feeding and drinking while
   concomitantly increasing grooming, stereotypies, and ethological plus
   traditional measures of anxiety-like responses in the elevated
   plus-maze. Urocortin infusion into neighboring sites (lateral ventricle,
   medial caudate) had no effects. Coinfusion into the LS of the mixed
   CRF1/CRF2 receptor antagonist D-Phe-CRF(12-41) (0, 100, 1000 ng/0.5 mu
   l) or the novel selective CRF2 receptor antagonist Astressin2B ( 0, 500,

   CRF1-selective antagonist NBI27914 ( 0, 500, 1000 ng/0.5 mu l) had no
   effect, although it completely reversed the behavioral sequelae of CRF
   when infused into the basolateral amygdala. These results indicate that
   one of the modes through which the CRF system promotes anorexia is the
   recruitment of stress-like states after stimulation of CRF2 receptors

Abstract = {{In social insects, decisions are usually predicted to be more accurate
   than individual decisions, because individual preferences are amplified
   at the group level. Although social caterpillars, as individuals,
   possess considerable `nutritional wisdom' and have the capacity to
   regulate their nutrient intake: does this mean that the collective
   nutritional decisions made by colonies are better? We investigated
   individual feeding responses and collective decisions when caterpillar
   colonies were faced with different food sources. Forest tent
   caterpillars, Malacosoma disstria, had to choose between nutritionally
   balanced and unbalanced food sources placed at opposite ends of a
   bridge. At the individual level, caterpillars showed a clear preference
   for the balanced food source. In contrast, at the collective level,
   colonies of caterpillars randomly chose one of the two, and then became
   trapped for at least 24 h as a result of trail following behaviour. If
   the first caterpillar found the unbalanced food, it was followed by the
   others and the colony was unable to reverse this choice. This study
   provides evidence for a novel potential cost to group living, and shows
   that group feeding behaviour cannot always be simply predicted from
   individual preferences. Crown Copyright (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of predator species on yellow perch (Perca
   flavescens) from lakes in the Sudbury mining region (Ontario, Canada),
   where fish communities are just beginning to recover from the effects of
   decades of acidification and metal stress. The predation regimes
   investigated included six lakes with no predators, four lakes recently
   invaded (>= 15 years) by predators, and eight lakes with
   well-established ( >= 15 years) predator populations. Netting survey
   results indicated that yellow perch biomass was 69\% lower in lakes with
   predators. In lakes recently invaded by predators, perch displayed
   earlier ontogenetic diet shifts from zooplankton to benthos and much
   poorer growth during their first growing season. Energy investment
   (lipid content per egg) in eggs by mature females was also less in the
   lakes recently invaded by predators. Growth potential in adult perch
   (age 1), estimated by nucleoside diphosphokinase, was highest in lakes
   with established predators. Body condition, controlling for size of
   perch, was also greatest in established predator lakes. Perch body shape
   in lakes with predators showed a shift from a typical streamlined,
   pelagic body form towards a deeper-bodied benthic body form, a change
   that may increase foraging efficiency for benthos or represent an
   antipredator strategy.}},

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{1. An organism's growth parameters are expected to depend on
   environmental constraints, such as predation risk and food supply.
   However, antipredator responses, food intake, and thus growth of an
   animal may be mediated by behavioural traits, which are likely to differ
   among developmental stages. In this study, it was investigated how the
   relationship between growth and behavioural antipredator responses
   changes during ontogeny in the time-constrained dragonfly species
   Libellula depressa, and which factors influenced specific behavioural
   decisions at different points in ontogeny.
   2. The results revealed that behavioural strategies differed between
   larval developmental sages, depending on associations between larval
   growth, food supply, and predation risk. Early in ontogeny, faster
   development was correlated with high larval activity and high food
   supply. This resulted in high activity levels under high food conditions
   irrespectively of predator presence, and under low food supply in
   predator absence only. In the intermediate stage of development, all
   larvae displayed a high activity level, which was correlated in general
   with fast development. However, growth later in ontogeny was not only
   influenced by the activity level, but also by predator presence and food
   supply, with larvae reared under high food supply and/or in presence of
   predators attaining a higher final mass. Thus, not only the way in which
   larval growth parameters and behaviour are related changed during
   development, but also whether the factors influenced larval growth and
   behaviour. Once the larvae reached the ultimate stage of development, in
   which they overwinter, behavioural patterns observed were consistent
   with model predictions.
   3. It is advocated that behavioural plasticity of prey organisms in
   different developmental stages should be analysed in the context of
   associated growth variables.}},

   loss being associated with declining populations and mass gain with

Abstract = {{Vasopressin affects behavior via its two brain receptors, the
   vasopressin 1a and vasopressin 1b receptors (Avpr1b). Recent work from
   our laboratory has shown that disruption of the Avpr1b gene reduces
   intermale aggression and reduces social motivation. Here, we further
   characterized the aggressive phenotype in Avpr1b -/- (knockout) mice. We
   tested maternal aggression and predatory behavior. We also analyzed the
   extent to which food deprivation and competition over food increases
   intermale aggression. We quantified defensive behavior in Avpr1b -/-
   mice and later tested offensive aggression in these same mice. Our
   results show that attack behavior toward a conspecific is consistently
   reduced in Avpr1b -/- mice. Predatory behavior is normal, suggesting
   that the deficit is not because of a global inability to detect and
   attack stimuli. Food deprivation, competition for food and previous
   experience increase aggression in both Avpr1b +/+ and -/- mice. However,
   in these circumstances, the level of aggression seen in knockout mice is
   still less than that observed in wild-type mice. Defensive avoidance
   behaviors, such as boxing and fleeing, are largely intact in knockout
   mice. Avpr1b -/- mice do not display as many `retaliatory' attacks as
   the Avpr1b +/+ mice. Interestingly, when territorial aggression was
   measured following the defensive behavior testing, Avpr1b -/- mice
   typically show less initial aggressive behavior than wild-type mice, but
   do show a significant increase in aggression with repeated testing.
   These studies confirm that deficits in aggression in Avpr1b -/- mice are
   limited to aggressive behavior involving the attack of a conspecific. We
   hypothesize that Avpr1b plays an important role in the central
   processing that couples the detection and perception of social cues
   (which appears normal) with the appropriate behavioral response.}},

Abstract = {{Early nutrition shapes life history. Parents should, therefore, provide
   a diet that will optimize the nutrient intake of their offspring. In a
   number of passerines, there is an often observed, but unexplained, peak
   in spider provisioning during chick development. We show that the
   proportion of spiders in the diet of nestling blue tits, Cyanistes
   caeruleus, varies significantly with the age of chicks but is unrelated
   to the timing of breeding or spider availability. Moreover, this
   parental prey selection supplies nestlings with high levels of taurine
   particularly at younger ages. This amino acid is known to be both vital
   and limiting for mammalian development and consequently found in high
   concentrations in placenta and milk. Based on the known roles of taurine
   in mammalian brain development and function, we then asked whether by
   supplying taurine-rich spiders, avian parents influence the stress
   responsiveness and cognitive function of their offspring. To test this,
   we provided wild blue tit nestlings with either a taurine supplement or
   control treatment once daily from the ages of 2-14 days. Then pairs of
   size- and sex-matched siblings were brought into captivity for
   behavioural testing. We found that juveniles that had received
   additional taurine as neonates took significantly greater risks when
   investigating novel objects than controls. Taurine birds were also more
   successful at a spatial learning task than controls. Additionally, those
   individuals that succeeded at a spatial learning task had shown
   intermediate levels of risk taking. Non-learners were generally very
   risk-averse controls. Early diet therefore has downstream impacts on
   behavioural characteristics that could affect fitness via foraging and
   competitive performance. Fine-scale prey selection is a mechanism by
   which parents can manipulate the behavioural phenotype of offspring.}},

Abstract = {{We studied individual variation in the antipredator response of the
   fishing spider, D. triton, in a variety of developmental and behavioural
   contexts. We examined our data with respect to two general hypotheses:
   (1) startled spiders should modulate their boldness according to
   context-specific variables (e.g. developmental stage, feeding
   opportunities, mating opportunities, parental investment, body
   condition, etc.), and/or (2) an individual spider's boldness will be
   consistent (i.e. positively correlated) across contexts such that
   boldness in any given context is well predicted by boldness in other
   contexts. We found some support for the former, context-specific
   hypothesis and strong support for the latter, `behavioural-syndromes'
   hypothesis. While spiders were significantly bolder in the presence
   versus absence of prey, boldness did not fluctuate with developmental
   stage, mating opportunities, parental investment or condition in the
   manner predicted. Instead, boldness in adult spiders was well predicted
   by a syndrome of positively correlated bold behaviours across functional
   contexts. We suggest that animal behaviour most often reflects a
   combination of context-specific behavioural optimization and
   context-general expression of behavioural syndromes, as was seen in this
   experiment. We further suggest that disentangling the relative magnitude
   of these two general mechanisms in a wide variety of taxa, covering many
   behavioural-ecological contexts, will provide great insights into (1)
   population ecology (e.g. the success of invasive/pest species and the
   failure of threatened species), (2) community ecology (e.g. species
   coexistence, trophic dynamics), and (3) evolutionary ecology (e.g.

Abstract = {{This study has been carried out to ``identify highly sensitive behavior

   doctors (MD) in the Faculty of Medicine. Diagnoses of ON was based on
   the presence of a disorder with obsessive-compulsive personality. The
   study is a cross-sectional research, which reached out to the entire 318
   MD. The ORTO-15 test was used to propose a diagnostic proceeding and to
   try verify the prevalence of ON. Those subjects who were classified
   below 40 from the ORTO-15 test are accepted to have ON.
   Chi-square test, ANOVA (univariate) analysis and logistic regression
   were used for analyses of the data. Mean score of the participants from
   the ORTO-15 test is 39.8 +/- 0.22, and there is no statistical
   difference between women and men. A total of 45.5\% of the residence MD
   involved in the research scored below 40 in the ORTO-15 test. Those who
   do their food shopping themselves, skip a meal with a salad/fruit, care
   about the quality of the things they eat, think that eating outside is
   healthy, look at the content of what they eat and the content of food is
   important in selection of a product score lower in their average marks
   in ORTO-15 and the difference among the groups is statistically
   significant. Food selection of 20.1\% of the male participants and
   38.9\% of the female participants among the residence MD is influenced
   by the programs on nutrition/health in mass-media. The difference
   between the groups is statistically significant (p < 0.05). Female
   medical doctors are more careful than men of their physical appearance
   and weight control and consume less caloric food, which is statistically
   significant. Since those who exhibit ``healthy fanatic{''} eating habits
   may have a risk of ON in the future, it would be useful to conduct
   studies that identify the prevalence of ON in the public. (c) 2007

Abstract = {{Although there is accumulating evidence of growth-rate optimization by
   natural selection, the coevolution of growth rate and risk-taking
   behavior has not been sufficiently documented. The Atlantic silverside
   fish, Menidia menidia, displays countergradient variation in growth
   across a latitudinal gradient: genotypes from Nova Scotia (NS), for
   example, grow in length twofold faster than those from South Carolina
   (SC). Past work has established that fast growth is adaptive in northern
   climates, but the trade-off is poorer swimming performance and higher
   susceptibility to predators. We compared escape behavior and willingness
   to forage under threat of predation among growth genotypes reared and
   tested under common-garden conditions. When chased with a predator
   model, NS fish occupied shelter more quickly than SC fish. When food was
   supplied after a chase, NS fish reemerged from the shelter much more
   quickly than SC fish and immediately commenced feeding, whereas many SC
   fish displayed timid behavior and did not feed. When food was absent
   following a chase, however, NS fish remained in the shelter longer than
   did SC fish and both displayed timid behavior. Hence, the fast-growing
   NS genotype was bolder than SC fish in the presence of food, but shyer
   in the absence of food. These behaviors are adaptive given the
   physiological constraints intrinsic to each genotype. Experiments on
   captive populations of silversides that had been artificially selected
   for fast or slow growth confirmed that foraging behavior is genetically
   correlated with intrinsic growth rate, although in these trials the
   fast-growth genotype was always more bold, regardless of food
   availability, as would be expected in the absence of predators. We
   conclude that risk-taking foraging behavior coevolves adaptively with
   intrinsic growth rate in M. menidia.}},

Abstract = {{Processes of seed predation and dispersal are crucial for tree
   regeneration and forest dynamics. To understand the role of the dung
   beetle, Thorectes lusitanicus (Col., Scarabaeoidea, Geotrupidae) as
   secondary seed disperser in Mediterranean oak forests, its food
   preference was investigated in the field and in the laboratory. This
   paper had for objectives (1) to explore the feeding preferences for
   acorns of the two species available in the field: Quercus suber and
   Quercus canariensis, and (2) to study the olfactory and palatability
   response of T. lusitanicus to different food resources (oak acorns and
   dung) under laboratory conditions. The number of beetles in the field
   was curvilinearly related to the number of acorns, being higher when the
   number of acorns was intermediate. The maximum values of T. lusitanicus
   density corresponded to those plots located under Q. suber trees with
   the highest total weight of acorns. Bioassays with a four-armed
   olfactometer showed that T. lusitanicus was clearly attracted to
   volatiles of Q. suber acorns more than to of dung. Palatability
   bioassays also showed significant preferences for acorns of Q. suber in
   comparison with the typical food previously described for this beetle
   species (dung). According to our results, we suggest that a diet based
   on acorns (due to their high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids)
   probably satisfies the nutritional requirements of T. lusitanicus during
   winter, larval development, and metamorphosis. (c) 2007 The Association

Abstract = {{The concept of farm animal welfare can, for practical purposes, be
   translated into the so-called Five Freedoms.(1) Organic farming aims to
   meet animal welfare needs and should therefore comply with these
   Freedoms. The first Freedom, from hunger and thirst, is met in any
   system properly managed to organic standards. The Freedom from thermal
   and physical discomfort is challenged as organic husbandry systems face
   more climatic extremes. However, they also provide more `control' to the
   animal by offering a choice when seeking warmth or a cool place to lie.
   The Freedom from pain, injury and disease is the most complicated one.
   Organic farming virtually bans mutilations (e.g. debeaking, tail
   docking), although some are still allowed and practised (e.g.
   castration). Organic animals are more exposed to wildlife and at risk of
   contracting infectious diseases. However, it is possible (although not
   proven) that organically managed animals are more resistant to illness.
   The Freedom to express normal behaviour is met through environmental
   enrichment and group housing. The Freedom from fear and distress is
   supported by e.g. extra (social) space. In conclusion, if animal health
   can be maintained, organic farming is very well placed to provide good
   animal welfare. (c) 2007 Society of Chemical Industry.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer is one of the most frequent causes of death in Germany. The
   reasons of various cancer diseases still remain uncertain. There is a
   long-standing discussion about associations between personality,
   depression, stress, and stressful life events, respectively, and the
   development of malignant neoplasms. Evidence for a role of psychosocial
   factors in development of cancer is not unequivocal despite many years
   of research on the subject. Current prospecvertive investigations do not
   support the conventional wisdom of a direct influence for personality in
   the development of cancer. Much of the research has been impaired by
   methodological flaws such as inadequate sample size, failure to adjust
   for potential confounders, lengths of follow-up, use of a variation of
   different measurements of cancer, and psychosocial variables.
   Furthermore, specific personality traits and various life events are
   associated with certain health-related behavior and lifestyle factors,
   e.g., smoking or an unhealthy nutrition. These unhealthy habits can
   increase cancer risk. Psychological parameters may alter immune and
   endocrine function and it has long been hypothesized that, through this
   pathway, psychosocial factors may affect cancer incidence.
   In conclusion, study results to substantiate the role of psychosocial
   factors in the development of various cancers are inconclusive.
   Contradictory results may be explained by methodological shortcomings.
   Further studies are required to pursue this question further.}},

Abstract = {{We used novel techniques for assessing resource value to investigate
   what additions to a barren cage female laboratory rabbits, Oryctolagus
   cuniculus, value. We tested motivation to reach two resources that are
   potentially practical enrichments: a platform (providing a partly
   enclosed space and a raised area) and limited social contact with
   another rabbit through wire mesh and compared these to food and an empty
   space. To reach these resources, rabbits had to pay entry costs (pushing
   through weighted doors) which increased every 2 days. With rising costs,
   rabbits generally rescheduled their behaviour, often reducing visit
   number and increasing visit length. Measures from economics and
   behavioural ecology ranked the relative importance of resources
   similarly (food >= social contact >= platform > empty cage). `Travel
   cost consumer surplus' (the area under a demand curve of price versus
   number of visits) ranked food and social contact similarly, but higher
   than the platform; `aggregate consumer surplus' (the area under a plot
   of weight against the number of rabbits paying each price level for the
   resource) placed food higher than both social contact and the platform;
   `reservation price' (maximum weight pushed) did not discriminate between
   the three resources; and `expenditure rate' (weight x visits/days) again
   ranked food and social contact similarly, but higher than the platform.
   Overall, rabbits' motivation for access to limited social contact thus
   came close to that for food, suggesting that they value this highly.
   Rabbits were almost as strongly motivated to be near a platform, but
   rarely used it, suggesting it might serve a `bolt hole' function. (C)

Abstract = {{Extensive livestock production is a low-input technology, in which means
   of production and labour are kept to a minimum level necessary to ensure
   profitability and arc located ill accordance with fodder resources. It
   enables animals to cypress their natural behaviour such as grazing,
   swimming, rooting and sandbathing. This production method is safer for
   the environment by maintaining landscape and cultural functions and
   using native breeds and varieties adapted to local conditions. It
   reduces risk to product safety and enables higher product quality.
   Because of their low profitability and at the same time other desirable
   characteristics, extensive production systems must be supported at EU
   and national level. This support is implemented under the second pillar
   of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Rural areas cover 93\%, of
   Poland's territory. Poland's natural and soil conditions arc inferior to
   average soil conditions in the European Union, Poland has 215 native
   breeds of animals, including 75 breeds, varieties and lines of farm
   animals that arc particularly useful for extensive production coupled
   with grazing in semi-natural areas. As many as 330,028 farms specialize
   in animal husbandry based oil file g-razing system. A total of 72,138
   farms received agri-environmental subsidies as part of the Rural
   Development Plan for 2004-2006. In 2006, 9194 farms with 220,000 ha of
   agricultural land were recorded and inspected as part of the organic
   farming system. The milk yield of dairy cows averaged 3350 l. Egg
   production was 8,529,000, i.e. almost 190 eggs per layer per year. Oil
   the other hand, as many as 717,393 farms participated in the Less
   Favoured Areas (LFA) scheme, which by design is oriented towards areas
   where extensive farming is needed in varying degrees. The export
   dynamics of Polish products and the considerable interest in Polish
   agricultural anti food products in the EU are evidence that Polish farms
   arc competitive and comply with stringent standards in terms of product
   quality. The undeniable quality of Polish) food, documented by quality
   certificates and marks, proves that Polish food products are unique and
   that the production potential of extensive,c animal production in Poland

Title = {{Starvation affects pre-dispersal behaviour of Erigone spiders}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{308-315}},
Abstract = {{Population studies often focus on demographic and genetic consequences
   of dispersal strategies, generally within an evolutionary framework.
   Adaptive investment in dispersal is generally assessed from single types
   of (pre-)dispersal behaviour that are presumed to reliably reflect the
   dispersal strategy adopted. Various spider families show a striking and
   quantifiable display, known as tiptoe behaviour that prepares
   individuals for take-off prior to (passive) aerial dispersal
   (ballooning). The lack of efficient control mechanisms during ballooning
   prevents individuals from actively selecting a suitable habitat for
   landing. Ballooning dispersal is therefore often regarded as a wind
   lottery preceded by individual-based risk assessment. Our laboratory
   experiments showed that the duration of tiptoe behaviour can be used as
   an indicator of silk thread length, which is related to the potential
   dispersal distance. For two related species, Erigone arctica and E.
   dentiplapis, tiptoe duration decreased independently of sex after
   starvation, while more complex reaction norms were observed for tiptoe
   frequency.
   Because these two aspects of dispersal behaviours show different
   responses towards a simple stress-factor (starvation) in two related
   spider species, we conclude that the level of plasticity in dispersal
   investment can be subject to selective forces affecting different
   dispersal properties in different ways. Our results, hence, plead for a
   more holistic approach when addressing evolutionary and applied
   questions related to dispersal. (C) 2007 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

Abstract = {{We examined activity rates prior to hibernation, age-adjusted body size,
   growth rates, and probability of recapture after spring emergence of
   juveniles from 2 populations of the lizard Psammodromus algirus
   separated by 600-700 m altitude. We captured gravid females, incubated
   the eggs, and released the juveniles into the wild. We used a reciprocal
   transplant design in a year of severe drought to distinguish between
   environmental and population-specific sources of variation. The levels
   of autumn activity differed between release sites (activity was higher
   at the more productive, high-elevation site) and between maternal sites
   of origin (at the low-elevation site, juveniles of low-elevation origin
   were less active than those of high-elevation origin). Although clutch
   mass was similar at both sites, eggs from low-elevation females were
   larger but fewer than those from high-elevation ones. Larger Juveniles
   and those from high-elevation clutches had higher survival rates. The
   juveniles recaptured in autumn at the low-elevation site were smaller as
   neonates than those that were not recaptured until next spring. Our
   results suggest that the scarcity of prey at the low-elevation site is a
   selective pressure resulting in limitation of activity, given the
   increased energy expenditure and risk of predation incurred by active
   lizards. Thus, at the low-elevation site inactivity would be
   advantageous for most juveniles, and only the smaller ones would have to
   remain active frequently enough to accumulate sufficient reserves prior
   to hibernation. This is consistent with the selective advantage of large
   eggs (and small clutches) at the low-elevation site.}},

   aquatic organisms: A review with a Canadian perspective - interactions
   affecting vulnerability}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{19-44}},
Abstract = {{Environmental change can increase the vulnerability of aquatic species
   to toxic chemicals by challenging an organism's aptitude to respond to
   chemicals or to repair toxic injury or by modifying animal behaviours
   like migration or predation. On the other hand, xenobiotics may affect
   the capacity of aquatic species to adapt to environmental challenges
   that come with change (e.g., pathogens, temperature). Across Canada we
   have identified a number of circumstances where chemicals and
   environmental variability have likely worked together to affect
   vulnerability of aquatic organisms. For example in the Maritimes,
   exposure to municipal wastewater or bleached kraft pulp mill effluent
   altered immune function in bivalves and increased their risk of
   developing haemocytic neoplasia, a disease known to cause high
   mortality. Northwest Atlantic cod stocks have experienced large-scale
   changes in environment and exhibit marked seasonal cycles in energy
   reserves. The risk associated with subsequent redistribution of
   persistent chemicals in the body together with nutritional deficiency is
   presently under evaluation since it could affect the recovery of these
   endangered stocks. In the Great Lakes, the introduction of an invasive
   fish species, the alewife, modified the diet of salmonids, which led to
   a deficiency of the vitamin thiamine in eggs causing early mortality.
   Contaminants may interact with thiamine deficiency and thus critically
   impair recruitment of salmonids. Viewing the risks presented by toxic
   chemicals from the point of view of species vulnerability, offers
   managers opportunities to mitigate such risks, for example, through
   habitat, ocean and fisheries management. Further research is needed to
   develop biomarkers of vulnerability, identify most vulnerable life
   stages and populations, to understand the interactions between global
   environmental changes, nutritional status, pathogens and toxic
   chemicals, and to develop integrated approaches to manage vulnerability
   of aquatic ecosystems to toxic chemicals.}},

   SALAMANDERS}},
Journal = {{HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{22}},
Pages = {{31-53}},
Abstract = {{In this paper I review the contributions of analytic and experimental
   research oil intraguild predation and interspecific competition to our
   understanding of population regulation in plethodontid salamanders.
   Henry Wilbur's model of population regulation in amphibians serves as a
   framework for the arguments. Much of the discussion is based on studies
   of eastern North American plethodontids that have been the focus of most
   of the research. Ensembles of plethodontids in this region include
   species with complex fife cycles (i.e., larval development) and simple
   life cycles (i.e., direct development). Interactions between members of
   these two life-history categories appear to be weaker than those within
   categories. Whereas there is no definitive evidence of factors that
   regulate populations of plethodontid salamanders, interspecific
   competition and intraguild predation do appear to contribute in some
   ensembles. Food and space have been identified as limiting resources in
   interspecific competition. Although predation of larger on smaller
   salamanders may be relatively rare in nature, the threat of predation
   appears to promote behavioral responses in members of the smaller
   species that reduce risks but may lower fitness through other effects.
   The role of extralimital predators and competitors in regulation of
   these salamanders is largely untested. ideally, future research should
   involve manipulative experiments on unenclosed field plots that examine
   effects of resources, intraguild competitors and predators, and
   extralimital predators on populations of key species of plethodontids.}},

Title = {{Non-lethal effects of predation in birds}},
Journal = {{IBIS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{150}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{3-17}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Predators can affect individual fitness and population and community
   processes through lethal effects (direct consumption or `density'
   effects), where prey is consumed, or through non-lethal effects
   (trait-mediated effects or interactions), where behavioural compensation
   to predation risk occurs, such as animals avoiding areas of high
   predation risk. Studies of invertebrates, fish and amphibians have shown
   that non-lethal effects may be larger than lethal effects in determining
   the behaviour, condition, density and distribution of animals over a
   range of trophic levels. Although non-lethal effects have been well
   described in the behavioural ecology of birds (and also mammals) within
   the context of anti-predation behaviour, their role relative to lethal
   effects is probably underestimated. Birds show many behavioural and
   physiological changes to reduce direct mortality from predation and
   these are likely to have negative effects on other aspects of their
   fitness and population dynamics, as well as affecting the ecology of
   their own prey and their predators. As a consequence, the effects of
   predation in birds are best measured by trade-offs between maximizing
   instantaneous survival in the presence of predators and acquiring or
   maintaining resources for long-term survival or reproduction. Because
   avoiding predation imposes foraging costs, and foraging behaviour is
   relatively easy to measure in birds, the foraging-predation risk
   trade-off is probably an effective framework for understanding the
   importance of non-lethal effects, and so the population and community
   effects of predation risk in birds and other animals. Using a trade-off
   approach allows us to predict better how changes in predator density
   will impact on population and community dynamics, and how animals
   perceive and respond to predation risk, when non-lethal effects decouple
   the relationship between predator density and direct mortality rate. The
   trade-off approach also allows us to identify where predation risk is
   structuring communities because of avoidance of predators, even when
   this results in no observable direct mortality rate.}},

Title = {{Homology in a context dependent predatory behavior in spiders (Araneae)}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARACHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{352-359}},
Abstract = {{Stereotyped behaviors have been routinely used as characters for
   phylogeny inference, but the same cannot be said of the plastic aspects
   of performance, which routinely are taken as a result of ecological
   processes. In this paper we examine the evolution of one of these
   plastic behavioral phenotypes, thus fostering a bridge between
   ecological and evolutionary processes. Foraging behavior in spiders is
   context dependent in many aspects, since it varies with prey type and
   size, spider nutritional and developmental state, previous experience
   and, in webweavers, is dependent on the structure of the web. Reeling is
   a predatory tactic typical of cobweb weavers (Theridiidae), in which the
   spider moves the prey toward her by pulling the capture thread (gumfoot)
   to which it is adhered. Predatory reeling is dependent on the gumfoot
   for its expression, and has not been previously reported in orbweavers.
   In order to investigate the evolution of this web dependent behavior, we
   built artificial, pseudogumfoot lines in orbwebs and registered
   parameters of the predatory tactics in this modified web. Aspects of the
   predatory tactics of 240 individuals (12 species in 4 families) were
   measured, and the resulting data were optimized on the phylogeny of
   Orbiculariae. All species perform predatory reeling with the
   pseudogumfoot lines. Thus, predatory reeling is homologous for the whole
   Orbiculariae group. In nature, holes made by insects in ecribellate orbs
   produce pseudogumfoot lines (similar to out experimentally modified
   webs), and thus reeling occurred naturally in ecribellates.
   Nevertheless, outside lab conditions, predatory reeling does not occur
   among cribellate orbweavers, so that this behavior could not have been
   selected for in the cribellate ancester of orbweavers. Cribellate
   spiders are flexible enough as to present novel and adaptive predatory

Title = {{Changes in body mass and organ size during remigial moult in common

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{39}},

Pages = {{35-40}},

Abstract = {{The ``cost-benefit{''} hypothesis states that avian body organs show
   mass changes consistent with the trade-off between their functional
   importance and maintenance cost, which may vary throughout the annual
   cycle. Flightless moulting common scoter Melanitta nigra in Danish
   marine waters select rich undisturbed offshore feeding areas lacking
   predators, suggesting active feeding during moult. We tested four
   predictions relating to organ size during flightlessness in moulting
   male common scoter under this hypothesis. Namely that (i) pectoral
   muscles would show atrophy followed by hypertrophy, but that there would
   be no change in (ii) leg muscles and heart (the locomotory architecture
   required to sustain diving for food), (iii) digestive organs and liver
   (required to process food), or (iv) fat deposits (because birds could
   fulfil daily energy requirements from locally abundant food resources).
   Dissection of scoters collected at different stages during wing moult
   south of the Danish island of L ae so provided data on organ size that
   were consistent with these predictions. Pectoral muscle mass showed a
   c.23\% atrophy during the middle of the flightless period relative to
   that at the end of moult. There was no significant loss in leg muscle,
   heart, digestive organs (except gizzard mass), liver, fat reserves or
   body mass with remigial growth. These findings are consistent with the
   hypothesis that common scoter moult in a rich feeding area, and rely on
   their diet to meet the nutritional requirements of remigial moult. These
   results differ in detail from those of a similar study of terrestrial
   feeding moulting greylag geese Anser anser, but because of the widely
   differing ecology of the species concerned, both sets of findings
   provide strong support for the hypothesis that variations in phenotypic
   plasticity in size of fat stores, locomotor and digestive organs can be
   interpreted as evolutionary adaptations to meet the conflicting needs
   (feather growth, nutritional challenges and predator avoidance) of the
   flightless moult period in different Anatidae species.}},

Title = {{Limited foraging flexibility: increased foraging effort by a marine
   predator does not buffer against scarce prey}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{366}},
Pages = {{245-258}},
Abstract = {{Flexibility in activity time budgets allows animals to cope with
   heterogeneous and changing environments. Many marine predators, such as
   seabirds, exhibit flexibility in their foraging behaviour to buffer
   reproductive success against periods of low prey availability. Over 3
   years, 2004 to 2006, we studied the foraging behaviour of a threatened
   seabird, the marbled murrelet Brachyramphus marmoratus in southwestern
   Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. An information-theoretic
   approach was used to compare among factors (temporal, spatial,
   environmental, and competitors) that may influence diving activity. We
   also quantified local prey availability by hydroacoustic surveys and
   regional oceanographic conditions (chlorophyll a concentrations and
   upwelling indices) to investigate relationships between diving activity,
   food supply and environmental conditions. Prey indices varied spatially,
   seasonally, and annually, showing reduced prey availability during
   incubation and chick-rearing of 2005. Upwelling indices and chlorophyll
   a concentrations, as an index of primary productivity, were delayed in
   2005. Year and breeding phase had the greatest impact on diving
   activity, with additional variation among sites. Murrelets increased
   diving activity in years and seasons with scarce prey and poor
   oceanographic conditions (incubation and chick-rearing 2005) and
   decreased diving activity at sites with high prey availability. There
   was a linear relationship between diving activity and food availability,
   suggesting no clear thresholds in response to decreases in prey. Despite
   their flexible activity budgets, increased foraging effort by murrelets
   in 2005 was inadequate to ensure average levels of reproductive success.
   Thus, flexible foraging behaviour by murrelets may be ineffective to
   buffer reproductive success when environmental conditions are extremely
   poor.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing life expectancy, cognitive decline is becoming a
   major public health problem. Selenium is thought to be involved in the
   maintenance of functional brain activity and in protection against
   oxidative stress. This idea is supported by the finding that the brain
   retains high selenium levels under conditions of persistent dietary
   selenium deficiency. Recently, we showed that in human, aging was
   associated with a decrease in plasma selenium while a lowered selenium
   status was associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline,
   suggesting that selenium decrease during ageing should not be
   underestimated as an emphasizing of brain ageing. The aim of this study
   was to evaluate the effects of a selenium restricted versus normal diet
   on brain antioxidant status and behavioural reactivity of old rats. In
   rats fed selenium restricted diet, plasma Se and GPx activity decreased
   significantly. After 12 weeks of restricted-diet, the fall in plasma Se
   was of 30\% but only 5\% in cerebellum. In brain we observe a decrease
   on complex I and IV of the mitochondria respiratory chain, but no
   significant alterations in redox status assessed by TBARS, SH groups,
   GPX, GSH and antioxidant power using ferric reducing antioxidant power
   (FRAP). Furthermore, the level of oxidative DNA cortex damage assessed
   by comet assay was similar between the groups. Se deficient animals
   exhibited a behaviour similar to their control when placed in a open
   field test. Our results suggest that a Se deficient diet during ageing
   could be associated with an accelerated brain ageing monitored by a
   decrease in mitochondrial complex I and IV but did not support the
   hypothesis of an increased oxidative stress. Further study is now
   necessary to understand by which mechanism Se acts on brain
   mitochondrial function and complementary tests on other brain function
   should be worked out.}},

Abstract = {{Noncardiac or unexplained chest pain can be defined as recurrent
   angina-like or substernal chest pain thought to be unrelated to the
   heart after a reasonable cardiac evaluation. We examined the personality
   profiles of patients complaining of noncardiac chest pain (NCCP) and
   healthy control subjects using the Temperament and Character Inventory
   (TCI), and determined whether the data acquired were related to the
   depressive status of the patients. We assessed 70 patients (ages 18-65
   years) referred to a cardiology practice with NCCP. Eighty control
   subjects, matched for age, gender, and education level, were included in
   the study. Each subject was evaluated with TCI, Beck Depression
   Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The TCI assesses four
   dimensions of temperament, namely, novelty seeking, harm avoidance,
   reward dependence and persistence and three dimensions of character,
   being self-directedness, cooperativeness and self-transcendence. We
   found higher harm avoidance scores and lower self-directedness and
   cooperativeness scores in patients group than those in healthy control
   subjects. High harm avoidance scores were associated with high
   depression level. However, all the character subdimensions were
   associated with an elevated level of depression. In the stepwise
   regression model, the presence of NCCP was determined by harm avoidance
   and self-directedness levels. These findings suggest state and trait
   dependence of harm avoidance, and strong state dependence of
   self-directedness scores in NCCP patients. When interpreting data
   regarding personality measured by the TCI in NCCP patients, the effects
   of depressive symptomatology should be taken into account.}},

Volume = {{179}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1142-1153}},
Abstract = {{Clonal plant networks consist of interconnected individuals (ramets) of
   different sizes and ages. They represent heterogeneous ramet assemblages
   with marked differences in quality and attractiveness for herbivores.
   Here, feeding preferences of a generalist herbivore (Spodoptera exigua)
   for differently-aged ramets of Trifolium repens were studied, and
   changes in herbivore preference in response to systemic defense
   induction were investigated.
   Dual-choice tests were used to assess the preference of herbivores for
   young versus mature ramets of induced and uninduced plants,
   respectively. Additionally, leaf traits related to nutrition,
   biomechanics and chemical defense were measured to explain variation in
   tissue quality and herbivore preference.
   Young ramets were heavily damaged in control plants. After systemic
   defense induction, damage on young ramets was greatly reduced, while
   damage on mature ramets increased slightly. Defense induction increased
   leaf strength and thickness, decreased leaf soluble carbohydrates and
   substantially changed phenolic composition of undamaged ramets connected
   to attacked individuals.
   Systemic induced resistance led to a more dispersed feeding pattern
   among ramets of different ages. It is proposed that inducible defense
   acts as a risk-spreading strategy in clonal plants by equalizing
   herbivore preference within the clone, thereby avoiding extended
   selective feeding on valuable plant tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic research has focused on identifying linkages between
   polymorphisms and phenotypic traits to explain variations in complex
   biologies. However, the magnitude of these linkages has not been
   particularly high. Conversely, the ability of developmental plasticity
   to generate biological variation from one genotype is well understood,
   while interest has emerged in the clinical significance of epigenetic
   processes, particularly those influenced by the external environment.
   Enviromnental cues in early development may induce responses that
   provide adaptive advantage later in life. The benefit of such responses
   depends on the fidelity of the prediction of the future environment.
   Life history and physiological changes mediated through epigenetic
   processes then follow, determining the later phenotype. Developmental
   mismatch, leading to disease, can arise from discordance between the
   fetal enviromnent, which is relatively constant across generations, and
   the postnatal nutritional environment, which can change drastically
   within and between generations. Metabolic disorders represent the
   outcome of an individual living in an energetically inappropriate
   environment. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that individual
   capacity to live in a given energetic environment is influenced by
   developmental factors acting through epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic
   biomarkers may be able to identify a risk of developmental mismatch and
   thus offer the opportunity for nutritional or other intervention.

Abstract = {{To elucidate the potential for colony growth and the dispersal of aphids

   Aphis craccivora Koch and the non-ant-tended Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris

   rate with density was more conspicuous in Ac. pisum than Ap. craccivora.
   The success rate of dispersal was higher in Ac. pisum than Ap.
   craccivora. These results would be derived from the higher ability of
   dispersal by walking in Ac. pisum than Ap. craccivora. The longer legs,
   higher walking speed, and stronger tolerance of starvation in Ac. pisum
   might result in a higher ability of dispersal by walking. These traits
   may have developed in relation to non-ant attendance, because Ac. pisum
   aphids frequently escape from natural enemies by dropping from the host
   plant. On the other hand, Ap. craccivora have not developed
   morphological and behavioral traits concerning dispersal by walking,
   because increasing colony size without dispersal is likely to be
   advantageous for ant attraction. Escaping behaviors of Ap. craccivora
   from natural enemies have not been well developed due to the ant's
   defense against natural enemies. The proportion of alatae in Ap.
   craccivora was higher than in Ac. pisum instead of a lesser ability for
   dispersal by walking in Ap. craccivora. The differences in ant
   attendance have been influenced in the development of morphological and
   behavioral traits concerning the dispersal ability, and then, different
   potentials for reproduction and dispersal have developed in ant-tended

Abstract = {{Introduction: Discourses around men's health refer to greater
   risk-taking behaviour, the social construct of masculinity and
   differences between men's and women's rates of death and disease. These
   ways of describing `men's health' may be inadequate, but many men,
   particularly rural men, experience health disadvantage.
   Method: A written postal survey was used to collect demographic data,
   eating behaviours using the Food Habit Score, alcohol use, physical
   activity behaviours using an adaptation of the Pilot Study of the
   Fitness of Australians and attitudes to health and body image. Subjects
   and Setting: The survey was sent to 2000 randomly selected men in two
   New South Wales Riverina federal electorates in June 2004, with 529
   returns (27\% response). Main outcome measures: Food Habit Scores;
   regularity of physical activity; frequency and amount of alcohol use;
   degree of agreement with statements about attitudes to health and body
   image. Statistical analyses: Descriptive statistics using frequencies
   and cross tabulations were performed with further univariate analyses
   conducted at a level of significance of 5\%.
   Results: Approximately one-third of the men achieved a poor Food Habit
   Score (<= 10 out of 20). Age was not significantly associated with diet
   quality, but those in higher skilled occupations had a better diet,
   compared with those in less skilled occupations (p<0.01). Eighty-seven
   percent of the respondents drank alcohol and of those, almost half
   consumed only one or two alcoholic drinks at each session. Nearly a
   quarter of the men reported that they had more than four drinks on each
   drinking occasion. Almost half the men did no `vigorous' exercise, but
   42\% did heavy labouring/gardening at least three times a week. The men
   with poor dietary habits were more likely to agree with less desirable
   attitudes to health, such as needing a health scare before changing
   lifestyle behaviours (p<0.001). The low response rate (27\%) limits the
   ability to generalise these results to the whole male population in the
   Farrer and Riverina federal electorates.
   Conclusion: This study describes the eating and physical activity
   behaviours of a sample of rural men and highlights the attitudes that
   are associated with poor lifestyle behaviours among this hard to reach
   group. Implications: Health promotion programs targeting men, especially
   rural men, should address existing attitudes to health which may impact
   on lifestyle behaviours.}},

Booktitle = {{WELFARE OF PIGS: FROM BIRTH TO SLAUGHTER}},
Year = {{2008}},
Pages = {{97-131}},
Abstract = {{With reference primarily to the `Five Freedoms' defined by the Farm
   Animal Welfare Council (London, UK), the present chapter reviews the
   behavioural and physiological welfare requirements of domestic piglets
   from birth until weaning: (1) comfort and housing requirements; (2)
   nutrition and welfare; (3) viability and health; (4) behavioural needs;
   and (5) fear, stress and suffering. The general aim is to evaluate the
   effects of housing and management practices on the biological responses
   (behaviour, physiology, health, performance) of piglets in relation to
   their needs. Suitable and practicable modifications are put forward for
   the improvement of welfare under commercial production conditions.
   Whereas serious welfare problems directly caused by nutrition and
   disease are less prevalent because of their obvious and immediate
   economic impacts, some welfare impairments still occur that result from
   psychobiological suffering and insufficient attention to the comfort
   requirements and behavioural needs of piglets. Some of the aspects that
   can help to improve the piglet welfare are discussed in this chapter.
   High mortality of piglets after farrowing is a major problem. This can
   be countered by ensuring adequate design of the farrowing environment to
   minimise the risk of crushing, by providing an optimal thermal
   environment and sufficient and comfortable lying space for all piglets,
   and by increasing supervision at farrowing and during the suckling
   period. The detrimental effects of tail docking, teeth resection and
   castration on welfare can be diminished by modifying or improving the
   techniques themselves; by using analgesic protocols; and by promoting
   the development of general and local anaesthetics that alleviate both
   acute and chronic pain. The abrupt weaning of piglets has been linked to
   many critical aspects of welfare (e.g. aggression, rearrangement of
   environment and feed) which can be improved by implementing a more
   gradual weaning process using sow-controlled systems and/or mixing of
   piglets prior to weaning. In addition, these alternative housing
   practices combined with environmental enrichment allow the animals to
   display more of their natural behavioural repertoire and to experience
   various stimuli which can help to prevent boredom and behavioural
   disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The ecological impacts of the indirect effects of predators are well
   established, but the evolutionary consequences are unknown. Predators
   often decrease prey density, which indirectly increases the resources
   available to surviving prey. This ecological effect could provide a link
   to evolution because it is generally assumed that resource availability
   influences life history evolution. Yet, predictions from theory that
   consider food availability are inconsistent, and evidence for an
   important role of resources in shaping life history evolution is absent.
   We compared life history traits in a Trinidadian killifish, Rivulus
   hartii, from fish communities that differ in predation intensity;
   predators are associated with lower population density and faster growth
   rates. To determine whether the indirect effects of predators influence
   evolutionary change, we reared second-generation-born fish under two
   food levels that approximated natural differences in resources between
   communities. Rivulus from sites with predators are younger and smaller
   at maturity. They have increased reproductive investment and produce
   many small eggs and smaller hatchlings. Such divergence is predicted as
   a direct effect of predation. We also found significant interactions
   between predator community and food level for age and size at maturity,
   fecundity, and egg size. These interactions, whereby the differences
   between communities were more pronounced at high-food levels, argue that
   evolution in Rivulus has been influenced by the indirect effects of
   predators mediated through resource availability. Rivulus from sites
   with predators better exploit the higher resources in those habitats.
   Therefore, both direct and indirect effects of predators have
   evolutionary consequences.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of group size and the number of helpers on reproductive
   success is crucial to understand the evolution and maintenance of
   cooperative breeding. In northern Spain, carrion crows form kin-groups
   (three to nine individuals) where up to five individuals contribute to
   rearing the young. Using data from 99 different territories, followed
   over 10 years, we showed that group size was positively correlated with
   the annual number of fledglings produced, after controlling for the
   potential confounding effect of territory quality. This occurred
   through: (1) an increased probability for larger groups of renesting
   after early nest failure; (2) a higher probability of nest success; and
   (3) a higher number of fledglings produced in successful attempts.
   Video-recorded observations at the nests showed that chicks received
   more food in larger groups during the first 10 days of life, when the
   risk of starvation is highest, suggesting a role of allofeeding by
   additional carers in augmenting the reproductive success of a group. In
   crows, indirect and direct benefits through increased production of
   young are therefore available to nonbreeding group members. (c) 2007 The

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{A central question in behavioral ecology has been why animals live in
   groups. Previous theories about the evolution of sociality focused on
   the potential benefits of decreased risk of predation, increased
   foraging or feeding efficiency, and mutual aid in defending resources
   and/or rearing offspring. This paper argues that access to mutualistic
   endosymbiotic microbes is an underappreciated benefit of group living
   and sets out to reinvigorate Troyer's hypothesis that the need to obtain
   cellulolytic microbes from conspecifics influenced the evolution of
   social behavior in herbivores and to extend it to nonherbivores. This
   extension is necessary because the benefits of endosymbionts are not
   limited to nutrition; endosymbionts also help protect their hosts from
   pathogens. When hosts must obtain endosymbionts from conspecifics, they
   are forced to interact. Thus, complex forms of sociality may be more
   likely to evolve when hosts must repeatedly obtain endosymbionts from
   conspecifics than when endosymbionts can be obtained either directly
   from the environment, are vertically transmitted, or when repeated
   inoculations are not necessary. Observations from a variety of taxa are
   consistent with the ideas that individuals benefit from group living by
   gaining access to endosymbionts and the complexity of social behavior is
   associated with the mode of acquisition of endosymbionts. Ways to test
   this theory include (a) experiments designed to examine the effects of
   endosymbionts on host fitness and how endosymbionts are obtained and (b)
   using phylogenetic analyses to examine endosymbiont-host coevolution
   with the goal of determining the relationship between the mode of
   endosymbiont acquisition and host sociality.}},

Abstract = {{Fetal programming encompasses the role of developmental plasticity in
   response to environmental and nutritional signals during early life and
   its potential adverse consequences (risk of cardiovascular, metabolic

   adverse long-term effects independently of obvious effects on fetal
   growth. Adverse long-term effects reflect a mismatch between early
   (fetal and neonatal) environmental conditions and the conditions that
   the individual will confront later in life. The mechanisms underlying
   this risk remain unclear. However, experimental data in rodents and
   recent observations in humans suggest that epigenetic changes in

Abstract = {{We illustrate the theoretical plausibility that fishery removal of
   sharks can indirectly alter predation pressure on different fish species
   via the behavioural responses of mesoconsumers released from predator
   intimidation. Our dynamic state variable model of foraging decisions by
   harbour seals, a mesopredator, predicted indirect effects of the removal
   of Pacific sleeper sharks on two species consumed by seals, Pacific
   herring and walleye pollock, as mediated by seal behaviour. Herring, a
   fatty fish, form near-surface aggregations that often are ephemeral and
   widely dispersed. Pollock are found in the deeper strata preferred by
   sharks and have lower energy density than herring, but also are larger
   and their more continuous distribution potentially makes them the more
   predictable resource for seals. During simulations, predation risk from
   sharks produced an asymmetric trophic cascade mediated by the seal's
   underutilisation of deeper, riskier strata. Risk management by seals
   reduced mortality on pollock, which required riskier access in deep
   strata, while increasing mortality on herring, which could be accessed
   with less risk in shallow strata. This effect, however, attenuated if
   herring were scarcer and seal energy state was poor. During shark
   removal scenarios, seals shifted to deeper strata, increasing pollock
   consumption and substantially decreasing use of herring; the
   proportional change was greatest if seals were in good energy state.
   Prior studies have addressed how shark declines might affect community
   structure through density responses by species consumed by sharks;
   earlier models incorporating antipredator behaviour of the mesopredator
   (i.e. Ecosim/Ecospace) allow for activity reduction but not for the
   spatial shifts that altered the asymmetric trophic cascade in our
   simulations. Our results suggest that shark declines might have stronger
   ecological consequences than previously recognised if we account for
   spatial and diet shifts by mesoconsumers released from shark
   intimidation.}},

Title = {{The emergence of leaders and followers in foraging pairs when the
   qualities of individuals differ}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Foraging in groups offers animals a number of advantages,
   such as increasing their likelihood of finding food or detecting and
   avoiding predators. In order for a group to remain together, there has
   to be some degree of coordination of behaviour and movement between its
   members (which may in some cases be initiated by a decision-making
   leader, and in other cases may emerge as an underlying property of the
   group). For example, behavioural synchronisation is a phenomenon where
   animals within a group initiate and then continue to conduct identical
   behaviours, and has been characterised for a wide range of species. We
   examine how a pair of animals should behave using a state-dependent
   approach, and ask what conditions are likely to lead to behavioural
   synchronisation occurring, and whether one of the individuals is more
   likely to act as a leader.
   Results: The model we describe considers how the energetic gain,
   metabolic requirements and predation risks faced by the individuals
   affect measures of their energetic state and behaviour (such as the
   degree of behavioural synchronisation seen within the pair, and the
   value to an individual of knowing the energetic state of its colleague).
   We explore how predictable changes in these measures are in response to
   changes in physiological requirements and predation risk. We also
   consider how these measures should change when the members of the pair
   are not identical in their metabolic requirements or their
   susceptibility to predation. We find that many of the changes seen in
   these measures are complex, especially when asymmetries exist between
   the members of the pair.
   Conclusion: Analyses are presented that demonstrate that, although these
   general patterns are robust, care needs to be taken when considering the
   effects of individual differences, as the relationship between
   individual differences and the resulting qualitative changes in
   behaviour may be complex. We discuss how these results are related to
   experimental observations, and how the model and its predictions could
   be extended.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Foraging behaviour is an essential ecological process
   linking different trophic levels. A central assumption of foraging
   theory is that food selection maximises the fitness of the consumer. It
   remains unknown, however, whether animals use innate or learned
   behaviour to discriminate food rewards. While many studies demonstrated
   that previous experience is a strong determinant of complex food choices
   such as diet mixing, the response to simple nutritional stimuli, such as
   sugar concentrations, is often believed to be innate.
   Results: Here we show that previous experience determines the ability to
   track changes in sugar composition in same-aged individuals of a
   short-lived migratory songbird, the garden warbler (Sylvia borin).
   Although birds received identical foods for seven months prior to the
   experiment, wild-caught birds achieved higher sugar intake rates than
   hand-raised birds when confronted with alternative, differently
   coloured, novel food types. Hand-raised and wild birds did not differ in
   their initial colour selection or overall food intake, but wild birds
   were quicker to adjust food choice to varying sugar intake.
   Conclusion: Over a period of at least seven months, broader previous
   experience translates into a higher plasticity of food choice leading to
   higher nutrient intake. Our results thus highlight the need to address
   previous long-term experience in foraging experiments. Furthermore, they
   show that hand-raised animals are often poor surrogates for testing the
   foraging behaviour of wild animals.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Because individuals high on hostility may be at risk for alcohol

   Mood, craving for alcohol, and salivary cortisol levels (CORT) were

   rate (HR) was measured during stress-induction. Results: HiHs compared
   to LoHs scored higher on the depression and anxiety trait scales as well

   Opposite to the predictions, tryptophan enhancement selectively
   facilitated stress-induced increase in craving in the HiHs. Conclusion:
   Among heavy drinkers HiHs report higher craving for alcohol and show
   greater reactivity to stress as measured by CORT and negative mood. The
   effects of stress on craving in HiHs may be mediated by a serotonergic

Abstract = {{Wolf, Canis lupus, recolonization of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem
   provides a rare opportunity to identify behaviours facilitating
   coexistence between sympatric canids. We investigated interactions
   between coyotes, Canis latrans, and recolonizing wolves at ungulate
   carcasses in Montana's Madison Range. We used a field-experimental study
   design consisting of a two-level carcass treatment (wolf presence, wolf
   absence) to assess factors influencing coyote risk assessment, carrion
   consumption and aggressive encounters with wolves. Socially dominant
   coyotes (alphas and betas) responded to wolf presence by increasing the
   proportion of time spent vigilant while scavenging. Vigilance behaviour
   was more pronounced when scavenging closer to structurally complex
   vegetation where lateral occlusion inhibited the ability of coyotes to
   scan for, and possibly escape from, returning wolves. Despite greater
   time spent vigilant, alpha coyotes consumed the greatest amount of
   carrion biomass by feeding on carcasses in earlier stages of consumption
   when organs and large muscle tissues were still present. This finding
   suggests that alpha coyotes might trade off greater risk for
   higher-quality food items. Coyotes would aggressively confront wolves:
   numerical advantage by coyotes and the stage of carcass consumption were
   influential in determining whether coyotes were able to displace wolves
   from carcasses. Coyotes relied on a gradient of risk-sensitive
   behaviours, ranging from elevated vigilance to aggressive confrontation,
   to manage risk associated with wolf presence. Identification of these
   behaviours, and their sensitivity to numeric and social factors, is an
   important step in elucidating mechanisms of resource partitioning in

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Reduced fetal growth has been closely associated with an increased risk
   for the development of chronic disease in later life. Accumulating
   evidence indicates that fetal exposure to excess glucocorticoids
   represents a critical mechanism underlying this association.
   Approximately 7\% of pregnant women are at risk of preterm delivery and
   these women are routinely treated with synthetic glucocorticoids (sGC)
   between 24 and 34 of weeks gestation to improve neonatal outcome. Animal
   studies have demonstrated that maternally administered sGC crosses the
   placenta, affecting fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
   development, resulting in changes in HPA axis function that persist
   throughout life. These changes appear to be modulated at the level of
   glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) in
   the brain and pituitary. As the HPA axis interacts with many other
   physiological pathways, the changes in endocrine function are also
   sex-specific and age-dependent. Alterations in behavior, particularly
   locomotion, in animals exposed to sGC in utero have also been
   demonstrated. Consistent with the finding in animal models, emerging
   human data are indicating attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder
   (ADHD)-like symptoms in children exposed to repeated courses of sGC in
   utero. This behavioral phenotype is likely linked to alterations in
   dopamine (DA) signaling, suggesting that sGC are able to permanently
   modify or `program' this system. Finally, it is emerging that changes in
   HPA axis function and behavior following antenatal exposure to sGC are
   transgenerational and likely involve epigenetic mechanisms. A
   comprehensive understanding of the acute and long-term impact of sGC
   exposure in utero is necessary to begin to develop recommendations and
   treatment options for pregnant women at risk of preterm delivery. (C)

Abstract = {{Because hormones mediate physiological or behavioral responses to
   intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli, they can help us understand how animals
   adapt their foraging decisions to energetic demands of reproduction.
   Thus, the hormone corticosterone deserves specific attention because of
   its influence on metabolism, food intake and locomotor activities. We
   examined the relationships between baseline corticosterone levels and
   foraging behavior or mass gain at sea in a diving seabird, the Adelie
   penguin, Pygoscelis adeliae. Data were obtained from free-ranging
   penguins during the brooding period (Adelie Land, Antarctica) by using
   satellite transmitters and time-depth-recorders. The birds were weighed
   and blood sampled before and after a foraging trip (pre-trip and
   post-trip corticosterone levels, respectively). Penguins with elevated
   pre-trip corticosterone levels spent less time at sea and stayed closer
   to the colony than penguins with low pre-trip corticosterone levels.
   These short trips were associated with a higher foraging effort in terms
   of diving activity and a lower mass gain at sea than long trips.
   According to previous studies conducted on seabird species, these
   results suggest that penguins with elevated pre-trip corticosterone
   levels might maximize the rate of energy delivery to the chicks at the
   expense of their body reserves. Moreover, in all birds, corticosterone
   levels were lower post-foraging than pre-foraging. This decrease could
   result from either the restoration of body reserves during the foraging
   trip or from a break in activity at the end of the foraging trip. This
   study demonstrates for the first time in a diving predator the close
   relationships linking foraging behavior and baseline corticosterone
   levels. We suggest that slight elevations in pre-trip corticosterone
   levels could play a major role in breeding effort by facilitating
   foraging activity in breeding seabirds. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Global warming impels species to track their shifting habitats or adapt

   individual dispersal. In many animals, dispersal behaviour is plastic,
   but how organisms with plastic dispersal respond to climate change is
   basically unknown. Here, we report the analysis of interannual dispersal
   change from 16 years of monitoring a wild population of the common
   lizard, and a 12-year manipulation of lizards' diet intended to
   disentangle the direct effect of temperature rise on dispersal from its
   effects on resource availability. We show that juvenile dispersal has
   declined dramatically over the last 16 years, paralleling the rise of
   spring temperatures during embryogenesis. A mesoscale model of
   metapopulation dynamics predicts that in general dispersal inhibition
   will elevate the extinction risk of metapopulations exposed to
   contrasting effects of climate warming.}},

Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE ZOOLOGY}},

Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{3-10}},

Abstract = {{Some small mammal populations require human interference to conserve
   rare or threatened species or to minimize adverse effects in plant
   production. Without a thorough understanding about how small rodents
   behave in their environment and consideration of how they react to
   management efforts, management will not be optimal. Social behavior,
   spatial and temporal activity patterns, predator avoidance and other
   behavioral responses can affect pest rodent management. Some of these
   behavioral patterns and their causes have been well studied. However,
   their impact on pest rodent management, especially for novel management
   approaches, is not always clear. Habitat manipulation occurs necessarily
   through land use and intentionally to reduce shelter and food
   availability and to increase predation pressure on rodents. Rodents
   often respond to decreased vegetation height with reduced movements and
   increased risk sensitivity in their feeding behavior. This seems to
   result mainly from an elevated perceived predation risk. Behavioral
   responses may lessen the efficacy of the management because the desired
   effects of predators might be mediated. It remains largely unknown to
   what extent such responses can compensate at the population level for
   the expected consequences of habitat manipulation and how population
   size and crop damage are affected. It is advantageous to understand how
   target and non-target species react to habitat manipulation to maximize
   the management effects by appropriate techniques, timing and spatial
   scale without causing unwanted effects at the system level.}},

   substrate types (medium sand and coarse gravel) in indoor artificial
   channels. Changes in the head capsule width, mesothoracic wing pad
   length, total body length, body mass, and behavior were studied over a
   4-wk period. Morphometric and behavioral differences were primarily
   associated with the mechanism of refugium use (although confounded by
   substrate size), which reduced energy expenditure. Growth (body size and
   mass) was reduced in sand (absence of refugia) relative to growth in
   gravel, regardless of current velocity, and nymphs made almost no
   investment in body length (variation in allometry). The effect of
   current velocity on behavior was less marked in sand than in gravel
   because of a possible confounding effect of direct exposure of nymphs to
   flow on sand (i.e., no available refugia). In sand, individuals were
   located mainly on the food source (erect leaf discs) at current
   velocities of 3 cm/s, but feeding was depressed. Therefore, nymphal
   development was slow on sand. In gravel, nymphs followed different
   developmental trajectories depending on current velocity because
   hydraulic stress seemed to trigger accelerated development. Our study
   shows that physical factors associated with habitat structure can result
   in adaptive phenotypic plasticity among aquatic insect populations, and
   that a lack of shelter might have a strong impact on stonefly fitness.}},

Journal = {{PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},

Abstract = {{Rationale Early environment can shape the development and function of
   the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system and represents a possible
   risk factor for adult pathologies. One critical variable in the early
   environment is nutrition, and exposure to high fat (HF) in adulthood is
   known to change this DA system.
   Objectives We tested whether perinatal HF intake in rats could have
   long-term effects on DA function and behavior in adult offspring.
   Materials and methods Rat dams were fed either a control (5\% fat, CD)
   or high fat (30\% fat, HF) diet during the last week of gestation and
   lactation, and adult offspring were tested (PND 56-90) after weaning on
   CD. Locomotor responses to acute and repeated doses of D-amphetamine
   (AMP, 0.75 mg/kg bw) were determined as were indices of DA function in
   the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and the
   prefrontal cortex (PFC).
   Results Adult HF offspring displayed increased tyrosine hydroxylase
   expression in the VTA and NAc and significant increases in DA and DOPAC
   content in the NAc, suggesting an elevated DA tone in this target field.
   In the NAc, there were no significant changes in D1, D2 receptors, or DA
   transporter (DAT) levels between diet groups. Perinatal HF feeding
   reduced AMP-induced locomotion and behavioral sensitization to AMP,
   suggesting that early diet might have caused long-lasting
   desensitization of postsynaptic receptor mechanisms in the NAc.
   Conclusions Our results demonstrate that both synthetic activity in VTA
   neurons and the responsiveness of accumbens DA neurons is altered by
   maternal nutrition. These effects subside long after termination of
   exposure to the HF diet.}},

   enhancement}},
Journal = {{SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT PREVENTION AND POLICY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Performance enhancement (PE) is a natural and essential
   ingredient of competitive sport. Except for nutritional supplement
   contamination, accidental use of doping is highly unlikely. It requires
   deliberation, planning and commitment; and is influenced by a host of
   protective and risk factors.
   Hypothesis: In the course of their career, athletes constantly set goals
   and make choices regarding the way these goals can be achieved. The
   cycle of choice-goal commitment-execution feedback on goal
   attainment-goal evaluation/adjustment has numerous exit points, each
   providing an opportunity for behaviour change, which may or may not be
   related to the use of prohibited methods. The interplay between
   facilitating and inhibiting systemic and personality factors, constantly
   influenced by situational factors could result in an outcome vector of
   `doping attitudes', which combines with subjective norms to influence
   intentions to choose prohibited PE methods. These influences also vary
   from one stage of athlete development to the next, making some athletes
   more vulnerable to engaging in doping practices than others, and more
   vulnerable at certain time periods-and not others.
   Testing the hypothesis: Model-testing requires a series of carefully
   planned and coordinated studies. Correlational studies can establish
   relationships where the directionality is not-known or not important.
   Experimental studies with the manipulation of doping expectancies and
   risk factors can be used to demonstrate causality and evaluate potential
   intervention strategies. The final model can be tested via a behavioural
   simulation, with outcomes compared to those expected from literature
   precedence or used as a simulated computer game for empirical data
   collection.
   Implications: A hypothesized life-cycle model of PE identifies
   vulnerability factors across the stages of athlete development with the
   view of informing the design of anti-doping assessment and intervention.
   The model suggests that, instead of focusing on the actual engagement in
   prohibited PE practices, deterrence strategies are likely to be more
   effective if they target the influencing factors at the appropriate
   stage and identify groups of athletes and their respective career
   stages, which pose particular risks of engagement in doping practices.
   This enables a more effective intervention approach by targeting
   specific risk factors and expectancies.}},

Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Neonatal lamb mortality represents both a welfare issue (due to the
   considerable suffering and distress) and an important production
   inefficiency. In lambs, approximately 80\% of mortality can be
   attributed to the starvation-mismothering-exposure complex and occurs in
   the first 3 days after birth. It was the object of this review to
   determine the micronutrient(s) most likely to have a positive effect on
   neonatal lamb survival when included above the requirement for that
   micronutrient. Micronutrients discussed were Co, Cu, I, Fe, Mn, Se, Zn,
   vitamins A and E and n-3 fatty acids. For Co, Fe, Mn and Zh, there was
   no evidence of positive responses to supplementation. Cu and I had
   toxicity thresholds that were sufficiently close to requirement that
   supplementing above requirement presented a risk of inducing toxicity.
   In the case of vitamin A while serum concentrations indicated that
   sub-optimal status did exist, long-term buffering from liver stores
   (from grazing) makes experimentation difficult and practical benefits to
   supplementation unlikely. Therefore, the most likely candidates for
   supplementation were Se vitamin E and fatty acids. Fatty acid
   supplementation with fish oils or docosahexaenoic acid-containing algal
   biomass consistently improved lamb vigour but it is unlikely that
   supplementation will be economic. Positive responses to Se
   supplementation throughout gestation were recorded. However, in many
   studies the Se status of control ewes was marginal and there is a need
   for more studies where control ewes are clearly adequate in Se. Positive
   responses to vitamin E supplementation above requirement in the
   last-third of gestation were observed but the optimum dietary inclusion
   of vitamin E and period of feeding during pregnancy still require
   clarification.}},

   the ability of a species to respond to changes in resource availability,

   an essential resource (nesting cavities) using the novel experimental
   approach of blocking the entrances to high-quality cavities. We
   monitored nest abundance on seven treatment and 13 control sites (aspen
   groves in a grassland matrix) in British Columbia, Canada, for two years
   pretreatment (2000-2001), two years during treatment (2002-2003), and
   two years posttreatment (cavities reopened; 2004-2005). At the community
   level, nest abundance declined by 50\% on treatment sites following
   cavity blocking and returned to pretreatment levels following cavity
   reopening. Nest abundance of European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), a
   dominant secondary cavity-nester (SCN), declined by 89\% and failed to
   recover posttreatment. Conversely, nest abundance of Mountain Bluebirds
   (Sialia currucoides; a subordinate SCN) increased following cavity
   blocking and remained high following reopening. Tree Swallows
   (Tachycineta bicolor) were unaffected by cavity blocking. We suggest
   that starlings, while being the dominant SCN, may be limited by
   availability of suitable nest sites, whereas bluebirds may be limited by
   starling abundance. We propose that plasticity in nest site preferences
   of subordinate cavity-nesters may enable them to contend with natural
   variation in availability of critical resources, such as nest cavities
   and food, in addition to coping with interspecific competition. This is
   the. first community-level, multiyear study involving manipulation of

Title = {{Cultural perceptions of healthy weight in rural Appalachian youth}},
Journal = {{RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Rates of overweight among US children have been rising
   over the past three decades. Changes in lifestyle behaviors, including
   dietary and physical activity habits, have been examined thoroughly to
   identify correlates of weight status in children. Youth in rural US
   Appalachia are at a disproportionately greater risk for obesity and
   related health complications. Inadequate physical activity and poor
   dietary habits are two primary causes of obesity that have been noted in
   West Virginia adolescents. Few existing data describes the decisional
   balance in performing lifestyle behaviors, nor the perceptions of these
   youth regarding their beliefs about weight. The purpose of this study
   was to identify the perceptions of a healthy weight in rural Appalachian
   adolescents.
   Methods: Ninth grade students were recruited from classroom
   presentations in four high schools throughout West Virginia. Interested
   parent-caregiver pairs returned forms to indicate interest in
   participation. Separate focus group interviews were conducted
   concurrently with adolescent and parents or caregivers to identify the
   cultural perceptions of a healthy weight. Questions were developed using
   grounded theory to explore how a healthy weight was defined, what
   factors dictate body weight, the perceived severity of the obesity
   issue, and the social or health ramifications of the condition. Verbatim
   transcripts were analyzed to identify dominant themes, and content
   analysis provided text segments to describe the themes. This article
   describes the data obtained from the adolescent focus groups.
   Results: When asked what defined a healthy weight, the adolescents who
   participated in the focus groups placed great value on physical
   appearance and social acceptability. Students believed there was a
   particular number, either an absolute weight or body mass index value
   that determined a healthy weight. These numbers were usually conveyed by
   a physician; however, there was also a general acceptance of being
   `thick' or a reliance on `feeling healthy' as a determinant of
   maintaining a healthy weight. Despite these beliefs, many teens had
   unrealistic and unhealthy perceptions of weight. Female participants
   were more concerned with weight than males, some to the point of
   obsession. Both males and females expressed a social stigma associated
   with overweight. Issues of guilt and diminished self-esteem were
   prevalent. When asked about the extensiveness of the problem of
   childhood overweight, the students indicated that a degree of
   familiarity with being overweight has developed and `you just get used
   to {[} seeing] it.' Because of the rising rates of chronic disease in
   this region, a fear was evident in these youth about the increased risk
   of developing these conditions in those who are overweight. Experiences
   with family members with diabetes and cardiovascular disease fueled
   these concerns, which instilled a fear of becoming overweight in many of
   the students. Many perceptions of healthy weight and appropriate body
   size were shaped by the media and entertainment industry. Additionally,
   some participants admitted to performing unsafe practices to reduce body
   mass, such as very low calorie diets or fasting.
   Conclusions: Youth in rural Appalachia present similar perceptions about
   weight as other children; however, differences in perceived healthy
   lifestyle habits and a general acceptance of a higher average body
   weight present additional challenges to addressing the increasing

Abstract = {{Risk effects arise when prey alter their behavior in response to

   that risk effects can be large. Nonetheless, studies of predation in
   vertebrate conservation and management usually consider only direct
   predation. Given the ubiquity and strength of behavioral responses to
   predators by vertebrate prey, it is not safe to assume that risk effects
   on dynamics can be ignored. Risk effects can be larger than direct
   effects. Risk effects can exist even when the direct rate of predation
   is zero. Risk effects and direct effects do not necessarily change in
   parallel. When risk effects reduce reproduction rather than survival,
   they are easily mistaken for limitation by food supply.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN FUNCTIONS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: While low-grade inflammation has consistently been observed
   in subjects with depression, studies on the possible relationship
   between inflammation and other aspects of brain function are as yet
   sparse. In this study, we aimed to investigate the possible association
   between serum levels of the inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP)
   and personality traits.
   Methods: In this study, serum levels of high-sensitivity CRP were
   determined by ELISA in a population of 270 42-year-old women recruited
   from the population registry who had been assessed using the Temperament
   and Character Inventory. Self-reported previous or ongoing depression
   was also recorded. Unpaired two-tailed t-tests were used for comparison
   between two groups and correlations were evaluated by the calculation of
   Pearson'sr-coefficient.
   Results: The temperament trait harm avoidance was positively (r = 0.227,
   p < 0.05) and the character trait self-directedness was negatively (r =
   -0.261, p < 0.01) associated with serum levels of CRP (p-values
   corrected for multiple comparisons). The correlations between the
   personality traits and CRP were observed also after exclusion of
   subjects reporting ongoing depression (n = 26). Whereas women reporting
   ongoing depression showed significantly increased levels of CRP as
   compared to non-depressed women (n = 155), women reporting a history of
   depression displayed no significant difference in CRP levels as compared
   to women that reported that they had never been depressed.
   Conclusion: Serum levels of CRP in women was found to be associated with
   the personality traits harm avoidance and self-directedness. In
   addition, moderately elevated levels may be a state dependent marker of
   depression.}},

Abstract = {{Under-nutrition and obesity are multi-determined. The multiple
   determinants of either under-nutrition or obesity are linked, thus
   forming a system of influences. How a system of linked multiple
   influences functions is illustrated with specific reference to early
   nutritional deficiencies. The traditional explanation that child
   nutritional deficiencies are due to food scarcity or a lack of family
   economic resources has been increasingly questioned. In the UNICEF
   extended care model, deficiencies in children's nutritional intake are
   due to family economic and food resources and to specific caregiver
   resources. The role of three caregiver resources, maternal education,
   intelligence and depression are reviewed. Evidence also is presented on
   the need to take into account child characteristics, as an additional
   set of influences on nutritional deficiencies. Using a systems
   perspective this review documents how the relation to nutrition of
   family and caregiver resources and child characteristics can be mediated
   or moderated by alternative linked influences such as cultural
   characteristics, maternal input into family economic decisions and
   social support networks. Based on this review a revised extended care
   model is presented, explicitly integrating child characteristics and
   specific mediating and moderating links between multiple predictors of
   child nutritional deficiencies. This is followed by a brief discussion

Abstract = {{Anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are related disorders of
   unknown etiology that most commonly begin during adolescence in women.
   AN and BN have unique and puzzling symptoms, such as restricted eating
   or binge-purge behaviors, body image distortions, denial of emaciation,
   and resistance to treatment. These are often chronic and relapsing
   disorders, and AN has the highest death rate of any psychiatric
   disorder. The lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of this illness
   has hindered the development of effective interventions, particularly
   for AN. Individuals with AN and BN are consistently characterized by
   perfectionism, obsessive-compulsiveness, and dysphoric mood. Individuals
   with AN tend to have high constraint, constriction of affect and
   emotional expressiveness, ahendonia and asceticism, whereas individuals
   with BN tend to be more impulsive and sensation seeking. Such symptoms
   often begin in childhood, before the onset of an eating disorder, and
   persist after recovery, suggesting they are traits that create a
   vulnerability for developing an ED. There is growing acknowledgement
   that neurobiological vulnerabilities make a substantial contribution to
   the pathogenesis of AN and BN. Considerable evidence suggests that
   altered brain serotonin (5-HT) function contributes to dysregulation of
   appetite, mood, and impulse control in AN and BN. Brain imaging studies,
   using 5-HT specific ligands, show that disturbances of 5-HT function
   occur when people are ill, and persist after recovery from AN and BN. It
   is possible that a trait-related disturbance of 5-HT neuronal modulation
   predates the onset of AN and contributes to premorbid symptoms of
   anxiety, obsessionality, and inhibition. This dysphoric temperament may
   involve an inherent dysregulation of emotional and reward pathways which
   also mediate the hedonic aspects of feeding, thus making these
   individuals vulnerable to disturbed appetitive behaviors. Restricting
   food intake may become powerfully reinforcing because it provides a
   temporary respite from dysphoric mood. Several factors may act on these
   vulnerabilities to cause AN to start in adolescence. First,
   puberty-related female gonadal steroids or age-related changes may
   exacerbate 5-HT dysregulation. Second, stress and/or cultural and
   societal pressures may contribute by increasing anxious and obsessional
   temperament. Individuals with AN may discover that reduced dietary
   intake, by reducing plasma tryptophan availability, is a means by which
   they can modulate brain 5-HT functional activity and anxious mood.
   People with AN enter a vicious cycle which accounts for the chronicity
   of this disorder because caloric restriction results in a brief respite
   from dysphoric mood. However, malnutrition and weight loss, in turn,
   produce alterations in many neuropeptides and monoamine function,
   perhaps in the service of conserving energy, but which also exaggerates
   dysphoric mood. In summary, this article reviews findings in brain
   chemistry and neuroimaging that shed new light on understanding the
   psychopathology of these difficult and frustrating disorders. (C) 2007

Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{183-194}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory rats are routinely killed using a gradually increasing
   concentration of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) gas. However, CO, exposure has
   been shown to cause aversion and to increase exploratory and escape
   behaviours in rats. We examined whether these responses are due, in
   part, to novelty, using two different approaches. For the first
   experimental approach, we used approach-avoidance testing to examine gas
   aversion by pairing gas exposure with a food reward. Rats were tested
   with repeated exposure to a gradually increasing concentration of either
   CO, (Experiment 1) or a novel odour (Experiment 2) to determine whether
   these stimuli cause aversion, and to document whether rats show
   habituation to these stimuli. We reasoned that aversion associated with
   novelty would decline with repeated exposure, but that aversion due to
   other factors would not. During control sessions in Experiment 1, rats
   were tested with air and they ate for an average of 266 +/- 4 s (mean
   S.E.M.). However, on the four CO(2) test days they stopped eating after
   only 30 +/- 2 s. Across the first three days of testing with CO(2), the
   latency for rats to stop eating and leave the test cage did not change,
   and the average CO(2) concentrations at these time points were 11 and
   14\%, respectively. On the final day of testing with CO(2), after eight
   additional days of CO(2) exposure, these latencies had increased
   slightly, but rats were still leaving the chamber at only 18\% CO(2). In
   contrast, rats in Experiment 2 showed similar latencies to stop eating
   and leave the test cage with both air and a novel odour (232 versus 235
   +/- 14 s), and their responses did not change with repeated exposure.
   These results suggest that novelty has only a minor effect on rats'
   aversion to CO(2). For the second experimental approach, we examined the
   behavioural responses of rats during baseline and during exposure to a
   gradually increasing concentration of either CO(2) or peppermint odour
   (Experiment 3) to determine which of the behavioural responses observed
   during CO(2) exposure can be attributed to novelty. In comparison to
   baseline, rats that underwent forced exposure to either CO(2) or a novel
   odour showed increased activity and rearing, and spent more time with
   the nose touching the cage lid. However, only one of 16 rats performed
   escape behaviours during exposure to the novel odour, while 10 of 16
   rats performed escape behaviours during CO(2) exposure. These results
   indicate that exploratory behaviours observed during CO(2) exposure
   could be due to novelty, but that escape behaviours are not. Both of the
   experimental approaches indicate that novelty accounts for only a minor
   portion of rats' responses to CO(2) exposure. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Maintenance of demographically and genetically self-sustaining
   populations in captivity can assist conservation of threatened species.
   Captivity can, however, lead to changes in phenotype, though to date
   this issue has received little attention in reptiles. We compared
   phenotypic differences in the now critically-endangered Otago skink
   (Oligosoma otagense) between wild specimens (Otago, southern New
   Zealand) and in captivity (North Island). Individuals of this
   long-lived, viviparous species have been maintained up to three
   generations in captivity, primarily by private herpetoculturists, but
   increasingly there is interest in integrating management of captive
   stocks with conservation in situ. For the same snoutvent length, captive
   skinks pooled across three colonies had a significantly heavier body
   mass, wider tail base, longer tail (juveniles only), faster growth rate
   and much slower sprint speed than in the wild. Captive skinks also
   lacked ectoparasitic mites and haemogregarine parasites, and experienced
   warmer temperatures with probably greater access to food. Our study
   demonstrates the importance of not treating captive management for
   conservation as a tool of last resort. Important questions, if
   captive-raised animals are to be released to the wild, are is it better
   for released skinks to run swiftly or to be heavy-bodied, and what role
   does reinfestation with native parasites have in determining this
   balance? We also recommend genetic analysis and studbook management of
   captive stocks, research to determine implications of heavy body mass
   for reproduction in captivity, and production of at least some offspring

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{There is a general trend that parasitism risk declines as latitude
   increases. Host populations breeding at high latitudes should therefore
   invest less in costly immune defenses than populations breeding in
   temperate or tropical zones, although it is unknown if such an effect is
   mediated by environmental (photoperiodic) or genetic factors or both.
   Acquired immune function (humoral, cell-mediated) and behavioral
   sickness responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; mimics bacterial
   infection) were assessed in two subspecies of white-crowned sparrow
   (Zonotrichia leucophrys) that breed at different latitudes in western
   North America. Zonotrichia l. gambelii (GWCS) is a high-latitude breeder
   (47-68 degrees N) while Z. l. pugetensis (PWCS) breeds at temperate
   latitudes (40-49 degrees N). Captive males of each subspecies were
   acclimated to (1) a short day (non-breeding) photoperiod (8L:16D), (2)
   the breeding photoperiod of PWCS (16L:8D), or (3) the breeding
   photoperiod of GWCS (20L:4D). Photoperiod was manipulated because
   shorter day lengths may enhance immune function. In support of a genetic
   effect, humoral responses to diphtheria-tetanus vaccination were
   significantly higher in PWCS compared to GWCS, regardless of
   photoperiod. There were no differences in cell-mediated responses to
   phytohemagglutinin (PHA) between subspecies or among photoperiods. For
   sickness responses to LPS, a significant interaction between photoperiod
   and subspecies was found, with long day GWCS producing stronger sickness
   responses (losing more weight, eating less) than short day GWCS and PWCS
   on all day lengths. However, these effects were influenced by
   photoperiodic changes in body condition. In conclusion, we find evidence
   for genetic control of immune responses across latitude, but no support
   for environmental (photoperiodic) regulation. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Antipredator defenses are expected to decrease toward higher latitudes
   because predation rates are predicted to decrease with latitude.
   However, latitudinal variation in predator avoidance and defense
   mechanisms has seldom been studied. We studied tadpole antipredator
   defenses in seven Rana temporaria populations collected along a 1500-km
   latitudinal gradient across Sweden, along which previous studies have
   found increasing tadpole growth and development rates. In a laboratory
   common garden experiment, we measured behavioral and morphological
   defenses by raising tadpoles in the presence and absence of a predator
   (Aeshna dragonfly larva) in two temperature treatments. We also
   estimated tadpole survival in the presence of free-ranging predators and
   compared predator densities between R. temporaria breeding ponds
   situated at low and high latitudes. Activity and foraging were generally
   positively correlated with latitude in the common garden experiment.
   While all populations responded to predator presence by decreasing
   activity and foraging, high-latitude populations maintained higher
   activity levels in the presence of the predator. All populations
   exhibited defensive morphology in body and tail shape. However, whereas
   tail depth tended to increase with latitude in the presence of predator,
   it did not change with latitude in the absence of the predator. Predator
   presence generally increased larval period and decreased growth rate. In
   the southern populations, predator presence tended to have a negative
   effect on metamorphic size, whereas in the northern populations
   predators had little or a positive effect on size. Latitude of origin
   had a strong effect on survival in the presence of a free-ranging
   predator, with high-latitude tadpoles experiencing higher mortality than
   those from the low latitudes. In the wild, predator densities were
   significantly lower in high-latitude than in mid-latitude breeding
   ponds. Although the higher activity level in the northern populations
   seems to confer a significant survival disadvantage under predation
   risk, it is probably needed to maintain the high growth and development
   rates. However, the occurrence of R. temporaria at high latitudes may be
   facilitated by the lower predator densities in the north.}},

Abstract = {{Feeding adult rats with high fat (HF) diets can alter their hypothalamic
   pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis responsiveness. In the present study, we
   examined the effect of a high fat diet, applied in rats from weaning to
   puberty, on their behavior and HPA axis status at puberty onset. Wistar
   rats of both sexes were fed postweaning with two diets containing either
   24\% fat (high fat, HF) or 4.3\% fat (normal chow) by weight. HF
   enhanced puberty onset in female rats, without increasing body weight
   gain in either sex, compared with chow-fed animals. In the forced swim
   test, HF males exhibited a more active behavioral response on the first
   day, whereas HF females a more passive response during the second day of
   the test, as compared with their chow-fed counterparts. In the open
   field test, HF females showed increased sniffing but reduced rearing,
   compared with chow-fed females and were less explorative than HF males
   in the central arena. All animals could learn and recall a water maze
   task though HF males spent more time in the opposite quadrant than
   chow-fed males during memory test. The HPA axis status of these animals
   was investigated under basal conditions. Pubertal fat-fed males had
   lighter adrenals, while females heavier ones, compared with their
   counterparts. In addition, plasma corticosterone levels of female rats
   were increased and glucocorticoid receptor levels in their hypothalamus
   were reduced due to fat diet, while in males no such changes were
   detected. We conclude that HF feeding during the prepubertal period can
   affect behavior and the HPA axis of rats at puberty onset, well before
   the appearance of the obese state, in a sexually dimorphic manner. Fat
   diet impacted more the female HPA axis, suggesting that their system is

   Present data suggest that the fat-induced nutritional imbalance in young
   females may lead to neuroendocrine dysfunction that in turn may trigger

Abstract = {{Almost all life histories are phenotypically plastic: that is,
   life-history traits such as timing of breeding, family size or the
   investment in individual offspring vary with some aspect of the
   environment, such as temperature or food availability. One approach to
   understanding this phenotypic plasticity from an evolutionary point of
   view is to extend the optimality approach to the range of environments
   experienced by the organism. This approach attempts to understand the
   value of particular traits in terms of the selection pressures that act
   on them either directly or owing to trade-offs due to resource
   allocation and other factors such as predation risk. Because these
   selection pressures will between environments, the predicted optimal
   phenotype will too. The relationship expressing the optimal phenotype
   for different environments is the optimal reaction norm and describes
   the optimal phenotypic plasticity. However, this view of phenotypic
   plasticity ignores the fact that the reaction norm must be underlain by
   some sort of control system: cues about the environment must be
   collected by sense organs, integrated into a decision about the
   appropriate life history, and a message sent to the relevant organs to
   implement that decision. In multicellular animals, this control
   mechanism is the neuroendocrine system. The central question that this
   paper addresses is whether the control system affects the reaction norm
   that evolves. This might happen in two different ways: first, the
   control system will create constraints on the evolution of reaction
   norms if it cannot be configured to produce the optimal reaction norm
   and second, the control system will create additional selection
   pressures on reaction norms if the neuroendocrine system is costly. If
   either of these happens, a full understanding of the way in which
   selection shapes reaction norms must include details of the
   neuroendocrine control system. This paper presents the conceptual
   framework needed to explain what is meant by a constraint or cost being
   created by the neuroendocrine system and discusses the extent to which
   this occurs and some possible examples. The purpose of doing this is to
   encourage endocrinologists to take a fresh look at neuroendocrine
   mechanisms and help identify the properties of the system and situations
   in which these generate constraints and costs that impinge on the
   evolution of phenotypic plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Collective detection and predation risk dilution are two nonexclusive
   mechanisms that can allow a reduction in antipredator vigilance in large
   animal groups. The two mechanisms make remarkably similar predictions in
   many contexts, and disentangling their relative contribution has proven
   empirically difficult thus far. We examined a situation where predators
   are more likely to attack from one side of the group. Provided that all
   foragers in the group can detect the predator equally well, the
   collective detection hypothesis predicts that all individuals will adopt
   the same vigilance level if this mechanism acted alone. In terms of risk
   dilution, individuals that are on the riskier side of the group, namely
   those on the attack side, are unlikely to benefit to the same extent as
   other groupmates from the presence of companions, and should have a
   higher level of vigilance than more buffered foragers further inside the
   group. We show that semipalmated sandpipers on the riskier side of
   flocks were more vigilant and thus pecked at a lower rate than those in
   the centre of the flocks and those on the less risky side. The
   proportion of successful pecks did not vary with spatial position within
   the flocks, suggesting that differences in food availability did not
   confound the above findings. We conclude that it is unlikely that
   collective detection acted alone and that risk dilution, acting alone or
   in combination with collective detection, shaped antipredator vigilance
   in an avian prey under predation risk. (c) 2008 The Association for the

Abstract = {{A wide variety of fish species release chemical alarm cues upon
   mechanical damage to their skin by predator attack. We investigated the
   effects of short-term food deprivation on the response to, and the
   production of, chemical alarm cues in the coral reef-dwelling goby
   Asterropteryx semipunctatus (family Gobiidae). Gobies deprived of food
   for 4 days did not react with fright when exposed to conspecific skin
   extracts. However, when the same individuals had been fed ad libitum,
   they responded with a typical alarm reaction to the skin extracts,
   including decreased movement and feeding. In a second experiment, gobies
   were exposed to skin extracts from conspecifics that had been food
   deprived and from conspecifics fed ad libitum. Damaged skin from
   food-deprived individuals did not elicit an alarm response in
   conspecifics, whereas skin from individuals that had been fed ad libitum
   yielded a typical alarm response. Histological sections of goby skin
   showed that food-deprived gobies had fewer sacciform cells in their
   epidermis than did gobies fed ad libitum. Evidence suggests that there
   may be a trade-off between foraging and antipredator behaviour, and also
   between the benefits derived from maintaining chemical alarm cue cells

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Whether animal signals convey honest information is a central
   evolutionary question, since selection pressures could, in some
   circumstances, favour dishonesty. A prior study of signalling in hermit
   crabs proposed that the cheliped extension display of Pagurus bernhardus
   might represent such an instance of dishonesty. A limitation of this
   conclusion, however, was that honesty was defined in the context of size
   assessment, neglecting the potential information that displays might
   transmit about signallers' variable internal states. Recent analyses of
   signalling in this same species have shown that its displays provide
   reliable information about the amount of risk crabs are prepared to
   tolerate, which therefore might enable signallers to use these displays
   to honestly convey their motivation to take such risks. Here we test
   this `honest advertisement of motivation' hypothesis by varying crabs'
   need for food and analysing their signalling during simulated feeding
   conflicts against a model. When crabs were starved for 1-5 days, they
   dropped significantly in weight. Despite this decrement in
   resource-holding potential and energy reserves, crabs were more likely
   to perform cheliped extension displays the longer they were food
   deprived. Longer-starved crabs, whose subjective resource value was
   greater, also displayed at a higher rate and were more likely to risk
   seizing the food from the model. We conclude that cheliped extension is
   a reliable indicator of crabs' internal state and suggest how this
   honest signal might operate in conflicts over a variety of other
   resources in addition to food. We propose that future studies detecting
   apparent dishonesty should analyse many possible signal-state
   correlations before concluding a signal is actually dishonest. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare the effect of continuous versus bolus feeding on

   Methods: In a randomized, controlled trial conducted at 3 neonatal

   Results: A significantly higher risk of a behavioral stress response in

Abstract = {{Behaviour and morphology were both shown to differ between 1+ perch from
   two lakes that in earlier studies showed differences in size-specific
   predation risk. As the level of nourishment is known to affect behaviour
   and morphology, we fed perch of the two lakes in tanks for 40 days with
   two food levels, to study whether observed differences remain stable
   with changes in food availability. The perch fed in excess grew
   significantly, while the perch at the low food conditions lost weight,
   clearly indicating undernourishment. In aquarium experiments, the
   starved perch from both lakes were much bolder in the trade-off between
   foraging and predator avoidance than their well-fed conspecifics. In
   addition, the shape of perch differed significantly between feeding
   treatments. At low food levels perch got a more slender body, while at
   high food levels they developed a deeper body and a relatively smaller
   head. Independent of feeding level, the comparison between the two lakes
   revealed a clearly deeper body and a larger head area for one
   population, a shape difference that remained stable after the feeding
   period. The results give evidence that the level of nourishment is an
   important factor that quickly alters risk-taking behaviour. In body
   morphology, however, more stable shape characteristics must be
   distinguished from more flexible ones. Consequently, the level of
   nourishment is a potential factor that may quickly hide other proximate
   cues and must be considered attentively in studies, in which shape
   changes and behaviour are related to environmental factors like diet,
   predation pressure or habitat diversity.}},

Abstract = {{1. Human outdoor recreational activities are increasing and have a
   significant impact on wildlife. There are few methods suitable for
   investigating the response of rare and endangered species to human
   recreational activities, although the impact can be assessed at various
   scales by measuring both physiological and behavioural responses to
   disturbance.
   2. Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus are suffering strong population
   declines throughout central Europe. We examined the effects of ski
   tourism on capercaillie habitat use and adrenocortical activity,
   measured non-invasively in droppings.
   3. During three winters, 2003-06, we radio-tracked 13 capercaillie. In
   the southern Black Forest in Germany, we sampled 396 droppings of these
   and additional individuals before and after the start of the ski season.
   We tested whether the intensity of human winter recreational activities
   affected home range location and habitat use, and we identified those
   factors influencing the concentration of corticosterone metabolites (CM)
   in droppings.
   4. Capercaillie used habitats subject to ski tourism. Although the
   latter did not affect home range location, capercaillie preferred
   undisturbed forests within their home ranges and avoided areas with high
   recreation intensity in the ski season. Faecal CM levels of individuals
   in areas with low recreation intensity were significantly lower than
   those in areas with moderate or high recreation intensity during the
   entire study period.
   5. We conclude that ski tourism affects both habitat use and endocrine
   status in capercaillie, with potential negative consequences on body
   condition and overall fitness.
   6. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates the relevance of
   studying wildlife responses at various temporal and spatial scales, and
   the value of using multiple methods applied to the same individuals to
   monitor the impact of human recreational activities on a free-ranging
   species. In order to protect capercaillie populations, we recommend that
   managers keep forests inhabited by capercaillie free from tourism
   infrastructure and retain undisturbed forest patches within skiing
   areas.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Increased fruit and vegetable intake can reduce cancer risk.
   Information from this study contributes to research exploring health
   disparities in high-risk dietary behavior. Purpose: Changes in fruit and

   low-intensity, physician-endorsed dietary intervention in a rural
   population. Methods: The study was a randomized trial of 754 patients
   from 3 physician practices in rural Virginia. Low-literacy nutrition
   education materials and personalized dietary feedback were administered
   by mail and telephone. Mixed model analysis of variance was used to
   determine the effect of the intervention on fruit and vegetable intake
   behavior, knowledge, intentions, and self-efficacy at 1, 6, and 12
   months. Findings: The intervention effect was moderated by age, race,
   sex, and education. Intake at 1 and 6 months was increased for older and
   younger participants and those with some college, and further maintained
   at 12 months by those who did not complete high school. African
   Americans in the intervention group displayed significantly greater
   intentions to increase fruit/vegetable intake than whites/others.
   Knowledge of fruit/vegetable recommendations significantly increased in
   the intervention group at 12 months, particularly for men. Conclusions:
   For the rural population, a low-intensity physician-endorsed self-help
   dietary intervention was successful in initiating fruit and vegetable
   dietary changes at 1 and 6 months post-intervention, and increasing
   intentions to change in African Americans. The relationship of the
   moderating effects of age, race, sex and education need to be further
   explored in relation to dietary intervention and dietary behavior change

Abstract = {{Prey scarcity compromises population survival, especially for specialist
   predators. Supplementary feeding is a management tool that can be
   applied to reverse the decline of food-limited populations. We analyse
   how a population of Iberian lynx, a threatened food specialist,
   initially reacted to, and subsequently used, supplementary food.
   Twenty-seven feeding stations (FS) with domestic rabbits were placed in
   the Donana Biological Reserve, SW Spain, between 2002 and 2005. We
   recorded lynx tracks inside and around stations to analyse
   spatio-temporal patterns of use, as well as the performance of several
   station designs. Iberian lynx used 62\% of the FS installed, and
   consumed most of the supplied food. All station designs were used and
   food provision apparently covered the energetic needs of the lynx
   inhabiting the reserve. There was spatial aggregation in the use of the
   FS. Fourteen weeks were needed on average for lynx to become familiar
   with feeding stations and making a regular use of the supplementary
   food. Seasonal variations in consumption frequency appeared to be
   modulated by fluctuations of wild rabbit numbers throughout its annual
   cycle as well as by variation in energy demand of breeding females. The
   Iberian lynx responded positively to our supplementary feeding
   programme. We show that this technique allows the persistence of lynx
   populations during long periods in areas where wild rabbits are
   extremely scarce. Supplementary food may be used to sustain lynx
   whenever rabbit populations need recovery, as well as in the context of
   lynx restocking or reintroduction programmes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Immigration, emigration, migration, and redistribution describe
   processes that involve movement of individuals. These movements are an
   essential part of contemporary ecological models, and understanding how
   movement is affected by biotic and abiotic factors is important for
   effectively modeling ecological processes that depend on movement. We
   asked how phenotypic heterogeneity (body size) and environmental
   heterogeneity (food resource level) affect the movement behavior of an
   aquatic snail (Tarebia granifera), and whether including these
   phenotypic and environmental effects improves advection-diffusion models
   of movement. We postulated various elaborations of the basic
   advection-diffusion model as a priori working hypotheses. To test our
   hypotheses we measured individual snail movements in experimental
   streams at high- and low-food resource treatments. Using these
   experimental movement data, we examined the dependency of model
   selection on resource level and body size using Akaike's Information
   Criterion (AIC). At low resources, large individuals moved faster than
   small individuals, producing a platykurtic movement distribution;
   including size dependency in the model improved model performance. In
   stark contrast, at high resources, individuals moved upstream together
   as a wave, and body size differences largely disappeared. The model
   selection exercise indicated that population heterogeneity is best
   described by the advection component of movement for this species,
   because the top-ranked model included size dependency in advection, but
   not diffusion. Also, all probable models included resource dependency.
   Thus population and environmental heterogeneities both influence
   individual movement behaviors and the population-level distribution
   kernels, and their interaction may drive variation in movement behaviors
   in terms of both advection rates and diffusion rates. A behaviorally
   informed modeling framework will integrate the sentient response of
   individuals in terms of movement and enhance our ability to accurately
   model ecological processes that depend on animal movement.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of prey to respond to novel predator cues may depend on the
   generality or specificity of the response to predator cues. We used
   laboratory behavioral experiments to examine the ability of tadpoles of
   three species of anurans (American toad, Bufo americanus; bullfrog, Rana
   catesbeiana; and green frog, R. clamitans) to respond to the presence of
   two native potential predators (bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus; and
   largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides) and one non-native potential
   predator (goldfish, Carassius auratus). We also examined the effect of
   tadpole size on the behavioral responses of American toads and green
   frogs to predator cues. All three species of tadpoles responded to the
   presence of predator cues, although the specific responses varied among
   species. American toads and green frogs reduced activity in the presence
   of at least some fish cues, but bullfrog tadpoles did not change their
   activity. Bullfrogs decreased use of vegetation in the presence of some
   predator cues, whereas American toads and green frogs did not. American
   toads only responded to the presence of bluegill cues but not the other
   fish predator cues, whereas bullfrogs and green frogs responded more
   generally to the fish predators. In both American toads and green frogs,
   tadpole size affected behavior. For American toads, activity increased,
   as did the use of the vegetated side of the aquarium, in larger
   tadpoles. Not only did size affect American toad behavior, but it also
   influenced the responses of the tadpoles to predator cues. For green
   frogs, activity decreased in larger tadpoles. Our results suggest that
   behavioral responses of tadpoles to predator cues can be influenced by
   both the identity of the predator and the prey, as well as the size of
   the potential prey.}},

Abstract = {{In a series of experiments, we investigated the effects of food
   availability and risk frequency on the dynamics of predator-induced
   changes in growth and morphology of prey fish using goldfish (Carassius
   auratus) as our test species. In experiment 1, we fed goldfish high or
   low food rations and exposed them to either alarm cues from
   conspecifics, cues from swordtails or a water control. After 60 days,
   goldfish in the alarm cue treatment significantly increased their body
   depth and body weight but had smaller body length than goldfish exposed
   to swordtails cues or water, likely reducing their vulnerability to
   gape-limited predators. Importantly, food level had an impact on the
   amplitude of the morphological changes. In experiment 2, goldfish were
   exposed to two different frequencies of predation cues or a water
   control for 50 days. The cues were either continued or discontinued from
   day 51 to 100, and all cues were resumed from day 101 to 150. We found
   that goldfish exposed to predation cues increased their depth and weight
   at a faster rate than did the goldfish exposed to water, and of
   particular significance was the fact that frequency of risk had an
   effect on the amplitude of the change. When the cues were interrupted,
   the increase in growth rate parameters was reduced to the level of the
   goldfish exposed to water. However, when the cues were resumed, the rate
   increased to match the growth rate of the goldfish that were
   continuously exposed to the cues. Finally, we staged encounters between
   goldfish of differing morphologies and yellow perch (Perca flavescens)
   and found that deep-bodied goldfish had better survival than the
   shallow-bodied ones. These experiments illustrate the dynamic nature of
   inducible morphological defences.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive species may reduce biodiversity in the long term by displacing
   resident species. Previous studies of geckos have suggested that
   invasive species can displace residents by monopolizing limited
   resources, and this competitive advantage may be exacerbated in
   structurally simple human-altered habitats. Lepidodactylus lugubris is a
   parthenogenetic gecko that comprises four major clones. On many Pacific
   islands A-clones have recently become numerically dominant over several
   other clones. We tested the general hypothesis that A-clones displace
   B-clones in structurally simple habitats owing to behavioural
   differences that influence foraging and aggression. Based on previous
   studies and the pattern of invasion, we predicted that A-clones would
   consume more insects and show higher levels of aggression and social
   dominance than would B-clones. We also tested the hypothesis that
   increasing topographic structure would affect clone behaviour
   asymmetrically and reduce the advantages of invading A-clones. We found
   that A-clones consumed more insects and initiated foraging faster
   compared to B-clones. However, A-clones were not consistently socially
   dominant over B-clones. Habitat structure affected foraging tactics,
   reduced aggression and decreased activity, but clones were affected
   equally and A-clones remained superior foragers in the structurally
   complex habitat. Although B-clones were more active, they were also more
   shy. They occupied and defended shelter more, which may partially
   explain their persistence in forested habitat. We conclude that part of
   the advantage A-clones have in structurally simple human landscapes
   stems from their innate boldness, which increases their ability to
   exploit limited food resources. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that the quality ( i. e. nutritional content)
   of food can have important effects on life history and behaviour. Yet
   few studies have considered the role of food quality for mating. We
   tested the effects of diet quality of prey fed to males and females on
   mating behaviours, sexual cannibalism and egg production in the wolf
   spider, Pardosa milvina. Diet quality was manipulated through
   supplementation of the substrate on which Drosophila melanogaster were
   reared on and prey quantity was held constant. There was no effect of
   diet quality on the occurrence of mating or the timing of copulatory
   behaviours. Contrary to our predictions, females on the high-quality
   diet engaged in more attacks on males before and after mating and were
   more likely to cannibalize males following mating. Hence, females do not
   compensate for low-quality diets by increasing attack rates or
   cannibalism on males. Rather, females on the high-quality diet appear to
   be more voracious predators, consistent with results of some foraging
   studies. Egg production of females that matured and mated in the
   laboratory was not affected by diet quality. However,field- caught adult
   females produced eggsacs more quickly when reared on the high-quality
   diet. Our results suggest that the quality of prey can limit the latency
   to female egg production. These results highlight the need for more
   research on the role of food quality for mating interactions and the
   mechanisms responsible for more voracious feeding by females on
   high-quality diets. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Most research on sexual cannibalism has focused on factors influencing

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To discover whether eating behaviour traits show continuity
   and stability over childhood.
   Subjects/Methods: Mothers of 428 twin children from the Twins Early
   Development Study participated in a study of eating and weight in 1999
   when the children were 4 years old. Families were contacted again in
   2006 when the children were aged 10 years, with complete data on 322
   children; a response rate of 75\%. At both times, mothers completed the
   Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ) for each child. Continuity
   was assessed with correlations between scores at the two time points,
   and stability by changes in mean scores over time.
   Results: For all CEBQ subscales, correlations between the two time
   points were highly significant ( P-values <0.001). For satiety
   responsiveness, slowness in eating, food responsiveness, enjoyment of
   food, emotional overeating and food fussiness, correlations ranged from
   r = 0.44 to 0.55, with lower continuity for emotional undereating
   (r=0.29). Over time, satiety responsiveness, slowness in eating, food
   fussiness, and emotional undereating decreased, while food
   responsiveness, enjoyment of food and emotional overeating increased.
   Conclusions: Eating behaviours, including those associated with a
   tendency to overeat, emerge early in the developmental pathway and show
   levels of individual continuity comparable to stable personality traits.
   Appetitive traits related to higher satiety tended to decrease with
   maturation, while those associated with food responsiveness tended to
   increase. This pattern is consistent with strong tracking of body mass
   index alongside a progressive increase in the risk of obesity.}},

Abstract = {{1. Marine invertebrates use egg nutrients to develop the functional
   feeding larva and then enter a facultative feeding period (FFP) when
   development can proceed without food because larvae are supported by
   maternal reserves. Facultative feeding reduces starvation risk and so is
   important for larval success. It may also influence egg size evolution
   because FFP length correlates with egg size.
   2. We quantified energetic lipid (triglyceride, TG) utilisation in unfed
   and fed larvae as an index of larval nutritive condition in the tropical
   echinoid Tripneustes gratilla during the FFP to determine if fed larvae
   would use the buffer provided by endogenous provisions to improve their
   condition or accelerate development. We predicted that: (i) the
   condition of unfed and fed larvae should diverge before egg TG is
   exhausted and/or (ii) that the size of fed larvae should outstrip that
   of unfed larvae.
   3. Temperate echinoplutei exhibit phenotypic plasticity, increasing the
   length of their food capture apparatus (arms) in nutrient-poor
   conditions. We examined the generality of this phenomenon in a
   morphometric analysis of growth in the tropical larva of T. gratilla. We
   hypothesized that plastic arm growth in starved larvae would occur
   before the FFP ends as a bet hedging strategy to prepare for hard times
   ahead when lack of reserves may render this response impossible.
   4. We found that fed larvae diverged in condition (higher TG) but not in
   size compared with starved larvae before egg energetic lipids were
   exhausted. In addition, unfed larvae showed plastic arm growth before
   the end of the FFP.
   5. Lack of divergence in growth of unfed and fed larvae suggests there
   may be an imperative to maintain a nutrient storage buffer against
   starvation due to unpredictable future planktonic food supply. The FFP
   of T. gratilla exceeds 8 days, considerably longer than that of other
   echinoids with similarly sized eggs, emphasizing that egg quality may be
   more important than egg size as a predictor of the FFP in fecundity-time
   models of egg evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Redshanks Tringa totanus that are preyed upon by Sparrowhawks Accipiter
   nisus at the Tyninghame Estuary, Firth of Forth, Scotland, provide an
   example of how the starvation-predation risk trade-off results in
   mortality. In this trade-off, animals cannot always optimize
   anti-predation behaviour because anti-predation behaviours, such as
   avoiding predators, are usually incompatible with foraging behaviours
   that might maximize intake rates. Therefore, as animals compensate for
   starvation risk, predation risk increases. Sparrowhawks are the main
   direct cause of death in Redshanks at Tyninghame. Sparrowhawk attack
   rate is determined by Redshank vulnerability, and vulnerability
   decreases as group size and distance to cover increase, and probably as
   spacing decreases. But reduction of predation vulnerability reduces
   feeding rate because areas away from cover are less food-profitable and
   grouping results in increased interference competition. Increased
   starvation risk in midwinter means Redshanks are forced to feed on
   highly profitable prey, Orchestia amphipods, the behaviour of which
   means that Redshanks are forced to feed vulnerably, in widely spaced
   groups, close to predator-concealing cover. Therefore, it is the
   constraints that limit the ability of Redshanks to feed in large, dense
   flocks away from cover that ultimately lead to mortality. We investigate
   this hypothesis further by testing the prediction that mortality can be
   predicted directly by cold weather and population density. We
   demonstrate that the overall number of Redshanks and the proportion of
   Redshanks killed increase in cold months when controlling for population
   size. We also demonstrate that the proportion of Redshanks killed
   increases when there are fewer Redshanks present, because the success
   rate of hunting Sparrowhawks increases, probably because effective
   management of predation risk through flocking is constrained by a low
   population size. Redshanks therefore provide an example of how directly
   mortality caused by predation arises from starvation risk and other
   constraints that prevent animals from optimizing anti-predation
   behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Second generation antipsychotics (SGA) induce substantial
   weight gain but the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon remain
   speculative.
   Objective: To explore eating behaviors among SGA-treated patients and
   compare them with nonschizophrenic healthy sedentary individuals
   (controls).
   Methods and Procedures: Appetite sensations were recorded before and
   after a standardized breakfast using visual analog scales. Three hours
   after breakfast, a buffet-type meal was offered to participants to
   document spontaneous food intake and food preferences. Satiety quotients
   (SQs) were calculated to determine the satiation of both meals and the
   Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) was used to document eating
   behaviors. Body composition and abdominal fat distribution were
   assessed.
   Results: Compared with controls (n = 20), SGA-treated patients (n = 18)
   showed greater adiposity indices (P <= 0.04). Patients' degree of hunger
   was also higher following the standardized breakfast (P = 0.03).
   Moreover, patients had significantly higher cognitive dietary restraint,
   disinhibition, and susceptibility to hunger scores than the reference
   group (P <= 0.05). Disinhibition in the reference group was positively
   associated with hunger triggered by external cues (r = 0.48, P = 0.03)
   whereas internal cues seem to mainly regulate emotional susceptibility
   to disinhibition in patients (r = 0.56, P = 0.02). Higher strategic
   restraint behavior in patients was associated with decreased satiation
   right after the buffet-type meal (r = -0.56, P = 0.02).
   Discussion: These exploratory findings suggest that patients under SGA
   seem to develop disordered eating behaviors in response to altered
   appetite sensations and increased susceptibility to hunger, a factor
   which may influence the extent of body weight gain triggered by these
   drugs.}},

Abstract = {{Prevalence of obesity in preschool children has increased dramatically
   in recent years. The preschool years (age 3-6 years) have been regarded
   as critical for the programming of energy balance, via the concept of
   early `adiposity rebound'. Children who undergo early adiposity rebound
   are at increased risk of later obesity. Recent evidence suggests that
   associations between timing of adiposity rebound and later obesity may
   not reflect programming, but might denote that `obesogenic' growth
   trajectories are often established by the preschool period. Studies of
   objectively-measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour in
   preschool children show that levels of physical activity are typically
   low and sedentary behaviour high. The review of evidence presented here
   is supportive of the hypothesis that physical activity is protective
   against obesity in the preschool period, and that sedentary behaviour,
   particularly television viewing, is obesogenic. Definitive evidence on
   dose-response relationships between physical activity, sedentary
   behaviour and obesity remain unclear. Dose-response evidence could be
   obtained fairly readily by intervention and longitudinal observational
   studies that use accelerometry in preschool children. The
   generalisability of much of the evidence base is limited and there is a
   need for research oil the influence of physical activity and sedentary
   behaviour in the preschool years in the aetiology of obesity in the

Abstract = {{This study examined critical periods in development to determine when
   offspring were most susceptible to dietary sodium manipulation leading
   to amphetamine sensitization. Wistar dams (n = 6-8/group) were fed chow
   containing low (0.12\% NaCl; LN), normal (1\% NaCl; NN), or high sodium
   (4\% NaCl; HN) during the prenatal or early postnatal period (birth to 5
   wk). Offspring were fed normal chow thereafter until testing at 6 mo.
   Body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), fluid intake, salt preference,
   response to amphetamine, open field behavior, plasma adrenocorticotropin
   hormone (ACTH), plasma corticosterone (Cort), and adrenal gland weight
   were measured. BW was similar for all offspring. Offspring from the
   prenatal and postnatal HN group had increased BP, NaCl intake, and salt
   preference and decreased water intake relative to NN offspring. Prenatal
   HN offspring had greater BP than postnatal HN offspring. In response to
   amphetamine, both prenatal and postnatal LN and HN offspring had
   increased locomotor behavior compared with NN offspring. In a novel open
   field environment, locomotion was also increased in prenatal and
   postnatal LN and HN offspring compared with NN offspring. ACTH and Cort
   levels 30 min after restraint stress and adrenal gland weight
   measurement were greater in LN and HN offspring compared with NN
   offspring. These results indicate that early life experience with low-
   and high-sodium diets, during the prenatal or early postnatal period, is
   a stress that produces long-term changes in responsiveness to
   amphetamines and to subsequent stressors.}},

Abstract = {{The mortality risk from hunting/predation should increase animals'
   vigilance and modify their selection of feeding sites. This risk may
   thus be costly if vigilance interferes with feeding and/or if animals
   select poorer but safer feeding sites. We observed the vigilance
   behaviour of roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, feeding in a fragmented
   landscape during and outside the hunting season and compared food
   availability and local landscape features at these feeding sites with
   random paired sites. Roe deer spent more time vigilant during the
   hunting season than outside it. During the hunting season, vigilance
   decreased as the woodland extent within an 800 m radius increased, but
   this was not the case outside the hunting season. Vigilance decreased
   with increasing distance to houses, both during and outside the hunting
   season. When food is abundant, interference with feeding may be low
   because animals can simultaneously process food (chewing) and be
   vigilant. During the hunting season, the total time spent vigilant while
   chewing increased with increasing food abundance to a lesser extent than
   outside the hunting season, suggesting a higher level of costly
   exclusive vigilance during the hunting season. Outside the hunting
   season animals selected feeding sites that provided more food, but
   during the hunting season, as risk (proximity to houses) was positively
   correlated with food availability, animals no longer selected feeding
   sites on the basis of food availability. Taken together, our results
   indicate that roe deer trade off risk avoidance for food availability in
   hunted populations. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Avian incubation behaviour is thought to be influenced mainly by ambient
   temperature and food availability. Field studies, however, have
   generated contradictory results; there is little agreement about the
   relative importance of food and temperature and how different components
   of incubation behaviour are affected by them. To date, no studies have
   manipulated both food availability and nest temperature in a controlled
   experiment, making it impossible to assess any potential interaction
   between food and temperature. We experimentally increased both food
   availability and ambient temperature during incubation in the northern
   mockingbird. Our results show that both food availability and
   temperature influence incubation behaviour. Increasing food availability
   enabled females to spend more time on the nest and in self- maintenance
   activities when off the nest. Increasing nest temperature caused females
   to spend less time incubating and to make more trips to and from the
   nest. When both food and temperature were increased, their effects on
   incubation time offset each other. These changes in incubation patterns
   had little effect on fitness, although embryo mass was lowest in the
   treatment in which only heat was increased, suggesting that heat may
   stress embryos, but not when extra food is also provided. Perhaps the
   reason previous studies have yielded contradictory results is that food
   and temperature offset each other in complex ways that could obscure
   their individual effects. Indeed, our experiment shows that food and
   temperature both affect avian incubation behaviour, but that different
   trade- offs apply to each environmental factor. (C) 2008 The Association

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Spiders alter web architecture in response to many environmental
   factors. Yet, the functional implications of this behavioural plasticity
   are poorly understood, especially for spiders that spin long-lasting
   webs such as cobwebs. The western black widow spins a three-dimensional
   web that captures terrestrial prey and can persist for many days.
   However, the shape of the cobweb depends upon changes in the spider's
   body condition. Starved spiders invest more silk in sticky gumfooted
   threads, whereas sated spiders invest more silk in supporting threads.
   We tested the hypothesis that the increased investment in sticky
   gumfooted threads by starved spiders functions to improve the prey
   capture of their webs. Regardless of intrinsic foraging motivation, both
   fed and starved spiders captured more prey, more quickly and more
   efficiently, when hunting on a web that was spun by a starved spider.
   Our study shows that cobweb spiders actively manipulate web-spinning
   behaviours in ways that alter the functions of their webs and that even
   spiders spinning relatively long-lasting webs may use behavioural
   plasticity to respond to changing selective pressures in their
   environment. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Bird parents can alert predators to the location of their nest. One
   mitigating option is that parents reduce their nest visitation rate in
   exchange for a lower predation risk. Here, using field data and
   experiments, we show that Siberian jay Perisoreus infaustus parents
   adjust feeding visit rates depending on an interaction of 3 factors:
   predator activity, nest concealment, and food availability. The rate of
   nest visits increased with the degree of nest concealment; yet, this
   relationship was modified by the presence of corvid predators. As the
   vegetation became more dense, parents at sites with high corvid activity
   disproportionately increased their feeding visit rates when compared
   with birds at sites with low corvid activity. We experimentally assessed
   how nesting cover affects this response of parents to the presence of
   corvids by using an Eurasian jay Garrulus glandarius model. Parents
   nesting at open sites ceased nest visits, whereas those nesting in dense
   forest continued feeding, albeit at a lower rate. Cover may thus not
   fully compensate for the effect of predator activity on feeding visit
   rates. However, offspring exposed to high predator activity might still
   receive the same amount of food because parents may adjust load sizes to
   compensate. This idea was confirmed by an experiment showing that in
   areas of high predator activity, food-supplemented birds significantly
   decreased nest visits when compared with nonsupplemented birds. These
   results indicate that some bird species can employ multiple nest-defense
   strategies to reduce predator-attracting nest visits; yet, these
   strategies may carry fitness consequences through reduced offspring
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{A positive relationship between the consumption of sweetened dietary
   substances (e.g. saccharin and sucrose) and drug abuse has been reported
   in both the human and other animal literature. The proposed genetic
   contribution to this relationship has been based on evidence from
   behavioral, neurobiological, and linkage studies in heterogeneous and
   homogeneous animal populations. Initial work in several laboratories
   indicated that rodents that are selected for high alcohol consumption
   also display an increased preference for sweets compared with low
   alcohol-consuming animals. More recently, Sprague-Dawley rats have been
   selectively bred based on high saccharin (HiS) or low saccharin (LoS)
   consumption, and these lines represent an ideal opportunity to determine
   whether a reciprocal genetic relationship exists between the consumption
   of sweetened substances and self-administration of drugs of abuse. The
   purpose of this review is to examine a series of studies on the HiS and
   LoS rats for drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior using laboratory
   animal models that represent critical phases of drug abuse in humans.
   The data support the hypothesis that sweet consumption and drug
   self-administration are closely related and genetically influenced.
   Other characteristics of HiS and LoS rats are discussed as possible
   mediators of the genetic differences such as activity, impulsivity,
   novelty reactivity, stress, and emotionality. The interaction of sweet
   preference with biological variables related to drug abuse, such as age,
   sex, and hormonal influences, was considered, as they may be additive
   vulnerability factors with consumption of sweet substances. In the
   studies that are discussed, the HiS and LoS lines emerge as ideal
   addiction-prone and addiction-resistant models, respectively, with
   vulnerability or resilience factors that will inform prevention and
   treatment strategies for drug abuse.}},

Abstract = {{As human recreation in natural areas increases, so does the potential
   for disturbance to wildlife, and many factors (environmental,
   disturbance type, experience with humans) influence the impact of
   disturbance. However, there exists no comprehensive examination of the
   effects of human disturbance on ungulate escape responses. I conducted a
   comprehensive review of studies measuring Artiodactyl escape responses
   (e.g., flight initiation distance, distance moved) to experimental
   harassment by humans and vehicles, and meta-analyses aimed at predictive
   questions about the impact of human disturbance on ungulate behavior
   under an optimization framework. I found evidence across studies that
   ungulates pay attention to approacher behavior, have greater perceptions
   of risk when disturbed in open habitats, and females or groups with
   young offspring show greater flight responses than adult groups.
   Increased group size and the presence of hunting showed weak but
   positive heterogeneous effects on flight behavior both between and
   within species. Humans on foot were more evocative than other stimuli
   (vehicles, noises). Populations in areas with higher levels of human
   traffic showed reduced wariness but a lack of alternative sites to move
   to may explain some of this effect. Hunted populations showed
   significantly greater flight responses than non-hunted populations.
   Finally, I suggest five factors to consider when forming predictive
   models of ungulate flight behavior: (1) how seasonal variation in
   reproductive status and body condition effects wariness, (2) the
   relative impacts of lethal and non-lethal human contact, and (3) unique
   natural history traits that may cause differences in flight behavior
   between populations, (4) the availability of alternative sites, and (5)
   shorter distances between feeding sites and refugia can reduce the
   impact of other factors on flight responses. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The pursuit of rewarding experiences motivates everyday human behavior,
   and can prove beneficial when pleasurable, positive consequences result
   (e.g., satisfying hunger, earning a paycheck). However, reward seeking
   may also be maladaptive and lead to risky decisions with potentially
   negative long-term consequences (e.g., unprotected sex, drug use). Such
   risky decision making is often observed during adolescence, a time in
   which important structural and functional refinements occur in the
   brain's reward circuitry. Although much of the brain develops before
   adolescence. critical centers for goal-directed behavior, such as
   frontal corticobasal ganglia networks, continue to mature. These ongoing
   changes may underlie the increased in risk-taking behavior often
   observed during adolescence. Further, typical development of these
   circuits is vital to out ability to make well-informed decisions;
   atypical developement of the human reward circuitry can have severe
   implications, as is the case in certain clinical and developmental
   conditions (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). This review
   focuses on current research probing the neural correlates of

Abstract = {{Spinal cord injury typically results in limited functional recovery.
   Here we investigated whether therapeutic dietary restriction, a
   multi-faceted, safe, and clinically-feasible treatment, can improve
   outcome from cervical spinal cord injury. The well-established notion
   that dietary restriction increases longevity has kindled interest in its
   potential benefits in injury and disease. When followed for several
   months prior to insult, prophylactic dietary restriction triggers
   multiple molecular responses and improves outcome in animal models of
   stroke and myocardial infarction. However, the efficacy of the
   clinically-relevant treatment of post-injury dietary restriction is
   unknown. Here we report that ``every-other-day fasting{''} (EODF), a
   form of dietary restriction, implemented after rat cervical spinal Cord
   injury was neuroprotective, promoted plasticity, and improved behavioral
   recovery. Without causing weight loss, EODF improved gait-pattern,
   forelimb function during ladder-crossing, and vertical exploration. In
   agreement, EODF preserved neuronal integrity, dramatically reduced
   lesion volume by > 50\%, and increased Sprouting of corticospinal axons.
   As expected, blood beta-hydfoxybutyrate levels, a ketone known to be
   neuroprotective, were increased by 2-3 fold on the fasting days. In
   addition, we found increased ratios of full-length to truncated trkB
   (receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor) in the spinal cord by
   2-6 folds at both 5 days (lesion site) and 3 weeks after injury (caudal
   to lesion site) which may further enhance neuroprotection and
   plasticity. Because EODF is a safe, non-invasive, and low-cost
   treatment, it could be readily translated into the clinical setting of
   spinal cord injury and possibly other insults. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{1. Despite the accelerating global spread of urbanized habitats and its
   associated implications for wildlife and humans, surprisingly little is
   known about the biology of urban ecosystems.
   2. Using data from a 60-year study period, this paper provides a
   detailed description of how the northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis L. -
   generally considered a shy forest species - colonized the city of
   Hamburg, Germany. Six non-mutually exclusive hypotheses are investigated
   regarding the environmental factors that may have triggered this
   invasion.
   3. The spatio-temporal analysis of 2556 goshawk chance observations
   (extracted from a total data set of 1 174 493 bird observations;
   1946-2003) showed that hawks regularly visited the city centre decades
   before the first successful breeding attempts were recorded. Many
   observations were made in parts of the city where territories were
   established in later years, demonstrating that these early visitors had
   encountered, but not used, potential nest sites.
   4. Pioneer settlement coincided with: (i) an increase in (legal) hunting
   pressure on goshawks in nearby rural areas; (ii) an increase in avian
   prey abundance in the city; and (iii) a succession of severe winters in
   the Greater Hamburg area. On the other hand, there was no evidence to
   suggest that the early stages of the invasion were due to: (i)
   decreasing food availability in rural areas; (ii) major habitat changes
   in the city; or (iii) rural intraguild dynamics forcing hawks into urban
   refugia. While breeding numbers of a potential rural source population
   were at a long-term low when the city was colonized, prior to first
   settlement there was a sharp increase of goshawk chance observations in
   the city and its rural periphery.
   5. The urban population expanded rapidly, and pair numbers began to
   stabilize after about 10 years. Ringing data (219 ringed nestlings from
   70 urban broods; 1996-2000) demonstrated that most urban recruits had
   fledged in the city, but also confirmed considerable gene flow between
   urban and rural habitats. Analysis of chance observations (as raw data
   or as detrended time series) suggested a tight coupling of population
   dynamics inside and outside the city.
   6. City-colonizations such as the one described here provide a valuable
   opportunity to study some fundamental aspects of population ecology on a
   scale at which detailed monitoring is logistically feasible.
   Furthermore, a good understanding of urban ecology has become essential
   for efficient wildlife conservation in modern, human-altered
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an individual-based model, MORPH, that has been
   designed to predict the effect of environmental change on foraging
   animal populations. The key assumptions of MORPH are that individuals
   within populations behave in order to maximise their perceived fitness,
   but that perceived fitness may not always be positively related to the
   actual chances of survival and reproduction. MORPH has been
   parameterised for coastal birds on several European sites and predicted
   the effect of environmental change, caused by factors such as habitat
   loss disturbance from humans and sea-level rise on the survival and body
   condition of these species. However, MORPH contains a basic framework to
   describe animal physiology and foraging behaviour, and the distribution
   and abundance of the resources required by these animals. Therefore,
   MORPH is not restricted to coastal birds, and is potentially applicable
   to a wider range of systems. To be applied to a forager system, MORPH
   requires parameters describing (i) the distribution of the food supply

Abstract = {{The present paper describes the main procedures used to slaughter fowl,
   pigs, calves and adult cattle, sheep, and farmed fish, starting on the
   farm and ending with the death of the animal at the abattoir. It reviews
   the currently known causes of stress, indicated by behavioural and
   physiological measurements on the animal level, and by post-mortem
   muscle metabolism. During the pre-slaughter period, psychological stress
   is due to changes of environment, social disturbances and handling, and
   physical stress is due to food deprivation, climatic conditions,
   fatigue, and sometimes pain. The exact causes of stress depend, however
   on the characteristics of each species, including the rearing system.
   For fowl, bird catching and crating, duration and climatic conditions of
   transport and of lairage and shackling are the main known pre-slaughter
   stress factors. For pigs, stress is caused by fighting during mixing of
   pens, loading and unloading conditions, and introduction in the
   restrainer Handling and novelty of the situation contribute to the
   stress reactions. For veal calves and adult cattle, disruption of the
   social group, handling, loading and sometimes unloading conditions,
   fatigue, novelty of the situation and for calves mixing with unfamiliar
   animals are known stress factors. Gathering and yarding of extensively
   reared lambs and sheep causes stress, particularly when shepherd dogs
   are used. Subsequent transport may induce fatigue, especially if sheep
   are commercialised through auctions or markets. In farmed fish, stress
   is predominantly related to environmental aspects such as temperature,
   oxygen, cleanliness of the water and, to a certain extent, stocking
   density and removal of the fish from the water If transport and lairage
   conditions are good and their durations not too long, they may allow
   pigs, calves and adult cattle, sheep, and fish to rest. For certain
   species, it was shown that genetic origin and earlier experience
   influence reactions to the slaughter procedure. Stunning techniques used
   depend on the species. Pigs and fowl are mostly electrically or
   gas-stunned, while most adult cattle are stunned with a captive bolt
   pistol. Calves and sheep may be electrically stunned or with a captive
   bolt pistol. Various stunning methods exist for the different farmed
   fish species. Potential causes of stress associated with the different
   stunning procedures are discussed. The paper addresses further
   consequences for meat quality and possible itineraries for future
   research. For all species, and most urgently for fish, more knowledge is
   needed on stunning and killing techniques, including gas-stunning
   techniques, to protect welfare.}},

Abstract = {{Social learning involves the transmission of information from
   demonstrators to conspecifics. The mother is expected to be the main
   demonstrator in solitary species, whereas several individuals can be
   demonstrators in group-living species. We studied social learning about
   novel food in two populations of the African striped mouse, with
   different social systems: a desert population (group living with
   paternal care and natal philopatry) and a grassland population
   (solitary, paternal care in captivity only and natal dispersal). We
   predicted that both parents would be reliable demonstrators for desert
   striped mice but only the mother would be a demonstrator for grassland
   striped mice. Adults and unweaned young were assigned to one of five
   treatments in captivity: (1) father or (2) mother fed novel food away
   from young; (3) novel food fed to both adults with young present; and
   (4) father or (5) mother fed mouse cubes (control) away from young.
   Juveniles from all treatments individually received novel food after
   weaning. The responses of juveniles to novel food were greater (shorter
   latency, more sniffs) when the mother was the demonstrator, regardless
   of population. Mothers may be more reliable demonstrators than fathers
   because information can be transmitted using multiple channels
   (olfaction, lactation). Our study also showed that fathers were more
   reliable demonstrators and responses to the novel food were greater in
   desert than grassland striped mice. These population differences reflect
   the different social organization of the populations and the
   unpredictable availability of highly nutritious food in the desert. (C)

Abstract = {{Animals are often neophobic towards novel foods, but will incorporate
   them into their diet after interacting with experienced conspecifics.
   Such social learning is likely to be particularly important for young
   animals, for which most foods are unfamiliar. It has been suggested that
   in some species adults actively promote learning about unfamiliar foods
   by teaching offspring, although firm evidence is lacking. I examined
   social influences on learning about novel foods among wild meerkats,
   Suricata suricatta, a species where older group members teach pups
   prey-handling skills. In two experiments, naive pups were significantly
   more likely to eat hardboiled egg, a food item not normally present in
   the diet, and scorpions, a common prey type, if they had interacted with
   experienced conspecifics. I then investigated whether helpers teach pups
   to eat unfamiliar prey by preferentially feeding rare items and through
   direct feeding, where food items are transferred mouth to mouth. Rare
   prey items were fed more frequently than common items, although this may
   reflect nutritional characteristics. Direct feeding was most commonly
   used by juvenile helpers, which typically contribute relatively little
   to cooperative activities, and was more frequent if other helpers were
   nearby. This suggests that direct feeding may be a means of reducing the
   costs of feeding by improving the efficiency of energy transfer and
   minimizing the risks of kleptoparasitism. I conclude that learning about
   novel foods is likely to occur as a by-product of provisioning by
   helpers. There was little evidence that helpers actively teach pups what
   to eat. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Behavioral management of risk, in which organisms must balance the

   nutrients, few have considered the role of genetic variation in the
   trade-off between these variables. We performed a study of four
   zebrafish (Danio rerio (Hamilton, 1822)) strains to test for genetic
   variation in foraging behavior and whether this variation affected their
   response to both aversive stimuli and nutrient restriction. Zebrafish
   strains differed significantly in their latency to begin foraging from
   the surface of the water under standard laboratory conditions. Fish fed
   sooner when nutrients were restricted, although this was only
   significant in the absence of aversive stimuli. Aversive stimuli caused
   fish to delay feeding in a strain-specific manner. Strains varied in
   food intake and specific growth rate, and feeding latency was
   significantly correlated with food intake. Our results indicate
   significant genetic variation in foraging behavior and the perception of

Abstract = {{Previous research has suggested that bipolar disorder is characterized
   by a state-dependent decrease in the ability to recognize facial affect
   during mania. It remains unclear, though, whether people who are only
   vulnerable to the disorder show these changes in facial affect
   recognition. It is also unclear whether minor shifts in mood affect the
   recognition of facial emotion. Thus, this study examined the effects of
   positive mood induction on the facial affect recognition of
   undergraduates vulnerable to mania. Fifty-two undergraduates completed
   the Hypomanic Personality Scale, and also completed a measure of their
   ability to recognize affect in pictures of faces. After receiving false
   success feedback on another task to induce a positive mood, they
   completed the facial affect recognition measure again. Although we
   expected to find a relationship between higher Hypomanic Personality
   Scale (HPS) scores and an impaired ability to recognize negative facial
   affect after a positive mood induction, this was not found. Rather,
   there was a significant interaction between HPS scores and happiness
   level, such that individuals with higher scores on the HPS who also
   reported higher levels of happiness were particularly adept at
   identifying subtle facial expressions of happiness. This finding expands
   a growing literature linking manic tendencies to sensitivity to positive

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{652-662}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{1. Larvae of a Myrmecaelurus sp. are unique among antlions because they
   have two prey-capture methods; they either ambush prey at the surface,
   or dig pit traps that prey fall in to. It was hypothesised that larvae
   will use the capture method that maximises their net rate of energy
   gain, which will be influenced by food availability (encounter rate) and
   by past energy inputs (body condition).
   2. Costs were estimated by measuring resting and activity metabolic
   rates and determining the duration of pit maintenance at various
   encounter rates with ants that served as prey. Benefits were estimated
   from the energy gained per ant captured at different encounter rates.
   3. Net energy gained was higher with a pit than without one, and was
   influenced more by the differences in prey capture rate between the two
   capture methods, and less by the differences in energy costs associated
   with each method. The proportion of larvae that constructed pits was
   higher when they were in intermediate body condition than when in good
   or in poor body condition.
   4. Thus, the use of one capture method or the other depends on a
   combination of the influences of past net energy gain and the antlion's
   most recent change in encounter rate with prey. Ambushing without a pit
   may serve as a default when physiological constraints limit the larvae's
   ability to invest in pit construction and maintenance, or when larvae
   are sated, and saving the energy of pit construction and maintenance is
   worthwhile.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Increased dietary fat intake is a precipitating factor for
   the development of obesity and associated metabolic disturbances.
   Physically active individuals generally have a reduced risk of
   developing these unhealthy states, but the underlying mechanisms are
   poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of
   feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) on obesity development and fuel
   homeostasis in male and female mice with a trait for increased physical
   activity and in their controls.
   Methods: Male and female mice selectively bred for a high level of wheel
   running behavior over 30 generations and nonselected controls
   (background strain Hsd:ICR) were maintained on a standard lab chow
   high-carbohydrate diet (HCD) or on an HFD (60\% fat). Food intake, body
   weight, indirect calorimetry parameters, spontaneous locomotor activity
   and several hormones relevant to metabolism and energy balance were
   measured.
   Results: On HFD, mice reduced food intake and increased body fat mass
   and plasma leptin levels, with the notable exception of the selected
   females, which increased their ingested calories without any effects on
   body mass or plasma leptin levels. In addition, they had an elevated
   daily energy expenditure (DEE), increased spontaneous cage activity
   (similar to 700\% relative to controls) and higher resting metabolic
   rate (RMR) on the HFD compared with feeding the HCD. The selected males
   also had a higher DEE compared with controls, but no interaction with
   diet was observed. On HCD, adiponectin levels were higher in selected
   male, but not female, mice relative to controls. A marked increase in
   the level of plasma adiponectin was observed on the HFD in selected
   females, an effect of diet that was not observed in selected males.
   Conclusion: Genetically based high locomotor activity renders female,
   but not male, mice resistant to HFD-induced obesity by alterations in
   behavioral, endocrine and metabolic traits that facilitate fat
   utilization rather than limiting HFD intake. International Journal of

Abstract = {{Within insect and anuran choruses, females are exposed to many male
   sexual signals overlapping in time. In many species, male call timing
   influences mate choice, with females preferentially orienting towards
   males that succeed in calling just before their opponents. The
   mechanisms through which males actively regulate their call timing to
   achieve this have been the focus of much interest. However, no study has
   addressed the problem of the reliability of call leadership as an
   indicator of male quality, which is crucial to females, since basing
   their choice of mate on an unreliable criterion could lead them to
   engage in suboptimal matings, with detrimental effects to their fitness.
   Addressing this question in the European treefrog, Hyla arborea, we
   first ascertained that females preferentially orient towards the first
   of two identical overlapping conspecific calls. We then found that
   within experimental choruses the males with the highest proportion of
   leading calls had significantly higher total calling times, a call
   characteristic encompassing two indicators of signal costliness: call
   duration and call rate. Although we failed to find a link between call
   leadership and male body condition, this study provides novel evidence
   that female preference for leading calls leads to the selection of the
   males with the highest energetic investment in their sexual display. The
   handicap principle predicts that this form of female preference should
   increase the fitness of females by guaranteeing that they select
   high-quality mates. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal

Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Although shedding a leg may save an individual's life, it may lower its
   subsequent fitness by decreasing its ability to obtain food, increasing
   its vulnerability to predators, or lowering its success in reproduction.
   We studied the effects of leg loss on common locomotory tasks and
   activity levels in adult male crab spiders Misumena vatia. Over three
   field seasons approximately 30\% of adult males lost one or more legs,
   usually among their four large anterior legs. Although M. vatia do not
   build webs, they use their front legs extensively to traverse lines,
   their most important means of movement. Field-captured males missing one
   or more legs moved 38\% more slowly across lines and 28\% more slowly on
   surfaces than intact males. Since males must hunt to find unmated
   females, this reduced mobility suggests a significant fitness cost for
   males that have lost legs. However, a set of males with experimentally
   autotomized legs moved as rapidly on lines as intact males. Since
   individuals that lost a limb in the field weighed significantly less
   than intact individuals of the same size (carapace width), adjusting for
   leg mass, the slow rates of movement on lines by the field-caught
   individuals missing a leg probably resulted from poor body condition,
   rather than a loss of dexterity. Most studies have explained potential
   loss in fitness from losing a leg as a direct consequence of leg loss,
   seldom invoking indirect effects. The potential for leg loss to reduce
   fitness via impacts on body condition warrants further attention, for it
   could play an important role in cost of autonomy. (C) 2008 The

Abstract = {{When food patch quality varies unpredictably over time, animals may
   benefit from sampling to track these changes. Previous theoretical work
   has shown how patch and environmental characteristics influence the
   optimal sampling policy, but there has been little attention to the
   effects of conspecifics, especially for species that do not live in
   groups. We used a simulation model to investigate the influence of
   conspecifics, as both competitors and providers of social information,
   on the optimal sampling behaviour of nongroup foragers. Competition
   reduces the range of patch characteristics for which frequent sampling
   provides a higher gain rate than rare or no sampling. Under conditions
   where sampling is beneficial, however, competition has little effect on
   the optimal sampling rate. Social information generally decreases the
   optimal sampling rate. However, the effect is small when the social
   information is unreliable. This will often occur when animals forage
   solitarily because of an inability to detect other animals at the patch
   or to distinguish animals that are sampling the patch from those that
   are exploiting it. Thus, the presence of conspecifics should reduce the
   sampling rate of nongroup foraging animals, but the extent of the
   reduction will depend on the reliability of the available social
   information. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Food competition is an expected cost of group living. It is therefore
   puzzling that there is little evidence for competition among
   group-living folivorous monkeys, for example, daily travel distance does
   not seem to increase with group size. It is even more puzzling that
   folivores do not form larger groups despite this apparent lack of food
   competition. This has become known as the folivore paradox, and to date,
   there is no broadly accepted theoretical solution. However, there have
   been no multigroup studies that have controlled for the potentially
   confounding effects of variation in habitat quality. We studied 9 groups
   of red colobus monkeys (Procolobus rufomitratus) in Kibale National
   Park, Uganda, and controlled for spatial and temporal variation in food
   availability. We found that larger groups occupied larger home ranges
   than smaller groups and that group size was related to increased
   foraging effort (longer daily travel distance), increased group spread,
   and reduced female reproductive success. Our results also suggest that
   monkeys in larger groups spent more time feeding and less time engaged
   in social behavior. These results suggest that folivorous red colobus
   monkeys experience within-group scramble competition and possess a suite
   of behavioral responses that may mitigate the cost of competition and
   represent adaptations for group living. The results offer insight into
   the folivore paradox and the evolutionary ecology of group size.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental factors influence variation in life histories by affecting
   growth, development, and reproduction. We conducted an experiment in
   outdoor mesocosms to examine how diet and a time constraint on juvenile
   development (pond-drying) influence life-history trade-offs (growth,
   development, adult body mass) in the caddis fly Limnephilus externus
   (Trichoptera: Limnephilidae). We predicted that: (1) diet
   supplementation would accelerate larval growth and development, and
   enhance survival to adulthood; (2) pond-drying would accelerate
   development and increase larval mortality; and (3) the relationship
   between adult mass and age at maturity would be negative. Diet
   supplementation did lead to larger adult mass under nondrying
   conditions, but did not significantly alter growth or development rates.
   Contrary to predictions, pond-drying reduced growth rates and delayed
   development. The slope (positive or negative) of the female mass-age at
   maturity relationship depended on interactions with diet or pond-drying,
   but the male mass-age relationship was negative and independent of
   treatment. Our results suggest that pond-drying can have negative
   effects on the future fitness of individuals by increasing the risk of
   desiccation-induced, pre-reproductive mortality and decreasing adult
   body size at maturity. These negative effects on life history cannot be
   overcome with additional nutritional resources in this species. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{Vertical migration of Daphnia represents the best-studied
   predator-avoidance behaviour known; yet the mechanisms underlying the
   choice to migrate require further investigation to understand the role
   of environmental context. To investigate the optimal habitat choice of
   Daphnia under fish predation pressure, first, we selected the
   individuals exhibiting strong migration behaviour. The animals collected
   from the hypolimnion during the daytime were significantly larger, being
   more conspicuous, and in turn performed stronger diel vertical migration
   (DVM) when exposed to fish cue. We called them strong migrants. Second,
   we provided the strong migrant D. pulex with food at high and
   intermediate (1 and 0.4 mg C l(-1), respectively) levels, which were
   well above the incipient limiting level and of high quality. They traded
   the benefits of staying in the warm water layer and moved down to the
   cold water in response to fish cue indicating fish predation. The
   availability of food allowed the animals to stay in the cold
   hypolimnion. However, at the low food level (0.1 mg C l(-1)), which is
   an additional constraint on fitness, Daphnia moved away from the cold
   hypolimnion. Poor food condition resulted in strong migrant Daphnia to
   cease migration and remain in the upper warmer water layer. Although
   temperature is known to be a more important cost factor of DVM than
   food, our results clearly show that this is only true as long as food is
   available. It becomes clear that food availability is controlling the
   direction of vertical positioning when daphnids experience a dilemma
   between optimising temperature and food condition while being exposed to
   fish cue. Then they overlook the predation risk. Thus, the optimal
   habitat choice of Daphnia appears to be a function of several variables
   including temperature, food levels and fish predation.}},

Abstract = {{ovarian-based immunological research is currently restricted to proteins

   oocyte. Seven female possums were immunized against recombinant
   glutathione S-transferase-VAP1 fusion protein. Control animals (n=3)
   received antigen-free vaccinations. Following immunization, regular
   blood sampling determined the level and duration of immune response.
   Animals were monitored daily, pre- and post-immunization, to determine
   estrous cycling activity and the percentage of reproductive cycles
   yielding viable young. The reproductive tracts and somatic organs of
   VAP1-immunized (n=7), control-immunized (n=3) and non-immunized (n=5)
   animals were collected and examined by histology and transmission
   electron microscopy. VAP1 immunization caused a strong and sustained
   immune response. Elevated levels of VAP1 antibody binding were detected
   in sera following initial injections, and immune titers rose as boosters
   were administered. Immunization had no adverse effect upon animal
   behavior or body condition. immunized females demonstrated no major
   change in annual estrous cycling activity; however, the percentage of
   reproductive cycles resulting in pouch young decreased significantly (P
   < 0.05) by 40\%. Histological and ultrastructural analyses revealed an
   abundance of lipid-like degradation bodies within the ooplasm of
   developing oocytes and the cytoplasm of failing uterine zygotes. Active
   macrophage invasion of enlarged endometrial glands was observed in the

Abstract = {{When predator chemical cues are present, low activity of prey is a

   In this study, we experimentally investigated how behavioral responses

   attacked by dragonfly nymphs was lower with chemical cues of predator
   was present than without chemical cues, and most of attacks occurred

   on the other hand, their swimming speed was quicker and swimming
   distance was longer, respectively, and the rates of being approached of
   the swimming tadpoles by dragonfly nymph was lower than those not
   exposed to chemical cues. We found that the tadpoles are induced by
   predator chemical cues not only to generally lower activity but also to
   swim in bursts as additional behavior and that the suite of their
   behavioral responses reduce the vulnerability against dragonfly nymph.
   Tadpoles can receive information about the predation risks by chemical
   cues and adjust their defensive behavior accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{Aphid predators are a systematically disparate group of arthropods
   united oil the basis that they consume aphids as part of their diet. In

   Forficulina, syrphid larvae, carabids, staphylinids, cantharids and

   created by ecologists as a way of understanding predation, particularly
   for conservation biological control. We investigated whether trait-based
   approaches could bring some cohesion and structure to this predator
   group. A taxonomic hierarchy-based null model was created from taxonomic
   distances in which a simple Multiplicative relationship described the
   Linnaean hierarchies (species, genera, etc.) of fifty common aphid
   predators. Using the same fifty species, a functional groups model was
   developed using ten behavioural traits (e.g. polyphagy, dispersal,
   activity, etc.) to describe the way in which aphids were predated in the
   field. The interrelationships between species were then expressed as
   dissimilarities within each model and separately analysed using
   PROXSCAL, a multidimensional scaling (MDS) program. When ordinated using
   PROXSCAL and then statistically compared using Procrustes analysis, we
   found that only 17\% of information was shared between the two
   configurations. Polyphagy across kingdoms (i.e. predatory behaviour
   across animal, plant and fungi kingdoms) and the ability to withstand
   starvation over days, weeks and months were particularly divisive within
   the functional groups model. Confirmatory MDS indicated poor prediction
   of aphid predation rates by the configurations derived from either
   model. The counterintuitive conclusion was that the inclusion of
   functional traits, pertinent to the way in which predators fed oil
   aphids, did not lead to a large improvement in the prediction of
   predation rate when compared to the standard taxonomic approach.}},

   the codes of short-term feed appetence in farm and companion animals. A
   comparative oronasal nutrient sensing biology review. Can. J. Anim. Sci.
   88: 535-558. The evolution of the chemical senses has resulted in a
   sensory apparatus for high taste and smell acuity in mammals and birds
   to ensure self-nourishment. Such peripheral chemosensory systems
   function as a code to unfold the nutritional value of feedstuffs. Food
   ingestion simultaneously evokes odor, taste and thermo-mechanical
   (somatosensing) sensations. Olfaction represents the capacity to
   identify feed volatiles that are predominantly derived from essential
   nutrients in plants. Comparative biology of olfaction shows that
   primates and chickens have a smaller olfactory epithelium and fewer
   olfactory receptor (OR) genes than non-primate mammals studied to date
   including farm and companion animals, such as the pig, the cow, the dog,
   the cat and the horse. A significant proportion of the total OR genes in
   mammals and birds have lost their functionality (pseudogenes) in a
   process that seems to reflect a decrease in the animal's reliance on the
   sense of smell, particularly in humans and cows. The taste system allows
   animals to recognize a diverse repertoire of nutrient (sugars, amino
   acids, salts, acids and fats) or toxic related chemical entities that
   provide valuable information about the quality of food. Taste senses
   non-volatile molecules in the oral cavity through taste receptors (TR).
   The TR are expressed in the sensory cells forming the taste buds of the
   tongue's papillae. Taste cells are linked to a network of solitary
   chemosensory cells diffused through many non-taste tissues involved in
   metabolic homeostasis. The number of functional taste receptor genes
   (TASR) in humans is equivalent to that in other mammals and superior to
   that in chickens. The TASR family 1 (TAS1R coding for umami and sweet
   TR) is conserved, in number and type, across the species evaluated, with
   the exception of the sweet receptor in chicken and feline species. The
   TASR family 2 (TAS2R coding for bitter TR) shows a strong adaptive
   capacity to dietary sources and digestive physiology across vertebrates.
   Pseudogenization (loss of gene functionality) in the TAS2R family seems
   to be a frequent strategy. The implications of oronasal nutrient sensing
   related to comparative animal feeding strategies and behaviors such as
   neophobia, feed refusal and hedonic preferences are discussed. Feed
   palatability and appetence might be one of the main driving forces in
   short-term feed consumption. Finally, practical applications relevant to
   animal production are outlined.}},

Abstract = {{Although variation in individual lifestyle and genotype are important
   factors in explaining individual variation in the risk of developing

   developmentally plastic processes also contribute. These effects are
   mediated at least in part through epigenetic processes. These
   developmental pathways do not directly cause obesity but rather alter
   the risk of an individual developing obesity later in life. At least two
   classes of developmental pathway are involved. The mismatch pathway
   involves the evolved adaptive responses of the developing organism to
   anticipated future adverse environments, which have maladaptive
   consequences if the environment is mismatched to that predicted. This
   pathway can be cued by prenatal undernutrition or stresses that lead the
   organism to forecast an adverse future environment and change its
   developmental trajectory accordingly. As a result, individuals develop
   with central and peripheral changes that increase their sensitivity to
   an obesogenic environment. It provides a model for how obesity emerges
   in populations in rapid transition, but also operates in developed
   countries. There is growing experimental evidence that this pathway can
   be manipulated by, for example, postnatal leptin exposure. Secondly,
   maternal diabetes, maternal obesity and infant overfeeding are

Abstract = {{To review the human and veterinary literature regarding the
   neurophysiology of dyspnea and to provide evidence for the beneficial
   effects of several novel therapies aimed at the alleviation of dyspneic
   sensations.
   Data sources included scientific reviews, case reports, original
   research publications, and recent research conference proceedings.
   The use of blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic
   resonance imaging technology has revealed that the brain regions
   activated by air hunger in humans are also those activated by fear,
   pain, and thirst perception. In human subjects, it has been found that
   agents known to enhance the firing of pulmonary slowly adapting
   receptors (SARs) can alleviate the sensation of dyspnea without altering
   central respiratory drive. Several small studies have also shown that
   nebulized opioids can reduce the sensation of dyspnea apparently via
   activation of peripheral opioid receptors in the lung.
   There are several animal models relevant to both small and large animal
   clinical patient populations. Treatment of rats with a nebulized SAR
   sensitizing agent (furosemide) enhances SAR firing in response to lung
   inflation. Behavioral escape responses to airway occlusion are reduced
   in lightly anesthetized cats when treated with nebulized furosemide.
   Opioid agonists have been shown to inhibit the release of acetylcholine
   and other mediators from the airways of dogs and guinea pigs. Studies
   using a goat model with bilateral destruction of the pre-Botzinger
   Complex do not support current paradigms of air hunger origination.
   Veterinary patients may benefit from an approach to dyspnea that
   incorporates an understanding of the origins of the unpleasant
   sensations associated with the condition. Several novel therapies have
   shown promise in alleviating dyspneic sensations without altering
   respiratory drive. Further study is needed to determine the safety and
   efficacy of these therapies in veterinary patients.}},

   the risk of major depression (MID) is still debated. In this prospective
   Study, alexithymic levels were evaluated before, during and after a
   depressive episode.
   Method. The alexithymic levels, the presence of MID and the severity of
   anxious-depressive symptoms were evaluated at intervals of about I month
   in pregnant women attending the Centers for Prenatal Care, Using the
   Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS), the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental
   Disorders (PRIME-MD) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
   (HADS).
   Results. Sixteen women affected by MID, 21 affected by subthreshold
   depression and 112 non-depressed women were included in the study. Women
   who developed depression, compared to non-depressed women, showed
   similar TAS and HADS scores during the pre-morbid phase, a significant
   increase in the scores during depression and a significant decrease
   after remission, whereas no change. vas observed in non-depressed women.
   Conclusions. Our data suggest that in pregnant women alexithymia does
   not represent a personality trait that increases the risk of developing
   a depressive episode, and the), Support the hypothesis that alexithymia
   is a state-dependent phenomenon in depressed pregnant women.}},

Abstract = {{The field of applied animal behaviour science has seen significant
   changes since David Wood-Gush and others began to study the behaviour of
   domesticated animals in the 1950s. This paper looks at these changes in
   order to provide a perspective on where the science has come from and
   where it might be going. Applied behaviour science for much of the
   Wood-Gush era was primarily interested in the study of the biology of
   domestic animal behaviour rather than directly in animal welfare. The
   post-Wood-Gush era has been characterised by an increasing global
   concern for animal welfare. This has had widespread socio-political
   effects including a marked shift in funding priorities towards support
   for research on animal welfare issues. Consequently research output on
   animal welfare is currently on a steep incline, but there is evidence
   from literature searches that the contribution of applied animal
   behaviour science to this output maybe declining probably reflecting in
   part the wider suite of disciplines (including socio-economics) now
   contributing to welfare research. Despite the likelihood that there will
   continue to be demand for research on animal welfare, applied behaviour
   science should not be complacent over its future. One issue highlighted
   in this paper is the risk that the focus on applied welfare issues may
   limit the strategic development of applied behaviour science. This could
   be particularly detrimental where there is a need to address complex
   issues such as the development of approaches to assessment of subjective
   states in animals. It is proposed that International Society for Applied
   Ethology (ISAE) could help counter these influences by developing a
   strategic plan for the future of applied behavioural science, and the
   developments within the science that are required to meet future
   demands. Examples taken from this paper would be to raise awareness of
   the potential benefits in integrating the different biological
   approaches to welfare research, and the need for theoretical and
   strategic research including a wider use of quantitative modelling. In
   addition there is a growing need for approaches that link animal welfare
   with other societal issues in order to better understand the trade-offs
   between welfare and other concerns. Such a strategy would help focus the
   applied behaviour science community on meeting future challenges and
   should help sustain the legacy of David Wood-Gush and the other early
   pioneers in applied behaviour science into the future. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{There is now clear evidence that the pace and pathway of early growth is
   a major risk factor for the development of a group of chronic diseases
   that include coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and

   disorders. The so-called `fetal origins hypothesis' proposes that the
   disorders originate through developmental plasticity, whereby
   malnutrition during fetal life, infancy and early childhood permanently
   change the structure and function of the body, a phenomenon known as
   `programming'. This paper reviews recent findings in the Helsinki Birth
   Cohort, which comprises 13 345 men and women born in the city during
   1934-1944. There is also an older cohort comprising 7086 people born
   during 1924-1933. We review the paths of pre- and postnatal growth that
   lead to later disease. Children who later develop coronary heart disease
   and type 2 diabetes grow slowly during fetal life and infancy but
   thereafter increase their body mass indices rapidly. Those who later
   develop stroke grow slowly in fetal life, infancy and during childhood.

Abstract = {{In the absence of an effective predator, spatial patterns of large
   herbivores in northern temperate regions are largely influenced by food
   acquisition and energy conservation during winter, when resources are
   limited and the energetic cost of movement is high. In these
   circumstances animals would be expected to minimize movement to avoid
   unnecessary energy expenditures. With the addition of a top predator
   such a strategy may not be compatible with avoiding predation risk,
   therefore animals may increase their movement to avoid detection or
   escape capture. Such increased movement may occur on relatively fine
   scales within an animal's home range or may be manifested in broader
   scale responses such as dispersal or migration. With the reintroduction
   of wolves (Canis lupus) to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 and 1996,
   much attention has focused on the behavioral responses of large
   herbivores to wolf predation risk and the implications of these
   responses on ecosystem structure and function. Investigations are
   numerous but evaluations are complicated due partly to a paucity of data
   on elk (Cervus elaphus) spatial patterns prior to wolf reintroduction.
   We quantified winter movement patterns of a non-migratory elk herd in
   the Madison headwaters prior to the reintroduction of wolves, when
   animals were constrained only by nutritional restrictions, and following
   wolf colonization and establishment, when elk experienced significant
   wolf predation. We evaluated changes in home range size and fidelity and
   described broader scale elk movement patterns such as dispersal and
   migration. We predicted elk would shift from a winter strategy of being
   relatively sedentary and occupying areas based on energetic
   considerations in the absence of wolves, to a more spatially dynamic
   strategy as elk responded to increased predation risk from wolves.
   Furthermore, we incorporated our knowledge of landscape characteristics
   of the system to provide possible explanations for any changes in elk
   spatial responses.}},

Abstract = {{Large herbivores that inhabit seasonal environments face considerable
   challenges when trying to balance the conflicting demands of satisfying
   physiological requirements and avoiding predation. The harsh environment
   imposes strong nutritional constraints which influence activity patterns
   and foraging strategies. In addition, the need to evade predators
   strongly determines the way in which prey behave (Lima and Dill 1990).
   The traditional view is that prey manage food acquisition and predation
   risk by trading one behavior at the expense of the other. However, if a
   range of anti-predator behaviors can collectively be adopted at
   appropriate temporal scales, then this trade-off may be somewhat reduced
   (Lind and Cresswell 2005). Plasticity in prey behaviors may balance the
   need to forage and minimize predation risk, thereby allowing prey to
   remain in an environment that both provides adequate forage resources
   but also poses a high threat of predation. We observed the behavior of
   elk (Cervus elaphus) in the Madison headwaters area of Yellowstone
   National Park during 15 consecutive winter field seasons, accruing
   approximately 3100 h of behavioral data before and after wolf (Canis
   lupus) reintroduction to Yellowstone, when elk were exposed to varying
   degrees of wolf predation risk. We hypothesized that environmental and
   temporal factors would play a fundamental role governing the likelihood
   of winter foraging by elk. We proposed competing hypotheses regarding
   the effect of wolves. Based on the traditional view of the
   foraging-vigilance trade-off, we suspected that the addition of wolves
   to the system would manifest a higher degree of behavioral alertness in
   elk and reduce the likelihood of foraging. Alternatively, increasing
   behavioral alertness when wolves were actively hunting at night would
   manifest increased diurnal foraging. Furthermore, we incorporated our
   knowledge of the range of other behavioral responses exhibited by elk to
   determine if they behaviorally compensated to mediate any fitness costs
   associated with behaviors that reduced predation risk.}},

Abstract = {{How animals use resources at local and landscape scales can differ
   depending on whether starvation is the primary limiting factor or
   significant predation risk also exists. With predation, individuals face
   the added and often conflicting demands of obtaining adequate nutrition
   while reducing predation risk. However, disentangling differences
   between the respective resource selection strategies in a given system
   is rarely possible. We evaluated changes in resource selection and prey
   distribution for a non-migratory elk population formerly limited by
   winter starvation and now subjected to wolf predation in the Madison
   headwaters area of Yellowstone National Park. Analyses of elk resource
   selection prior to wolf establishment (1991-1992 through 1997-1998)
   demonstrated a dynamic spatial and temporal response to changes in snow
   pack at the local and landscape level, with elk selecting areas with low
   snow mass, but forced to occupy areas with higher local snow mass as
   conditions on the winter range became more severe (Chapter 8 by Messer
   et al., this volume). We hypothesized that variables affecting elk
   resource selection prior to wolves would retain their primacy in
   post-wolf models (1998-1999 through 2005-2006), but that the magnitude
   of each would change depending on its contribution to predation risk.
   Broad-scale changes in prey distribution could also occur if the
   collective attributes of a landscape serve to alternately provide areas
   with decreased or increased predation risk. Thus, we also evaluated the
   potential for landscape-scale shifts in the distribution of the elk
   population among the three drainages of the Madison headwaters area if
   elk selected distinct prey refuges and avoided areas where they were
   particularly vulnerable to wolf predation. Alternatively, elk
   distribution shifts among the three drainages could also result from
   differential predation risk with lower densities of animals in high risk
   areas due to the removal by wolves of substantial numbers of prey.}},

Abstract = {{We examined effects of seasonality, larval food availability and larval

   two summer generations showed that adult males resulting from group

   resulting from singly kept, food deprived larvae. Thus, sperm size is
   not a simple function of body size. Instead, we suggest that sperm size
   modification was caused by varying rearing densities. Group bred
   individuals produced smaller sperm but transferred at higher rate. This
   indicates a trade-off between sperm number and sperm size as predicted

Abstract = {{Social communication in the house mouse relies heavily on
   pheromone-carrying major urinary proteins (MUPs), which delay release of
   pheromones thus extending longevity of the scent signal. Moreover, MUPs
   appear to play an important role in individual recognition. In the last
   few years, new research has led to some important advances. It has been
   shown that MUPs without their volatile ligands are able to activate
   neurons in vomeronasal organ and elicit behavioural and physiological
   responses in the signal receiver. Furthermore, increasing evidence has
   been found showing that, contrary to the traditional view, MUP
   expression is condition and state dependent, and that this variation may
   provide additional information about an individual. Progress has also
   been made in the description of MUP-like proteins in other rodents; as
   yet, however, the protein variability typical of the house mouse has not
   been observed in any other species. Despite these new results, the
   concept of MUPs has remained more or less unchanged from the date they
   were first recognized as an identity signal. The aim of this review is
   to summarise recent knowledge about MUPs and to discuss previous

Abstract = {{Since the discovery of the double helix, the study of brain function, in
   terms of both physiology and behavioral traits, has resulted in a
   plethora of research linking these activities to the genetic basis of
   neurotransmitter function. Knowledge about how genes are expressed, as
   well as their potential impairment due to polygenic inheritance, can
   shed light on predispositions to addiction and self-destructive
   behaviors. Genetic information derived from scientific explorations of
   genetic traits may have important links to understanding the basis for
   feelings of well-being and potentially the phenomena associated with
   human happiness. While non-genetic oriented research of social,
   political, and biological studies have addressed the impact of social
   and institutional environments on mass political attitudes and
   behaviors, there is a paucity of solid research on the interrelation and
   influence of genetic and environmental factors on these parameters. The
   separate fields of psychology and molecular biology are subject to
   inherent limitations that may only be resolved through collaboration
   across disciplines. Certainly areas relating to spirituality
   ({''}Genospirituality{''}) and political science are just two that are
   beginning to emerge as fruitful grounds for identification of specific
   polymorphic gene associations and may pave the way to advance a new
   science of human nature. We address the issue of ``Nature vs.
   Nurture{''} as it relates to questions regarding the definition of
   happiness, its causes, and its promotion. These questions are central to
   understanding human nature and are emerging as an important target of
   research, especially in the area of nutrigenomics. The present
   commentary attempts to identify key ``vector influences{''} that link
   genes, the brain, nutrition, and social behavior to a most desired, but
   misunderstood, and potentially fragile experience known as
   ``happiness.{''} Specifically, we propose that successful changes in
   body composition/body mass index (BMI)/percentage of body fat will
   increase not only positive self-image, but overall wellness that

Pages = {{11-27}},
Abstract = {{This chapter provides an overview of the truism that both nature and
   nurture determine human athletic ability. The major thesis developed is
   that environmental effects work through the process of growth and
   development and interact with an individual's genetic background to
   produce a specific adult phenotype, i.e. an athletic or nonathletic
   phenotype. On the nature side (genetics), a brief historical review is
   provided with emphasis on several areas that are likely to command
   future attention including the rise of genome-wide association as a
   mapping strategy, the problem of false positives using association
   approaches, as well as the relatively unknown effects of gene-gene
   interaction (epistasis), gene-environment interaction, and genome
   structure on complex trait variance. On the nurture side (environment),
   common environmental effects such as training-level and sports nutrition
   are largely ignored in favor of developmental environmental effects that
   are channeled through growth and development processes. Developmental
   effects are difficult to distinguish from genetic effects as phenotypic
   plasticity in response to early life environmental perturbation can
   produce lasting effects into adulthood. In this regard, the fetal
   programming (FP) hypothesis is reviewed in some detail as FP provides an
   excellent example of how developmental effects work and also interact
   with genetics. In general, FP has well-documented effects on adult body
   composition and the risk for adult chronic disease, but there is
   emerging evidence that FP affects human athletic performance as well.

   of MetS and its component measures and x(2) analyses to compare these
   results with the most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination

Abstract = {{Unlike other visceral organs, the gastrointestinal tract has several
   communication channels transmitting to the spinal cord and brain, which
   include vagal afferent neurons, spinal afferent neurons, intestinofugal
   enteric neurons, and endocrine mechanisms. The vagus nerves have long
   been thought to play only a role in the efferent reflex regulation of
   digestion. It has turned out, however, that the majority of fibers in
   the vagus nerves is afferent in nature and subserves an unprecedented
   variety of physiological and pathophysiological roles. Thus, vagal
   afferents have a function in chemonociception and interoception (the
   sense of the physiological state of the body), modify
   affective-emotional processes in the brain, can give rise to nausea and
   vomiting, and carry messages relevant to appetite and nutrition. In the
   context of this book, it is particularly relevant that vagal afferents
   serve as a sensory interface between the peripheral immune system and
   the central as well as autonomic nervous system. Vagal afferents can
   respond to proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta and
   contribute to the behavioral sickness response to infection. In
   addition, they elicit a vagovagal anti-inflammatory reflex that results
   in the stimulation of cholinergic vagal efferents. Upon peripheral
   release, acetylcholine activates alpha7 subunit-containing nicotinic
   receptors on immune cells, which inhibits further release of
   proinflammatory cytokines and suppresses inflammation. These substantial
   advances in the understanding of vagal nerve function offer novel
   therapeutic opportunities for the management of nociception and
   inflammation.}},

Pages = {{145-166}},
Abstract = {{The current chapter reviews the relationship between future time
   perspective, income, health, and age. It is proposed that future time
   perspective, that is, how future experiences and consequences are
   evaluated and compared to the present, is one critical factor for
   understanding decision-making. Many personal decisions involve
   consequences (cost and benefits) that unfold over time. The current
   chapter focuses on health and financial decisions. Promoting preventive
   health behaviors and retirement savings is critical to the well-being of
   all Americans given the demographic trend in the United States toward a
   larger number of older adults using social services (e.g., Social
   Security and Medicare) and fewer working adults to pay for those
   services. Preventive health decisions (e.g., exercise, nutrition, and
   tobacco use) and financial decisions involve a trade-off between
   benefits (e.g., taking a vacation) and costs (e.g., depleting a savings
   account). Furthermore many of the trade-offs for preventive health and
   financial decisions involve an immediate benefit (e.g., eating dessert
   now) versus a delayed cost (gaining weight later) or an immediate cost
   (e.g., inconvenience and time to exercise) versus a delayed benefit
   (e.g., better cardiovascular health). The chapter reviews the
   fundamental concepts of intertemporal choice, time discounting, and
   related empirical research. New and emerging areas of research in future
   time perspective including future representation of events, age and life
   events, and emotion are discussed. In particular, the important role of
   age in future time perspective is identified and discussed. Future
   applications of research with an emphasis on specific determinants
   (e.g., anxiety) that tip decisions toward greater concern for future

Journal = {{POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{57}},

Pages = {{139-147}},
Abstract = {{According to Optimal Foraging Theory a consumer should select its diet
   in order to maximise net energy intake per unit of foraging time.
   Therefore, the Antarctic scavenging sea star Odontaster validus can be
   expected to choose food items of high profitability and ignore those of
   low profitability. Laboratory experiments with agar models of food items
   were performed to investigate the foraging behaviour and food
   selectivity of O. validus. Freshly caught sea stars were first fed with
   fish meat to minimize differences in their feeding status and then
   starved for 2 and 4 weeks. Sea stars were divided into three size groups
   (small - radius 1-3 cm, medium - radius 3-4 cm, large - radius 4-5.5
   cm). Agar food items of different quality (low - 1.2 kJ, medium - 2.5
   kJ, high - 4.1 kJ) and size (small - 8 cm(3) and large - 64 cm(3)) were
   utilized in the experiments, Sea stars were individually presented with
   food items placed on the aquarium bottom, and their behaviour (number
   and type of investigated food items, time needed for final choice) was
   observed for 30 minutes. Starved individuals preferentially selected
   more profitable food items as is predicted by Optimal Foraging Theory.
   Choice of food item was probably mediated by contact chemoreception,
   Starvation time and sea star size had significant impact on selectivity.
   Mean number of food items of different quality investigated by sea stars
   starved for 2 weeks was higher then in sea stars starved for 4 weeks.
   Low quality food items by large individuals starved for 2 weeks. Sea
   stars O. validus were also capable of distinguishing between small and
   large food items. Final choice made by sea stars presented with food
   items of differing size depended on their size with large and medium
   individuals choosing mostly large food items. Sea stars starved for 2
   weeks chose higher proportion of large food items than individuals
   starved for 4 weeks. Such strategy in accordance with Optimal Foraging
   Theory allows for flexibility in O. validus feeding behaviour and
   enables this species to survive in harsh marine environment, where food
   resources accessible during the Antarctic winter are scarce and
   unpredictable in space and time.}},

Title = {{The effects of heterogeneous regimes on reproductive skew in eutherian
   mammals}},
Booktitle = {{REPRODUCTIVE SKEW IN VERTEBRATES: PROXIMATE AND ULTIMATE CAUSES}},
Year = {{2009}},
Pages = {{84-113}},
Abstract = {{Although several models of reproductive skew have been proposed,
   ``transactional{''} models, on the one hand, and ``tug-of-war{''} or
   ``incomplete control{''} models, on the other hand, are most commonly
   debated. The former hold that dominants control group size by yielding
   ``incentives{''} (a share of total group productivity) to subordinates,
   while the latter advance the idea that the dominant's control over one
   or more subordinates is incomplete. While high skew has been identified
   in several mammalian societies, most research on this topic shows that
   social mammals are likely to display intermediate, low, or variable
   reproductive skew. In an attempt to explain this pattern of results, the
   present chapter shows that mammals have evolved to cope with
   heterogeneous environmental regimes (abiotic and biotic), yielding a
   eutherian adaptive complex comprised of endothermy, relative brain
   enlargement, and behavioral flexibility. It is argued that these
   adaptations to environmental unpredictability favor the evolution of
   alternative phenotypes as well as situation- and condition-dependent
   responses decreasing the likelihood that dominants will be able to
   monopolize subordinates, including females, and that high skew will be
   observed. Additional research is required to highlight similarities and,
   most important, differences in the routes to sociality between insects,
   birds, and mammals (see Vehrencamp 1979).
   A simple mathematical model is presented linking reproductive
   suppression by a dominant to his/her influence on a subordinate and
   consequent ability to monopolize the subordinate. This treatment shows
   that, depending upon conditions, both types of skew models are
   realistic. Reproductive skew is discussed in relation to allocation
   decisions and the different reproductive tactics of female and male
   mammals. All other things being equal, reproductive skew in
   heterogeneous regimes may be limited for taxa with relatively
   generalized phenotypes, because exposure to unpredictable conditions
   increases the likelihood of error, uncertainty, and risk of response
   outcomes, decreasing the ability to control a conspecific.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The ability of inferring mental states of others ( also
   named ``Theory of Mind{''} or ``ToM{''} abilitiy) has been developed due
   an evolution pressure exerted by progressively more complex societies

   individuals. Such impairment might explain the occurrence of psychotic
   symptoms in these individuals. Objective: To review critically the
   literature on possible alterations of ToM processing in individuals with
   schizotypy or subsyndromal psychotic symptoms. Methods: We performed a
   search on MedLine database for articles published in English or
   Portuguese between 1990 and 2008, using the phrase ``Schizotypal
   Personality Disorder {[}MeSH] AND ``Theory of Mind{''} OR
   ``Mentalising{''}. Results: Fifteen manuscripts have been selected,
   which used diverse experimental designs and instruments to evaluate
   schizotypal traits, vulnerability to psychosis and ToM abilities.
   Discussion: The reviewed articles aimed to establish relationships
   between vulnerability to psychosis and alterations in ToM processing.
   Some articles also approached the trait or state dependence character of
   ToM impairments. The great majority of the selected manuscripts
   suggested that individuals who scored high in schizotypy scales, as well
   as schizophrenic relatives, do show problems in ToM processing ( which
   suggests a trait dependence character). However, these results should be
   interpreted carefully due to methodological problems seen in the
   majority of the studies.}},

Abstract = {{Eating is not only triggered by hunger but also by the sight of foods.
   Viewing appetizing foods alone can induce food craving and eating,

   overeating, identifying its neural correlates is important for
   understanding the current epidemic of obesity. Animal research has
   identified the ventral striatum, amygdala, hypothalamus, medial
   prefrontal and premotor cortices as key interacting structures for
   feeding. However, it is unclear whether a similar network exists in
   humans and how it is affected by EFS. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging, we showed that viewing appetizing compared with bland
   foods produced changes in connectivity among the human ventral striatum,
   amygdala, anterior cingulate and premotor cortex that were strongly
   correlated with EFS. Differences in the dynamic interactions within the
   human appetitive network in response to pictures of appetizing foods may

Month = {{JAN 31}},
Abstract = {{Exploration appears to be carried out for its own purpose due to being
   self-rewarding. Furthermore, it increases environmental certainty with
   the effect of increased predictability and control of the environment.
   We, therefore, supposed that exploratory behaviour is associated with
   positive emotions and could be a valuable tool in the assessment of
   animal welfare from the positive side. Since assessing the level of
   exploration in daily life is time consuming, the goal of our study was
   to develop a feasible on-farm test to estimate the daily exploratory
   level of beef bulls. This was based on the hypothesis that bulls in
   barren environments (here: pens with fully slatted floors) will explore
   an unknown object more than those housed under more enriched conditions
   (here: littered pens). A novel object test at the feed rack over a 1-h
   period was carried out in 64 groups of fattening bulls on farms in
   Germany and Austria. In order to evaluate sensitivity of the test half
   of the barren pens in Germany were slightly enriched after these tests
   and bulls tested again after 1 week. During the first three quarters of
   the test hour, significantly more barren-housed bulls were occupied with
   the objects than animals in littered pens. This was predominantly due to
   more licking/chewing of the novel object. However, the differences in
   exploration levels were only slight. Moreover, the test was not
   sensitive to the slight short-term change in stimulation of the bulls
   following the simple enrichment. The motivational basis for increased
   exploration of the novel object by licking or chewing in bulls kept in
   barren conditions is not clear-cut. While it might reflect that these
   bulls gain less positive emotions from intrinsic exploration in their
   daily life, nutritional aspects may also play a role. While further
   investigations should aim to identify the motivational basis of
   occupation with the novel object and relate true daily exploration
   levels to test results, for the on-farm assessment of good animal
   welfare the test appears not to be promising in its current form. (C)

Abstract = {{This study investigated intra-test and inter-test consistency of dairy
   cattle behavioural responses to a series of tests involving human
   approach and exposure to novelty. Thirty-six lactating Holstein-Friesian
   cows were each subjected to three human approach tests and three novel
   stimuli tests. Flight response score was assessed by an experimenter
   approaching cows when they were in the passageway of the home-pen (AP),
   lying down (AL) and at the feedface (FF). Each human approach test was
   repeated on each cow three times. The intra-animal repeatability
   estimates were 0,65,0.40,0.27 for AP, AL and FF tests, respectively.
   Repeatability evaluates an individual's consistency across tests by
   comparing it to the variation within the group. Cows showed moderate
   consistency in their flight response scores to the different approach
   tests (W(35) - 0.56, P < 0.01). Three novel stimuli (water spray,
   striped boards and flashing light) were individually presented once to
   each cow. Investigatory and reactivity behavioural responses were

   spray compared to the striped boards (U(1) - 56, P < 0.001) and flashing
   light (U(1) - 66, P < 0.001). No statistically significant agreement

Abstract = {{Many herbivores and omnivores can balance their intake of macronutrients
   when faced with nutritionally variable environments. Carnivores,
   however, are widely believed to optimize their rates of prey capture and

   balancing in captive mink and found a pronounced ability to balance and
   regulate intake of protein and lipid. When faced with one of several
   different pairings of complementary foods varying in protein to lipid
   composition, mink apportioned intake between the two foods to defend a
   near constant ratio and amount (intake target) of the two

   mink balanced macronutrient intake relative to the intake target,
   without showing the excessive energy intake on diets with a low
   percentage of protein and energy deficit on diets with a high percentage
   of protein previously reported for herbivores and omnivores, including
   humans. This demonstration of nutrient balancing in a carnivorous mammal

Abstract = {{Behavioural field observations are increasingly being used in
   ecotoxicological research to identify potential adverse effects of
   exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs). We investigated
   thermal conditions inside the nest and parental behaviour of glaucous
   gulls, Larus hyperboreus, breeding in the Norwegian Arctic in relation
   to the concentrations of major classes of POPs (organochlorines,
   brominated flame retardants and metabolically derived products)
   accumulated in their blood. Most notably, nest temperature was
   negatively correlated with the concentrations of the sum of (Sigma) DDT,
   Sigma PCB and several quantitatively minor POP classes within the
   incubating parent. To investigate the relationship between incubation
   ability and parental POP exposure further, we experimentally increased
   the costs of incubation by artificially increasing the clutch size from
   two to four eggs. Clutch enlargement was followed by a decrease in nest
   temperature, but this drop in temperature was not associated with POP
   concentrations within the incubating parent. However, males, which had
   higher POP concentrations and lower white blood cell counts than
   females, seemed less able to maintain nest temperature. There was
   virtually no evidence to suggest that Sigma PCB or Sigma DDT were
   associated with changes in the time a bird spent incubating. However,
   there was some indication that nest site attendance by nonincubating
   males was negatively related to Sigma DDT, suggesting that nest
   protection may have been compromised. The results suggest that adverse
   effects of parental POP exposure may occur through suboptimal thermal
   conditions for embryo development and possibly increased egg predation
   risk. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{457-463}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The study of breeding habitat selection has focused mainly on physical
   characteristics of the environment such as nest sites and food
   abundance, both of which are required for successful reproduction.
   However, individuals may have limited time to make settlement decisions,
   and thus, their knowledge of resource availability may be incomplete.
   Furthermore, food abundance during settlement may not reflect levels
   later in the breeding season. An alternative perspective is that the
   most direct measure of habitat suitability is derived from social
   information such as the presence of conspecifics (conspecific
   attraction) or their reproductive performance (habitat copying). We
   tested resource and socially based hypotheses of habitat selection in a
   population of eastern kingbirds, Tyrannus tyrannus, at Malheur National
   Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Oregon, U.S.A. Kingbirds nested in areas
   with a greater proportion of suitable nest trees than what was generally
   available, but many areas with suitable numbers of trees went unused.
   Kingbirds also settled in areas of relatively high insect abundance, but
   only in years when overall abundance was low. We also found support for
   the socially based hypotheses. Relative to where they nested previously,
   kingbirds tended to settle in areas of higher conspecific density. But,
   we found stronger evidence in favour of habitat copying, suggesting that
   dispersing individuals settled in areas that produced more fledglings in
   the previous year. Kingbirds thus appeared to select breeding habitat
   based, in part, on resource availability, but dispersal decisions may be
   influenced by social information, primarily past reproductive success of
   conspecifics. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal

   atherosclerosis. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), a systemic
   inflammatory marker, has been gaining recognition as an independent risk
   factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Both baseline hsCRP
   concentrations and drug-induced hsCRP changes are highly variable and
   potentially subject to genetic regulation.
   CONTENT: This review summarizes the current studies examining the effect
   of genetic and environmental factors on baseline plasma hsCRP
   concentrations, with a main focus on C-reactive protein,
   pentraxin-related (CRP) genetic polymorphisms and various dietary
   components that affect hsCRP concentrations. We also address the
   association of CRP genetic variations with CVD risk, a relationship that
   may support or refute the causality of CRP in the atherosclerotic
   process. Moreover, we discuss the impact of CRP genetic polymorphisms on
   hsCRP changes in response to 3-week fenofibrate treatment in the genetic
   intervention of the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network
   study.
   SUMMARY: Genetic variants on the CRP locus and other loci and dietary
   and lifestyle factors are responsible for the interindividual
   variability of plasma hsCRP concentrations. CRP genetic variants further
   influence differing plasma hsCRP response after 3-week fenofibrate
   treatment in patients with metabolic syndrome. Future studies focusing
   on the influence and interaction of genetic variation on the hsCRP
   response to dietary and other behavior modification as well as drug
   treatment could have important implications for the development of more
   personalized preventive and therapeutic approaches to reduce CVD. (C)

Abstract = {{Background Fetal programming of diabetes might originate in early
   pregnancy when fingerprints are permanently established. The mean
   dermatoglyphic ridge count difference between fingertips 1 and 5
   ('Md15') varies with the early prenatal environment. We hypothesized
   that Md15 would be associated with adult-onset diabetes.
   Methods We obtained Md15 from 577 Dutch adults (aged 58.9 years, SD 1.1)
   whose births in 1943-47 were documented in maternity records and from
   260 of their same-sex siblings for whom birth weights were not
   available. Of these 837 participants, complete anthropometry and
   diabetes status (from history or glucose tolerance test) were obtained
   for 819.
   Results After adjustment for age, sex, parental diabetes and adult
   anthropometry, fingerprint Md15 was associated with prevalent diabetes
   {[}odds ratio (OR) = 1.37 per 1 SD (95\% confidence interval
   1.02-1.84)]. This relationship held {[}OR = 1.40 (1.03-1.92)] for
   diabetic cases restricted to those recently diagnosed (within 7 years).
   In the birth series restricted to recently diagnosed cases, the mutually
   adjusted ORs were 1.34 (1.00-1.79) per SD of Md15 and 0.83 (0.62-1.10)
   per SD of birth weight. Further adjustments for maternal smoking,
   conception season or prenatal famine exposure in 1944-45 did not alter
   these estimates. Among 42 sibling pairs discordant for diabetes, the
   diabetic sibling had higher Md15 by 3.5 (0.6-6.3) after multi-variable
   adjustment.
   Conclusions Diabetes diagnosed at age 50+ years was associated with a
   fingerprint marker established in early gestation, irrespective of birth
   weight. Fingerprints may provide a useful tool to investigate prenatal
   developmental plasticity.}},

Title = {{Behavioural plasticity associated with propagule size, resources, and
   the invasion success of the Argentine ant Linepithema humile}},

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{46}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The number of individuals involved in an invasion event, or `propagule
   size', has a strong theoretical basis for influencing invasion success.
   However, rarely has propagule size been experimentally manipulated to
   examine changes in invader behaviour, and propagule longevity and
   success.
   We manipulated propagule size of the invasive Argentine ant Linepithema
   humile in laboratory and field studies. Laboratory experiments involved
   L. humile propagules containing two queens and 10, 100, 200 or 1000
   workers. Propagules were introduced into arenas containing colonies of
   queens and 200 workers of the competing native ant Monomorium
   antarcticum. The effects of food availability were investigated via
   treatments of only one central resource, or 10 separated resources.
   Field studies used similar colony sizes of L. humile, which were
   introduced into novel environments near an invasion front.
   In laboratory studies, small propagules of L. humile were quickly
   annihilated. Only the larger propagule size survived and killed the
   native ant colony in some replicates. Aggression was largely independent
   of food availability, but the behaviour of L. humile changed
   substantially with propagule size. In larger propagules, aggressive
   behaviour was significantly more frequent, while L. humile were much
   more likely to avoid conflict in smaller propagules.
   In field studies, however, propagule size did not influence colony
   persistence. Linepithema humile colonies persisted for up to 2 months,
   even in small propagules of 10 workers. Factors such as temperature or
   competitor abundance had no effect, although some colonies were
   decimated by M. antarcticum.
   Synthesis and applications. Although propagule size has been correlated
   with invasion success in a wide variety of taxa, our results indicate
   that it will have limited predictive power with species displaying
   behavioural plasticity. We recommend that aspects of animal behaviour be
   given much more consideration in attempts to model invasion success.
   Secondly, areas of high biodiversity are thought to offer biotic
   resistance to invasion via the abundance of predators and competitors.
   Invasive pests such as L. humile appear to modify their behaviour
   according to local conditions, and establishment was not related to
   resource availability. We cannot necessarily rely on high levels of
   native biodiversity to repel invasions.}},

Abstract = {{Open population mark-recapture analysis of unbounded populations
   accommodates some types of closure violations (e.g. emigration,
   immigration). In contrast, closed population analysis of such
   populations readily allows estimation of capture heterogeneity and
   behavioural response, but requires crucial assumptions about closure
   (e.g. no permanent emigration) that are suspect and rarely tested
   empirically.
   In 2003, we erected a double-sided barrier to prevent movement of snakes
   in or out of a 5-ha semi-forested study site in northern Guam. This
   geographically closed population of > 100 snakes was monitored using a
   series of transects for visual searches and a 13 x 13 trapping array,
   with the aim of marking all snakes within the site. Forty-five marked
   snakes were also supplemented into the resident population to quantify
   the efficacy of our sampling methods. We used the program mark to
   analyse trap captures (101 occasions), referenced to census data from
   visual surveys, and quantified heterogeneity, behavioural response, and
   size bias in trappability. Analytical inclusion of untrapped individuals
   greatly improved precision in the estimation of some covariate effects.
   A novel discovery was that trap captures for individual snakes consisted
   of asynchronous bouts of high capture probability lasting about 7 days
   (ephemeral behavioural effect). There was modest behavioural response
   (trap happiness) and significant latent (unexplained) heterogeneity,
   with small influences on capture success of date, gender, residency
   status (translocated or not), and body condition.
   Trapping was shown to be an effective tool for eradicating large brown
   treesnakes Boiga irregularis (> 900 mm snout-vent length, SVL).
   Synthesis and applications. Mark-recapture modelling is commonly used by
   ecological managers to estimate populations. However, existing models
   involve making assumptions about either closure violations or response
   to capture. Physical closure of our population on a landscape scale
   allowed us to determine the relative importance of covariates
   influencing capture probability (body size, trappability periods, and
   latent heterogeneity). This information was used to develop models in
   which different segments of the population could be assigned different
   probabilities of capture, and suggests that modelling of open
   populations should incorporate easily measured, but potentially
   overlooked, parameters such as body size or condition.}},

   enclosures, we simulated two competitive contexts favouring development
   of divergent male sizes. Relatively smaller males lost when competing
   directly, but had 10 times higher fitness than relatively larger males

Abstract = {{Foraging theory seeks to explain how the distribution and abundance of
   prey influence the evolution of predatory behaviour, including the
   allocation of effort to searching for prey and handling them after they

   behaviour phenotypically within individual lifetimes, few have examined
   the actual evolution of predatory behaviour in light of this theory.
   Here, we test the effects of prey density on the evolution of a
   predator's searching and handling behaviours using a bacterial predator,
   Myxococcus xanthus. Sixteen predator populations evolved for almost a
   year on agar surfaces containing patches of Escherichia coli prey at low
   or high density. Improvements in searching rate were significantly
   greater in those predators that evolved at low prey density. Handling
   performance also improved in some predator populations, but prey density
   did not significantly affect the magnitude of these gains. As the
   predators evolved greater foraging proficiency, their capacity
   diminished to produce fruiting bodies that enable them to survive
   prolonged periods of starvation. More generally, these results
   demonstrate that predators evolve behaviours that reflect at least some
   of the opportunities and limitations imposed by the distribution and
   abundance of their prey.}},

Abstract = {{The processes promoting disease in wild animal populations are highly
   complex, yet identifying these processes is critically important for
   conservation when disease is limiting a population. By combining field
   studies with epidemiologic tools, we evaluated the relationship between
   key factors impeding southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis)
   population growth: disease and resource limitation. This threatened
   population has struggled to recover despite protection, so we followed
   radio-tagged sea otters and evaluated infection with 2 disease-causing
   protozoal pathogens, Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis neurona, to
   reveal risks that increased the likelihood of pathogen exposure. We
   identified patterns of pathogen infection that are linked to individual
   animal behavior, prey choice, and habitat use. We detected a high-risk
   spatial cluster of S. neurona infections in otters with home ranges in
   southern Monterey Bay and a coastal segment near San Simeon and Cambria
   where otters had high levels of infection with T. gondii. We found that
   otters feeding on abalone, which is the preferred prey in a
   resource-abundant marine ecosystem, had a very low risk of infection
   with either pathogen, whereas otters consuming small marine snails were
   more likely to be infected with T. gondii. Individual dietary
   specialization in sea otters is an adaptive mechanism for coping with
   limited food resources along central coastal California. High levels of
   infection with protozoal pathogens may be an adverse consequence of
   dietary specialization in this threatened species, with both depleted
   resources and disease working synergistically to limit recovery.}},

Volume = {{369}},

Abstract = {{Blue crabs are cannibalistic, and therefore the scent of injured
   conspecifics represents both a potential food cue, as well as an
   indicator of predation risk. We examined the response of blue crabs to
   conspecific odor alone, as well as in mixtures of attractive cues to
   determine how animals evaluate and respond to this odor. We explicitly
   manipulated risk-sensitivity based on either animal size (an indicator
   of susceptibility to predation) or hunger state (susceptibility to
   starvation) as ways to evaluate theories of risk-allocation, which
   suggest that decreases in predation risk, or increases in the risk of
   starvation, ought to result in diminished responses to sensory cues that
   signal predator presence or activity. Large and small blue crabs were
   challenged to locate the source of odor plumes consisting of the scent
   of injured conspecifics (risk cue), attractive food odors (attractive
   cue), or their mixture (conflicting cue). Neither large nor small blue
   crabs tracked aversive cues, but large blue crabs consistently tracked
   conflicting treatments to their source. Responses to conflicting and
   aversive treatments also involved diminished movement and reduced
   tracking speed relative to behaviors displayed in attractive plumes.
   Thus, even cannibalistic crabs seem to respond more prevalently to the
   apparent predation risk then to food reward, and risk-sensitive
   behaviors have a likely cost in terms of reduced food intake. Starved
   animals were more likely than unstarved animals to track conflicting
   plumes. Both the ontogenic shift and the response of starved animals
   support the notion that the cost of risk-aversive behaviors results in
   this strategy being allocated in proportion to the degree of potential
   risk. Since risk-aversive responses to chemical cues can produce strong
   effects in communities, the size-dependent nature of these responses in
   blue crabs may introduce considerable complexity in interactions between
   blue crabs, their predators, and their prey. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The primary goal of this article was to illustrate how nutritional
   deficiencies can translate into adult or child mental health problems.
   Whereas brain development and function play an essential role in the
   etiology and maintenance of mental health problems, what is required are
   models that go beyond nutrition-brain relations and integrate the
   contributions of nutritionally related contextual and behavioral
   characteristics. Four such models are presented. The multiple risks
   model derives from evidence showing covariance between nutritional
   deficiencies and other life stressors. Given that poorly nourished
   adults may be less able to actively cope with stressors, nutritional
   deficiencies may accentuate the negative impact of stress exposure on
   mental health. The cross-generational model is based on evidence showing
   less adequate patterns of mother-child interactions when mothers are
   poorly nourished. Impairments in mother-child interactions increase the
   likelihood of child mental health problems and the risk of subsequent
   child nutritional deficiencies. The attachment model derives from
   evidence showing that poorly nourished infants may be less likely to
   elicit the types of maternal child-rearing patterns that translate into
   secure infant-mother attachments. Insecure attachments in infancy are
   associated with an increased risk of both short-term and long-term child
   mental health problems. The temperament model is based on evidence
   documenting that certain patterns of infant temperament are related to
   an increased risk of later behavioral problems. Infant nutritional
   deficiencies can influence the development of temperament, and certain
   temperament patterns can contribute to an increased risk of infant
   nutritional deficiencies. Am J Clin Nutr 2009; 89(suppl): 935S-9S.}},

   significant public health issue. Given current barriers to the effective
   treatment of these problems, researchers are looking to the field of
   nutrition for potential alternatives to better understand and address
   mental health issues. The purpose of this article was to review current
   evidence on the relation between zinc and mental health disorders with a
   focus on 2 mental health problems that commonly affect women and

   Relations between zinc concentrations and behavior in animals; the
   relation between zinc deficiency, depression, and ADHD in patient and
   community samples; and the potential biological mechanisms for these
   relations were explored. The data support a relation between low
   concentrations of zinc and mental health problems, especially in at-risk
   populations. Evidence for the potential use of zinc in treating mental
   health problems comes mainly from patient populations and is strongest
   when zinc is given in combination with pharmacologic treatment. Less

Abstract = {{Background: Depressive disorders are a major source of disability among
   low-income mothers in developing countries.
   Objectives: The objectives were to examine the association of maternal
   depressive symptoms and infant growth among infants in rural Bangladesh
   and to examine how the relation is affected by infant irritability and
   caregiving practices.
   Design: Infant growth was measured among 221 infants at 6 and 12 mo.
   Mothers reported their depressive symptoms and perceptions of their
   infant's temperament, and a home observation of caregiving was
   conducted.
   Results: At 6 mo, 18\% of infants were stunted (length-for-age,22 z
   scores). At 12 mo, 36.9\% of infants were stunted; infants of mothers
   with depressive symptoms had a 2.17 higher odds of being stunted (95\%
   CI: 1.24, 3.81; P = 0.007) than did infants of mothers with few symptoms
   (45.3\% compared with 27.6\%). In a multivariate regression analysis,
   maternal depressive symptoms were associated with 12-mo length-for-age,
   adjusted for 6-mo length-for-age, maternal education, infant sex, birth
   order, receipt of iron and zinc, months breastfed, maternal perception
   of infant temperament, and caregiving observations. Maternal depressive
   symptoms were not related to 12-mo weight-for-length. The relation
   between depressive symptoms and infant growth was not moderated by
   maternal perceptions of infant temperament, but was partially mediated
   by caregiving.
   Conclusions: The finding that infants of mothers with depressive
   symptoms in Bangladesh experience poor linear growth may extend to other
   low-income countries with high rates of food insecurity. Interventions
   to promote growth in infants should include prevention or treatment of
   maternal depressive disorders and strategies to ensure adequate food
   security. Am J Clin Nutr 2009; 89(suppl): 951S-7S.}},

   colonies at the southern African west coast, potentially caused by
   deteriorating food availability. The behavioural responses of
   individuals to changing conditions can provide insights into the
   mechanisms that drive population dynamics. We studied the relationship
   between parental provisioning behaviour and the breeding success of Cape
   Gannets breeding at Ichaboe Island (Namibia) in two years with different
   nesting success, to assess the potential role of variation in food
   availability in explaining variation in chick survival. In 2006/07
   parents delayed the onset of breeding and visited nests at a lower
   frequency than in 2005/06, indicating that food availability was
   limited. Within the years individual differences in provisioning rate
   but not in parental condition were associated with chick growth and
   survival. These associations remained present when controlling for
   seasonal changes. Predation, not starvation, was the main cause of
   mortality. Under poor conditions, as indicated by long foraging trips,
   Cape Gannet parents left small chicks unattended, resulting in many
   being killed by Kelp Gulls Larus dominicanus. Long foraging trips were
   associated with reduced average breeding success, but impacted some
   parents more than others. Knowledge of the origin of this
   inter-individual variability is needed to predict how changes in food
   availability affect seabird population dynamics, which is one of the
   steps towards conservation of these birds.}},

Abstract = {{Polyphenism in larval amphibians has been related to several factors,
   including wetland hydroperiod, food availability, competition, and
   predation. Spadefoot toads (genus Spea Cope, 1866) often exhibit a
   trophic polyphenism by developing distinct carnivore and omnivore larval
   morphotypes. Using a multimodel selection approach, we investigated the
   influence of land use (cropland vs. grassland type) and differences in
   annual precipitation on morphotype expression in Plains spadefoot (Spea
   bombifrons (Cope, 1863)) and New Mexico spadefoot (Spea multiplicata
   (Cope, 1863)) toads in playas. We also examined the relative importance
   of tadpole density, tadpole age, water-loss stress, wetland size,
   density of larval mole salamanders (genus Ambystoma Tschudi, 1838; a
   predator on Spea tadpoles), and food resources on morph occurrence. The
   carnivore morphotype developed almost exclusively in S. bombifrons and
   rarely in S. multiplicata regardless of land use. Habitat availability
   measured by water-loss rate, as well as predation risk and tadpole age,
   were the most important factors influencing carnivore proportions.
   Ambystoma density was positively associated, whereas water-depth loss
   and tadpole age were negatively associated with the proportion of
   carnivores. The greatest proportion of carnivores was observed in
   grassland playas, which had the highest density of Ambystoma predators,
   longest hydroperiods, and experienced water-depth gain. Fairy shrimp
   density was not correlated with the proportion of carnivores. Upland
   land use through cultivation-associated erosion is altering wetland
   trophic structure, which further influences morphotype expression in
   Spea tadpoles and playa amphibian community structure.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the effects of hypoxia on macrobenthic communities in the
   York and Rappahannock Rivers, Chesapeake Bay, in box-core samples before
   and after hypoxic episodes in 2003 and 2004. Hypoxia occurred in both
   years and was associated with a decrease in biomass and a shift in
   community structure toward opportunistic species in both rivers.
   Long-term data indicate that the frequency of hypoxia in the York has
   increased over the last 22 years. In previous work from similar to 20
   years ago, the macrobenthic community structure did not change in
   response to hypoxia in the York; however, in the present study hypoxia
   was associated with a reduction in community biomass and a change in
   community structure. We conclude that currently hypoxia is a more
   important environmental problem in the York than in previous years.
   Hypoxia likely negatively affects the estuarine food web, as lower
   macrobenthic biomass could decrease food availability to epibenthic
   predators.}},

Abstract = {{Background: African Americans are more insulin resistant than are
   Whites. The purpose of this study was to characterize physiologic and
   psychological (stress coping style) correlates of insulin resistance in
   African Americans and Whites.
   Methods: We examined African American (n = 67) and White (n = 41) men
   and women aged 18-45 years with body mass index 1835 kg/m(2). We used
   the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) and area under the curve for
   insulin (AUC) after a standardized meal as measure of insulin
   resistance. We obtained anthropometric measures and determined maximal
   aerobic power (VO2max) by treadmill exercise. We used stress profile to
   assess stress and coping style.
   Results: Postprandial insulin AUCs were higher in African Americans than
   in Whites. Anthropometric measures and VO2max were related to HOMA-IR
   and AUC. Although self-reported stress level did not differ between
   Whites and African Americans, positive appraisal predicted reduced
   HOMA-IR and negative appraisal coping style predicted increased insulin
   AUC.
   Conclusions: Psychosocial factors may be determinants of health and
   targets of intervention for obesity-related disorders such as insulin
   resistance. Existing behavioral intervention programs, designed with a
   sole emphasis on exercise and nutrition, may fall short of optimal
   effectiveness. (Ethn Dis. 2009;19:104-110)}},

Abstract = {{Both rs17782313 (near MC4R) and rs1421085 (FTO) polymorphisms have been
   consistently associated with increased risk of obesity and with body
   mass index (BMI) variation. An effect of both polymorphisms on satiety
   has recently been suggested. We genotyped rs17782313 and rs1421085 in
   5764 relatives from 1109 French pedigrees with familial obesity, 1274
   Swiss class III obese adults as well as in 4877 French adults and 5612
   Finnish teenagers from two randomly selected population cohorts. In all
   subjects, eating behaviour traits were documented through
   questionnaires. We first assessed the association of both single
   nucleotide polymorphisms with BMI and then studied eating behaviour.
   Under an additive model, the rs17782313-C MC4R allele showed a trend
   towards higher percentages of snacking in both French obese children (P
   = 0.01) and Swiss obese adults (P = 0.04) as well as in adolescents from

   Stunkard hunger score (P = 0.02) and in obese children with a higher
   prevalence of eating large amounts of food (P = 0.04). However, no
   consistent association of the FTO rs1421085-C allele and available

Abstract = {{Artificially selected qualities can reduce fitness in a wild setting,

   Domestic sheep Ovis aries have frequently become feral on islands, which

   body mass and wool traits in feral sheep inhabiting Santa Cruz Island
   (SCI), California for >= 90 years. To elucidate the influence of
   nutrition, we compared the mass of feral island sheep with that of
   island sheep raised in farm conditions. We found that feral sheep on SCI
   were smaller than purported founder breeds, and that most documented
   populations of insular feral sheep worldwide have converged to similar
   body sizes (within 6 kg). SCI rams attained greater mass in farm
   conditions but ewes did not, suggesting phenotypic plasticity in ram
   body mass. Ewes exhibited self-shedding of wool at a greater frequency
   than rams, and sex differences and shedding patterns were consistent
   with thermoregulation and the risk of fly strike disease as benefits of
   wool loss. Pigmentation rates did not increase, further supporting the
   influence of heat stress on wool traits. These changes occurred in < 25
   generations and may have had a genetic basis, representing a potential
   example of rapid evolution in insular feral sheep.}},

Abstract = {{At the time of settlement to the reef environment, coral reef fishes
   differ in a number of characteristics that may influence their survival
   during a predatory encounter. This study investigated the selective
   nature of predation by both a multi-species predator pool, and a single
   common predator (Pseudochromis fuscus), on the reef fish, Pomacentrus
   amboinensis. The study focused on the early post-settlement period of P.
   amboinensis, when mortality, and hence selection, is known to be
   highest. Correlations between nine different measures of body
   condition/performance were examined at the time of settlement, in order
   to elucidate the relationships between different traits. Single-predator
   (P. fuscus) choice trials were conducted in 57.4-l aquaria with respect
   to three different prey characteristics {[}standard length (SL), body
   weight and burst swimming speed], whilst multi-species trials were
   conducted on open patch reefs, manipulating prey body weight only.
   Relationships between the nine measures of condition/performance were
   generally poor, with the strongest correlations occurring between the
   morphological measures and within the performance measures. During
   aquaria trials, P. fuscus was found to be selective with respect to prey
   SL only, with larger individuals being selected significantly more
   often. Multi-species predator communities, however, were selective with
   respect to prey body weight, with heavier individuals being selected
   significantly more often than their lighter counterparts. Our results
   suggest that under controlled conditions, body length may be the most
   important prey characteristic influencing prey survival during predatory
   encounters with P. fuscus. In such cases, larger prey size may actually
   be a distinct disadvantage to survival. However, these relationships
   appear to be more complex under natural conditions, where the expression
   of prey characteristics, the selectivity fields of a number of different
   predators, their relative abundance, and the action of external
   environmental characteristics, may all influence which individuals
   survive.}},

Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{American trypanosomiasis is a parasitic zoonosis that occurs throughout
   Latin America. The etiological agent, Trypanosoma cruzi, is able to
   infect almost all tissues of its mammalian hosts and spreads in the
   environment in multifarious transmission cycles that may or not be
   connected. This biological plasticity, which is probably the result of
   the considerable heterogeneity of the taxon, exemplifies a successful
   adaptation of a parasite resulting in distinct outcomes of infection and
   a complex epidemiological pattern. In the 1990s, most endemic countries
   strengthened national control programs to interrupt the transmission of
   this parasite to humans. However, many obstacles remain to the effective
   control of the disease. Current knowledge of the different components
   involved in elaborate system that is American trypanosomiasis (the
   protozoan parasite T. cruzi, vectors Triatominae and the many reservoirs
   of infection), as well as the interactions existing within the system,
   is still incomplete. The Triatominae probably evolve from predatory
   reduvids in response to the availability of vertebrate food source.
   However, the basic mechanisms of adaptation of some of them to
   artificial ecotopes remain poorly understood. Nevertheless, these
   adaptations seem to be associated with a behavioral plasticity, a
   reduction in the genetic repertoire and increasing developmental
   instability.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic or natural disturbances can have a significant impact on
   wild animals. Therefore, understanding when, how and what type of human
   and natural events disturb animals is a central problem in wildlife
   conservation. However, it can be difficult to identify which particular
   environmental stressor affects an individual most. We use heart rate
   telemetry to quantify the energy expenditure associated with different
   types of human-mediated and natural disturbances in a breeding
   passerine, the white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus). We fitted 0.5 g heart
   rate transmitters to 14 male vireos and continuously recorded heart rate
   and activity for two days and three nights on a military installation.
   We calibrated heart rate to energy expenditure for five additional males
   using an open-flow, push-through respirometry system showing that heart
   rate predicted 74 per cent of energy expenditure. We conducted
   standardized disturbance trials in the field to experimentally simulate
   a natural stressor (predator presence) and two anthropogenic stressors.
   Although birds initially showed behavioural and heart rate reactions to
   some disturbances, we could not detect an overall increase in energy
   expenditure during 1- or 4-hours disturbances. Similarly, overall
   activity rates were unaltered between control and experimental periods,
   and birds continued to perform parental duties despite the experimental
   disturbances. We suggest that vireos quickly determined that
   disturbances were non-threatening and thus showed no (costly)
   physiological response. We hypothesize that the lack of a significant
   response to disturbance in vireos is adaptive and may be representative
   of animals with fast life histories (e. g. short lifespan, high
   reproductive output) so as to maximize energy allocation to
   reproduction. Conversely, we predict that energetic cost of
   human-mediated disturbances will be significant in slow-living animals.}},

Abstract = {{The behavioral outcomes of a calorie restricted diet are often neglected
   in favour of a more physiological examination of the consequences of

   behavior. A few findings within the maternal CR literature suggest that
   adult male social behavior is altered by this regimen. Despite the
   paucity of findings within the maternal CR literature, a systematic
   investigation of the behavioral phenotype of males administered an
   adult-onset CR is completely lacking and was the focus of the current
   study. Adult male hooded Wistar rats were administered a three week CR,
   with one group receiving a 25\% CR and another group receiving a 50\% CR
   before male-to-male social behavior was examined and compared with ad
   libitium fed males. Various behavioral elements were modulated by CR,
   both the CR25\% and 50\% group initiated contact sooner and engaged in
   greater social activity compared to the ad libitum fed controls. The
   CR25\% group also demonstrated less non-social (self-grooming) behavior
   and a greater frequency of walkovers compared to all groups, indicating
   a propensity towards dominance. The CR50\% group demonstrated greater
   environmental assessment/exploration, as measured by the frequency of
   rearing. As with the maternal CR literature, an adult-onset chronic CR
   induces a more socially active behavioral phenotype and reduces interest
   in non-social behavior in the moderately CR group. Taken together, the
   social behavioral phenotype can be modulated by a CR initiated and

Abstract = {{Conditions experienced during early life can have profound effects on
   individual development and condition in adulthood. Differences in
   nutritional provisioning in birds during the first month of life can
   lead to differences in growth, reproductive success and survival. Yet,
   under natural conditions shorter periods of nutritional stress will be
   more prevalent. Individuals may respond differently, depending on the
   period of development during which nutritional stress was experienced.
   Such differences may surface specifically when poor environmental
   conditions challenge individuals again as adults. Here, we investigated
   long term consequences of differences in nutritional conditions
   experienced during different periods of early development by female
   zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) on measures of management and
   acquisition of body reserves. As nestlings or fledglings, subjects were
   raised under different nutritional conditions, a low or high quality
   diet. After subjects reached sexual maturity, we measured their
   sensitivity to periods of food restriction, their exploration and
   foraging behaviour as well as adult resting metabolic rate (RMR). During
   a short period of food restriction, subjects from the poor nutritional
   conditions had a higher body mass loss than those raised under
   qualitatively superior nutritional conditions. Moreover, subjects that
   were raised under poor nutritional conditions were faster to engage in
   exploratory and foraging behaviour. But RMR did not differ among
   treatments. These results reveal that early nutritional conditions
   affect adult exploratory behaviour, a representative personality trait,
   foraging and adult's physiological condition. As early nutritional
   conditions are reflected in adult phenotypic plasticity specifically
   when stressful situations reappear, the results suggest that costs for
   poor developmental conditions are paid when environmental conditions
   deteriorate.}},

Abstract = {{In a successive negative contrast (SNC) procedure, subjects used to a
   familiar contingency are unexpectedly shifted to a less favourable one.
   Typically, mammals in the new condition show lower anticipatory and
   consummatory responses than controls that only experience the low
   contingency, but similar experiments in birds have failed to show SNC.
   We investigated SNC in European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris. In
   experiment 1, birds that were shifted from mealworms (preferred food) to
   turkey crumbs (less preferred food) consumed less of the turkey crumbs,
   and showed elevated activity and exploratory feeder probing with respect
   to unshifted starlings exposed throughout to turkey crumbs. This is the
   first report of consummatory SNC in birds. In experiment 2, two groups
   differed in the amount of information. Initially, both groups
   encountered simultaneously one hopper with mealworms and three with
   turkey crumbs. The mealworm hopper was colour coded in group `cued' but
   not in group `uncued'. After a shift, all four feeders contained turkey
   crumbs and were signalled by the colour associated with turkey crumbs
   before the shift. The two groups did not differ in postshift
   consumption, and increased overall activity similarly after the shift.
   Exploratory feeder probing, however, increased significantly less in
   group cued than in group uncued, consistent with the view that informed

Abstract = {{Domestication and selection for high production have selected animals
   with less energy-demanding behaviour. In the natural environment of the
   ancestors, fitness (reproductive success) is often favoured by an
   ability to locate and remember food sites, whereas in captivity, fitness
   may be more related to the ability to grow and reproduce efficiently
   under stable food conditions. We hypothesized that domestication and
   selection for production traits have caused animals to react less
   actively to food shortage. In this experiment, 26 red junglefowl (RJF)
   and 27 White Leghorn layers (WL), the latter selected for high egg
   production, were exposed to 0, 3 and 24 h of food deprivation while
   housed in furnished cages. After food deprivation, we quantified the
   bird's behaviour, in a series of tests. Birds of both breeds performed
   more foraging-exploring, less preening behaviour and less perching with
   increasing length of food deprivation. However, when tested in a group,
   RJF showed a more active response than WL to food shortage by reducing
   perching time and increasing the foraging and exploration time on the
   ground, which may be interpreted as a more risk-prone behaviour.
   Furthermore, when tested individually, there was a breed effect on
   response in the open field and the novel object tests, where RJF were
   more cautious than WL. The results may reflect different feeding
   strategies: the behaviour of RJF would probably be more adaptive in a
   natural environment, while the behaviour shown by WL may allow more
   investment in production traits in a more predictable environment. (C)

Abstract = {{Selection should favour female preferences for reliable signals of male
   quality when such preferences result in benefits to females. Research on
   bird song suggests that, because song is costly to produce or sustain,
   females are obtaining accurate information about male quality through
   song preferences. Females have been shown to express mating preferences
   for three general categories of costly song features: song output, song
   complexity and geographical variation. A novel mechanism for the
   reliability of song is suggested by constraints on the ability to
   produce rapid, broadband trills (i.e. `vocal performance'). In several
   species of birds, females show a preference for superior vocal
   performance, supporting a key prediction of the hypothesis that vocal
   performance, like other features of song, may be a reliable indicator of
   male quality. In this study, I further test this hypothesis by
   investigating whether female swamp sparrows' preference for vocal
   performance is favoured by selection because it reliably reflects male
   quality. I found that vocal performance in male swamp sparrows was
   correlated with age and size, measured as mass. By preferring males with
   superior vocal performance, female swamp sparrows may obtain direct and
   indirect benefits by mating with older larger males. These results
   support the hypothesis that vocal performance in swamps sparrows is a
   reliable indicator of male quality. (C) 2009 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Visually foraging planktivorous fish are prey of visual predators, and
   their foraging behaviour may be affected by light levels both in terms
   of gain and risk. The large seasonal change in day length throughout a
   subarctic summer at 69 degrees N was used to show the influence of light
   on diel vertical migration (DVM) and shoaling patterns in a
   planktivorous fish assemblage consisting of two species (Coregonus
   lavaretus and Coregonus albula). Under the midnight sun in June, night
   and daytime behaviour was similar, with extensive shoaling and limited
   DVM. With increasingly darker nights towards autumn, the fish dispersed
   during the dark hours and showed more extensive DVM. Throughout the
   changing light regime of both the day and the season, the planktivores
   consistently chose depths with light levels compatible with visual
   foraging and reduced predation risk as revealed from reactive distance
   modelling of coregonids and their salmonid predators. The findings
   support the hypothesis that behavioural decisions are based on a
   trade-off between foraging rate and predation risk, and increased
   predator avoidance behaviour towards autumn suggests that this trade-off
   is state-dependent.}},
