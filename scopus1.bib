abstract={Regulation of food systems exists to ensure safety and enhance consumer confidence in the food which they purchase and consume. However, some regulatory systems fail to instil public confidence. In China for example, trust in the domestic food system is low as a consequence of multiple high-profile food scandals, many of which linked to food fraud. Fraud occurs when food is intentionally adulterated for economic gain and may, but not always, pose a risk to the safety of food. Food authenticity and quality may also be compromised. The focus of this research relates to how Chinese consumers perceive food fraud and make choices in the absence of trust in regulatory systems. Seven focus groups with middle class Chinese participants in tier 1 and 2 cities (Beijing, Guangzhou and Chengdu) were conducted to explore attitudes of and perception towards food fraud. Infant milk formula, olive oil and Scotch whisky were used as prompts for attitudinal and perceptual elicitation. The findings indicated that Chinese consumers consider food fraud to represent a food hazard that poses a threat to the authenticity, quality and reliability of food and increased the risk of purchasing and consuming of unsafe food. Consumers were found to rely on informal kinship networks as trusted sources of information regarding food products’ authenticity and safety. Behavioural responses included a range of risk relieving strategies to support food purchasing judgements, in the perceived absence of regulatory protection, that included: pre-purchase and consumption information seeking; the use of product attributes as authenticity cues; carefully selected acquisition sources; as well as a range of domestically-situated food practices. The strategic implications for food companies and policy are discussed. © 2018},

abstract={Black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) use their namesake chick-a-dee call for multiple functions, altering the features of the call depending on context. For example, duty cycle (the proportion of time filled by vocalizations) and fine structure traits (e.g., number of D notes) can encode contextual factors, such as predator size and food quality. Wilson and Mennill (2011) found that chickadees show stronger behavioral responses to playback of chick-a-dee calls with higher duty cycles, but not to the number of D notes. That is, independent of the number of D notes in a call, but dependent on the overall proportion of time filled with vocalization, birds responded more to higher duty cycle playback compared to lower duty cycle playback. Here we presented chickadees with chick-a-dee calls that contained either two D (referred to hereafter as 2 D) notes with a low duty cycle, 2 D notes with a high duty cycle, 10 D notes with a high duty cycle, or 2 D notes with a high duty cycle but played in reverse (a non-signaling control). We then measured ZENK expression in the auditory nuclei where perceptual discrimination is thought to occur. Based on the behavioral results of Wilson and Mennill, 2011, we predicted we would observe the highest ZENK expression in response to forward-playing calls with high duty cycles; we predicted we would observe no significant difference in ZENK expression between forward-playing high duty cycle playbacks (2 D or 10 D). We found no significant difference between forward-playing 2 D and 10 D high duty cycle playbacks. However, contrary to our predictions, we did not find any effects of altering the duty cycle or note number presented. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Many individuals sporadically and circumstantially sample addictive drugs, yet few become addicted. The individual vulnerabilities underlying the development of addiction are not well understood. Correlational findings show that early life adversity is associated with a greater propensity to develop drug addiction. However, the mechanisms by which early life adversity increases addiction vulnerability are unknown. Separate lines of research have found that several traits are associated with addiction. Here, we examined the effects of early life adversity on addiction-related traits in adulthood. We weaned male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (postnatal day – PND21) and randomly assigned them to either a non-adversity group (N-ADV) or an adversity group (ADV). ADV rats experienced adversity from PND 21-35, they were: a) singly housed, b) food restricted for 12 h/day, c) subjected to forced-swim sessions, and d) restrained and exposed to predator odour (1 h). As adults, rats were tested for impulsivity, anxiety-like behaviour, novelty preference, and attribution of incentive salience to a reward cue. ADV rats showed enhanced novelty preference and attributed greater incentive value to a reward cue. Compared to N-ADV rats, a greater proportion of ADV rats expressed multiple addiction risk traits. Furthermore, fewer ADV rats expressed no addiction risk traits. This effect was most evident in female ADV rats. © 2017},

abstract={There are three non-mutually-exclusive key strategies evolved by gene pools to cope with fluctuating food resource availability, including evolutionary adaptation, phenotypic plasticity, and migration. We focus primarily on evolutionary adaptation and behavioral plasticity, which is a type of phenotypic plasticity, resulting in life-history changes as ways of dealing with fluctuations in food resource availability. Using EcoSim, a predator-prey individual-based model, we compare individuals with stable food resources with those in environments where there are fluctuating food resources in terms of adaptation through behavioral plasticity and evolution. The purpose of our study is to determine whether evolution and behavioral plasticity truly play a role in adapting to an environment with fluctuating food resources, as well as to determine whether there are specific gene divergences between gene pools in fluctuating food resource environments versus gene pools where food resources are relatively stable. An important result of our study is that individuals in environments that are unstable with respect to food resource availability exhibited significant differences in behaviors versus those in environments with stable food resources. Although behavioral plasticity facilitates a rapid response to unstable food conditions, our study revealed the evolution of perceptual traits such as vision range in reaction to fluctuating food resources, indicating the importance of evolution in adapting to unstable resource environments in the long run. Moreover, using decision trees, we found that there were significant behavioral gene divergences between individuals in environments with fluctuating food resources as opposed to individuals in environments with stable food resources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Phytophagy is a common feature among pure herbivorous insects and omnivores that utilise both plant and prey as food resources; nevertheless, experimental evidence for factors affecting their interactions is restricted to intraguild predation and predator-mediated competition. We herein focused on plant-mediated effects that could result from plant defence activation or quality alteration and compared the performance of an omnivore, the western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis, and a pure herbivore, the greenhouse whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum, on cucumber plants previously infested with either species. Furthermore, we recorded their behavioural responses when given a choice among infested and clean plants. Whiteflies laid less eggs on plants previously exposed to thrips but more on whitefly-infested plants. Thrips survival was negatively affected on whitefly-infested than on thrips-infested or clean plants. Notably, whiteflies developed significantly faster on plants infested with conspecifics. In accordance, whiteflies avoided thrips-infested plants and preferred whitefly-infested over clean plants. Thrips showed no preference for either infested or clean plants. Our study is a first report on the role of plant-mediated effects in shaping omnivore-herbivore interactions. Considering the factors driving such interactions we will likely better understand the ecology of the more complex relationships among plants and pest organisms. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Objectives: To explore the association of colorectal cancer with environmental solar radiation and sun exposure behavior, considering phenotypic variables (eye color, hair color and skin phenotype), dietary intake of vitamin D and calcium, and socio-demographic factors. Study design: Multicenter population-based frequency matched case-control study in Spain (MCC-Spain), with 2140 CRC cases and 3950 controls. Methods: Data were obtained through personal interviews using a structured epidemiological questionnaire that included socio-demographic data, residential history, environmental exposures, behavior, phenotypic and dietary information. An environmental-lifetime sun exposure score was constructed combining residential history and average daily solar radiation, direct and diffuse. Logistic regression was used to explore the association between different variables. A structural equation model was used to verify the associations of the conceptual model. Results: We found a lower risk of CRC in subjects frequently exposed to sunlight during the previous summer and skin burning due to sun exposure. No association was observed in relation to the residential solar radiation scores. Subjects with light eye or light hair colors had a lower risk of CRC that those with darker colors. Dietary calcium and vitamin D were also protective factors, but not in the multivariate model. The structural equation model analysis suggested that higher sun exposure was associated with a decreased risk of CRC, as well as dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D, and these factors are correlated among themselves and with environmental solar radiation and skin phenotypes. Conclusion: The results agree with previous observations that sun exposure, dietary vitamin D and calcium intake, and serum 25(OH)D concentration reduce the risk of CRC and indicate that these factors may be relevant for cancer prevention. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Ancestor microbes started colonizing inland habitats approximately 2.7 to 3.5 billion years ago. With some exceptions, the key physiological adaptations of microbiomes associated with marine-to-land transitions have remained elusive. This is essentially caused by the lack of suitable systems that depict changes in microbiomes across sufficiently large time scales. Here, we investigate the adaptive routes taken by microbiomes along a contemporary gradient of land formation. Using functional trait-based metagenomics, we show that a switch from a microbial 'dispersal' to a 'competition' response modus best characterizes the microbial trait changes during this eco-evolutionary trajectory. The 'dispersal' modus prevails in microbiomes at the boundary sites between land and sea. It encompasses traits conferring cell chemosensory and motile behaviors, thus allowing the local microbes to exploit short-lived nutritional patches in high-diffusion microhabitats. A systematic transition towards the 'competition' modus occurs progressively as the soil matures, which is likely due to forces of viscosity or strain that favor traits for competition and chemical defense. Concomitantly, progressive increases in the abundances of genes encoding antibiotic resistance and complex organic substrate degradation were found. Our findings constitute a novel perspective on the ecology and evolution of microbiome traits, tracking back one of the most seminal transitions in the evolutionary history of life. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background/Objectives: The current obesity epidemic has spurred exploration of the developmental origin of adult heath and disease. A mother's dietary choices and health can affect both the early wellbeing and lifelong disease-risk of the offspring. Subjects/Methods: To determine if changes in the mother's diet and adiposity have long-term effects on the baby's metabolism, independently from a prenatal insult, we utilized a mouse model of diet-induced-obesity and cross-fostering. All pups were born to lean dams fed a low fat diet but were fostered onto lean or obese dams fed a high fat diet. This study design allowed us to discern the effects of a poor diet from those of mother's adiposity and metabolism. The weaned offspring were placed on a high fat diet to test their metabolic function. Results: In this feeding challenge, all male (but not female) offspring developed metabolic dysfunction. We saw increased weight gain in the pups nursed on an obesity-resistant dam fed a high fat diet, and increased pathogenesis including liver steatosis and adipose tissue inflammation, when compared to pups nursed on either obesity-prone dams on a high fat diet or lean dams on a low fat diet. Conclusion: Exposure to maternal over-nutrition, through the milk, is sufficient to shape offspring health outcomes in a sex- A nd organ-specific manner, and milk from a mother who is obesity-prone may partially protect the offspring from the insult of a poor diet. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Understanding how threatened wildlife can coexist with humans over the long term is a central issue in conservation and wildlife management. Komodo National Park in Eastern Indonesia, harbors the largest extant populations of the endemic Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis). Consistent with global trends, this species is expected to be increasingly exposed to human activities and in particular growing ecotourism activities. Here we comprehensively evaluated how human activities affected individual and population level attributes of Komodo dragons. We compared Komodo dragons phenotypic (behaviour, body size, and body condition) and demographic (age structure, sex ratio, survival, and density) responses to variation in human activities across national park. Komodo dragons were found to exhibit pronounced responses to high human activity level relative to sites with low and negligible human activities. Komodo dragons exposed to ecotourism exhibited significantly less wariness, larger body mass, better body condition, and higher survival. These results are entirely consistent with ecotourism activities that provided Komodo dragons with long-term and substantial nutritional subsidies as a consequence of feeding and human food refuse. However, we also noted the potential negative consequences of altered behaviour and adult-biased populations in ecotourism areas which may influence demographic processes through intraspecific competition or predation. To address this issue, we recommend that three management strategies to be implemented in future include: (1) removal of human-mediated nutritional subsidies, (2) alternative ecotourism, and (3) spatial regulation of ecotourism. Furthermore, we advocate the development of approaches to achieve a socio–ecological sustainability that benefits both people and wildlife conservation. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={PURPOSE: The impact of cognitive-behavioral strategies and clinical factors on diet change during cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is not well studied. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of collaborative goal-setting and clinical predictors on diet scores and weight loss in a case management model of CR.
METHODS: We retrospectively examined the effects of clinical factors and goal-setting facilitated by case managers on diet scores and weight loss in 629 consecutive patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease enrolled in our CR program between 2014 and 2016. The Rate Your Plate (RYP) diet score was used to measure diet quality at baseline and discharge. Logistic regression modeling was used to identify predictors of diet score change in a subsample with goal-setting data (n = 615). Analysis of variance was conducted in the subset with complete weight data (n = 584) to compare weight loss between those who improved their RYP scores versus those who did not.
RESULTS: Participants were 27.9% female, with a mean age of 63.4 ± 11.5 y. The average body mass index at baseline was 30.3 ± 6.8, and 51.7% reported diet change and/or weight loss as a goal. After an average of 33 CR sessions, 27.3% improved their RYP scores by at least 1 risk category (mean score, 54.0 ± 9.0 vs 58.2 ± 7.3, P < .001) and the average weight loss was 1.5 ± 2.9 kg (P < .001). After logistic regression modeling, dietary goal-setting was significantly associated with improvement in diet scores and with greater weight loss (2.2 ± 3.1 kg vs 0.84 ± 2.6 kg, P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: A case management model that incorporates dietary goal-setting is associated with improved measures of diet quality and weight loss during CR.},

abstract={Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the perceived advantages and disadvantages of oral anticoagulant therapies (OAT), and the trade-offs patients make in choosing therapy and adhering to their drug regimen. Methods: Five focus group sessions were conducted across Europe among patients with atrial fibrillation to identify the most important factors impacting OAT's value and adherence. Results: The most frequently identified barriers to OAT were lack of knowledge; poor patient-physician relationships; distraction due to employment or social environment; prior bleeding event(s) or the fear of bleeding; and changes in routine. Factors identified as promoting adherence included patients' personality, motivation, attitudes, and medication-taking habits and routines, as well as good quality health services. Inconvenient aspects of vitamin-K antagonists, such as regular blood monitoring and diet restrictions, were not reported to influence adherence, but may trigger patients to switch to direct oral anticoagulants. Conclusion: Most patients reported that a mixture of modifiable and non-modifiable factors helps them to take their drugs as prescribed. Individual patients’ particular needs and preferences regarding OAT vary. Practice implications: OAT adherence can be promoted if therapies are tailored to patients’ needs and preferences. Patients should be supported to share their preferences with their clinician. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={A “landscape of fear” (LOF) is a map that describes continuous spatial variation in an animal's perception of predation risk. The relief on this map reflects, for example, places that an animal avoids to minimize risk. Although the LOF concept is a potentially unifying theme in ecology that is often invoked to explain the ecological and conservation significance of fear, little is known about the daily dynamics of an LOF. Despite theory and data to the contrary, investigators often assume, implicitly or explicitly, that an LOF is a static consequence of a predator's mere presence within an ecosystem. We tested the prediction that an LOF in a large-scale, free-living system is a highly dynamic map with “peaks” and “valleys” that alternate across the diel (24-h) cycle in response to daily lulls in predator activity. We did so with extensive data from the case study of Yellowstone elk (Cervus elaphus) and wolves (Canis lupus) that was the original basis for the LOF concept. We quantified the elk LOF, defined here as spatial allocation of time away from risky places and times, across nearly 1,000-km2 of northern Yellowstone National Park and found that it fluctuated with the crepuscular activity pattern of wolves, enabling elk to use risky places during wolf downtimes. This may help explain evidence that wolf predation risk has no effect on elk stress levels, body condition, pregnancy, or herbivory. The ability of free-living animals to adaptively allocate habitat use across periods of high and low predator activity within the diel cycle is an underappreciated aspect of animal behavior that helps explain why strong antipredator responses may trigger weak ecological effects, and why an LOF may have less conceptual and practical importance than direct killing. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Laying hens housed in free-range systems have access to an outdoor range, and individual hens within a flock differ in their ranging behaviour. Whether there is a link between ranging and laying hen welfare remains unclear. We analysed the relationships between ranging by individual hens on a commercial free-range layer farm and behavioural, physiological and health measures of animal welfare. We hypothesised that hens that access the range more will be (1) less fearful in general and in response to novelty and humans, (2) have better health in terms of physical body condition and (3) have a reduced physiological stress response to behavioural tests of fear and health assessments than hens that use the range less. Using radio frequency identification tracking across two flocks, we recorded individual hens' frequency, duration and consistency of ranging. We also assessed how far hens ventured into the range based on three zones: 0 to 2.4, 2.4 to 11.4 or >11.4 m from the shed. We assessed hen welfare using a variety of measures including: tonic immobility, open field, novel object, human approach, and human avoidance (HAV) behavioural tests; stress-induced plasma corticosterone response and faecal glucocorticoid metabolites; live weight, comb colour, and beak, plumage, footpad, and keel bone condition. Range use was positively correlated with plasma corticosterone response, faecal glucocorticoid metabolites, and greater flight distance during HAV. Hens that used the range more, moved towards rather than away from the novel object more often than hens that ranged less. Distance ranged from the shed was significantly associated with comb colour and beak condition, in that hens with darker combs and more intact beaks ranged further. Overall the findings suggest that there is no strong link between outdoor range usage and laying hen welfare. Alternatively, it may be that hens that differed in their ranging behaviour showed few differences in measures of welfare because free-range systems provide hens with adequate choice to cope with their environment. Further research into the relationship between individual range access and welfare is needed to test this possibility.},

abstract={Fluoxetine and propranolol are neuroactive human pharmaceuticals that occur frequently as pollutants in surface waters. The potential effects of these pharmaceuticals on aquatic organisms have raised concern but many adverse effects are not well characterized for a broad range of concentrations and endpoints. In this study, 6 biological parameters in the freshwater Cladoceran Daphnia magna were compared for their responses to fluoxetine or propranolol exposure: mobility (dichotomous response), active swimming time, swimming distance, swimming velocity, swimming acceleration speed, and survival in the absence of food (starvation-survival). Changes in swimming behavior was quantified by video tracking followed by image analyses at six exposure concentrations between 100 ng/L and 10 mg/L. Active swimming time and swimming distance were the most responsive parameters among the behavioral traits. Sublethal exposure concentrations resulted in nonmonotonic responses and behavior profiling suggested that fluoxetine and propranolol stimulated swimming activity at 1–10 μg/L whereas lower (0.1–1 μg/L) and higher exposure concentrations (>100 μg/L) inhibited swimming activity. The ability to survive in the absence of food when exposed to fluoxetine or propranolol resulted in EC50 and EC10 values that were lower than for swimming behavior (EC50 of 0.79–0.99 mg/L; EC10 of 1.4–2.9 μg/L). Starvation-survival appeared to be a potentially simple and sensitive endpoint for adverse effects in D. magna at intermediate exposure concentrations. Nonmonotonic behavioral responses at low exposure concentrations and decreased ability to survive starvation should be considered in assessment of adverse effects of pharmaceuticals to freshwater invertebrates. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Coprophagia is a common canine habit, although it is aversive for human beings. Despite absence of clinical risk to animals and their owners, this behavior may lead the owners to get rid of their dogs. The lack of information and effective corrective methods make it difficult for veterinary clinicians to contribute to eradication of this problem. The objective of this study was to evaluate nutritional, behavioral, and hereditary aspects involved in the manifestation of coprophagia in dogs, the effectiveness of the most common corrective methods, and the perception of owners about the subject through a questionnaire designed for coprophagic and non–coprophagic dogs’ owners. Owners of 70 adult animals were interviewed, of which 42.8% (n = 30/70) were coprophagic and 57.1% (n = 40/70) were non-coprophagic. There was no difference between sex, habits, lifestyle, habitat, number of meals, nutritional background, commercial diet, and reproductive status. However, development of coprophagia appears to be influenced by the presence of a coprophagic cohabitant. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Temperate-zone bats likely feed in an environment with few dangerous nocturnal predators, suggesting a life largely free of the antipredator trade-offs faced by most other animals. Such bats may, however, encounter dangerous diurnal raptors with an early start to their nightly feeding, and thus may face predation-related trade-offs in deciding when to emerge from a daytime roost. Non-predator-related factors could also come into play in this nightly decision. We used an information-theoretic approach to examine which combination of a wide range of variables exerts the greatest influence over emergence times from maternity roosts in a population of Indiana bats, Myotis sodalis, covering a 12-year period. Our competing statistical models were based on two broad environmental influences on emergence times: predators and physical (meteorological and astronomical) variables. The best-performing model included most of the variables associated with antipredator trade-offs, assuming that bats emerging before or near sunset experience a foraging benefit and a substantial risk of predation by diurnal raptors. Accordingly, state-dependent behaviour was apparent, with emergence beginning earlier during the more energetically demanding portion of the reproductive cycle. During lactation (the most demanding period), about 20% of emergence events began before sunset, compared to only 5% during colony formation. Earlier emergence was also associated with high cloud cover (darker conditions), larger roost populations and roosts located deep into the forest. Moonlight at sunset, however, was absent from the best-supported model and had no apparent influence on emergence times. Overall, the emergence behaviour of our species is consistent with a trade-off between energetic needs and predation risk, most likely due to the temporal overlap of early emergences with the activity period of diurnal raptors. This behaviour may be more common than expected in temperate-zone bats. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Early life, covering childhood and adolescence in humans, is an important period of brain development and maturation. Experimental works in rodents have shown that high-caloric diets are particularly detrimental to young rats, affecting cognition. We studied the effects of two different high-caloric diets, prevalent in human adolescents, on male Wistar rats aged 4 weeks at the beginning of the experiment. Rats were randomly allocated to control (C, n = 10), high-sugar diet (HS, n = 10) and cafeteria diet (CAF, n = 10) groups and fed accordingly for 8 weeks. At the end of this period, behavioral tests were performed to analyze (1) anxiety behavior in the elevated plus-maze and open field tests, (2) learning and memory processes in the Morris water maze and novel object recognition test, (3) fear response in the fear conditioning test, and (4) depression state in the forced swim test. We also examined neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus using the marker of neuroproliferation doublecortin (DCX). Our results show that CAF rats have impaired spatial learning and memory and increased anxiety, without changes in the remaining aspects of behavior, associated with a reduction of the total number of DCX-immunoreactive cells in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus. Conversely, HS rats displayed no changes in behavior and neurogenesis. These data demonstrate that diets rich in saturated fats and sugar are more detrimental for juvenile rats than diets with high sugar content in what concerns their effects in anxiety-related behaviors, spatial learning and memory, and neurogenesis. These findings may help explain the cognitive disturbances observed in obese human adolescents, who consume high-caloric diets. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and automated vehicles can contribute to reduce traffic congestion and accidents. Recently, an on-road study has shown that drivers may prefer to deactivate full-range ACC when closing in on a slower leader and to overrule it by pressing the gas pedal a few seconds after the activation of the system. Notwithstanding the influence of these control transitions on driver behaviour, a theoretical framework explaining driver decisions to transfer control and to regulate the target speed in full-range ACC is currently missing. This research develops a modelling framework describing the underlying decision-making process of drivers with full-range ACC at an operational level, grounded on Risk Allostasis Theory (RAT). Based on this theory, a driver will choose to resume manual control or to regulate the ACC target speed if its perceived level of risk feeling and task difficulty falls outside the range considered acceptable to maintain the system active. The feeling of risk and task difficulty evaluation is formulated as a generalized ordered probit model with random thresholds, which vary between drivers and within drivers over time. The ACC system state choices are formulated as logit models and the ACC target speed regulations as regression models, in which correlations between system state choices and target speed regulations are captured explicitly. This continuous-discrete choice model framework is able to address interdependencies across drivers’ decisions in terms of causality, unobserved driver characteristics, and state dependency, and to capture inconsistencies in drivers’ decision making that might be caused by human factors. The model was estimated using a dataset collected in an on-road experiment with full-range ACC. The results reveal that driver decisions to resume manual control and to regulate the target speed in full-range ACC can be interpreted based on the RAT. The model can be used to forecast driver response to a driving assistance system that adapts its settings to prevent control transitions while guaranteeing safety and comfort. The model can also be implemented into a microscopic traffic flow simulation to evaluate the impact of ACC on traffic flow efficiency and safety accounting for control transitions and target speed regulations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Neonatal brain Hypoxia–Ischemia (HI) is one of the major causes of infant mortality and lifelong neurological disabilities. The knowledge about the physiopathological mechanisms involved in HI lesion have increased in recent years, however these findings have not been translated into clinical practice. Current therapeutic approaches remain limited; hypothermia, used only in term or near-term infants, is the golden standard. Epidemiological evidence shows a link between adverse prenatal conditions and increased risk for diseases, health problems, and psychological outcomes later in life, what makes pregnancy a relevant period for preventing future brain injury. Here, we review experimental literature regarding preventive interventions used during pregnancy, i.e., previous to the HI injury, encompassing pharmacological, nutritional and/or behavioral strategies. Literature review used PubMed database. A total of forty one studies reported protective properties of maternal treatments preventing perinatal hypoxia-ischemia injury in rodents. Pharmacological agents and dietary supplementation showed mainly anti-excitotoxicity, anti-oxidant or anti-apoptotic properties. Interestingly, maternal preconditioning, physical exercise and environmental enrichment seem to engage the same referred mechanisms in order to protect neonatal brain against injury. This construct must be challenged by further studies to clearly define the main mechanisms responsible for neuroprotection to be explored in experimental context, as well as to test their potential in clinical settings. © 2018 ISDN},

abstract={While biomedical researchers have long appreciated the influence of maternally derived glucocorticoids (GCs) on offspring phenotype, ecologists have only recently begun exploring its impact in wild animals. Interpreting biomedical findings within an ecological context has posited that maternal stress, mediated by elevations of maternal GCs, may play an adaptive role preparing offspring for a stressful or rigorous environment. Yet, the influence of maternal stress on offspring phenotype has been little studied in wild animals. We experimentally elevated GCs to ecologically relevant levels (mimicking increases in maternal stress hormones following a nonlethal predator encounter, a heat challenge, or a chasing or confinement stressor) in female eastern fence lizards Sceloporus undulatus during gestation. We tested the hypothesis that maternally derived stress hormones themselves are sufficient to alter offspring phenotype. Specifically, we examined the effects of experimentally elevated maternal GCs on fitness-relevant traits of the mother, her eggs and her subsequent offspring. We found that daily maternal GC elevation: (a) increased maternal antipredator behaviours and postlaying glucose levels; (b) had no effect on egg morphology or caloric value, but altered yolk hormone (elevated GC) and nutrient content; and (c) altered offspring phenotype including stress-relevant physiology, morphology and behaviour. These findings reveal that maternally derived GCs alone can alter offspring phenotype in a wild animal, changes that may be mediated via maternal behaviour, and egg hormone and nutrient content. Understanding the ecological consequences of these effects under different environmental conditions will be critical for determining the adaptive significance of elevated maternal GCs for offspring. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={We examined the food preference of Chinese mitten crabs, Eriocheir sinensis (H. Milne Edwards, 1853), under food shortage, habitat choice in the presence of predators, and cannibalistic behavior by comparing their response to the popular culture plant Elodea nuttallii and the structurally more complex Myriophyllum verticillatum L. in a series of mesocosm experiments. Mitten crabs were found to consume and thus reduce the biomass of Elodea, whereas no negative impact on Myriophyllum biomass was recorded. In the absence of adult crabs, juveniles preferred to settle in Elodea habitats (appearance frequency among the plants: 64.2 ± 5.9%) but selected for Myriophyllum instead when adult crabs were present (appearance frequency among the plants: 59.5 ± 4.9%). The mortality rate of mitten crabs in the absence of plant shelter was higher under food shortage, primarily due to cannibalism. The proportion of molting crabs dying in the structurally more complex Myriophyllum habitats was significantly lower than in the less complex Elodea habitats, indicating that Myriophyllum provides better protection from cannibalistic behavior, likely due to its structurally more complex canopy. Stable isotope analyses of crab samples revealed a trophic shift in both δ13C and δ15N (Δδ13C: 2.2-4.0h; Δδ15N: 1.5-2.8h) during the experimental period. Significant positive correlations between body mass and δ13C and δ15N were recorded, suggesting that cannibalistic feeding might further increase crab growth and lead to ontogenetic increases in trophic position with increasing size. Our study overall demonstrates that a combination of submerged aquatic vegetation functioning as a highly suitable food with other less palatable plant species acting as efficient refuges against predators may be the optimal method of plant stocking in mitten crab aquacultures to ensure both high crab growth and a high survival rate. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Food consumption is an inevitable experience within a travel destination and has become an area of interest for both host countries and tourists. However, research regarding traditional food consumption behaviour has not always addressed consumer choice behaviour of traditional food consumption in relation to destination. This study uses the Theory of Planned Behaviour as the basis for the study of how personality traits (food neophobia and sensation-seeking) affect traditional food consumption behaviour. Findings indicated that the theory provided feasible explanations for traditional food consumption behaviour of tourists. This study also found food neophobia has an important moderating effect on the relationship between attitude-purchase intention and subjective norm-purchase intention. However, sensation-seeking was neither a predictor nor a moderator of the intention to consume traditional foods. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Behavioural flexibility, the ability to adjust behaviour to environmental change by adapting existing skills to novel situations, is key to coping with, for example, complex social interactions, seasonal changes in food availability or detecting predators. We tested the tree skink, Egernia striolata, a family-living skink from eastern Australia, in a set-shifting paradigm of eight colour/shape discriminations including reversals, an intradimensional acquisition of a new colour/shape and extradimensional shift from colour to shape (and vice versa). Skinks could learn to discriminate between colour/shape pairs and reverse this initial stimulus–reward association; however, they showed no significant decrease in the probability of making a correct choice in the extradimensional shift suggesting that they did not form an attentional set. Subjects appear to have learnt each stage as a new problem instead of generalizing stimuli into specific dimensions (set formation). In conclusion, tree skinks solved a discrimination reversal by focusing their attention towards visual stimuli and flexibly adjusting their choice behaviour accordingly. These lizards learned to use multidimensional visual stimuli to find a food reward but did not generalize stimuli into dimensions. Furthermore, this study is the first to test for set shifting in a lizard species and thereby allows us to extend set-shifting theory to a new taxon for comparison with primates, rodents, a bird and a turtle. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Abstract: Hoarding behaviour (storing food for a later use) has evolved to reduce starvation risk when resources are scarce. Different age and sex classes often show differences in foraging due to experience, skills or life history strategy, but such differences in hoarding under spatio-temporally varying environmental conditions have rarely been studied in the wild. We studied hoarding behaviour of Eurasian pygmy owls (Glaucidium passerinum) during 2003–2016 in western Finland, where the abundance of their main prey (voles) fluctuates in three-year population cycles. In 14 years, 1056 food stores were found during the hoarding season (Oct–Dec) and 330 pygmy owls were trapped at these stores. The number of stores per individual did not vary in relation to age, sex or vole abundance. Adults (+ 1-year old) had their stores farther apart than yearlings. Both the number of stores per year and the biomass of stored prey items increased with vole abundance. Females and yearlings had larger and heavier stores than males and adults, respectively. The same individuals stored more food as yearlings than as adults. These sex- and age-differences in hoarding indicate that it is not constrained by experience or skills. It rather seems that less-experienced yearlings rely more on stored food than adults. Females may need more food due to their larger size and need to accumulate energy reserves before reproduction. A detailed knowledge of age- and sex-related differences in hoarding behaviour under fluctuating abundances of main foods is fundamental to better understand a population response to climate change and forest management. Significance statement: The hoarding behaviour of animals has evolved to cope with the problem of food limitation. On the basis of 14-year data from pygmy owls, we show that the number of stores per year and the biomass of prey items per store increased with vole abundance in the environment. Adults had stores farther apart than yearlings, and females and yearlings stored more prey items and biomass compared to males and adults, respectively. These results indicate that hoarding behaviour responds to the available main prey abundance and varies with traits such as age and sex. Because different age and sex classes might respond differently to variation in food abundance, due to habitat alterations or climate change, a detailed knowledge of hoarding behaviour can be of particular importance to understand changes in body condition, reproductive success and survival of pygmy owls under changing climate and management of boreal forest. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={When measuring animals’ valenced behavioural responses to stimuli, the Conditioned Place Preference (CPP) test goes a step further than many approach-based and avoidance-based tests by establishing whether a learned preference for, or aversion to, the location in which the stimulus was encountered can be generated. We designed a novel, four-chambered CPP test to extend the capability of the usual CPP paradigm to provide information on four key features of animals’ affective responses: valence, scale, persistence and generalization. Using this test, we investigated the affective responses of domestic chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) to four potentially aversive stimuli: 1. Puffs of air; 2. Sight of (robotic) snake; 3. Sprays of water; 4. Sound of conspecific alarm calls. We found conditioned avoidance of locations associated with the air puffs and water sprays (Friedman's χ2 (3) = 13.323 p &gt;.005; χ2 (3) = 14.235 p &gt;.005), but not with the snake and alarm calls. The scale of the learned avoidance was similar for the air puff and water spray stimuli, but persistence and generalization differed. We conclude that the four chambered CPP test can have a valuable role to play in making multi-feature measurements of stimulus-generated affective responses, and we highlight the value of such measurements for improving our understanding of the structure of affect in chickens and other animals. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Sensor-based technologies are becoming increasingly available and can be used to automatically gather long-term data about animal behaviour. With this information, it is possible to assess the circadian rhythm of activity and monitor its response to internal and external factors. Identifying irregularities in this rhythm may indicate animal health and welfare issues. The aim of this study was to collect sensor-based general activity and investigate circadian rhythm of this activity to identify the changes due to weather influences that act on these parameters throughout the year; to identify the differences between individuals; and to assess links between general activity and circadian rhythm of activity with sheep body weight change. In total, 29 Scottish Blackface ewes of different ages and body condition scores were used. The animals were monitored for four consecutive weeks in each of four seasonal periods, in extensive systems on Scottish upland pastures, and without human handling during study periods. Accelerometer-integrated collars were fitted to the animals to collect motion index continuously every minute. These data were used to calculate the percentage of cyclic behaviour that was harmonic/synchronized with the environment (over 24 h period), as Degree of Functional Coupling (DFC). The DFC was shown within rolling seven-day periods. Low DFCs indicate low synchronization. Weather data were collected daily. Random regression models were used to assess between-individual variation. During the winter period, the level of the DFC for the activity of nineteen ewes lowered in response to a period of high level of precipitation combined with low winter temperatures. However, four ewes exhibited a lower level of variation in the DFC values, showing that there were differences between individuals in regard to their response to the precipitation level. The overall mean of the DFC for the general activity was highest in autumn (95.4%, P < 0.001), however, it did not differ between summer and spring (respectively 90.2% and 88.1%, P > 0.05), but was significantly lower during the winter (81.7%, P < 0.001) compared with summer and autumn. Over the spring and summer, variation in DFC was a good estimator of body weight gain. It was concluded that the assessment of circadian rhythms of general activity using the DFC-parameter allows a better understanding of sheep responses to weather influences, compared to the evaluation of general activity alone. The random regression model method was effective in identifying animals that deviated positively or negatively from population responses. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Study Objective: To explore parental and adolescent views on the confidential interview in the gynecologic setting and compare adolescent reported risk-taking behaviors with parental perception. Design: Anonymous surveys were administered separately to parents/guardians and adolescents between the ages of 11 and 17 years. Information pertaining to the patient's Tanner stage and reason for visit was obtained from the provider. This first phase served as the usual care group. In the second phase of the study, surveys were again distributed after a brief educational intervention. Linear regression analysis, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and Fisher exact test were used where appropriate. Setting and Participants: Pediatric and adolescent gynecology clinics in 2 tertiary hospitals. Interventions: Brief educational handout on key concepts of the confidential interview. Main Outcome Measures: Parental perception of the confidential interview and adolescent risk-taking behaviors. Results: A total of 248 surveys were included in the final analysis, which accounts for 62 adolescent and parent/guardian pairs in each group. Most parents and adolescents reported perceived benefit to the confidential interview. However, parents were less likely to rate benefits of private time specifically for their own adolescent and less than half of the parents believed that adolescents should have access to private time in the gynecologic setting. Parents/guardians as well as adolescents feared that the confidential interview would limit the parent's ability to take part in decision-making. The low support for confidential time for their adolescent was not different in the usual care group compared with the intervention group, although there was a trend toward parental acceptance with increased adolescent age. Adolescents were consistently more likely to report more risk-taking behaviors than their parents perceived. Conclusion: There is a discord between parental perception and adolescent reports of risk-taking behaviors. This is coupled with a lack of understanding or comfort regarding the benefits of the confidential interview among parents and adolescents who present for gynecologic care. A short educational intervention had only a modest effect on parental perceptions regarding the confidential interview. © 2018 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology},

abstract={The etiopathogenesis of depression may involve repeated exposure to several unpredictable stressors. This study was conducted to investigate changes induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and to assess behavioral and neurochemical changes that predict depressive-like behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. Male Drosophila melanogaster flies were exposed to CUMS with several stressors (cold, heat, starvation, and sleep deprivation) in an unpredictable and chronic manner for ten days. At the end of treatment, in vivo behavioral tests (open field, aggression, forced swimming, mating, light/dark box, male fertility evaluation, sucrose preference, weight evaluation) and ex vivo analyses (dopamine and serotonin levels) were performed. Using this CUMS model, we obtained results that contribute to the construction of a depressive model in Drosophila, where we reproduce some behavioral phenotypes corresponding to depressive symptoms, such as immobility in the forced swimming test, less exploration in the light/dark test, changes in mating behavior, changes in the aggressiveness test, reduced sucrose preference, and weight-loss, in addition to a significant reduction in the levels of serotonin and dopamine when compared to the control group. Fluoxetine was used in our study as a positive control to demonstrate that CUMS-induced depressive-like behaviors in flies can be reversed by antidepressants. In conclusion, male Drosophila melanogaster exposed to CUMS display a depressive-like phenotype, and, while this poses some limitations as an animal model for depression, it meets some of the criteria required to be a valid model, such as good face and construct validity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been linked with eating- and feeding-related atypicalities, including food neophobia (FN) (refusal to try unfamiliar foods), since its earliest description. Nevertheless, whether associations between ASD traits and FN extend subclinically into the broader population of children and their potential additive health impacts remains unexplored. Objective We examined ASD-control group differences in FN and ASD trait-FN trait associations, as well as the ability of FN and autistic traits to predict one index of later health-related outcomes [body mass index (BMI)]. Design Participants in the present study were a large community-based sample of 8- to 11-y-olds (n = 4564), including a relatively small group of children diagnosed with ASD (n = 37). Parents of these 8- to 11-y-old children completed assessments of FN and autistic traits and provided height and weight metrics at 12 y of age. Results Children with ASD were rated as more food neophobic than their same-age non-ASD peers (2.67 ± 0.83 compared with 2.22 ± 0.73; P < 0.001), and there were subclinical associations between FN and ASD traits (social, communication, and restricted/repetitive behavior) in this community-based sample of children (P < 0.05). Moreover, whereas FN alone predicted lower BMI, the interaction of FN and ASD traits predicted higher BMI (P ≤ 0.01), suggesting that elevated ASD traits in combination with FN exert opposing influences on weight compared with FN alone. Conclusions These findings implicate clinical and subclinical connections between ASD traits and feeding behaviors that could affect health outcomes and therefore should be further explored in future studies of shared etiology and intervention strategy. © 2018 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Ability to identify familiar foods is a major driver of animal feeding behavior. Animals show preference for familiar foods over novel ones, presumably to avoid poisonous substances and better support their growth and reproduction. However, we do not know how their feeding behavior is affected when the familiar food is inferior to a novel food with regards to its palatability and nutritional properties. We tested the hypothesis that feeding preference is determined by specific food characteristics rather than food familiarity with fast-growing soil-dwelling nematodes. Two sequential experiments were designed to test the feeding behavior of soil bacterial-feeding nematodes (Mesorhabditis sp. and Acrobeloides sp.) resulting from familiar food recognition, including a 6-months training period to develop their food familiarity and a feeding experiment to test their food preference for five bacterial species. Nematodes showed clear preference for specific food sources, which were not necessarily the familiar food. Their feeding behavior was not affected by food familiarity, but correlated highly with bacterial traits such as cell size, growth rates, and water content. We conclude that nematode feeding behavior was controlled by food specificity rather than familiarity. We further suggest that physiological factors, possibly the physical size and presence of chemical receptors in the buccal cavity, allow nematodes to rapidly assess their food supply and switch from a familiar food to a preferred, novel food that is easier to ingest and better suited to support their growth and reproduction. © 2018},

abstract={The pseudoscorpion Paratemnoides nidificator is a generalist predator that captures large arthropods that live on tree trunks. Few pseudoscorpions species show some degree of sociality. We investigated how colonies of the pseudoscorpion P. nidificator adjust their cooperative capture behavior under a situation of changing prey types as a simulation of variation in prey availability. We hypothesized that colonies would be more efficient at prey capture under repeated exposure to the same prey, and that the change in the availability of prey would be followed by new behavioral adjustments to adequately exploit the new prey. Eight experimental colonies housed in the laboratory received repetitions of three different ant species as prey. The number of pseudoscorpions attacking the prey, the number of behavioral acts, and the time expended subduing prey were evaluated as measures of prey capture performance, in relation to repetitive exposure to the same prey and also in relation to prey type changes. However, only individuals’ recruitment significantly responded to prey type exposure. Prey capture behavior was heterogeneous among colonies, resulting in highly variable behavioral responses. Colonies showed a tendency toward increasing capture success through repeated prey type exposure. However, 50% of the colonies were unable to capture the new prey type and died of starvation. Although it is a generalist predator, prey capture behavior could depend on different coordination components for subduing and handling large prey. Therefore, changes in prey availability could cause the attenuation of a cooperative relationship in some colonies, making them more prone to failure during capture. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature and ISPA.},

After the cuff was inflated, a purse-string suture was performed around the catheter, penetrating only the serous layer of the rumen. Then two cruciate sutures were applied for rumenopexy. Finally, the muscle layer was synthesized, followed by skin suture, with two horizontal mattress sutures lateral to the catheter. A single dose of 20 mg/kg of oxytetracycline was administered and, if necessary, rescue analgesia with 5 mg/kg of tramadol. Ruminal fluid was collected daily to test the viability of the catheter, and wound healing around the surgical wound was evaluated. Surgical time and trans-surgical complications were recorded and post-surgical pain was also assessed, using a behavioral scale. After 65 days, the animals were sent to the slaughterhouse where carcass analysis was performed, mainly observing the place where the Foley Catheter was placed. All animals presented satisfactory recovery, and no need for analgesia at any time. Throughout the entire period, there was no extravasation of rumenal fluid through the surgical wound, not even when the catheter was removed. This study shows that the minimally invasive technique of rumenostomy performed was efficient, with extremely advantageous results, both in the execution of the technique and well-being of the animals. It may be still very important for nutritional and digestibility studies, as well as for relapsing tympani therapy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Nitrogen (N) fertilization is a common agricultural practice, which, by increasing the quality of plants, also enhances their nutritional suitability for insect herbivores, creating the possibility of a cascade of N across trophic levels, from plant to herbivore to predator. We manipulated the quality of cucumber plants by fertilizing them with three different N rates (110, 160, and 210 ppm), which represented low, medium, and high N levels, respectively. Colonies of Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae) were then reared on these plants and used as prey for adult Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in experiments that characterized the predator's foraging behavior and functional response to different aphid densities. The nutritional content of plants and aphids was also measured. As N fertilization increased, so did the nutrient content (total energy) of aphids and this resulted in declining rates of aphid consumption by beetles at higher aphid densities. Females in the 110 N treatment, and males in all treatments, responded to aphids with a type II functional response (decelerating consumption at higher densities), but females in the 160 and 210 ppm N treatments exhibited a type III response (consuming a declining proportion of available aphids at high densities). Beetles fed aphids from the 110 N treatment consumed more prey in both assays than did those fed aphids from the 210 N treatment. Beetle searching time, handling time, and duration of digestive pauses all increased at high levels of N fertilization, especially for females. The results indicate that heavy N fertilization can increase prey nutritional quality to the point where it alters predator foraging and feeding behavior, resulting in slower rates of prey consumption and longer prey handling times. © The Author(s) 2018.

abstract={Urban habitats present new ecological and evolutionary challenges for animals. Noise and infrastructure often change behavior and community composition, with potential physical costs such as decreased condition. However, the underlying mechanisms driving these patterns are virtually unknown. One potential driver of condition within a species is the diversity of the gut microbiome. Here, we investigate how the urban habitat affects the gut microbiome of White-crowned Sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys) males using spatial analyses of land cover (impervious, scrub, grass, and trees) at the regional level and territory level in urban San Francisco, CA and nearby rural Point Reyes, California. We hypothesized that urbanization of habitats affects gut microbial composition and diversity, potentially through direct effects on diet and/or indirect environmental effects. We measured gut microbial community diversity from 16s rRNA sequences amplified from cloacal swabs. We find that the urban and rural male gut microbiomes are significantly different, such that the urban gut microbiome is more diverse than the rural gut microbiome. This relationship may be due to more variable land cover types in urban habitats as compared to rural habitats, which are mainly composed of native scrub. We do not find support for regional impervious cover affecting the gut microbiome, but the more precise territory level analyses show that higher tree cover correlates with increased alpha diversity and impervious cover correlates with relative abundances of gut microbial taxa (Unifrac beta diversity). Although some studies show that gut diversity affects physiology, our measures of body condition do not indicate a strong relationship. Our results highlight how changes in the landscape may affect the gut microbiome of animals in an ever-urbanizing world, and provide a baseline for future studies of how anthropogenic change affects communities at multiple levels. © 2018 Phillips, Berlow and Derryberry.},

abstract={Emotional and other maladaptive eating behaviors develop in response to a diversity of triggers, from psychological stress to the endless external cues in our modern food environment. While the standard approach to food- and weight-related concerns has been weight-loss through dietary restriction, these interventions have produced little long-term benefit, and may be counterproductive. A growing understanding of the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that underpin habit formation may explain why this approach has largely failed, and pave the way for a new generation of non-pharmacologic interventions. Here, we first review how modern food environments interact with human biology to promote reward-related eating through associative learning, i.e., operant conditioning. We also review how operant conditioning (positive and negative reinforcement) cultivates habit-based reward-related eating, and how current diet paradigms may not directly target such eating. Further, we describe how mindfulness training that targets reward-based learning may constitute an appropriate intervention to rewire the learning process around eating. We conclude with examples that illustrate how teaching patients to tap into and act on intrinsic (e.g., enjoying healthy eating, not overeating, and self-compassion) rather than extrinsic reward mechanisms (e.g., weighing oneself), is a promising new direction in improving individuals' relationship with food. © 2018 Brewer, Ruf, Beccia, Essien, Finn, van Lutterveld and Mason.},

abstract={O-linked N-acetylglucosamine, better known as O-GlcNAc, is a sugar post-translational modification participating in a diverse range of cell functions. Disruptions in the cycling of O-GlcNAc mediated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), respectively, is a driving force for aberrant cell signaling in disease pathologies, such as diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. Production of UDP-GlcNAc, the metabolic substrate for OGT, by the Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway (HBP) is controlled by the input of amino acids, fats, and nucleic acids, making O-GlcNAc a key nutrient-sensor for fluctuations in these macromolecules. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways also participate in nutrient-sensing as a means of controlling cell activity and are significant factors in a variety of pathologies. Research into the individual nutrient-sensitivities of the HBP, AMPK, and mTOR pathways has revealed a complex regulatory dynamic, where their unique responses to macromolecule levels coordinate cell behavior. Importantly, cross-talk between these pathways fine-tunes the cellular response to nutrients. Strong evidence demonstrates that AMPK negatively regulates the mTOR pathway, but O-GlcNAcylation of AMPK lowers enzymatic activity and promotes growth. On the other hand, AMPK can phosphorylate OGT leading to changes in OGT function. Complex sets of interactions between the HBP, AMPK, and mTOR pathways integrate nutritional signals to respond to changes in the environment. In particular, examining these relationships using systems biology approaches might prove a useful method of exploring the complex nature of cell signaling. Overall, understanding the complex interactions of these nutrient pathways will provide novel mechanistic information into how nutrients influence health and disease. © 2007 - 2018 Frontiers Media S.A.

abstract={Background: Economically disadvantaged families receive care in both clinical and community settings, but this care is rarely coordinated and can result in conflicting educational messaging. WEE Baby Care is a pragmatic randomized clinical trial evaluating a patient-centered responsive parenting (RP) intervention that uses health information technology (HIT) strategies to coordinate care between pediatric primary care providers (PCPs) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infant and Children (WIC) community nutritionists to prevent rapid weight gain from birth to 6months. It is hypothesized that data integration and coordination will improve consistency in RP messaging and parent self-efficacy, promoting shared decision making and infant self-regulation, to reduce infant rapid weight gain from birth to 6months. Methods/design: Two hundred and ninety mothers and their full-term newborns will be recruited and randomized to the "RP intervention" or "standard care control" groups. The RP intervention includes: 1) parenting and nutrition education developed using the American Academy of Pediatrics Healthy Active Living for Families curriculum in conjunction with portions of a previously tested RP curriculum delivered by trained pediatric PCPs and WIC nutritionists during regularly scheduled appointments; 2) parent-reported data using the Early Healthy Lifestyles (EHL) risk assessment tool; and 3) data integration into child's electronic health records with display and documentation features to inform counseling and coordinate care between pediatric PCPs and WIC nutritionists. The primary study outcome is rapid infant weight gain from birth to 6months derived from sex-specific World Health Organization adjusted weight-for-age z-scores. Additional outcomes include care coordination, messaging consistency, parenting behaviors (e.g., food to soothe), self-efficacy, and infant sleep health. Infant temperament and parent depression will be explored as moderators of RP effects on infant outcomes. Discussion: This pragmatic patient-centered RP intervention integrates and coordinates care across clinical and community sectors, potentially offering a fundamental change in the delivery of pediatric care for prevention and health promotion. Findings from this trial can inform large scale dissemination of obesity prevention programs. Trial registration: Restrospective Clinical Trial Registration: NCT03482908.

abstract={Menopause-induced changes may include increased incidence of both depression/anxiety and obesity. We hypothesized that behavioral changes that may develop after ovarian failure could be related to neurochemical and metabolic aspects affected by this condition and that high-fat intake may influence these associations. The present study investigated in rats the effects of ovariectomy, either alone or combined with high-fat diets enriched with either lard or fish-oil, on metabolic, behavioral and monoaminergic statuses, and on gene expression of neuropeptides and receptors involved in energy balance and mood regulation. Female rats had their ovaries removed and received either standard chow (OvxC) or high-fat diets enriched with either lard (OvxL) or fish-oil (OvxF) for 8 weeks. The Sham group received only chow diet. Ovariectomy increased feed efficiency and body weight gain and impaired glucose homeostasis and serotonin-induced hypophagia, effects either maintained or even accentuated by the lard diet but counteracted by the fish diet. The OvxL group developed obesity and hyperleptinemia. Regarding components of hypothalamic serotonergic system, both ovariectomy alone or combined with the fish diet increased 5-HT2C expression while the lard diet reduced 5-HT1B mRNA. Ovariectomy increased the anxiety index, as derived from the elevated plus maze test, while both high-fat groups showed normalization of this index. In the forced swimming test, ovariectomy allied to high-lard diet, but not to fish-oil diet, reduced the latency to immobility, indicating vulnerability to a depressive-like state. Linear regression analysis showed hippocampal AgRP to be negatively associated with the anxiety index and hypothalamic AgRP to be positively associated with the latency to immobility. These AgRp gene expression associations are indicative of a beneficial involvement of this neuropeptide on both depression and anxiety measures. The present findings demonstrate metabolic, neurochemical and behavioral alterations after ovaries removal and highlight a positive effect of high-fat feeding on the anxiety-like behavior shown by ovariectomized animals. Since the polyunsaturated ômega-3 intake (fish diet), unlike the saturated fat intake (lard diet), failed to induce deleterious metabolic or neurochemical consequences, further studies are needed focusing on the potential of this dietary component as an adjuvant anxiolytic agent after menopause. © 2018 Dornellas, Boldarine, Pedroso, Carvalho, de Andrade, Vulcani-Freitas, dos Santos, do Nascimento, Oyama and Ribeiro.},

abstract={Maternal nutrition impacts fetal development, and may play a role in determining resilience to stress and vulnerability to stress-precipitated psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression. In this study, we examined the effect of a reduction in maternal dietary protein during pregnancy on the brain neurochemistry and behavior of offspring. We focused specifically on the serotonin system, the 5-HT1A receptor and the responsivity of offspring as adults to stress. Dams were fed either a low protein diet (10% protein by weight) or isocaloric control diet (20% protein by weight). The low protein diet did not alter maternal food intake and body weight, or litter size and the average birth weight of male or female littermates. 5-HT1A receptor function, as measured by quantitative autoradiography of 8-OH-DPAT (1 μM)-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding, was markedly reduced in hippocampus of weanling female, but not male offspring (postnatal day, PND 21) of dams fed the low protein diet. The number of serotonergic cell bodies in the rostral raphe, and 5-HT metabolism in the limbic system of weanling offspring was not altered by maternal low protein diet. The deficit in hippocampal 5-HT1A receptor function observed in weanling female offspring persisted into adulthood (PND 112), and was accompanied by an increased sensitivity to stress, specifically increased immobility during a 15-minute forced swim challenge and increased anorexia following 30-minute restraint (PND 97-100). The present work begins to uncover important future directions for understanding the early developmental origins of resilience to stress, and factors that may put individuals at greater risk for stress-related psychiatric disorders. © 2018},

abstract={Similar doses of caffeine have been shown to produce either anxiolytic or anxiogenic effects in rats. The reasons for these conflicting results are not known. We hypothesized that food deprivation stress interacts with the stimulant effects of caffeine to increase anxiety-like behavior. We tested 32 female Sprague Dawley rats in a dim open field for 10 min. Half of the animals were food deprived for 24 h and injected (intraperitoneal) with caffeine (30 mg/kg; n=7) or deionized water (n=8) 20 min before the open field test. The other half was nondeprived and injected with caffeine (30 mg/kg; n=8) or deionized water (n=9). Results showed that nondeprived rats injected with caffeine moved longer distances and at a greater speed in the periphery and moved longer distances and spent more time in the center than rats treated with vehicle, indicative of motor-activating and/or anxiolytic effects of caffeine. Rats that were food deprived and injected with caffeine moved longer distances in the center and tended to spend more time there, indicative of anxiolysis. We conclude that caffeine had two effects on behavior, motor activation and a reduction of anxiety, and that food deprivation separated these effects. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

abstract={Anthropogenic landscapes and soundscapes impose strong selective pressures on a number of species, which can manifest in changes in vocalizations, foraging strategies, predator vigilance, and reproductive success. However, few studies have examined survival rates, a major component of fitness, across urban landscapes and soundscapes. White-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys) persist in both urban and rural landscapes and change their behavior in response to the soundscape. We color-banded adult white-crowned sparrows and collected noise levels on their territories in the urban San Francisco Bay Area and adjacent rural Point Reyes National Seashore in California. We collected mark-encounter data on territorial males from 2014 to 2017. Using the Program MARK, we tested the effects of habitat (urban/rural) and territory noise level on annual survival rates and body condition. We predicted that survival and body condition would be lower in urban habitats and decrease with increasing background noise level on territories. We found that survival estimates vary according to year, and males in urban landscapes have higher survival. Noise levels best predict body condition, such that soundscape negatively correlates with male body condition. Taken together, the urban landscape and soundscape shape the survival and health of birds in and near cities. © 2018 The Authors.},

abstract={The optic tectum and superior colliculus rapidly inhibit food intake when a visual threat is present. Previous work indicates that CRF, acting on CRFR1 receptors, may play a role in tectal inhibition of feeding behavior and food intake. Here we test the hypothesis that tectal CRFR1 receptors modulate food intake and feeding behavior in juvenile Xenopus laevis. We performed five experiments to test the following questions: 1) Does tectal CRF injection decrease food intake/feeding behavior? 2) Does a selective CRFR1 antagonist block CRF effects on feeding/feeding behavior? 3) Does a reactive stressor decrease food intake/feeding behavior? 4) Does a selective CRFR1 antagonist block reactive stress-induced decrease in feeding/feeding behavior? 5) Does food deprivation increase food intake/feeding behavior? Tectal CRF injections reduced food intake and influenced exploratory behavior, hindlimb kicks, and time in contact with food. These effects were blocked by the selective R1 antagonist NBI-27914. Exposure to a reactive stressor decreased food intake and this effect was blocked by NBI-27914. Neither food intake or feeding behavior changed following 1 wk of food deprivation. Overall, we conclude that activation of tectal CRFR1 inhibits food intake in juvenile X. laevis. Furthermore, tectal CRFR1 receptors appear to be involved in the reduction of food intake that occurs in response to a reactive stressor. © 2018},

abstract={Abstract: Personality traits overlap in behavioral syndromes that are assumed to be related to physiology and life history traits, shaping pace-of-life syndromes. Boldness and explorative behavior are frequently associated with higher parasite loads, increased resource acquisition, less efficient antipredator behavior, and reduced survival (e.g., through predation). We explored how personality is related to these biological traits using an invasive species—Atlantoxerus getulus in Fuerteventura island—as a model system with reduced parasitism and low predation pressure. We used breath rate during handling, open field tests, and escape trials to test for the existence of interindividual differences in boldness, explorative behavior, and escape speed, respectively. We also tested whether the personality traits were related and formed behavioral syndromes in A. getulus. At the same time, we explored how personality is related to ectoparasite load, body condition, and survival in the species. We found strong between-individual differences in breath rate, readiness to get in the open field arena, and escape speed. We found a behavioral syndrome, linking open field entrance and escape speed, in A. getulus. However, personality was not related to parasite load or body condition and survival was higher for bolder individuals. As a whole, our results suggest reduced parasites and predator pressures on Fuerteventura may have potentially neutralized the typical drawbacks of a fast pace-of-life in the introduced population of A. getulus. Significance statement: Research on the interactions of animal personality with other ecological and evolutionary factors, such as parasitism and selection gradients, has yielded some intriguing perspectives about many ecological and evolutionary processes. However, our understanding of the eco-evolutionary consequences of animal personality and how it interacts with other relevant biological processes is still limited. Invasive species often experience specific ecological conditions that can allow testing of the general assumptions related to animal personality. The present contribution explores if and how personality traits are related to key ecological and evolutionary factors, such as parasitism and survival, in the context of an invasive population subjected to reduced parasite and predation pressure. Unlike other studies conducted under different ecological contexts, our results suggest Barbary ground squirrels from the assessed population with fast pace-of-life syndromes have higher survival chances than their counterparts. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Chemicals released into the environment by food, predators and conspecifics play critical roles in Drosophila reproduction. Females and males live in an environment full of smells, whose molecules communicate to them the availability of food, potential mates, competitors or predators. Volatile chemicals derived from fruit, yeast growing on the fruit, and flies already present on the fruit attract Drosophila, concentrating flies at food sites, where they will also mate. Species-specific cuticular hydrocarbons displayed on female Drosophila as they mature are sensed by males and act as pheromones to stimulate mating by conspecific males and inhibit heterospecific mating. The pheromonal profile of a female is also responsive to her nutritional environment, providing an honest signal of her fertility potential. After mating, cuticular and semen hydrocarbons transferred by the male change the female’s chemical profile. These molecules make the female less attractive to other males, thus protecting her mate’s sperm investment. Females have evolved the capacity to counteract this inhibition by ejecting the semen hydrocarbon (along with the rest of the remaining ejaculate) a few hours after mating. Although this ejection can temporarily restore the female’s attractiveness, shortly thereafter another male pheromone, a seminal peptide, decreases the female’s propensity to re-mate, thus continuing to protect the male’s investment. Females use olfaction and taste sensing to select optimal egg-laying sites, integrating cues for the availability of food for her offspring, and the presence of other flies and of harmful species. We argue that taking into account evolutionary considerations such as sexual conflict, and the ecological conditions in which flies live, is helpful in understanding the role of highly species-specific pheromones and blends thereof, as well as an individual’s response to the chemical cues in its environment. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={When prey are differentially affected by intra and interspecific competition, the cooccurrence of multiple prey species alters the per capita availability of food for a particular prey species which could alter how prey respond to the threat of predation, and hence the overall-effect of predators. We conducted an experiment to examine the extent to which the nonconsumptive and overall effect of predatory water bugs on snail and tadpole traits (performance and morphology) depended on whether tadpoles and snails cooccurred. Tadpoles and snails differed in their relative susceptibility to intraspecific and interspecific competition, and predators affected both prey species via consumptive and nonconsumptive mechanisms. Furthermore, the overall effect of predators often depended on whether another prey species was present. The reasoning for why the overall effect of predators depended on whether prey species cooccurred, however, differed for each of the response variables. Predators affected snail body growth via nonconsumptive mechanisms, but the change in the overall effect of predators on snail body growth was attributable to how snails responded to competition in the absence of predators, rather than a change in how snails responded to the threat of predation. Predators did not affect tadpole body growth via nonconsumptive mechanisms, but the greater vulnerability of competitively superior prey (snails) to predators increased the strength of consumptive mechanisms (and hence the overall effect) through which predators affected tadpole growth. Predators affected tadpole morphology via nonconsumptive mechanisms, but the greater propensity for predators to kill competitively superior prey (snails) enhanced the ability of tadpoles to alter their morphology in response to the threat of predation by creating an environment where tadpoles had a higher per capita supply of food available to invest in the development of morphological defenses. Our work indicates that the mechanisms through which predators affect prey depends on the other members of the community. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Climate change is regarded as one of the major concerns of the 21st Century, with mean temperatures expected to increase by about 3 °C over the next 100 years. Species responses to climate change are not consistent, with some species apparently able to respond more quickly than others, thus producing changes in community structure. One increasingly common observation is that species at lower trophic levels respond more quickly to change in climate than species at higher levels. This can result in, for example, the timing of a predator's peak food requirements being separated in time from the point at which their prey is most available. It has been suggested that this creates an additional risk for the persistence of species at high trophic levels as the climate alters; there is an alternative possibility — that predators may change their diets in response to changing prey availability. Models of diet choice make several predictions, for example they suggest that whether a predator includes a secondary prey into its diet depends on the availability of the primary prey and not on characteristics of the secondary prey. By switching between one prey type and another, a predator population may be able to persist in a particular location longer than they would otherwise. Using a simple demonstration model we show that this idea is theoretically plausible. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Previous studies in animal models and humans have shown that exposure to nutritional deficiencies in the perinatal period increases the risk of psychiatric disease. Less well understood is how such effects are modulated by the combination of genetic background and parent-of-origin (PO). To explore this, we exposed female mice from 20 Collaborative Cross (CC) strains to protein deficient, vitamin D deficient, methyl donor enriched or standard diet during the perinatal period. These CC females were then crossed to a male from a different CC strain to produce reciprocal F1 hybrid females comprising 10 distinct genetic backgrounds. The adult F1 females were then tested in the open field, light/dark, stress-induced hyperthermia, forced swim and restraint stress assays. Our experimental design allowed us to estimate effects of genetic background, perinatal diet, PO and their interactions on behavior. Genetic background significantly affected all assessed phenotypes. Perinatal diet exposure interacted with genetic background to affect body weight, basal body temperature, anxiety-like behavior and stress response. In 8 of 9 genetic backgrounds, PO effects were observed on multiple phenotypes. Additionally, we identified a small number of diet-by-PO effects on body weight, stress response, anxiety- and depressive-like behavior. Our data show that rodent behaviors that model psychiatric disorders are affected by genetic background, PO and perinatal diet, as well as interactions among these factors. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society},

abstract={Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several genes associated with obesity. The mechanisms through which these genes affect body weight are not fully characterized. Recent studies suggest that eating behavior (EB) traits could be involved, but only a few EB traits were investigated. Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether genetic susceptibility to obesity is mediated by EB traits (cognitive restraint, disinhibition, hunger) and their subscales. We hypothesized that EB traits, and their subscales, partly mediate this association. Design: Adult individuals (n = 768) who participated in the Quebec Family Study were included in this cross-sectional study. A genetic risk score (GRS) of obesity was calculated based on the 97 genetic variants recently identified in a GWAS meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI). EB traits and their subscales were assessed with the use of the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire. Regression analyses with age and sex as covariates were used to investigate the associations between GRS, EB traits, BMI, and WC and whether the association between GRS and obesity is mediated by EB traits, which represents the indirect effect of GRS on obesity. Results: The GRS of obesity was positively associated with BMI (β = 0.19 ± 0.04, P &lt; 0.0001) and WC (β = 0.46 ± 0.10, P &lt; 0.0001). Regression analyses also revealed that the association between GRS of obesity and BMI was partly mediated by disinhibition and susceptibility to hunger (βindirect = 0.09 ± 0.03, P = 0.0007, and βindirect = 0.04 ± 0.02, P = 0.02, respectively). Habitual and situational susceptibility to disinhibition (βindirect = 0.08 ± 0.03, P = 0.002 and βindirect = 0.05 ± 0.02, P = 0.003, respectively) as well as internal and external locus of hunger (βindirect = 0.03 ± 0.02, P = 0.03 for both) were also found to mediate the association between GRS of obesity and BMI. The same trends were observed with WC. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that the genetic susceptibility to obesity is partly mediated through undesirable EB traits, which suggests that they could be targeted in obesity treatment and prevention. © 2018 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Small birds overwintering in cold climates must meet the daily challenge of accumulating sufficient energy reserves throughout the day to ensure overnight survival. Theoretical work suggests that risk of starvation is a major force shaping optimal daily foraging routines. Animals are predicted to adjust how they distribute their daily foraging activity in relation to environmental harshness, which largely determines the risk of starvation. Here, we used radiofrequency identification (RFID)-enabled bird feeders to test whether mountain chickadees, Poecile gambeli – small, resident, food-caching birds – exhibited different daily foraging routines in harsher (higher elevation) versus milder (lower elevation) environments in the Sierra Nevada. In addition, we assessed foraging routines between four different periods of the nonbreeding season ranging from autumn (milder conditions) to winter and early spring (harsher conditions) and to late spring (milder conditions). We also tested whether individual variation in spatial cognition associated with food caching, which represents a more reliable food source that can be expected to lower risk of starvation, is associated with differences in daily foraging routines. Chickadees from both elevations distributed their daily foraging efforts differently throughout the nonbreeding season, consistent with theoretical predictions for milder and harsher conditions. Differences between chickadees from high and low elevations were especially pronounced during harsher winter periods, with chickadees from high elevations showing a bimodal daily routine, while low-elevation birds showed an inverted U-shaped daily routine, with most foraging during the middle of the day. Finally, significant differences in daily routines were associated with variation in spatial learning and memory performance. Overall, our study shows that daily foraging routines are consistent with risk of starvation under different degrees of environmental harshness, whether across nonbreeding seasons or between elevations, and that perception of harshness may be associated with cognitive abilities. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Food preferences may be driven by a species’ ecology. Closely related species such as dogs and wolves may have evolved preferences for different foods owing to their differing foraging styles. Wolves have been shown to be more persistent in problem-solving experiments and more risk-prone in a foraging task. A possible element affecting these (and other) results is a potential wolf-dog difference in food preferences. To address this possibility, we tested similarly raised and kept dogs and wolves in two different food choice tasks, a classic two-choice task and a multiple-choice paradigm. We predicted that if dogs have adapted to a more opportunistic, scavenging foraging style, they would show a weaker preference for meat over starch rich foods (such as kibble) and be less affected by hunger than wolves. Alternatively, given the recentness of the new niche dogs have created, we predicted no substantial differences between dogs’ and wolves’ food preferences. We found that our subjects did not differ in their preference for meat over kibble in either paradigm. However, wolves’ (but not dogs’) choice patterns were affected by satiation, with wolves being less “selective” when hungry. Furthermore, when fed before testing, wolves were more selective than dogs. These differences were more noticeable in the multiple-choice paradigm than the two-choice task, suggesting that the former, novel paradigm may be more sensitive and better capable of evaluating food preferences in a diverse range of species. Overall, we found that the distinct differences in wolves’ and dogs’ ecology and foraging styles do not appear to have affected their food preferences and thus, differences in food preferences are unlikely to have influenced results of previous experiments demonstrating wolf-dog differences in cognitive skills. © 2018 Rao et al.

They exhibit varied morphological responses to different nitrogen levels indicating its developmental plasticity in relation to nitrogen availability. In order to understand the genetic diversity in modulation of root architecture among diverse wheat genotypes in response to external root growth media and nitrate starvation, root system architecture parameters such as total toot size, main root size, lateral root size, 1st order lateral root number and 2nd order lateral root number were studied in 15 days old seedlings of twelve diverse wheat genotypes carrying different nitrogen use efficiency traits in three different root growth media i.e. hydroponic culture (HC), solid nutrient free (in terms of plant nutrients; vermiculite and perlite mixture; VPC) culture and soil culture (SC). We observed that both nitrate starvation and root growth media modulate overall root system architecture. However, the ability of such modulation is genotype specific. Further, the solid nutrient free media, in contrast to solution culture (HC), induced much pronounced effect on overall architecture indicating their nitrate foraging ability in natural soil condition. Among the two solid media, VPC has caused more exploratory root morphology in nitrate deficient condition. In general the effect of nitrate stress is more predominant in VPC followed by HC than SC. Among genotypes, NP846 and HS1097-17 were found to be most responsive towards nitrogen starvation condition and root growth media as far as root traits are concerned. © 2018, Brazilian Society of Plant Physiology.},

abstract={On ‘Mismatch’ and ‘Metabolic Ghettos:’ The Conceptualization of Global Health Differences in Research on the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease. Epigenetic approaches to human health have received growing attention in the past two decades. They allow to view the development of human organisms as plastic, i.e. as open to influences from the social and material environment such as nutrition, stress, and trauma. This has lent new credence to approaches in biomedicine that aim to draw attention to the importance of development for later life health. Some scholars in the social sciences and humanities have welcomed such approaches as a departure from gene‐centric perspectives and as an opportunity for highlighting the social and political determinants of health and illness. Others have warned that they might lead to new forms of biological reductionisms and determinisms. In this article, we explore how research on developmental plasticity addresses and articulates global health disparities, specifically in the context of postcolonial India. We discuss two prominent approaches from the field of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) that build on epigenetic perspectives on health and illness and view different global rates of disease susceptibility as the result of developmental processes: first, the ‘mismatch paradigm’ by Peter Gluckman and Mark Hanson and second, the ‘metabolic ghetto’ concept by Jonathan Wells. We highlight how both approaches render historical and social factors meaningful for the development of global health disparities, but emphasize how they at the same time remain prone to determinisms and reductionisms reminiscent of a gene‐centric perspective. DOHaD actors themselves are critical of these tendencies, and in conclusion we explore novel opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations enabled by this critical potential. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH&Co.

Methods: From a population-based one-year cohort (n = 416), we performed an observational study of 145 survivors at 16 months and 10 years after stroke (age 27-97 years) regarding secondary prevention including reaching acceptable treatment goals; nutritional status with focus on underweight; and the lifestyle indices: living situation, level of dependence, and self-assessed health condition. Results: Ten years after stroke, 50% of the subjects with hypertension diagnosis and 55% of those without hypertension diagnosis were within the blood pressure goal <140/90 compared with 32% (P =.008) and 37% (N.S.) at 16 months. Acceptable HbA1c levels among subjects with diabetes mellitus diagnosis increased from 35% to 45% (N.S.). Among those without diabetes diagnosis, satisfactory HbA1c levels decreased from 98% to 79% (P <.001). Underweight increased from 9% to 17% (P =.019). Among patients with cerebral infarction, the prevalence of atrial fibrillation increased from 22% to 29% (P =.004), and treatment with oral anticoagulants from 75% to 78% (N.S.). Acceptable LDL cholesterol levels increased from 59% to 80% (P =.033) among subjects on lipid lowering treatment, and from 18% to 40% among untreated (P =.010). At 10 years, 90% still lived in their own home. Health condition was reported as good/very good/excellent by 65%. Age, female sex, and living situation were associated with intensity of secondary prevention measures and underweight. Conclusions: The proportion of individuals within treatment goals improved over time, but secondary prevention still needed additional consideration 10 years after stroke. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

abstract={Background: Most studies on food choice have been focussing on the individual level but familial aspects may also play an important role. This paper reports of a novel study that will focus on the familial aspects of the formation of food choice among men and women aged 50-70 years by recruiting spouses and siblings (NutriAct Family Study; NFS). Methods: Data is collected prospectively via repeatedly applied web-based questionnaires over the next years. The recruitment for the NFS started in October 2016. Participants are recruited based on an index person who is actively participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam study. This index person was asked to invite the spouse, a sibling or an in-law. If a set of family members agreed to participate, access to individualized web-based questionnaires assessing dietary intake, other health related lifestyle habits, eating behaviour, food responsiveness, personality, self-regulation, socio-economic status and socio-cultural values was provided. In the first phase of the NSF, recruitment rates were monitored in detail and participants' comments were analysed in order to improve the feasibility of procedures and instruments. Discussion: Until August 4th 2017, 4783 EPIC-Participants were contacted by mail of which 446 persons recruited 2 to 5 family members (including themselves) resulting in 1032 participants, of whom 82% had started answering or already completed the questionnaires. Of the 4337 remaining EPIC-participants who had been contacted, 1040 (24%) did not respond at all, and 3297 (76%) responded but declined, in 51% of the cases because of the request to recruit at least 2 family members in the respective age range. The developed recruitment procedures and web-based methods of data collection are capable to generate the required study population including the data on individual and inter-personal determinants which will be linkable to food choice. The information on familial links among the study participants will show the role of familial traits in midlife for the adoption of food choices supporting healthy aging. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Regulation of mass in small birds is based on simultaneously minimizing starvation and predation risk, but the mechanisms birds use to assess starvation risk are still debated. While we know that birds anticipate periods of unpredictable food availability/energy expenditure (e.g. the winter and night) by increasing their fat reserves, we do not know whether this anticipation involves learning. This study investigated whether birds could learn to use a light cue that predicted a period of food unavailability, to adaptively regulate their foraging and/or body weight. Sixteen captive starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, were subjected to 42 days of an irregular schedule of food deprivation that involved depriving them of food for 5 h on 20 pseudorandomly chosen days. Birds were randomly allocated to two treatment groups for which a 30 min period of reduced ambient light either provided perfect information (Predictable) or no information (Unpredictable) about upcoming food deprivation. Both groups of birds increased their dawn body mass over the period of the experiment, consistent with a response to unpredictable food deprivation. However, no differences in either foraging behaviour or dawn body mass emerged between the groups, suggesting that the Predictable birds were unable to learn to use the light cue to initiate anticipatory foraging ahead of food deprivation. Furthermore, both groups immediately decreased their foraging behaviour in response to the onset of the light cue, suggesting that starlings do not have an evolved anticipatory foraging response to low light levels. Further work is needed to test alternative cues and designs before any general conclusions can be drawn regarding the flexibility of anticipatory foraging. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Purpose: This study was conducted to develop a nutrition quotient (NQ) to assess overall dietary quality and food behaviors of Korean adults. Methods: The NQ was developed in three steps: item generation, item reduction, and validation. Candidate items of the NQ checklist were derived from a systematic literature review, expert in-depth interviews, statistical analyses of the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2010 ~ 2013) data, and national nutrition policies and recommendations. A total of 368 adults (19 ~ 64 years) participated in a one-day dietary record survey and responded to 43 items in the food behavior checklist. Pearson's correlation coefficients between responses to the checklist items and nutritional intake status of the adults were calculated. Item reduction was performed, and 24 items were selected for a nationwide survey. A total of 1,053 nationwide adult subjects completed the checklist questionnaires. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed to develop a final NQ model. Results: The 21 checklist items were used as final items for NQ. Checklist items were composed of four factors: nutrition balance (seven items), food diversity (three items), moderation for the amount of food intake (six items), and dietary behavior (five items). The four-factor structure accounted for 41.8% of the total variance. Indicator tests of the NQ model suggested an adequate model fit (GRI = 0.9693, adjusted GFI = 0.9617, RMR = 0.0054, SRMR = 0.0897, p < 0.05), and item loadings were significant for all subscales. Standardized path coefficients were used as weights of the items. The NQ and four-factor scores were calculated according to the obtained weights of the questionnaire items. Conclusion: NQ for adults would be a useful tool for assessing adult dietary quality and food behavior. Further investigations of adult NQ are needed to reflect changes in their food behavior, environment, and prevalence of chronic diseases. © 2018 The Korean Nutrition Society.},

abstract={Background/objectives: Previous studies have shown that the temperament traits are related to risk factors for chronic diseases, which could be partly explained by lifestyle habits. However, little is known whether temperament traits associate with diet. The aim of this study was to examine the cross-sectional associations between temperament traits and the whole diet. Subjects/methods: We studied 1668 men and women, aged 56−70, from the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study. Temperament was measured using the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire. Information on diet was collected by a validated 128-item food frequency questionnaire. The associations of temperament traits; novelty seeking (NS), harm avoidance (HA), reward dependence (RD), and persistence (P), with diet were tested by linear regression analysis. Results: After adjustment for potential confounders, greater HA was related to poorer diet quality, including lower consumption of vegetables, fruits, fish and several vitamins. RD was associated with healthier diet quality, including higher consumption of vegetables and intake of vitamin E and lower intake of alcohol. NS was significantly related to higher intake of fish, fat and alcohol and lower consumption of cereals, milk products and carbohydrates. No significant associations between P and intake of foods and nutrients were observed. Conclusions: Our results suggest that there is an association between temperament traits and diet. Especially greater HA seems to associate with poorer diet quality and greater RD with healthier diet quality. © 2018, Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Abstract: Variation in intrinsic (body mass, reproductive condition) and extrinsic factors (habitat quality, spatio-temporal variation in food availability) can affect the costs and benefits of personality traits. Relationships between personality and fitness components can vary with changes in population density and/or habitat quality. Here, using capture-mark-recapture data of individually marked Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris), we explored whether indices of boldness and exploration are correlated with local survival in either of the sexes and with a measure of reproductive success in females, under different conditions of food availability. PCA scores derived from the number of captures (trappability) and number of different traps where an individual was captured (trap diversity), in the first 1 or 2 years of presence, were used as indices of personality (boldness and pure exploration). The relationships between boldness and local survival differed between habitats in both sexes. Bold squirrels survived better than shy ones in Norway spruce forest, while in the other two study areas (Scots pine or mixed spruce-fir forest), survival was lower for bolder squirrels. Pure exploration behavior was negatively correlated with local survival in all habitats and in both sexes. Female reproductive success increased with body mass and decreased with the tendency to explore, a relationship consistent across habitat types. Bolder females did not have a reproductive advantage in years of poor food availability. We suggest that costs and benefits of boldness vary with spatio-temporal differences in availability of high-quality food resources which may help to maintain variation in personality in red squirrels in heterogeneous landscapes. Significance statement: Differences in personality among individuals can affect their survival or reproductive success. We investigated the relationship between personality traits and fitness components in Eurasian red squirrels under different food availability. We scored boldness and exploration using indices derived from capture-mark-recapture data. Bold red squirrels survived longer than shy ones in spruce forest where food availability varied strongly between years. Instead, in mixed forests with more stable food supplies, shy individuals survived longer. Heavy females produced more litters in their lifetime than those with lower body mass. Explorative squirrels were more likely to die young and to produce no or few litters, independent of the habitat they lived in. Our results suggest that variation in personality traits within populations of Eurasian red squirrels was maintained by changing fitness benefits in relation to habitat type in pulsed resource systems. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Climate-driven increases in spring temperatures are expected to result in higher prey availability earlier in the breeding season for insectivorous birds breeding in wetland habitats. Predation during the incubation phase is a major cause of nesting failure in open-nesting altricial birds such as the Eurasian reed warbler. The nest predation rate in this species has recently been shown to be substantially reduced under conditions of experimentally elevated invertebrate prey availability. Food availability near the nest may be an important determinant of adult incubation and nest defence behaviours during the incubation period. We used two experimental studies to compare incubation behaviour and nest defence in food-supplemented and unsupplemented adult Eurasian reed warblers during the incubation phase. In the first study we measured nest defence behavioural responses to a taxidermic mount of a native predator (stoat Mustela erminea). In the second study we used temperature loggers installed in nests to measure breaks in incubation as a measure of nest vulnerability. Food-supplemented birds responded aggressively to the presence of a predator more quickly than those in the unsupplemented group, suggesting they are closer to their nest and can more quickly detect a predator in the vicinity. Food-supplemented birds also had shorter breaks in incubation (both in terms of maximum and mean off-bout durations), presumably because they were foraging for shorter periods or over shorter distances from the nest. This study therefore identifies the behavioural mechanisms by which changes in food availability may lead to changes in nest survival and thus breeding productivity, in open-nesting insectivorous birds. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Complex interactions between environmental and genetic factors influence the risk of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD) in humans. To date, studies of the impact of environment on AUD risk have primarily focused on psychological characteristics or on the effects of developmental exposure to ethanol (EtOH). We recently observed that modifying levels of the long-chain ω-3 (LC ω-3) fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), alters acute physiological responses to EtOH in Caenorhabditis elegans. Because mammals derive ω-3 fatty acids from their diet, here we asked if manipulating dietary levels of LC ω-3 fatty acids can affect EtOH-responsive behaviors in mice. Methods: We used 2 well-characterized inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2), which differ in their responses to EtOH. Age-matched young adult male mice were maintained on isocaloric diets that differed only by being enriched or depleted in LC ω-3 fatty acids. Animals were subsequently tested for acute EtOH sensitivity (locomotor activation and sedation), voluntary consumption, and metabolism. Fat deposition was also determined. Results: We found that dietary levels of LC ω-3s altered EtOH sensitivity and consumption in a genotype-specific manner. Both B6 and D2 animals fed high LC ω-3 diets demonstrated lower EtOH-induced locomotor stimulation than those fed low LC ω-3 diets. EtOH sedation and EtOH metabolism were greater in D2, but not B6 mice on the high LC ω-3 diet. Conversely, LC ω-3 dietary manipulation altered EtOH consumption in B6, but not in D2 mice. B6 mice on a high LC ω-3 diet consumed more EtOH in a 2-bottle choice intermittent access model than B6 mice on a low LC ω-3 diet. Conclusions: Because EtOH sensitivity is predictive of risk of developing AUD in humans, our data indicate that dietary LC ω-3 levels should be evaluated for their impact on AUD risk in humans. Further, these studies indicate that genetic background can interact with fatty acids in the diet to significantly alter EtOH-responsive behaviors.

abstract={Thermoregulatory behaviours are of great importance for ectotherms buffering against the impact of temperature extremes. Such behaviours bring not only benefits but also organism level costs such as decreased food availability and foraging efficiency and thus lead to energetic costs and metabolic consequences. However, there remains an important gap in our knowledge to link thermoregulatory behaviour to population level ecological consequences. Aphids, as ectothermic invertebrates, can escape from thermal extremes by either dropping off the plant they are on or moving to suitable microclimates. Here we used the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae, as a model system to test the hypothesis that aphids may behaviourally avoid heat stress while also altering their microhabitat utilization leading to demographic consequences. We found that heat stress drove the aphids to leave their host plant; this reduction in host plant residence was associated with increasing leaf temperatures indicating that aphids exhibit thermoregulatory behaviour to escape heat stress. Specifically, we found that behavioural thermoregulation made the aphids disperse and redistribute themselves within different microclimates and thus led to changes in microhabitat utilization. We also discovered that leaving the host plant during behavioural thermoregulation resulted in a considerable decrease in aphids' survival probability due to their inefficient relocation to other plants and increased risk of starvation. Finally, we found that the aphids' thermoregulatory behaviour prevented heat stress while concurrently resulting in decreased survival and reproduction. Together, these findings support our hypothesis that behavioural thermoregulation alters microhabitat utilization and demographic rates in aphids. This study highlights the importance of behavioural thermoregulation and its ecological consequences and has important implications for understanding population responses in the context of current climate change. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Background: Most brain machine interfaces (BMI) focus on upper body function in non-injured animals, not addressing the lower limb functional needs of those with paraplegia. A need exists for a novel BMI task that engages the lower body and takes advantage of well-established rodent spinal cord injury (SCI) models to study methods to improve BMI performance. New method: A tilt BMI task was designed that randomly applies different types of tilts to a platform, decodes the tilt type applied and rights the platform if the decoder correctly classifies the tilt type. The task was tested on female rats and is relatively natural such that it does not require the animal to learn a new skill. It is self-rewarding such that there is no need for additional rewards, eliminating food or water restriction, which can be especially hard on spinalized rats. Finally, task difficulty can be adjusted by making the tilt parameters. Results: This novel BMI task bilaterally engages the cortex without visual feedback regarding limb position in space and animals learn to improve their performance both pre and post-SCI.Comparison with Existing Methods: Most BMI tasks primarily engage one hemisphere, are upper-body, rely heavily on visual feedback, do not perform investigations in animal models of SCI, and require nonnaturalistic extrinsic motivation such as water rewarding for performance improvement. Our task addresses these gaps. Conclusions: The BMI paradigm presented here will enable researchers to investigate the interaction of plasticity after SCI and plasticity during BMI training on performance. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Visual signals are widely used by animals in foraging, mating and predator avoidance. Body coloration plays an important role in the reproductive behavioural interactions of many diurnal animal species; however, its role in the courtship of nocturnal species has received little attention. We investigated the role of conspicuous body coloration, a white stripe on the forehead region, in the reproductive interactions of the nocturnal brown huntsman spider, Heteropoda venatoria. We performed a series of mating trials in which we manipulated the body coloration of males and the vision of females and determined the probabilities of mating success of males in different treatments. Results showed that males that courted females with intact vision had a significantly lower probability of mating success than males that courted females whose vision was blocked. Females with intact vision were also more likely to choose males with a white stripe than those whose stripe was removed. Therefore, we have unambiguously demonstrated for the first time that body coloration plays an important role as a visual signal in the mating of nocturnal spiders. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Stress in general and starvation in particular have various and often contrasting effects on different traits. Previous starvation studies have usually focused on one or two response variables and comprised one starvation treatment versus a control. Here, we used the red flour beetle to study the effects of (1) a starvation gradient of 0–4 days, and (2) alternating starvation over 3 days on multiple response variables: movement activity, food patch discovery, latency to emerge from shelter, body mass, water content, and offspring number and mass. Starvation led to a decline in body mass and water content, as expected. Beetles also became less active, less explorative and less bold, which is in contradiction to the findings from some previous work. Both the number of offspring and their mass at mid-development diminished, suggesting a non-adaptive parental effect, from the offspring perspective, due to parental starvation. Recuperation episodes negated starvation effects in most cases, with three exceptions: male body mass, water content and movement activity. The link between starvation duration and the tested response variables was inconsistent between sexes, with movement activity the most prominent example. Females were generally larger and although the rate of their mass loss was steeper, they were more starvation tolerant than males, as evident in their ability to take better advantage of the recuperation episodes. Our results indicate that starvation has a differential effect on the response variables according to sex. © 2018 The Zoological Society of London},

abstract={The ability to distinguish between different quantities of items is fundamental in many ecological contexts, and it has been shown in different animal species. This ability may also be context specific. Quantity estimation in fish has mainly been analysed in the context of social behaviour, whereas a majority of studies conducted with species other than fish tested it in the context of foraging. Surprisingly, little is known about the capacity of fish to discriminate between food quantities, possibly because of difficulties in testing individual fish in a novel, and thus aversive, test environment. Here, we present a novel approach that allowed us to test single angelfish, Pterophyllum scalare, while minimizing isolation-related stress. In binary choice tests, sets composed of similarly sized discrete food items differing in numerical size were presented and the spontaneous (untrained) choice of angelfish was investigated. In all contrasts tested in three experiments, angelfish preferred the numerically larger to the smaller food set. The performance of the fish was ratio dependent in the small but not in the large number range (more than four food items, contrasts that were investigated for the first time in fishes), and there was no significant difference in the magnitude of preference for the small versus the large values. However, overall results indicated that the response was ratio dependent, with an increase in accuracy as the numerical ratio between the contrasts increased. Furthermore, the same numerical ratios that were successfully discriminated with small quantities were also similarly discriminated with large quantities. Altogether, our results thus imply that angelfish utilize the approximate number system of quantity representation for the entire numerical range tested, and that their response is an attempt to maximize foraging success. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Individuals vary greatly in the distance they disperse, and in doing so, strongly affect ecological and evolutionary processes. Dispersal, when viewed as a component of phenotype, can be affected independently or jointly by environment. However, among taxa with complex life cycles that occupy different habitats over ontogeny, the effects of environment on dispersal and the interaction between environment and phenotype remains poorly understood. Here, we conducted a field experiment to measure how dispersal distance was affected by phenotype, environment experienced before and after metamorphosis, and their interaction. We manipulated the environment encountered by a pond-breeding salamander Ambystoma annulatum during the aquatic larval stage and again as dispersing terrestrial juveniles. After assaying juvenile phenotype (exploration behavior, body condition, and morphology), we then measured the initial distance dispersed by juveniles. The distance moved by dispersing salamanders was affected by attributes of both larval and juvenile habitat, with salamanders that encountered low quality habitat in either life stage moving the farthest. However, we did not find support for an interactive effect of phenotype and environment affecting the distance moved by dispersers. Interestingly, exploration behavior explained the distance moved by philopatric animals but not dispersing ones. Our findings indicate that the environment experienced before metamorphosis can affect juvenile dispersal behavior, and demonstrates the need to consider dispersal in species with complex life cycles to understand the coupling between local and regional population dynamics. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Animals are able to modify their behaviour in response to changes in their internal and environmental state. The asset protection principle predicts that an animal's risk-taking behaviour should vary as a result of its residual reproductive value (RRV); animals with greater RRV would incur a greater cost if injured or killed and should therefore take fewer risks than those with low RRV. Despite the intuitive appeal of this hypothesis, few studies have effectively separated the effects of RRV on behaviour from those of age. We addressed this weakness in the widely invoked hypothesis by measuring the risk-taking behaviour of female Australian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, at various points in the animal's lifetime. We found significant effects of age on risk-taking behaviour: older females emerged from a shelter sooner after a simulated predation threat and exhibited greater mobility in an open arena. Importantly, there was also a significant marginal effect of RRV on risk-taking behaviour. Females with lower RRV displayed greater levels of risk taking than females with high RRV. Our results thereby offer support for the asset protection principle as an explanation for state-dependent variation in risk-taking behaviour. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Existing programs which aim to prevent and treat childhood obesity often do not take into account individual variation and the underlying mechanisms that impact child eating behavior. Individual differences in children's appetitive traits have been shown to appear as early as during infancy and become more pronounced as children grow older and become more exposed to the obesogenic food environment. Differences in genetic predispositions interacting with factors in children's early environment account in part for individual differences in appetitive traits. It is very likely that obesogenic eating phenotypes manifest themselves before the onset of childhood obesity. If so, identifying these phenotypes early is expected to move primary prevention strategies in a new direction and holds great potential to significantly enhance our ability to prevent childhood obesity. The aim of this narrative review is to discuss the role of behavioral phenotyping as an innovative approach for the development of more personalized obesity prevention and treatment interventions that are tailored to children's individual predispositions. We describe several examples of appetitive traits which have been linked to overeating and excess weight gain in children and thus may represent modifiable risk factors for future interventions. The review concludes with a comprehensive synthesis of opportunities for future human ingestive behavior research on identifying behavioral phenotypes for childhood obesity. © 2018},

abstract={The current obesogenic environment promotes physical inactivity and food consumption in excess of energy requirements, two important modifiable risk factors influencing energy balance. Habitual physical activity has been shown to impact not only energy expenditure, but also energy intake through mechanisms of appetite control. This review summarizes recent theory and evidence underpinning the role of physical activity in the homeostatic and non-homeostatic mechanisms controlling appetite. Energy intake along the spectrum of physical activity levels (inactive to highly active) appears to be J-shaped, with low levels of physical activity leading to dysregulated appetite and a mismatch between energy intake and expenditure. At higher levels, habitual physical activity influences homeostatic appetite control in a dual-process action by increasing the drive to eat through greater energy expenditure, but also by enhancing post-meal satiety, allowing energy intake to better match energy expenditure in response to hunger and satiety signals. There is clear presumptive evidence that physical activity energy expenditure can act as a drive (determinant) of energy intake. The influence of physical activity level on non-homeostatic appetite control is less clear, but low levels of physical activity may amplify hedonic states and behavioural traits favouring overconsumption indirectly through increased body fat. More evidence is required to understand the interaction between physical activity, appetite control and diet composition on passive overconsumption and energy balance. Furthermore, potential moderators of appetite control along the spectrum of physical activity, such as body composition, sex, and type, intensity and timing of physical activity, remain to be fully understood. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders commonly characterised by verbal and non-verbal communication deficits, impaired social interaction and repetitive, stereotypic behaviours. The aetiology of ASD is most likely a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Epidemiological evidence suggests that prenatal vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased incidence of ASD. The overall aim of this study was to investigate prenatal vitamin D deficiency on ASD-related behavioural phenotypes in multiple inbred strains of mice. We included two commonly used inbred mouse strains (C57BL/6J and BALB/c) as well as inbred BTBR mice, which show ASD-related behaviours, such as excessive self-grooming, hyperlocomotion, social interaction deficits and altered communication. We also studied the effect of prenatal vitamin D deficiency in a fourth strain; an F1 cross of C57BL/6J x BTBR mice, which have a partial BTBR phenotype. To implement prenatal vitamin D deficiency, female mice were placed on vitamin D deplete diets for ten weeks, including mating and gestation, until littering, when all dams were switched to the control diet. Behavioural symptoms related to ASD were measured, including isolation-induced ultrasonic vocalisations to measure communication, the three-chambered social interaction task to observe social interaction, the open field test to examine hyperlocomotion, assessment of grooming and rearing behaviour and finally the active place avoidance task to observe spatial learning and memory in response to a mild foot shock. Prenatal vitamin D deficiency had a negative impact on preference for social novelty in C57BL/6J mice, despite similar vocalisation phenotypes, and prenatal vitamin D-deficient F1 mice were found to be hypolocomotive in the open field test yet performed better on the active place avoidance task. Despite clear differences between strains, there were no other consistent significant main effects of maternal diet on the behaviour of the offspring. Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated as a risk factor for ASD and these data show that there is greater variation between different inbred strains in ASD-related behaviour, suggesting that prenatal vitamin D deficiency is not sufficient to recapitulate an ASD phenotype in multiple inbred strains of mice. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Sexual ornaments contribute substantially to phenotypic diversity and it is particularly relevant to understand their evolution. Ornaments can assume the function of signals-of-quality that the choosy sex uses to evaluate potential mating partners. Often there are no obvious direct benefits and investment into mate choice is primarily rewarded by beneficial alleles that are inherited to the offspring. Inter-sexual communication via sexual ornaments requires honesty of the sexual signal, yet the question of what maintains honesty remains only partially solved. One solution is that honesty is maintained by trait expression being dependent on individual condition, since condition-dependent trait expression offers an effectively inexhaustible source of genetic variability. Here we test in the highly sexually dimorphic club-legged grasshopper Gomphocerus sibiricus if putative sexual ornaments, in particular the striking front-leg clubs, are more strongly affected by a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) immune challenge than putatively not sexually selected traits. Our results show overall little condition-dependent expression of morphological and song traits, with sexually selected traits exhibiting effects comparable to nonsexually selected traits (with the possible exception of stridulatory file length and syllable-to-pause ratio in advertisement songs). Interestingly, field observations of individuals of lethally parasitized individuals suggest that a very strong environmental challenge can specifically affect the expression of the front-leg clubs. The presence of 1% of males in natural populations with missing or heavily deformed clubs plus 5% with minor club deformations furthermore indicate that there are risks associated with club development during final ecdysis and this might act as a filter against deleterious alleles. © 2017 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences},

abstract={Evidence is growing on the ability of anurans to make immediate call adjustments in response to the propagation properties of the environment. However, our understanding of such flexibility is typically based on dichotomous stimuli (i.e. presence/absence), while its condition-dependence has been little explored. We experimentally studied the ability of adjustment and its condition dependence of advertisement calls of Hypsiboas pulchellus in response to different levels of attenuation. Individuals modified most call parameters analyzed, although the direction of adjustments was contingent on individual identity, level of attenuation and trait category (i.e. spectral or temporal). Under low attenuation conditions males lengthened some call elements, partially supporting the hypothesis of plasticity oriented towards maintaining signal transmission, but this trend was not present in the high attenuation treatment. Also, under both attenuation treatments males gave higher frequency notes, as expected from an energy-saving response to changes in social environment or reducing attractiveness due to risk perception. Across treatments individuals in better condition tended to exhibit higher plasticity. These results indicate that call structure could depend on the integration of different cues such as habitat propagation characteristics, acoustic competition for females, and predation risk, while the ability to behave flexibly depends on current body reserves. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objective: The authors examined whether lamotrigine is a clinically effective and cost-effective treatment for people with borderline personality disorder. Method: This was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial. Between July 2013 and November 2016, the authors recruited 276 people age 18 or over who met diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder. Individuals with coexisting bipolar affective disorder or psychosis, those already taking a mood stabilizer, and women at risk of pregnancy were excluded. A web-based randomization service was used to allocate participants randomly in a 1:1 ratio to receive either an inert placebo or up to 400 mg/day of lamotrigine. The primary outcome measure was score on the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD) at 52 weeks. Secondary outcome measures included depressive symptoms, deliberate self-harm, social functioning, health-related quality of life, resource use and costs, side effects of treatment, and adverse events. Results: A total of 195 (70.6%) participants were followed up at 52 weeks, at which point 49 (36%) of those in the lamotrigine group and 58 (42%) of those in the placebo group were taking study medication. The mean ZAN-BPD score was 11.3 (SD=6.6) among those in the lamotrigine group and 11.5 (SD=7.7) among those in the placebo group (adjusted difference in means=0.1, 95% CI=21.8, 2.0). There was no evidence of any differences in secondary outcomes. Costs of direct care were similar in the two groups. Conclusions: The results suggest that treating people with borderline personality disorder with lamotrigine is not a clinically effective or cost-effective use of resources. © 2018 American Psychiatric Association.

There have already been some attempts within the literature to conceptualize the multidimensional construct of food personality, and some outcomes of food personality have also been studied. However, we have limited knowledge of the psychological antecedents of food personality. In this short communication, using survey data from 1006 Turkish consumers, we conduct an exploratory study of the distal and proximal predictors (i.e. psychological traits and other individual differences stemming from traits) of one dimension of food personality, namely food neophilia. Our findings suggest that promotion focus and materialism are proximal predictors of food neophilia, and openness to experience, extraversion, need for cognition and need for touch are distal predictors that have indirect effects on food neophilia through promotion focus and materialism. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This study investigates how group size of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) changes temporally, spatially, and/or with predominant behavior at two discreet sites along the Eastern Cape coastline of South Africa: Algoa Bay and the Wild Coast. The mean group size of bottlenose dolphins was large with an average of 52 animals. Significantly larger groups were observed in Algoa Bay ((Formula presented.) = 60, range = 1–600) than off the Wild Coast ((Formula presented.) = 32.9, range = 1–250). In Algoa Bay, the mean group size increased significantly over the study period, from an average 18 animals in 2008 to 76 animals in 2016. Additionally, the largest average and maximum group sizes ever reported both in South Africa and worldwide, were recorded in Algoa Bay (maximum group size = 600). Neither season nor behavior had a significant effect on mean group size at both sites. Similarly environmental variables such as the depth and substrate type also had no influence on group size. It remains unclear which ecological drivers, such as predation risk and food availability, are leading to the large groups observed in this area, and further research on abundance and distribution of both predators and prey is necessary. © 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy},

abstract={Studies at small spatial scale are often fundamental to highlight the behavioural plasticity of a species and thus have important implications for conservation planning, in particular for species usually considered as habitat specialists. We investigated second-order habitat selection of the European pine marten in an area dominated by deciduous oak forest and open fields in central Italy, by radio-tracking 16 pine martens (eight males, eight females). Pine martens placed home ranges in areas with more open field than in the study area, whereas woodland (oak and conifer forests) comprised a smaller portion of the home range than predominant forest character of the studied area. Although the presence of the species in the open habitats has been documented, to our knowledge, our results provide the first evidence of home range establishment in this cover type by pine marten at population level. The combination of low predation risk and high availability of resources could allow pine martens to occupy open fields in our study area. We highlighted different individual strategies of habitat selection, with some individuals placing home ranges in areas with high forest coverage while others occupying open areas. We found no effects of sex and body condition on habitat selection, and this could indicate that in the study area, both forested and non-forested cover types, such as open fields, shrub and anthropic areas, can provide adequate food, overhead cover and resting sites for all individuals. Pine marten ability to occupy open fields seems thus more related to the behavioural flexibility of the species, rather than to the need to supplement dens and forage from complementary lower quality habitat. The high quality of the Mediterranean continental area studied could also explain the selection of open areas by the pine marten. Our results offer useful information on pine marten ecology and may be helpful for conservation management of this species in southern Europe. © 2018, Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Białowieża, Poland.},

abstract={An organism's life history strategy is made up of a suite of physiological, behavioral, and ecological traits, which vary at both the interspecific and intraspecific levels in accordance with selective pressures operating on individuals. For birds, 2 primary ecological factors have been proposed to explain intraspecific and interspecific variation in nestling growth: nest predation and food availability. Individual nestling growth rates have important consequences for overall fitness because growth speed could influence subsequent reproductive performance and survival. We studied the relationship between ecological factors (i.e. precipitation level and predation rate) and nestling growth patterns of 2 New World flycatcher species (Tyrannidae) of the genus Tyrannus (Fork-Tailed Flycatcher T. savana and Scissor-Tailed Flycatcher T. forficatus) breeding at south-And north-Temperate latitudes. We tested the hypothesis that nestling growth rates are driven by nest predation rates and predicted that nestling growth rates would be higher in species experiencing higher nest predation rates. We also tested the hypothesis that nestling growth rates are related to precipitation levels (a proxy for food abundance) and predicted that nestling growth rates would be higher at sites with higher precipitation levels. Growth rate was not associated with predation rate, but it varied with precipitation level, with faster nestling growth rates during wet years for the Scissor-Tailed Flycatcher living at north-Temperate latitudes. Among species, similar growth rates were found during wet years. These results indicate that, at least as proximate causes, precipitation explains intraspecific and interspecific growth rate variation in Tyrannus species to a larger degree than predation. Additionally, the variation in growth rate we observed between wet and dry years indicates a high level of plasticity in growth rate in this group of insectivorous birds. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={The expression of alternative reproductive tactics can be plastic and occur simultaneously depending on cues that vary spatially or temporally. For example, variation in resources and sexual selection intensity is expected to influence the pay-off of each tactic and shape the decision of which tactic to employ. Males of the nuptial gift-giving spider Pisaura mirabilis can adopt three tactics: offering a genuine prey gift, a ‘worthless’ non-nutritious gift or no gift. We hypothesized that resources and/or male body condition, and mating opportunity and sexual selection intensity, vary over the course of the mating season to shape the co-existence of alternative traits. We measured these variables in the field over two seasons, to investigate the predictions that as the mating season progresses, (i) males become more likely to employ a gift-giving tactic, and (ii) the likelihood of switching from worthless to genuine gifts increases. Prey availability increased over the season and co-varied with the propensity of males to employ the gift-giving tactic, but we found no support for condition-dependent gift giving. Males responded to an increase in female availability by increasing their mating effort (gift production). Furthermore, the frequency of genuine gift use increased with sexual selection intensity, consistent with the assumption that sperm competition intensity increases with time. Our results suggest that the frequency of alternative tactics is shaped by seasonal changes in ecological factors and sexual selection. This leads to relaxed selection for the gift-giving tactic early in the season when females are less choosy and resources more scarce, and increased selection for genuine gifts later in the season driven by mating opportunity and risk of sperm competition. © 2018 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

abstract={Wildlife and humans are increasingly competing for resources worldwide, and a diverse, innovative, and effective set of management tools is needed. Controlling abundance of wildlife species that are simultaneously protected, abundant, competitive for resources, and in conflict with some stakeholders but beloved by others, is a daunting challenge. Free-ranging horses (Equus caballus) present such a conundrum and managers struggle for effective tools for regulating their abundance. Controlling reproduction of female horses presents a potential alternative. During 2009–2017, we determined the long-term effectiveness of GnRH vaccine (GonaCon-Equine) both as a single immunization and subsequent reimmunization on reproduction and side effects in free-ranging horses. At a scheduled management roundup in 2009, we randomly assigned 57 adult mares to either a GonaCon-Equine treatment group (n = 29) or a saline control group (n = 28). In a second roundup in 2013, we administered a booster vaccination to these same mares. We used annual ground observations to estimate foaling proportions, social behaviors, body condition, and injection site reactions. We found this vaccine to be safe for pregnant females and neonates, with no overt deleterious behavioral side effects during the breeding season. The proportion of treated mares that foaled following a single vaccination was lower than that for control mares for the second (P = 0.03) and third (P = 0.08) post-treatment foaling seasons but was similar (P = 0.67) to untreated mares for the fourth season, demonstrating reversibility of the primary vaccine treatment. After two vaccinations, however, the proportion of females giving birth was lower (P 0.001) than that for control mares for three consecutive years and ranged from 0.0–0.16. The only detectable adverse side effect of vaccination was intramuscular swelling at the vaccination site. Regardless of vaccine treatment (primary/secondary), approximately 62% (34/55) of immunized mares revealed a visible reaction at the vaccine injection site. However, none of these mares displayed any evidence of lameness, altered gait or abnormal range of movement throughout the 8 years they were observed in this study. Our research suggests that practical application of this vaccine in feral horses will require an initial inoculation that may provide only modest suppression of fertility followed by reimmunization that together could result in greater reduction in population growth rates over time.

abstract={Oral processing behaviours associated with faster eating rates have been consistently linked to increased energy intakes, but little is known about their links to children's appetitive traits. This study used the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ) to explore cross-sectional and prospective associations between parent-reported appetitive traits and observed oral processing behaviours. Participants were 195 children from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes cohort, who participated in a video-recorded ad libitum lunch at 4.5 (Time 1) and 6 years (Time 2). Their mothers completed the CEBQ around the same time points. Children's bites, chews and swallows were coded, and used to calculate their eating rate, bite size, chews per bite, chew rate, oral exposure time and oral exposure per bite. At Time 1, children with higher scores in slowness in eating had lower eating and chew rates. At Time 2, higher scores for food enjoyment and lower for satiety responsiveness, slowness in eating, and food fussiness were linked with higher eating rates and greater energy intakes (r > 0.16, p < 0.05). Post-hoc analyses revealed that these associations were moderated by BMI and only present among children with higher BMI. Faster eating rates mediated the associations between greater food enjoyment, lower slowness in eating, lower food fussiness and higher intakes of energy. Children with higher slowness in eating scores had lower increases in eating rates over time, and children with higher BMI who had greater food enjoyment and food responsiveness scores had greater increases in eating rates over time. The findings suggest that oral processing behaviours linked with increased obesity risk may be underpinned by appetitive traits and may be one of the behavioural pathways through which these appetitive traits influence energy intakes. © 2018},

abstract={Energy availability (EA) is a scientific concept describing how much energy is available for basic metabolic functions such as reproduction, immunity, and skeletal homeostasis. Carefully controlled studies on women have shown pathological effects of EA < 30 kcal/kg fat-free mass (FFM), and this state has been labeled low EA (LEA). Bodybuilding is a sport in which athletes compete to show muscular definition, symmetry, and low body fat (BF). The process of contest preparation in bodybuilding includes months of underfeeding, thus increasing the risk of LEA and its negative health consequences. As no well-controlled studies have been conducted in natural male bodybuilders on effects of LEA, the aim of this review was to summarize what can be extrapolated from previous relevant research findings in which EA can be calculated. The reviewed literature indicates that a prolonged EA < 25 kcal/kg FFM results in muscle loss, hormonal imbalances, psychological problems, and negatively affects the cardiovascular system when approaching the lower limits of BF (∼4%C5%) among males. Case studies on natural male bodybuilders who prepare for contest show muscle loss (>40% of total weight loss) with EA < 20 kcal/kg FFM, and in the study with the lowest observed BF (∼4 kg), major mood disturbance and hormonal imbalances co-occurred. Studies also underline the problem of BF overshoot during refeeding after extremes of LEA among males. A more tempered approach (EA > 25 kcal/kg FFM) might result in less muscle loss among natural male bodybuilders who prepare for contest, but more research is needed. © 2018 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

abstract={Who takes risks, and when? The relative state model proposes two nonindependent selection pressures governing risk-taking: need-based and ability-based. The need-based account suggests that actors take risks when they cannot reach target states with low-risk options (consistent with risk-sensitivity theory). The ability-based account suggests that actors engage in risk-taking when they possess traits or abilities that increase the expected value of risk-taking (by increasing the probability of success, enhancing payoffs for success or buffering against failure). Adaptive risk-taking involves integrating both considerations. Risk-takers compute the expected value of risk-taking based on their state—the interaction of embodied capital relative to one’s situation, to the same individual in other circumstances or to other individuals. We provide mathematical support for this dual pathway model, and show that it can predict who will take the most risks and when (e.g. when risk-taking will be performed by those in good, poor, intermediate or extreme state only). Results confirm and elaborate on the initial verbal model of state-dependent risk-taking: selection favours agents who calibrate risk-taking based on implicit computations of condition and/or competitive (dis)advantage, which in turn drives patterned individual differences in risk-taking behaviour. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Previous studies suggest that immune-challenged individuals need to allocate resources to the immune system to combat infection, reducing escape ability and increasing the vulnerability of infected individuals to predators. Such behavioural responses might change in anthropogenic habitats where the balance between predation risk and countering infections can differ from that in natural habitats. We experimentally explored whether fighting an infection has an effect on hiding behaviour in a frog (Pelophylax perezi), and whether frogs from urban ponds respond differently from those from natural forested ponds. Independently of habitat type, we found no evidence for changes in hiding behaviour of male frogs before and after they were immune challenged (injected with lipopolysaccharide) or not (injected with phosphate-buffered saline). We also explored whether immune response (phytohaemagglutinin assay) or morphological traits (head width, body condition, body size and length) were related to variation in hiding time, but we did not find a relationship between the measured traits and behavioural response for males from either habitat. In conclusion, we show that frog anti-predator behaviour is not always affected by an immune challenge and the effect of urban habitats can be weaker than expected, at least in species that could be pre-adapted to the novel environmental conditions. © 2018 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract={Overt parental restriction of food has previously been associated with child weight; however, most research has relied on self-reported feeding behaviour, or observations which give little opportunity to observe restriction of food. Using a novel lab-based observational technique to increase the opportunity to observe maternal feeding restriction, we explored the relationships between maternal restriction, child responses to restriction and child temperament with child body mass index (BMI) Z-scores over time. Sixty-two mother child dyads were recruited to the study when their children were aged 3-5 years and were followed up 2 years later (N = 39 dyads). Families were observed during a feeding interaction in the laboratory where cookies were offered with the main meal to increase the opportunity for maternal restriction of food. Feeding observations were coded and child temperament and BMI were measured. Controlling for current child BMI Z-scores, greater maternal verbal and physical restriction of food at 3-5 years was related to higher child BMI Z-scores at 5-7 years. More emotional children were less likely to experience restriction and less likely to accept attempts to restrict their food intake. Further research should consider children’s reactions to parental feeding behaviours in greater depth and explore how feeding practices interact with child temperament in the prediction of changes in child weight. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={Feeding is a complex motivated behavior controlled by a distributed neural network that processes sensory information to generate adaptive behavioral responses. Accordingly, studies using appetitive Pavlovian conditioning confirm that environmental cues that are associated with food availability can induce feeding even in satiated subjects. However, in mice, appetitive conditioning generally requires intensive training and thus can impede molecular studies that often require large numbers of animals. To address this, we developed and validated a simple and rapid context-induced feeding (Ctx-IF) task in which cues associated with food availability can later lead to increased food consumption in sated mice. We show that the associated increase in food consumption is driven by both positive and negative reinforcement and that spaced training is more effective than massed training. Ctx-IF can be completed in ~1 week and provides an opportunity to study the molecular mechanisms and circuitry underlying non-homeostatic eating. We have used this paradigm to map brain regions that are activated during Ctx-IF with cFos immunohistochemistry and found that the insular cortex, and other regions, are activated following exposure to cues denoting the availability of food. Finally, we show that inhibition of the insular cortex using GABA agonists impairs performance of the task. Our findings provide a novel assay in mice for defining the functional neuroanatomy of appetitive conditioning and identify specific brain regions that are activated during the development of learned behaviors that impact food consumption. © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature},

abstract={Abstract: Inducible behavioral defenses against predators, and how environmental factors mediate such responses, have been the focus of behavioral ecological research for decades. However, results often remained contradictory, perhaps because the ontogenetic context was ignored. Here, we investigated how antipredator behavioral responses of common toad (Bufo bufo) tadpoles are affected by food limitation and how the mediated responses changed during larval development. We raised tadpoles in the presence or absence of chemical cues indicating predation risk, combined with low or high food levels, and repeatedly monitored tadpole activity and visibility. We found that the presence of cues indicating predation risk and resource availability interactively affected visibility, but not relative activity, and this interactive effect changed with time over the larval period. Visibility of tadpoles decreased with time but to a greater extent when tadpoles were exposed to cues indicating predation risk compared to control groups, and this difference was more expressed when food was limited. Activity of tadpoles also decreased during larval development but to a greater extent in case of tadpoles raised in resource-limited environment compared to the other treatments. Also, activity of tadpoles was higher when food was scarce; however, the magnitude of this effect was not influenced by the predator-cue treatment. Thus, in addition to describing the trajectories of ontogenetic changes in tadpole behavior, our study also demonstrated that responses to environmental factors, such as predation threat and food availability, vary with age. Significance statement: Antipredator behavior is a common phenomenon in nature, and its expression is known to be influenced by the amount of available resources. How such defensive responses change with age, however, has been studied barely. By repeatedly observing common toad (Bufo bufo) tadpoles exposed to predators and/or food limitation, we found that tadpoles’ activity and visibility decreased with age and did so to a greater extent when tadpoles were exposed to chemical cues indicating predation risk compared to control groups. Our study demonstrated how responses to environmental factors, such as predation threat and food availability, vary with age in an important amphibian model species. These results draw attention to the importance of considering age when studying behavioral responses to environmental change and provide a possible explanation for some inconsistencies in the relevant literature. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The ideal free distribution assumes that animals select habitats that are beneficial to their fitness. When the needs of dependent offspring differ from those of the parent, ideal habitat selection patterns could vary with the presence or absence of offspring. We test whether habitat selection depends on reproductive state due to top-down or bottom-up influences on the fitness of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), a threatened, wide-ranging herbivore. We combined established methods of fitting resource and step selection functions derived from locations of collared animals in Ontario with newer techniques, including identifying calf status from video collar footage and seasonal habitat selection analysis through latent selection difference functions. We found that females with calves avoided predation risk and proximity to roads more strongly than females without calves within their seasonal ranges. At the local scale, females with calves avoided predation more strongly than females without calves. Females with calves increased predation avoidance but not selection for food availability upon calving, whereas females without calves increased selection for food availability across the same season. These behavioral responses suggest that habitat selection by woodland caribou is influenced by reproductive state, such that females with calves at heel use habitat selection to offset the increased vulnerability of their offspring to predation risk. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={BACKGROUND: An understanding of the causes and consequences of dispersal is vital for managing populations. Environmental contaminants, such as pesticides, provide potential environmental context-dependent stimuli for dispersal of targeted and non-targeted species, which may occur not only for active but also for passive dispersal, although such a possibility is frequently neglected. Here, we assessed the potential of food deprivation and acaricides to interfere with the take-off for passive (wind) dispersal of the predatory mite Neoseiulus baraki. RESULTS: Wind tunnel bioassays indicated that starvation favoured the take-off for wind dispersal by the mite predator, which also varied with wind velocity, and dispersal increased at higher velocities within the 1–7 (m s−1) range tested. For the acaricides tested, particularly the biopesticide azadirachtin but also abamectin and fenpyroximate, the rate of predator take-off for dispersal increased, and further increased with wind velocity up to 7 m/s. Such responses were associated with changes in the predator behavioural preparation for wind-mediated passive dispersal, with a greater incidence of the standing posture that permitted take-off. CONCLUSION: The rate of take-off for passive dispersal by N. baraki increased with food deprivation and exposure to the residues of agricultural acaricides. Azadirachtin exposure resulted in a particularly strong response, although abamectin and fenpyroximate also stimulated dispersal. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

abstract={Wild primates that live in urban areas face extreme threats that are less frequent in nonurban fragments, such as the presence of dangerous matrix elements (e.g., roads, power lines, buildings, and a high density of domestic dogs near food patches), that could influence their movements, feeding behavior, and survival. However, the scarcity of studies addressing this issue hinders our understanding of the behavioral adjustments that favor the survival of primates in urban areas. For 12 months, we studied a six-individual group of brown howlers (Alouatta guariba clamitans) in an urban fragment to determine (i) their diet richness and its relationships with food availability, (ii) their daily path length (DPL) and the matrix elements used during movement, and (iii) the main ecological drivers of the DPL. Sampling effort totaled 72 days, 787 hr, and 3,224 instantaneous scans. We found that the diet of brown howlers contained 35 plant species (including seven cultivated crops) belonging to 33 genera and 21 families. The consumption of fruits and young leaves was directly related to their temporal availability. The average DPL (446 m) was smaller than that reported for groups of howlers inhabiting large nonurban fragments. To move between food patches, animals used three main matrix elements: trees, power lines, and roofs. The number of plant species used during the day was the main driver of DPL. Our findings highlighted that the generalist-opportunistic diet of brown howlers and their ability to move across the anthropogenic matrix using artificial elements such as power lines, roofs, and wildlife crossings represent a remarkable part of their behavioral repertory in Lami. However, there are potential costs associated with these strategies, namely, electrocution and predation by domestic dogs. Thus, it is urgent to further investigate how these behaviors could affect the long-term survival of these animals. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Prey responses to predation risk can affect multiple phenotypic traits that have significant implications for population-to-ecosystem-level properties. The general stress paradigm (hereafter GSP) proposes integrating the principles of ecological stoichiometry and prey physiological plasticity in response to predation risk to provide an explicit mechanistic framework to evaluate the direct influence of predation risk on ecosystem functioning. However, theoretical attempts evaluating the GSP have focused on only one component of phenotypic plasticity, neglecting the fact that multiple phenotypic responses can affect nutrient demand and consumption, and therefore, the overall animal effect on nutrient cycling rates and stoichiometry. In this study, we used a dynamic state variable model to examine how variation in predation and starvation risk on a landscape of patch types that vary in food quality affects the behavioural and physiological phenotypic responses of prey and the linked nutrient and carbon recycling. We found that the stress imposed by predation risk promotes prey carbon limitation, which leads to increased nutrient release and carbon uptake due to a stoichiometric mismatch between an animal's demand and food stoichiometry. Such effects can be altered by prey shifting spatially to carbon- or nutrient-rich patches. However, the abilities of prey to cope with new physiological demands can be affected by absolute stress level or the predation risk distribution on a spatially implicit landscape of stoichiometric-divergent patch type availability. Overall, starvation risk can act as a selective force favouring individuals that maximize their growth, thus reducing their nutrient release, but increasing their exposure to predation risk. Our results provide an important connection between predator-induced stress ecology and ecosystem functioning, linking organism nutrition and ecological stoichiometry to fitness outcomes, thus improving our understanding of how non-consumptive predator effects can scale up to ecosystems.

abstract={Around cities, natural wetlands are rapidly being destroyed and replaced with wetlands constructed to treat stormwater. Although the intended purpose of these wetlands is to manage urban stormwater, they are inhabited by wildlife that might be exposed to contaminants. These effects will be exacerbated if animals are unable to differentiate between stormwater treatment wetlands of varying quality and some function as “ecological traps” (i.e., habitats that animals prefer despite fitness being lower than in other habitats). To examine if urban stormwater wetlands can be ecological traps for frogs, we tested if survival, metamorphosis-related measures, and predator avoidance behaviors of frogs differed within mesocosms that simulated stormwater wetlands with different contaminant levels, and paired this with a natural oviposition experiment to assess breeding-site preferences. We provide the first empirical evidence that these wetlands can function as ecological traps for frogs. Tadpoles had lower survival and were less responsive to predator olfactory cues when raised in more polluted stormwater wetlands, but also reached metamorphosis earlier and at a larger size. A greater size at metamorphosis was likely a result of increased per capita food availability due to higher mortality combined with eutrophication, although other compensatory effects such as selective-mortality removing smaller individuals from low-quality mesocosms may also explain these results. Breeding adults laid comparable numbers of eggs across wetlands with high and low contaminant levels, indicating no avoidance of the former. Since stormwater treatment wetlands are often the only available aquatic habitat in urban landscapes we need to better understand how they perform as habitats to guide management decisions that mitigate their potential ecological costs. This may include improving wetland quality so that fitness is no longer compromised, preventing colonization by animals, altering the cues animals use when selecting habitats, pretreating contaminated water prior to release, providing off-line wetlands nearby, or simply not constructing stormwater treatment wetlands in sensitive areas. Our study confirms the potential for urban stormwater treatment wetlands to function as ecological traps and highlights the need for greater awareness of their prevalence and impact at landscape scales. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America},

abstract={Although shell colour polymorphism of the land snail Cepaea nemoralis is a well-known phenomenon, proximate and ultimate factors driving its evolution remain uncertain. Polymorphic species show variation in behavioural responses to selective forces. Therefore, we estimated effects of various environmental factors (temperature, humidity, food availability, (micro)habitat structure and predatory pressure) on behavioural response (frequency of locomotion, climbing and hiding) of C. nemoralis morphs, in experimental and natural conditions. In the experimental part of study, the frequency of locomotion was negatively affected by temperature and the presence of food and positively influenced by the presence of light. Morphs significantly differed in behavioural responses to environmental variability. Pink mid-banded and yellow five-banded morphs climbed less often and hide in shelter more often than yellow and pink unbanded individuals when temperature was low and food was absent. Snails fed most often at moderate temperature compared to low and high temperatures. Field investigations partially confirmed differences among morphs in frequency of climbing, but not in terms of probability of hiding in sheltered sites. In natural colonies, temperature and (micro)habitat structure significantly affected frequency of climbing as well as hiding in shelter. Snails more often hid in sheltered sites where thrushes preyed on Cepaea. Tendency of unbanded morphs to climb trees may have evolved under avian predatory pressure as thrushes forage on a ground. Tendency of banded morphs to hide in sheltered sites may reflect prey preferences for cryptic background. The results implicate that differential behaviour of C. nemoralis morphs compensate for their morphological and physiological limitations of adaptation to habitat. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={Animal ‘personality’, the phenomenon of consistent individual differences in behaviour within populations, has been documented widely, yet its functional significance and the reasons for its persistence remain unclear. One possibility is that among-individual behavioural variation is linked to fitness-determining traits via effects on resource acquisition. In this study, we tested this idea, using rockpool prawns, Palaemon elegans, to test for a correlation between ‘high-risk exploration’ and the ability to monopolize a limited resource. Modified open field trials (OFTs) confirmed that consistent among-individual (co)variation in high-risk exploratory behaviours does exist in this species, and multivariate analysis showed trait variation is consistent with a major axis of personality variation. Subsequent feeding trials in size-matched groups where competition was possible revealed a high repeatability of feeding duration, used here as a proxy for RHP (resource-holding potential). We found significant negative correlations between feeding duration and two ‘risky’ behaviours, such that individuals that took fewer risks fed more. Our results are not consistent with the widely hypothesized idea of a ‘proactive syndrome’ in which bolder, risk-taking personalities are positively associated with RHP. Rather they suggest the possibility of a trade-off, with some individuals successful at monopolizing limited, high-value resources, while others are more willing to engage in potentially risky exploration (which may increase the likelihood of encountering novel resource patches). We speculate that alternative strategies for acquiring limited resources might thereby contribute to the maintenance of personality variation observed in wild populations. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Regret can be defined as the subjective experience of recognizing that one has made a mistake and that a better alternative could have been selected. The experience of regret is thought to carry negative utility. This typically takes two distinct forms: augmenting immediate postregret valuations to make up for losses, and augmenting long-term changes in decision-making strategies to avoid future instances of regret altogether. While the short-term changes in valuation have been studied in human psychology, economics, neuroscience, and even recently in nonhuman-primate and rodent neurophysiology, the latter long-term process has received far less attention, with no reports of regret avoidance in nonhuman decision-making paradigms. We trained 31 mice in a novel variant of the Restaurant Row economic decision-making task, in which mice make decisions of whether to spend time from a limited budget to achieve food rewards of varying costs (delays). Importantly, we tested mice longitudinally for 70 consecutive days, during which the task provided their only source of food. Thus, decision strategies were interdependent across both trials and days. We separated principal commitment decisions from secondary reevaluation decisions across space and time and found evidence for regret-like behaviors following change-of-mind decisions that corrected prior economically disadvantageous choices. Immediately following change-of-mind events, subsequent decisions appeared to make up for lost effort by altering willingness to wait, decision speed, and pellet consumption speed, consistent with past reports of regret in rodents. As mice were exposed to an increasingly reward-scarce environment, we found they adapted and refined distinct economic decision-making strategies over the course of weeks to maximize reinforcement rate. However, we also found that even without changes in reinforcement rate, mice transitioned from an early strategy rooted in foraging to a strategy rooted in deliberation and planning that prevented future regret-inducing change-of-mind episodes from occurring. These data suggest that mice are learning to avoid future regret, independent of and separate from reinforcement rate maximization. © 2018 Sweis et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/},

abstract={Animal behaviour is increasingly seen as an important component in maintaining functional connectivity between patches in fragmented landscapes. However, models that explicitly incorporate behavioural trade-offs are rarely applied to landscape planning problems like connectivity. The aim of this study was to explore how state-dependent behaviour influenced functional connectivity between patches from a theoretical perspective. We investigated how inter-patch distances influenced functional connectivity using a dynamic state variable model framework. The decision making process of an individual ruminant facing fitness trade-offs in staying in its patch of origin or moving to another patch at various distances were explicitly modelled. We incorporated energetic costs and predation costs of feeding, ruminating, and resting while in the patch and for transit between patches based on inter-patch distance. Functional connectivity was maintained with isolated patches when they offered high intake and the inactivity of rumination associated with rapid gut fill resulted in reduced predation risk. Nevertheless, individuals in high energetic state often would forgo moving to another patch, whereas individuals in poor energetic states were forced to accept the cost of movement to best meet their requirements in the distant patch. The inclusion of state-dependent behavioural models provides important insights into functional connectivity in fragmented landscapes and helps integrate animal behaviour into landscape planning. We discuss the consequences of our findings for landscape planning to show how the approach provides a heuristic tool to assess alternative scenarios for restoring landscape functional connectivity. © 2018 Visscher, Merrill.

abstract={Background & objectives: Attractin, is a large multi-domain protein which has regulatory functions in multiple physiological processes and thus have strong therapeutic potential. In invertebrates, it was first identified as a water-borne protein pheromone that plays important role in chemical communication and coordinates reproductive activities. But its role in mosquitoes/insects remains unknown. Our unexpected discovery of attractin homolog from the olfactory tissue of Anopheles culicifacies mosquito prompted us to investigate the possible role of Ac-attractin (Ac-atrn) in diverse behavioural responses, e.g. feeding, mating and other non-genetic stresses. Methods: A homology search analysis was performed to identify the full length attractin (Ac-atrn) gene of Anopheles culicifacies mosquito. To unravel its molecular function during external and internal stresses, extensive real-time PCR was performed in the neuro-olfactory tissues of the adult mosquitoes as well as in the larval stages. Further, a behavioural assay was conducted to elucidate its role in mosquitoes mating behaviour. Results: The results indicated that Ac-atrn is a 3942 bp long transcript which encodes a 1313 amino acid protein, having multiple domains including CUB, EGF, Keltch, etc, with 80-90% homology to other insect/mosquito homologs. Ac-atrn gene was dominantly expressed in the young larvae and its expression was elevated in response to the fresh food supply in the starved larvae. Cold stress temporarily arrested the expression of Ac-atrn gene. In case of adult mosquitoes, olfactory and brain tissue showed relatively higher expression of Ac-atrn than reproductive organs. Although, starvation did not yield significant changes in olfactory tissues, but aging and nutritional stress modulated Ac-atrn expression in the brain tissue. Furthermore, a circadian rhythm dependent change in the expression of Ac-atrn of virgin and mated mosquitoes (both sexes), indicates that Ac-atrn might also have a pheromone guided role during swarm formation and mating behaviour. Interpretation & conclusion: The relative expression profiling of Ac-atrn gene in the larvae during nutritional and cold stress suggested its possible role in mediating chemical communication towards the food source and in thermal regulation of young larvae. Similarly, it might have crucial regulatory role in the stress management and survival of adult mosquitoes. The results revealed that Ac-atrn gene is a global regulator of many physiological processes in mosquitoes including stress response and mating behaviour and thus might be a potential target to design novel intervention strategy against mosquitoes. © 2018 Malaria Research Center.

abstract={PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Obesity rates in the USA have reached pandemic levels with one third of the population with obesity in 2015-2016 (39.8% of adults and 18.5% of youth). It is a major public health concern, and it is prudent to understand the factors which contribute. Racial and ethnic disparities are pronounced in both the prevalence and treatment of obesity and must be addressed in the efforts to combat obesity.
RECENT FINDINGS: Disparities in prevalence of obesity in racial/ethnic minorities are apparent as early as the preschool years and factors including genetics, diet, physical activity, psychological factors, stress, income, and discrimination, among others, must be taken into consideration. A multidisciplinary team optimizes lifestyle and behavioral interventions, pharmacologic therapy, and access to bariatric surgery to develop the most beneficial and equitable treatment plans. The reviewed studies outline disparities that exist and the impact that race/ethnicity have on disease prevalence and treatment response. Higher prevalence and reduced treatment response to lifestyle, behavior, pharmacotherapy, and surgery, are observed in racial and ethnic minorities. Increased research, diagnosis, and access to treatment in the pediatric and adult populations of racial and ethnic minorities are proposed to combat the burgeoning obesity epidemic and to prevent increasing disparity.},

abstract={Considering that obesity is one of the leading risks for death worldwide, it should be noted that a brain-related mechanism is involved in AngII-induced and AT1-receptor-dependent weight loss. It is moreover established that activation of the Ang(1–7)/ACE2/Mas axis reduces weight, but it remains unclear whether this Ang(1–7) effect is also mediated via a brain-related mechanism. Additionally to Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, we used TGR(ASrAOGEN) selectively lacking brain angiotensinogen, the precursor to AngII, as we speculated that effects are more pronounced in a model with low brain RAS activity. Rats were fed with high-calorie cafeteria diet. We investigated weight regulation, food behavior, and energy balance in response to chronic icv.-infusions of AngII (200 ng•h−1), or Ang(1–7) (200/600 ng•h−1) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid. High- but not low-dose Ang(1–7) slightly decreased weight gain and energy intake in SD rats. AngII showed an anti-obese efficacy in SD rats by decreasing energy intake and increasing energy expenditure and also improved glucose control. TGR(ASrAOGEN) were protected from developing obesity. However, Ang(1–7) did not reveal any effects in TGR(ASrAOGEN) and those of AngII were minor compared to SD rats. Our results emphasize that brain AngII is a key contributor for regulating energy homeostasis and weight in obesity by serving as a negative brain-related feedback signal to alleviate weight gain. Brain-related anti-obese potency of Ang(1–7) is lower than AngII but must be further investigated by using other transgenic models as TGR(ASrAOGEN) proved to be less valuable for answering this question. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={There has been increasing concern expressed about children’s food intakes and dietary patterns. These are closely linked to children’s appetitive traits (such as disinhibited eating and food fussiness/neophobia). Research has examined both biological and psychosocial correlates or predictors of these traits. There has been less focus on possible processes or mechanisms associated links biological and psychosocial factors. There is an absence of research that links biological and psychosocial factors. In the present article, we outline a model intended to facilitate theory and research on the development of appetitive traits. It is based on scholarship from developmental theory and research and incorporates biological factors such as genetic predispositions and temperament as well as psychosocial factors in terms of parent cognitions, feeding styles and feeding practices. Particular attention is directed to aspects such as emotional eating and feeding, self-regulation of energy intake, and non-shared family environments. We highlight the opportunity for longitudinal research that examines bidirectional, transactional and cascade processes and uses a developmental framework. The model provides a basis for connecting the biological foundations of appetitive traits to system-level analysis in the family. Knowledge generated through the application of the model should lead to more effective prevention and intervention initiatives. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Hedonic response is preserved in schizophrenia. However, it is unclear whether this is also true in individuals meeting criteria for “prodromal” psychosis, who are considered to be at symptomatic high risk for developing the disorder. In this study, we examined neurophysiological and self-reported response to emotional stimuli in UHR (n = 23) and healthy control (CN: n = 30) participants who passively viewed pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral images for 500 ms while the electroencephalogram was recorded and then provided self-reports of valence and arousal to the stimuli. The Late Positive Potential (LPP) event related potential (ERP) component was used as a neurophysiological marker of emotional reactivity. Results indicated that CN participants had higher LPP amplitude for pleasant and unpleasant compared to neutral stimuli; however, UHR youth displayed no differences in LPP amplitude among pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral stimuli. Self-report data mirrored neurophysiological data, as UHR youth had lower reports of positive emotion to pleasant stimuli and negative emotion to unpleasant stimuli compared to CN participants. Furthermore, the presence of a mood disorder diagnosis predicted reduced neurophysiological emotional reactivity in UHR youth. Findings suggest that youth at UHR for psychosis display diminished subjective and neurophysiological reactivity to emotional stimuli, and that symptoms of depression may result in diminished emotional reactivity. © 2017},

abstract={Objectives: The purpose of the current study is to directly compare a diet high in fat with a diet high in fructose. This side-by-side comparison will allow us to determine the physiological and behavioral effects resulting from the consumption of a diet dominated by one macronutrient. Methods: Rats were fed pelletized food containing either 60% fat or 55% fructose diet, or control chow (5.8% kcal of fat, 44.3% kcal carb) for 9 weeks. Animals performed a classic Morris Water Maze (MWM) and a reversal MWM to assess spatial and working memory near the end of the feeding period. At termination, tissue samples were collected including trunk blood, livers, fat pads, and brain punches. Results: Animals maintained on the high-fat diet weighed more by the end of the feeding period, had a higher percent body weight change and had higher fat pad weight than the high-fructose and control group. The high-fructose group had higher serum insulin levels than the high-fat group and higher total triglycerides than control or high-fat groups. Additionally, the high-fructose group entered the target quadrant significantly less than high-fat fed animals in the reverse MWM task. Discussion: These data suggest that fat accumulation and weight gain are influenced by the high-fat component of the Western-style diet. However, insulin resistance and elevated serum triglycerides are impacted more by high levels of fructose in the diet. Comparative data between a high-fat and high-fructose diet in a single study are novel and shed light on two of the individual components of a Western-style diet. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. However, therapeutic options treating only its symptoms are very disappointing. Therefore there is an ongoing search for compounds capable of tackling the multi-dimensional features of PD. Recently natural polyphenols have gained great interest as potential therapeutic agents. Herein, we have attempted to summarize results obtained in different animal models demonstrating their neuroprotective effects. The in vivo findings presented below are supported by human subject data and reports regarding the ability of polyphenols to cross the blood-brain barrier. The beneficial effects of polyphenols are demonstrated by the results of behavioral examinations, mainly related to motor and cognitive capabilities, histopathological and immunohistochemical examination concerning the protection of dopaminergic neurons, analyses of dopamine and the concentration of its metabolites, as well as mechanistic studies regarding the modulation of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, cellular iron management, proteinopathy, and additionally the regulation of signaling pathways. Importantly, data about brain distribution of the metabolic derivatives of the reviewed polyphenols are crucial for the justification of their nutritional intake in neuroprotective intervention, as well as for the identification of potential targets for a novel therapeutic approach to Parkinson’s disease. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={The amount, composition, and sources of nutrition support provided to preterm infants is critical for normal growth and development, and particularly for structural and functional neurodevelopment. Although omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), and particularly docosahexanoic acid (DHA), are considered of particular importance, results from clinical trials with preterm infants have been inconclusive because of ethical limitations and confounding variables. A translational large animal model is needed to understand the structural and functional responses to DHA. Neurodevelopment of preterm pigs was evaluated in response to feeding formulas to term-equivalent age supplemented with DHA attached to phosphatidylserine (PS-DHA) or sunflower oil as the placebo. Newborn term pigs were used as a control for normal in utero neurodevelopment. Supplementing formula with PS-DHA increased weight of the brain, and particularly the cerebellum, at term-equivalent age compared with placebo preterm pigs (P’s < 0.10 and 0.05 respectively), with a higher degree of myelination in all regions of the brain examined (all p < 0.06). Brains of pigs provided PS-DHA were similar in weight to newborn term pigs. Event-related brain potentials and performance in a novel object recognition test indicated the PS-DHA supplement accelerated development of sensory pathways and recognition memory compared with placebo preterm pigs. The PS-DHA did not increase weight gain, but was associated with higher survival. The benefits of PS-DHA include improving neurodevelopment and possibly improvement of survival, and justify further studies to define dose-response relations, compare benefits associated with other sources of DHA, and understand the mechanisms underlying the benefits and influences on the development of other tissues and organ systems. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={Background: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a fatal bile duct cancer associated with infection by the liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini, in the lower Mekong region. Numerous public health interventions have focused on reducing exposure to O. viverrini, but incidence of CCA in the region remains high. While this may indicate the inefficacy of public health interventions due to complex social and cultural factors, it may further indicate other risk factors or interactions with the parasite are important in pathogenesis of CCA. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of described risk factors for CCA in addition to O. viverrini to guide future integrative interventions. Main body: We searched five international and seven Thai research databases to identify studies relevant to risk factors for CCA in the lower Mekong region. Selected studies were assessed for risk of bias and quality in terms of study design, population, CCA diagnostic methods, and statistical methods. The final 18 included studies reported numerous risk factors which were grouped into behaviors, socioeconomics, diet, genetics, gender, immune response, other infections, and treatment for O. viverrini. Seventeen risk factors were reported by two or more studies and were assessed with random effects models during meta-analysis. This meta-analysis indicates that the combination of alcohol and smoking (OR=11.1, 95% CI: 5.63-21.92, P< 0.0001) is most significantly associated with increased risk for CCA and is an even greater risk factor than O. viverrini exposure. This analysis also suggests that family history of cancer, consumption of raw cyprinoid fish, consumption of high nitrate foods, and praziquantel treatment are associated with significantly increased risk. These risk factors may have complex relationships with the host, parasite, or pathogenesis of CCA, and many of these risk factors were found to interact with each other in one or more studies. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a complex variety of risk factors in addition to O. viverrini infection should be addressed in future public health interventions to reduce CCA in affected regions. In particular, smoking and alcohol use, dietary patterns, and socioeconomic factors should be considered when developing intervention programs to reduce CCA. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Preclinical pain assessments can be criticized for failing to adequately characterize the human clinical pain experience. Although recent assessments have improved upon this shortcoming, there are still significant limitations. One concern is that current procedures fail to examine underlying motivational drives related to pain. Therefore, we used a novel approach-avoidance paradigm that allowed a rat to either satisfy hunger or avoid noxious stimulation to reveal prioritizing of motivational drives. The operant paradigm utilized a single lever that the animal pressed for appetitive reward (approach). The lever press was associated with mechanical stimulation of an inflamed paw induced by subcutaneous injection of carrageenan (avoidance). The results revealed that carrageenan-injected animals had a significant suppression of lever pressing and, in addition, had a longer latency to approach and press a lever for appetitive reward. The pattern of operant behavioral responses indicates that the motivation to avoid pain superseded the motivation to alleviate hunger. Utilization of approach-avoidance paradigms, such as this one, can allow researchers to unravel the complexities of the pain experience with the goal of enhancing translation to clinical efficacy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Why are some individuals more prone to gamble than others? Animals often show preferences between 2 foraging options with the same mean reward but different degrees of variability in the reward, and such risk preferences vary between individuals. Previous attempts to explain variation in risk preference have focused on energy budgets, but with limited empirical support. Here, we consider whether biological ageing, which affects mortality and residual reproductive value, predicts risk preference. We studied a cohort of European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in which we had previously measured developmental erythrocyte telomere attrition, an established integrative biomarker of biological ageing. We measured the adult birds' preferences when choosing between a fixed amount of food and a variable amount with an equal mean. After controlling for change in body weight during the experiment (a proxy for energy budget), we found that birds that had undergone greater developmental telomere attrition were more risk averse as adults than were those whose telomeres had shortened less as nestlings. Developmental telomere attrition was a better predictor of adult risk preference than either juvenile telomere length or early-life food supply and begging effort. Our longitudinal study thus demonstrates that biological ageing, as measured via developmental telomere attrition, is an important source of lasting differences in adult risk preferences. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Although antisocial personality disorder (APD) is one of the most researched personality disorders, it is still surprisingly resistant to treatment. This lack of clinical progress may be partly due to the failure to view APD as a neurodevelopmental disorder and to consider early interventions. After first defining what constitutes a neurodevelopmental disorder, this review evaluates the extent to which APD meets neurodevelopmental criteria, covering structural and functional brain imaging, neurocognition, genetics and epigenetics, neurochemistry, and early health risk factors. Prevention and intervention strategies for APD are then outlined, focusing on addressing early biological and health systems, followed by forensic and clinical implications. It is argued both that APD meets criteria for consideration as a neurodevelopmental disorder and that consideration should be given both to the possibility that early onset conduct disorder is neurodevelopmental in nature, and also to the inclusion of psychopathy as a specifier in future Diagnostic and Statistical Manual revisions of APD. © Copyright 2018 by Annual Reviews.

abstract={The predation pressure and food availability to which individuals are exposed during their life histories shape inspection behaviour in animals. In this study, we aimed to test whether such behaviours varied with prior experience (predation, starvation or both treatments) or measurement condition (with or without the presence of a predator; here, the snakehead fish, Channa argus) in the fish species Spinibarbus sinensis, known as qingbo. Unexpectedly, prior predator experience showed no significant effect on inspection behaviour as demonstrated by either the frequency or the duration of each activity outside shelter or on cooperation as demonstrated by the inter-individual distance or synchronization of speed. This may have been due to the different adjustments in behaviour among individuals (more shelter use vs. more inspection), the predator treatment used in the present study (exposure to caged predator rather than direct predation) and/or a species-specific strategy in the qingbo. The starved fish displayed shorter inspection latency, increased inspection behaviour and greater cooperation when measured without the predator; however, when measured in the presence of the predator, the starved fish showed increased inspection frequency but shorter inspection duration, possibly due to the compromise between energy needs and predation risk. Similar to those of the predation group, the fish from the double-treated group showed no difference in inspection behaviour compared to the control group under the predator-absent condition, while the high-frequency, short-duration inspection behaviours remained the same as in the starved group. These findings suggested that the adjustment of inspection behaviour and related cooperation are rather complicated according to either predator experience or food deprivation, partially due to the inter-individual differences in behavioural adjustment and/or different environmental conditions. © 2018, Japan Ethological Society and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Conservation and research efforts occasionally rely upon bringing wild animals into human care to establish breeding programs and to understand their biology. Wild-caught birds may have husbandry requirements that differ from captive-reared animals due, in part, to their social development in the wild and potential exposure to novel pathogens. We developed husbandry techniques to minimize stress and monitor health in a population of wild-caught song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). We describe enclosure conditions, diet and enrichment, and best practices for stress reduction. In addition, we describe several health monitoring strategies, including assessing feces quality, body condition scores, and specific signs of infection. These techniques led to successful housing of song sparrows during formal behavioral and developmental studies. This information will be useful for guiding the husbandry of wild-caught passerine birds in the future. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Environmental enrichment is a tool used to promote the welfare and well-being of captive animals by encouraging the display of species-specific behaviors and reducing the stress or boredom induced by captive environments. Lemurs are highly endangered, yet few studies have analyzed the behavioral impacts of enrichment on captive populations. We studied the impacts of two novel enrichment devices on three lemur species (ring-tailed lemurs [Lemur catta], red-ruffed lemurs [Varecia rubra], and Coquerel's sifaka [Propithecus coquereli]) to determine both the overall and species-specific impacts of enrichment on lemur behavior. We recorded lemur behavior using the continuous sampling method to obtain behavior duration and analyzed our results using ANOVA Repeated Measures. Results showed enrichment effectiveness differed for each species and that different enrichment devices had varying impacts on lemur behavior across all species. We attributed the differences in species-specific responses to the unique locomotor patterns and methods of diet acquisition of each species, and the variances in behavioral responses across all species to the characteristics of each device. Our study highlights the importance of species-specific enrichment and encourages further research in this field in order to maximize the positive effects of enrichment, which in turn has the potential to affect the overall well-being of captive populations. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={The objective of this study was to find out whether a change from a grain-rich concentrated feed to a grain-free, fibre- and fat-enriched concentrated diet (FFD), leads to an improvement in gastric ulcers in horses. The experiment was conducted as a prospective experimental study. Thirty-four adult horses with gastric lesions - six mares and 28 geldings - fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this study. The average age was 11 ± 4 (mean±SD) years and the horses weighed between 358kg and 697kg. Twenty horses were fed the FFD, while 14 horses were controls (C) and received their usual concentrated feed. Each horse underwent gastroscopy twice, at an interval of eight weeks. An independent evaluation of the examination and the scoring of the lesions, using the Equine Gastric Ulcer Council 0-4 scoring system for equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS), was performed by an experienced gastroscopist. The horses with EGUS scores a 3 received additional omeprazole at the recommended dosage for 14 days. The horses of the FFD group were adapted to the new diet whereas the control group received their usual concentrate. In the control group, only the amounts of hay and concentrate were adjusted to the requirement of the respective horse. After the change of the ration, the starch intake (FFD 0.09 ± 0.05g/kg BW; C 1.38 ±0.62 g/kg BW) was significantly different. However, there was no difference concerning the hay intake (FFD 21.2±3.5g/kg BW/day; C 23.3±5.1 g/kg BW/day), the Ca intake (FFD 0.129±0.034g/kg BW/day; C 0.112±0.019g/kg BW/day), the Mg intake (FFD 0.042±0.009g/kg BW/day; C 0.042 ±0.011 g/kg BW/day) or the intake of the praecaecal digestible protein (FFD 1.42±0.38g/kg BW/day; C 1.58±0.39g/kg BW/day). The prevalence and severity of the mucosal lesions significantly decreased in the FFD group (p<0.001). No significant correlation between the EGUS and the other risk factors, such as workload, behaviour or typical symptoms was found in this study. The change of the concentrated feed to FFD improved the gastric ulcerations in both squamous and glandular mucosa. © 2018 Hippiatrika Verlagsgesellschaf. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Synthetic polycyclic musks, widely used as additives in personal care products, are present in both biotic and abiotic matrices of the aquatic environment at concentrations of ng/l to µg/l. Although they are determined at comparatively low concentrations, these levels are biologically relevant and pose a significant growing risk as stressors to aquatic organisms. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the effects of 28-day-long exposure to polycyclic musk tonalide in zebrafish juvenile stages (Danio rerio) using selected biomarkers. Environmentally relevant concentrations of tonalide caused significant changes in selected enzyme activities in the experimental groups exposed to the highest concentrations. The activity of glutathione S-transferase and lipid peroxidation increased significantly (p < 0.05) after exposure to the highest concentration (50,000 ng/l) compared with the control. A similar trend was observed in catalase activity; there was a significant increase (p < 0.05) after exposure to two highest concentrations of tonalide (5000 and 50,000 ng/l). In addition, a statistically significant decrease (p < 0.05) in glutathione reductase activity was found in the lowest test concentration of tonalide (50 ng/l). None of the tested concentrations resulted in histopathological changes in liver, kidney, skin, or gill. Furthermore, no effects on body weight, body length, specific growth rate, and behavior were observed. Our results showed that tonalide exposure induced profound changes in the activities of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes, such changes representing an adaptive response of the fish organism to tonalide toxicity. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Individuals frequently show long-term consistency in behaviour over their lifetimes, referred to as “personality.” Various models, revolving around the use of resources and how they are valued by individuals, attempt to explain the maintenance of these different behavioural types within a population, and evaluating them is the key for understanding the evolution of behavioural variation. The pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis suggests that differences in personalities result from divergent life-history strategies, with more active/risk-taking individuals reproducing rapidly but dying young. However, studies of wild animals provide only limited support for key elements of this and related hypotheses, such as a negative relationship between residual reproductive value and activity. Furthermore, alternative models make divergent predictions regarding the relationship between risk-taking behaviours and variables consistent in the short-term, such as condition. To test these predictions, we regularly measured willingness to leave a shelter and the activity level of wild adult field crickets (Gryllus campestris) at both short and long intervals over their entire adult lives. We found some support for a pace-of-life syndrome influencing personality, as lifespan was negatively related to willingness to leave the shelter and activity. Crickets did not appear to protect their “assets” however, as estimates of residual reproductive value were not related to behaviour. Although there was considerable variance attributed to the short-term consistency, neither trait was affected by phenotypic condition, failing to support either of the models we tested. Our study confirms that behaviours may covary with some life-history traits and highlights the scales of temporal consistency that are more difficult to explain. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Abstract: Animal personality and behavioral syndromes can have profound effects on individual fitness. Consequently, there is growing recognition that knowledge of these phenomena may assist with animal conservation. Here we review evidence for personality and behavioral syndromes in amphibians (the most threatened vertebrate class), critique experimental approaches, and explore whether knowledge in this domain might assist with endangered species management. Despite being a neglected field (research has spanned just 24 species), there is emerging evidence that frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts show personality and behavioral syndromes along three behavioral axes: boldness, exploration, and activity. Among vertebrates, amphibians are unique in having a biphasic lifecycle defined by metamorphosis and obvious transformations in morphology, physiology, and habitat use, characteristics that enable detailed examination of behavioral changes across life stages and ecological contexts. Accordingly, recent work has started to make important contributions to our understanding of the development and proximate causes of personality and behavioral syndromes, with some emerging evidence for ontogenetic stability, genetic control, and state-dependent personality. To date, however, no study has considered the conservation implications of personality for amphibians. Drawing on a conceptual framework and empirical literature for all vertebrates, we argue that there is considerable potential for knowledge of animal personality to improve amphibian conservation programs. We propose a novel paradigm to improve (i) the mating and reproductive success of captive animals by ensuring that breeding pairs are behaviorally compatible and (ii) the post-reintroduction survival and reproductive potential of animals by facilitating the selection of optimal behavioral types for release. Significance statement: Animal personality and behavioral syndromes appear to be widespread in nature. Here, we review animal personality and behavioral syndromes in amphibians, an understudied taxonomic group within the field. We summarize evidence, critique methodological approaches used, and emphasize that the unique behavioral ecology of amphibians makes them a model group for studying the proximate causes and ecological consequences of personality and behavioral syndromes. We also highlight that knowledge of these phenomena may have significant conservation implications for amphibian captive breeding and reintroduction programs. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Genetic selection for body size during domestication of animal species can inadvertently affect a number of physiological and behavioural traits. The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis predicts that domestication in an artificial environment lacking predators and providing abundant resources prefers proactive individuals with strong feeding motivation, high levels of aggression and risk taking, with low hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis responsiveness. In the present experiment we weaned fingerling pike-perch from live feed and habituated them to formulated feed. We recorded the number of weeks needed for the fish to accept pellets, their body length at the age of 100 days, their boldness in a novel object test and their HPI axis responsiveness. Individuals accepting the artificial feed within the first week grew larger than fish habituating later; therefore early weaners would be kept and bred in routine aquaculture procedures. Contrary to predictions of POLS hypothesis, fish weaning earlier and thus growing faster were less bold and had higher HPI axis responsiveness than fish accepting the pellets later or never. As live feed is preferred to artificial pellets, less competitive individuals may switch to pellets earlier. Inadvertent selection for stress sensitive fish may have an effect on production in aquaculture as well as on natural population after intensive restocking. © 2018 Molnár et al.

abstract={Background and aims Associated with numerous metabolic and behavioral abnormalities, obesity is classified by metrics reliant on body weight (such as body mass index). However, overnutrition is the common cause of obesity, and may independently contribute to these obesity-related abnormalities. Here, we use dietary challenges to parse apart the relative influence of diet and/or energy balance from body weight on various metabolic and behavioral outcomes. Materials and methods Seventy male mice (mus musculus) were subjected to the diet switch feeding paradigm, generating groups with various body weights and energetic imbalances. Spontaneous activity patterns, blood metabolite levels, and unbiased gene expression of the nutrient-sensing ventral hypothalamus (using RNA-sequencing) were measured, and these metrics were compared using standardized multivariate linear regression models. Results Spontaneous activity patterns were negatively related to body weight (p<0.0001) but not diet/energy balance (p = 0.63). Both body weight and diet/energy balance predicted circulating glucose and insulin levels, while body weight alone predicted plasma leptin levels. Regarding gene expression within the ventral hypothalamus, only two genes responded to diet/energy balance (neuropeptide y [npy] and agouti-related peptide [agrp]), while others were related only to body weight. Conclusions Collectively, these results demonstrate that individual components of obesity—specifically obesogenic diets/energy imbalance and elevated body mass—can have independent effects on metabolic and behavioral outcomes. This work highlights the shortcomings of using body mass-based indices to assess metabolic health, and identifies novel associations between blood biomarkers, neural gene expression, and animal behavior following dietary challenges. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

abstract={Exercise alone is often ineffective for treating obesity despite the associated increase in metabolic requirements. Decreased nonexercise physical activity has been implicated in this resistance to weight loss, but the mechanisms responsible are unclear. We quantified the metabolic cost of nonexercise activity, or "off-wheel" activity (OWA), and voluntary wheel running (VWR) and examined whether changes in OWA during VWR altered energy balance in chow-fed C57BL/6J mice (n = 12). Energy expenditure (EE), energy intake, and behavior (VWR and OWA) were continuously monitored for 4 days with locked running wheels followed by 9 days with unlocked running wheels. Unlocking the running wheels increased EE as a function of VWR distance. The metabolic cost of exercise (kcal/m traveled) decreased with increasing VWRspeed. Unlockingthe wheelledtoanegativeenergy balance but also decreased OWA, which was predicted to mitigate the expected changeinenergy balanceby∼45%. A novel behavioral circuit involved repeated bouts of VWR, and roaming was discovered and represented novel predictors of VWR behavior. The integrated analysis described here reveals that the weight loss effects of voluntary exercise can be countered by a reduction in nonexercise activity. © 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.},

abstract={In a physical model of a thin planktonic layer, the estuarine copepod Acartia tonsa strongly avoided weakly stratified layers of dissolved chemical compounds from the harmful dinoflagellate Karenia brevis. Chemical-induced changes in swimming kinematics allowed copepods to effectively avoid the layer and surrounding volume, highlighting the relevance of harmful alga-grazer interactions at a distance that involve dissolved chemical signals. Avoidance increased significantly with increasing chemical concentration representative of a range of ecologically relevant bloom conditions (1–104 cells/mL equivalent). Under mid to maximal bloom conditions, Acartia displayed visually and hydrodynamically conspicuous avoidance jumps featuring large, rapid displacements with swimming speeds near those reported for predatory escape reactions. Previous findings show K. brevis is both toxic and nutritionally inadequate to A. tonsa when ingested and that exposure to dissolved chemical compounds likely rapidly suppresses effective sampling and grazing behaviors. Thus, copepods have strong incentive to sense and avoid nearby, spatially discrete patches of toxic algae in order to improve fitness by avoiding exposure and/or ingestion and associated negative impacts. Our results suggest harmful alga not only produce deleterious physiological effects in copepod grazers, but chemical-induced behavioral responses also likely alter grazer distributions and top-down control via avoidance reactions (reduced harmful alga-grazer encounter rates). Additionally, predator-prey encounter rates at higher trophic levels are likely enhanced via significant changes in copepod swimming kinematics. These combined mechanisms could protect and sustain harmful blooms contained in subsurface thin layers until blooms reach critical mass and produce widespread impacts at the ecosystem level, the “cryptic bloom” effect. © 2017 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography},

abstract={Social impairment is one of the major symptoms in multiple psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Accumulated studies indicate a crucial role for the gut microbiota in social development, but these mechanisms remain unclear. This review focuses on two strategies adopted to elucidate the complicated relationship between gut bacteria and host social behavior. In a top-down approach, researchers have attempted to correlate behavioral abnormalities with altered gut microbial profiles in rodent models of ASD, including BTBR mice, maternal immune activation (MIA), maternal valproic acid (VPA) and maternal high-fat diet (MHFD) offspring. In a bottom-up approach, researchers use germ-free (GF) animals, antibiotics, probiotics or pathogens to manipulate the intestinal environment and ascertain effects on social behavior. The combination of both approaches will hopefully pinpoint specific bacterial communities that control host social behavior. Further discussion of how brain development and circuitry is impacted by depletion of gut microbiota is also included. The converging evidence strongly suggests that gut microbes affect host social behavior through the alteration of brain neural circuits. Investigation of intestinal microbiota and host social behavior will unveil any bidirectional communication between the gut and brain and provide alternative therapeutic targets for ASD. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract={Cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Diet, nutrition, physical inactivity, and obesity have been identified as important contributors to the increasing cancer incidence worldwide. To effectively plan interventions to reduce cancer incidence and to influence the public’s decisions regarding health behaviors, it is important for professionals to have an understanding of the ways in which people understand risk with regard to development of cancer. Selecting an appropriate method to evaluate awareness of cancer risk is an important consideration. Quantitative approaches such as surveys may be used to investigate awareness of risk, and recall of risk factors as well as recognition of such factors may form part of such assessments. Such quantitative methods may be used to evaluate risk in different demographic groups, as well as to examine the link between risk factors and behavior. Qualitative approaches include in-depth interviews, focus groups, and open-ended survey items and may be used to explain findings derived using quantitative methods. Mixed methods approaches may also be employed, involving use of a survey as well as interviews or focus groups to gather in-depth information. Assessment of awareness of cancer risk using an appropriate method has important implications for educators, as professionals must evaluate understanding of risk factors and tailor messages accordingly for educational programs. Ongoing evaluation of awareness is a key part of determining the effectiveness of education initiatives and identifying new and emerging issues. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={The Risk factors for Binge Eating Disorder in Overweight (REO) questionnaire is a screening tool for nutritionists to discriminate between individuals with obesity with and without Binge Eating Disorder (BED). The first study tested the discriminative ability of the REO and identified an optimal cut-off value. In the second study this cut-off value was used to identify individuals with and without BED from a sample of individuals with obesity visiting a nutritionist and compared clinical and personality characteristics with a group of individuals officially diagnosed with BED. Results showed that the REO has a sensitivity of 95.1%, specificity of 81.5%, a good internal consistency of α =.96, and an exploratory factor analysis showed four underlying factors of the REO that explained a total variance of 63.7%. Characteristics of individuals with BED symptoms identified by the REO and those officially diagnosed with BED were comparable and differed from individuals with obesity without BED symptoms. By screening individuals with obesity with the REO those presenting with BED symptoms are more easily identified, and can be referred to psychological treatment facilities for further assessment and appropriate treatment. © 2018 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity},

abstract={Nutritional status influences brain health and gestational exposure to metabolic disorders (e.g. obesity and diabetes) increases the risk of neuropsychiatric disorders. The aim of the present study was to further investigate the role of maternal Western-style diet (WSD), metabolic state, and inflammatory factors in the programming of Japanese macaque offspring behavior. Utilizing structural equation modeling, we investigated the relationships between maternal diet, prepregnancy adiposity, third trimester insulin response, and plasma cytokine levels on 11-month-old offspring behavior. Maternal WSD was associated with greater reactive and ritualized anxiety in offspring. Maternal adiposity and third trimester macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) exerted opposing effects on offspring high-energy outbursts. Elevated levels of this behavior were associated with low maternal MDC and increased prepregnancy adiposity. This is the first study to show that maternal MDC levels influence offspring behavior. We found no evidence suggesting maternal peripheral inflammatory response mediated the effect of maternal diet and metabolic state on aberrant offspring behavior. Additionally, the extent of maternal metabolic impairment differentially influenced chemokine response. Elevated prepregnancy adiposity suppressed third trimester chemokines, while obesity-induced insulin resistance augmented peripheral chemokine levels. WSD also directly increased maternal interleukin-12. This is the first non-human primate study to delineate the effects of maternal diet and metabolic state on gestational inflammatory environment and subsequent offspring behavior. Our findings give insight to the complex mechanisms by which diet, metabolic state, and inflammation during pregnancy exert unique influences on offspring behavioral regulation. © 2018 Thompson, Gustafsson, DeCapo, Takahashi, Bagley, Dean, Kievit, Fair and Sullivan.},

abstract={Background: Mercury (Hg) has been suspected of causing autism in the past, especially a suspected link with vaccinations containing thiomersal, but a review of the literature shows that has been largely repudiated. Of more significant burden is the total quantity of Hg in the environment. Here, we have used the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) to test whether prenatal exposure from total maternal blood Hg in the first half of pregnancy is associated with the risk of autism or of extreme levels of autistic traits. This is the largest longitudinal study to date to have tested this hypothesis and the only one to have considered early pregnancy. Methods: We have used three strategies: (1) direct comparison of 45 pregnancies resulting in children with diagnosed autism from a population of 3840, (2) comparison of high scores on each of the four autistic traits within the population at risk (n~2800), and (3) indirect measures of association of these outcomes with proxies for increased Hg levels such as frequency of fish consumption and exposure to dental amalgam (n > 8000). Logistic regression adjusted for social conditions including maternal age, housing circumstances, maternal education, and parity. Interactions were tested between risks to offspring of fish and non-fish eaters. Results: There was no suggestion of an adverse effect of total prenatal blood Hg levels on diagnosed autism (AOR 0.89; 95% CI 0.65, 1.22) per SD of Hg (P = 0.485). The only indication of adverse effects concerned a measure of poor social cognition when the mother ate no fish, where the AOR was 1.63 [95% CI 1.02, 2.62] per SD of Hg (P = 0.041), significantly different from the association among the offspring of fish-eaters (AOR = 0.74 [95% CI 0.41, 1.35]). Conclusion: In conclusion, our study identifies no adverse effect of prenatal total blood Hg on autism or autistic traits provided the mother ate fish. Although these results should be confirmed in other populations, accumulating evidence substantiates the recommendation to eat fish during pregnancy. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={A wide range of maternal exposures-undernutrition, obesity, diabetes, stress and infection-are associated with an increased risk of metabolic disease in offspring. Developmental influences can cause persistent structural changes in hypothalamic circuits regulating food intake in the service of energy balance. The physiological relevance of these alterations has been called into question because maternal impacts on daily caloric intake do not persist to adulthood. Recent behavioural and epidemiological studies in humans provide evidence that the relative contribution of appetitive traits related to satiety, reward and the emotional aspects of food intake regulation changes across the lifespan. This Opinion article outlines a neurodevelopmental framework to explore the possibility that crosstalk between developing circuits regulating different modalities of food intake shapes future behavioural responses to environmental challenges. © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

abstract={Metabolic flexibility is defined as the ability to adapt substrate oxidation rates in response to changes in fuel availability. The inability to switch between the oxidation of lipid and carbohydrate appears to be an important feature of chronic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Laboratory assessment of metabolic flexibility has traditionally involved measurement of the respiratory quotient (RQ) by indirect calorimetry during the fasted to fed transition (e.g. mixed meal challenge) or during a hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamp. Under these controlled experimental conditions, ‘metabolic inflexibility’ is characterized by lower fasting fat oxidation (higher fasting RQ) and/or an impaired ability to oxidize carbohydrate during feeding or insulin-stimulated conditions (lower postprandial or clamp RQ). This experimental paradigm has provided fundamental information regarding the role of substrate oxidation in the development of obesity and insulin resistance. However, the key determinants of metabolic flexibility among relevant clinical populations remain unclear. Herein, we propose that habitual physical activity levels are a primary determinant of metabolic flexibility. We present evidence demonstrating that high levels of physical activity predict metabolic flexibility, while physical inactivity and sedentary behaviours trigger a state of metabolic ‘inflexibility’, even among individuals who meet physical activity recommendations. Furthermore, we describe alternative experimental approaches to studying the concept of metabolic flexibility across a range of activity and inactivity. Finally, we address the promising use of strategies that aim to reduce sedentary behaviours as therapy to improve metabolic flexibility and reduce weight gain risk.

abstract={Larvae of several marine invertebrates are known to alter their morphology adaptively as a response to changes in conditions, such as food and predator density, within plankton communities. In contrast, nothing is known about plastic re sponses to the density of competitors, which could signal the potential for food limitation or predation risk. We studied effects on trophic morphology of culturing sand dollar pluteus larvae with limiting or saturating food and at low or high density using 1 of 3 potential competitors: feeding conspecifics, feeding heterospecifics, and non-feeding hetero specifics. We hypothesized that feeding competitors would induce a morphological response similar to limiting food, while the effect of non-feeders would depend on whether larvae respond directly to higher density or indirectly to food reduction. Plutei cultured with limited food grew longer feeding arms and shorter stomachs, though only in higher density treatments. Whereas the response to food involved a tradeoff between skeleton and stomach growth, larvae responded to high density by in creasing in vestment in both, reflecting a more complex set of energetic tradeoffs. Similar responses to the presence of feeding and non-feeding larvae implicate a sensory mechanism involving signals from potential competitors rather than a food de cline. Patterns in 2 literature surveys of laboratory experiments and field studies suggest that culture density is a critical but neglected aspect of experimental design in the study of early life-history stages. Larvae are most likely exposed to densities sufficient to induce plasticity following synchronous spawning, highlighting the importance of natural history in understanding density-dependent effects on developmental plasticity. © 2018 Inter-Research.},

abstract={Combined lifestyle interventions (CLIs) can be effective in reducing weight and improving lifestyle-related behaviours but it is unclear how CLIs can best be implemented in practice in order to achieve sustained lifestyle changes. The Coaching on Lifestyle programme (CooL) is a CLI in the Netherlands, in which professional lifestyle coaches counsel adults and children (and/or their parents) who are obese or at high risk of obesity to achieve a sustained healthier lifestyle. The CooL intervention consists of group and individual sessions addressing the topics of physical activity, dietary behaviours, sleep and stress. Our longitudinal one-group pre-post study aimed to identify lifestyle changes among participants (adults, children and their parents) at 8 and 18 months after initiation. We assessed constructs ranging from motivation and behaviour-specific cognitions to behaviours and health outcomes. Positive and sustained changes among adults were found regarding perceived autonomy, motivation, perceived barriers, lifestyle behaviours, quality of life and weight. Among children and their parents, few improvements were found regarding behaviours and quality of life. CooL has been successful in coaching adult participants towards sustained behavioural change during the intervention period. Mixed results and smaller effect sizes were found for children and their parents. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The links between parental restriction of food intake, child's eating behaviour and child's adiposity are still unclear. Our aim was to validate a model suggesting an underlying mechanism for the impact of parental restriction on child's adiposity through a broad dimension of child's eating temperament entitled the appetite reactivity (including both appetite arousal and appetite persistence). Using an online questionnaire administered at home to children aged between 8 and 11 years (N = 414) with one or both of their parents, we measured: based on child's reports, the perceived maternal restriction of child's food intake, the appetite reactivity and both the desired and the eaten mean food portion sizes; based on parental reports, the mean food portion size given to the child and the child's BMI. Structural equation modelling was used to test a model linking measured variables. A well-fitting structural model (AGFI = 0.91; RMSEA = 0.07; SRMR = 0.08) was identified, showing that: (i) perceived maternal restriction of child's food intake negatively impacts child's appetite arousal and food portion size but positively influences child's appetite persistence; (ii) the two components of appetite reactivity have a positive effect on child's adiposity which is partly mediated by child's actual food portion size. Results suggest an explanation for the controversy surrounding the links between parental food restriction and child's adiposity: through its negative impact on child's appetite arousal and food portion size, parental control may protect against overweight, but because of its positive effect on appetite persistence, it can also be detrimental. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Foraging decisions tend to drive individuals toward maximising energetic gains within a patchy environment. This study aims to determine the extent to which rainfall, and associated changes in food availability, can explain foraging decisions within a patchy urbanised landscape, using the Australian white ibis as a model species. Ibis density, food consumption rates and food abundance (both natural and anthropogenic) were recorded during dry and wet weather within urban parks in Sydney, Australia. Rainfall influenced ibis density in these urban parks. Of the four parks assessed, the site with the highest level of anthropogenic food and the lowest abundance of natural food (earthworms), irrespective of weather, was observed to have three times the density of ibis. Rainfall significantly increased the rate of earthworm consumption as well as their relative availability in all sites. Overall, these density and consumption measures indicate that anthropogenic derived foods, mainly from direct feeding by people, explain the apparent distribution of ibis across urban parks. However, there was evidence of prey-switching when the availability of natural foods increased following rainfall, perhaps reflecting selection of particular nutrients. © 2018 Chard et al.

abstract={Compared with adults, adolescent behavior is often characterized by reduced behavioral flexibility, increased sensitivity to reward, and increased likelihood to take risks. These traits, which have been hypothesized to confer heightened vulnerability to psychopathologies such as substance use disorders (SUDs), have been the focus of studies in laboratory animal models that seek to understand their neural underpinnings. However, rodent studies to date have typically used only males and have adopted standard methodological practices (e.g., weight loss inducing food restriction) that are likely to have a disparate impact on adolescents compared with adults. Here, we used adolescent and adult Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes to study instrumental behavior tasks that assess behavioral flexibility (strategy shifting and reversal learning; Experiment 1), sensitivity to reward value (outcome devaluation; Experiment 2), and risky decision making (probability discounting; Experiment 3). In Experiment 1, we found that adolescents were faster to acquire reversal learning than adults but there were no differences in strategy shifting. In Experiments 2 and 3, adolescents and adults were equally sensitive to changes in reward value and exhibited similar reductions in preference for a large reward when reinforcement probability was decreased. However, adolescents responded more efficiently and earned reinforcers at a higher rate than their same-sex, adult counterparts. Together, these findings provide only limited support for the existence of an "adolescent-typical" phenotype in Sprague-Dawley rats and instead suggest that age differences in the expression of these behaviors may depend on conditions such as pubertal status and motivational state. © 2018 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Anxiety, trauma- and stressor-related disorders are severe psychiatric conditions that affect human population worldwide. Given their genetic tractability, evolutionarily conserved neurotransmitter systems, and extensive behavioral repertoire, zebrafish have become an emergent model organism in translational neuroscience. Here, we investigate whether a single exposure to conspecific alarm substance (CAS) produces fear conditioning in zebrafish using a conditioned place aversion (CPA) paradigm, as well as the persistence of aversive responses at different time intervals. While CAS elicited freezing and erratic movements at conditioning phase, zebrafish showed a robust avoidance for the CAS-paired compartment and increased risk assessment up to 7 days postconditioning. Additionally, we observed the existence of two behavioral phenotypes (high- and low-avoider fish) that present different fear-like responses at conditioning phase and evasion of the conditioning side at postconditioning trials. Collectively, we show a prolonged conditioned place aversion in zebrafish after a single CAS conditioning session, reinforcing the use of fear conditioning protocols as valuable strategies for modeling psychiatric disorders-related phenotypes in zebrafish. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The effects of stream environmental conditions on inter individual variability were quantified for lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens (Rafinesque, 1817) yolk sac larvae in the expression of behavioral and morphological traits. Simulated experimental treatments including food availability (brine shrimp), presence of chemosensory predator cues (adult crayfish and odonate larvae), and conspecific density (2 verses 1 larvae) were applied to determine the effects on the duration of time in substrates following hatch and growth from hatch until emergence. In spring 2010, larvae from two full-sib families were individually placed into 240 mL perforated plastic containers (n = 263) with gravel substrate immediately following hatch. Containers were maintained in stream water at ambient temperatures and constant flow (~0.03 m/sec) in 4 m experimental flowing streams. Duration of time (days) each individual remained in the substrate was recorded. Morphological traits including total length (mm), body area (mm2), and yolk-sac area (mm2) were measured at hatch and at the time of emergence from substrate to compare growth and amount of endogenous yolk reserves used in individuals among experimental treatments. Environmental conditions significantly affected emergence time. Individuals emerged earlier in treatments exposing larvae to chemosensory predator odorants and higher conspecific density. Use of endogenous reserves (yolk-sac area) at the time of emergence did not differ among treatments. Growth was significantly greater when individuals were provided a food source compared to all other treatments. Quantifying the magnitude and direction of phenotypic responses to environmental conditions is important to understand potential factors affecting survival during early life stages and population viability under conditions of increasing environmental variability. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Shipping has increased dramatically in recent decades and oysters can hear them. We studied the interaction between noise pollution and trace metal contamination in the oyster Magallana gigas. Four oyster-groups were studied during a 14-day exposure period. Two were exposed to cadmium in the presence of cargo ship-noise ([Cd++]w ≈ 0.5 μg L-1; maximum sound pressure level 150 dBrms re 1 μPa), and 2 were exposed only to cadmium. The Cd concentration in the gills ([Cd]g) and the digestive gland ([Cd]dg), the valve closure duration, number of valve closures and circadian distribution of opening and closure, the daily shell growth-rate and the expression of 19 genes in the gills were studied. Oysters exposed to Cd in the presence of cargo ship-noise accumulated 2.5 times less Cd in their gills than did the controls without ship noise and their growth rate was 2.6 times slower. In the presence of ship noise, oysters were closed more during the daytime, and their daily valve activity was reduced. Changes in gene activity in the gills were observed in 7 genes when the Cd was associated with the ship noise. In the absence of ship noise, a change in expression was measured in 4 genes. We conclude that chronic exposure to cargo ship noise has a depressant effect on the activity in oysters, including on the volume of the water flowing over their gills (Vw). In turn, a decrease in the Vw and valve-opening duration limited metal exposure and uptake by the gills but also limited food uptake. This latter conclusion would explain the slowing observed in the fat metabolism and growth rate. Thus, we propose that cargo ship noise exposure could protect against metal bioaccumulation and affect the growth rate. This latter conclusion points towards a potential risk in terms of ecosystem productivity. © 2018 Charifi et al.

abstract={Mortality through predation is often selective, particularly at life-history bottlenecks. While many studies have looked at the importance for survival of specific prey characteristics in isolation, few have looked at a broad array of attributes and how they relate to survival in a realistic context. Our study measures 18 morphological, performance and behavioural traits of a juvenile damselfish that have been hypothesized as important for prey survival, and examines how they relate to survival in the field immediately after settlement. These attributes included size, relative false eye-spot size, fast-start escape response kinematics, thigmotaxis, laterality, and space use and activity in the field. Using conditional inference trees, we identify the most important drivers out of a reduced suite of 13 characters. Fast-start response latency, boldness, feeding rates and two measures of activity were found to significantly contribute to survival. Morphological variables and most laboratory measures of performance appeared to contribute little to survival. Results suggest selection works on a suite of characters associated with boldness. Bold and active fish are those that will be best able to learn using public information, but because of the relative naiveté of newly metamorphosed fishes, speed to react to a strike from an unknown predator is of critical importance. Findings substantiate the ecomorphological paradigm by suggesting that selection on behaviour modifies the correlations of morphological and performance variables with survival probabilities, since behaviour modifies performance capabilities by making them specific to context.

abstract={Objective: Metabolic syndrome and the presence of metabolic syndrome components are risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the association between personality traits and metabolic syndrome remains controversial, and few studies have been conducted in East Asian populations. Methods: We measured personality traits using the Japanese version of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Revised Short Form) and five metabolic syndrome components—elevated waist circumference, elevated triglycerides, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, and elevated fasting glucose—in 1322 participants aged 51.1 ± 12.7 years old from Kakegawa city, Japan. Metabolic syndrome score (MS score) was defined as the number of metabolic syndrome components present, and metabolic syndrome as having the MS score of 3 or higher. We performed multiple logistic regression analyses to examine the relationship between personality traits and metabolic syndrome components and multiple regression analyses to examine the relationship between personality traits and MS scores adjusted for age, sex, education, income, smoking status, alcohol use, and family history of CVD and diabetes mellitus. We also examine the relationship between personality traits and metabolic syndrome presence by multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: “Extraversion” scores were higher in those with metabolic syndrome components (elevated waist circumference: P = 0.001; elevated triglycerides: P = 0.01; elevated blood pressure: P = 0.004; elevated fasting glucose: P = 0.002). “Extraversion” was associated with the MS score (coefficient = 0.12, P = 0.0003). No personality trait was significantly associated with the presence of metabolic syndrome. Conclusions: Higher “extraversion” scores were related to higher MS scores, but no personality trait was significantly associated with the presence of metabolic syndrome. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Altricial young are dependent on adults for protection and food, and they display nutritional need by begging to elicit feeding from parents. Begging at high levels can be energetically expensive and attract predators; thus, an individual must balance its nutritional needs with these potential costs. Further, because a parent is limited in the amount of food it can provide, begging can contribute to both parent-offspring conflict and sibling-sibling competition. Many extrinsic and intrinsic factors may contribute to begging behavior. One intrinsic factor of interest is corticosterone (CORT), a metabolic hormone hypothesized to play a role in regulating a nestling's begging behavior. We investigated the hypothesis that increased exposure to CORT influences nestling begging behavior in an altricial species, the Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens). We treated one nestling per treatment nest with a twice-daily dose of exogenous hormone via a CORT-injected waxworm, whereas a second individual received a vehicle-injected waxworm. We monitored individual nestling and adult behavior at all nests with the use of high-definition video cameras on several days during treatment. We found no difference in begging rate between CORT fed and vehicle fed nestlings within a treatment nest. Further, to determine whether CORT treatment had indirect effects on the entire brood, we monitored additional nests, in which nestlings were not manipulated. When treatment and controls were compared, overall begging rates of nestlings in treatment nests were greater than those in control nests. This result suggests that CORT treatment of an individual altered its behavior, as well as that of its siblings. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Several studies indicate that the outcome of nutritional and lifestyle interventions can be linked to brain ‘signatures’ in terms of neural reactivity to food cues. However, ‘dieting’ is often considered in a rather broad sense, and no study so far investigated modulations in brain responses to food cues occurring over an intervention specifically aiming to reduce sugar intake. We studied neural activity and liking in response to visual food cues in 14 intensive consumers of sugar-sweetened beverages before and after a 3-month replacement period by artificially-sweetened equivalents. Each time, participants were presented with images of solid foods differing in fat content and taste quality while high-density electroencephalography was recorded. Contrary to our hypotheses, there was no significant weight loss over the intervention period and no changes were observed in food liking or in neural activity in regions subserving salience and reward attribution. However, neural activity in response to high-fat, sweet foods was significantly reduced from pre-to post-intervention in prefrontal regions often linked to impulse control. This decrease in activity was associated with weight loss failure, suggesting an impairment in individuals’ ability to exert control and adjust their solid food intake over the intervention period. Our findings highlight the need to implement multidisciplinary approaches when aiming to help individuals lose body weight. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Prey species can respond to the risk of predation with a range of antipredator behaviours and physiological changes. While these responses increase chances of survival, they often involve feeding reductions and greater energy expenditure (e.g. increases in metabolic rate). As a consequence, a prey response is constrained by its own nutritional condition. While a number of studies indeed demonstrate that prey in better nutritional condition have stronger antipredator behaviours, we do not yet understand how condition impacts the physiological component of the prey's response. Previous research revealed that Leptinotarsa decemlineata beetles experiencing predation risk improve their offspring's nutritional condition by promoting intraclutch egg cannibalism. Importantly, egg cannibalism decreased offspring vulnerability by increasing larval behavioural responses to chronic predation risk. In this study we test if egg cannibalism similarly impacts larval physiological responses by comparing how risk of predation in cannibals and non-cannibals affects their behaviour (e.g. feeding reductions), metabolic rate and energy stores. We found that non-cannibals did not exhibit antipredator behaviours but responded physiologically, by increasing metabolic rates. In contrast, cannibals responded behaviourally, suppressing feeding, but without altering metabolism. While cannibals and non-cannibals coupled food intake and energy expenditure differently, both reached similar growth rates and had similar energy stores when facing chronic predation risk. These results indicate that increases in predator avoidance behaviours are not merely mirrored by a stronger physiological response. Instead, changes in metabolism appear to ameliorate, within our experimental conditions, the costs associated with the behavioural response. Prey in poorer nutritional state are not less responsive to predators but appear to rely more heavily on physiological responses, demonstrating that how prey integrates behaviour and physiology depends on their own nutritional state.

abstract={Sialic acid (SA) is an integral component of gangliosides and signaling molecules in the brain and its dietary intake may support cognitive development. We previously reported that feeding sialyllactose, a milk oligosaccharide that contains SA, alters SA content and diffusivity in the pig brain. The present research sought to expand upon such results and describe the effects of feeding sialyllactose on recognition memory and sleep/wake activity using a translational pig model. Pigs were provided ad libitum access to a customized milk replacer containing 0 g/L or 380 g/L of sialyllactose from postnatal day (PND) 2-22. Beginning on PND 15, pigs were fitted with accelerometers to track home-cage activity and testing on the novel object recognition task began at PND 17. There were no significant effects of diet on average daily body weight gain, average daily milk intake, or the gain-to-feed ratio during the study (all p ≥ 0.11). Pigs on both diets were able to display recognition memory on the novel object recognition task (p < 0.01), but performance and exploratory behavior did not differ between groups (all p ≥ 0.11). Total activity and percent time spent sleeping were equivalent between groups during both day and night cycles (all p ≥ 0.56). Dietary sialyllactose did not alter growth performance of young pigs, and there was no evidence that providing SA via sialyllactose benefits the development of recognition memory or gross sleep-related behaviors. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={It is now recognized that emotions can influence food intake. While some people report eating less when distressed, others report either no change of eating or eating more in the same condition. The question whether this interindividual variability also occurs in response to positive emotions has been overlooked in most studies on Emotional Eating (EE). Using the Emotional Appetite Questionnaire (EMAQ) and Latent Profile Analysis, this study aimed to examine the existence of latent emotion-induced changes in eating profiles, and explore how these profiles differ by testing their relations with 1) age and sex, 2) BMI and risk for eating disorders (ED) and 3) factors that are known to be associated with EE such as perceived positive/negative feelings, depression, anxiety, stress symptoms and impulsivity. Among 401 university students (245 females) who completed the EMAQ, 3 profiles emerged (P1:11.2%, P2:60.1%, P3:28.7%), with distinct patterns of eating behaviors in response to negative emotions and situations but few differences regarding positive ones. Negative emotional overeaters (P1) and negative emotional undereaters (P3) reported similar levels of emotional distress and positive feelings, and were at greater risk for ED. However, the people in the former profile i) reported decreasing their food intake in a positive context, ii) were in majority females, iii) had higher BMI and iv) were more prone to report acting rashly when experiencing negative emotions. Our findings suggest that a person-centred analysis of the EMAQ scores offers a promising way to capture the inter-individual variability of emotionally-driven eating behaviors. These observations also add to the growing literature underscoring the importance of further investigating the role of different facets of impulsivity in triggering overeating and to develop more targeted interventions of EE. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: Metabolic abnormalities are common in patients maintained on antipsychotics. These abnormalities increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and mortality in this population. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in subjects maintained on antipsychotics relative to controls in Qatar, and to assess the factors contributing to the development of MetS. Methods: A cross sectional design was used to collect data and fasting blood samples from subjects maintained on antipsychotics for at least six months (n = 112) and from a control group (n = 114). The groups were compared in regard to prevalence of MetS, and multiple regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors in each group. Results: The two groups (antipsychotics vs. control) were similar in regard to age (35.73 ± 10.28 vs. 35.73 ± 8.16 years) and gender ratio. The MetS was higher among the subjects on antipsychotics, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Blood pressure (BP) was significantly higher in the antipsychotics group and BMI was the major risk factor to develop MetS in this group. Conclusions: The prevalence of MetS in both groups is high and mostly attributed to obesity and high BP. Public health interventions are needed to address this major health problem overall. Larger studies are needed to further assess the impact of antipsychotics and mental illness on the development of MetS. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Constructing models of living organisms locating food sources has important implications for understanding animal behavior and for the development of distribution technologies. This paper presents a novel simple model of stochastic differential equations for the foraging behavior of fish schools in a space including obstacles. The model is studied numerically. Three configurations of space with various food locations are considered. In the first configuration, fish swim in free but limited space. All individuals can find food with large probability while keeping their school structure. In the second and third configurations, they move in limited space with one and two obstacles, respectively. Our results reveal that the probability of foraging success is highest in the first configuration, and smallest in the third one. Furthermore, when school size increases up to an optimal value, the probability of foraging success tends to increase. When it exceeds an optimal value, the probability tends to decrease. The results agree with experimental observations. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Questions about the ecological drivers of, and mechanistic constraints on, productivity have driven research on life-history evolution for decades. Resource availability and offspring mortality are considered among the 2 most important influences on the number of offspring per reproductive attempt. We used a factorial experimental design to manipulate food abundance and perceived offspring predation risk in a wild avian population (red-faced warblers; Cardellina rubrifrons) to identify the mechanistic cause of variation in avian clutch size. Additionally, we tested whether female quality helped explain the extant variation in clutch size. We found no support for the Food Limitation or Female Quality Hypotheses, but we did find support for both predictions of the Nest Predation Risk Hypothesis. Females that experienced an experimentally heightened perception of offspring predation risk responded by laying a smaller clutch than females in the control group. Additionally, predation rates at artificial nests were highest where red-faced warbler clutch size was smallest (at high elevations). Life-history theory predicts that an individual should invest less in reproduction when high nest predation risk reduces the likely benefit from that nesting attempt and, indeed, we found that birds exhibit phenotypic plasticity in clutch size by laying fewer eggs in response to increasing nest predation risk. © Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International Society for Behavioral Ecology 2017.},

abstract={Food uncertainty has the effect of invigorating food-related responses. Psychologists have noted that mammals and birds respond more to a conditioned stimulus that unreliably predicts food delivery, and ecologists have shown that animals (especially small passerines) consume and/or hoard more food and can get fatter when access to that resource is unpredictable. Are these phenomena related? We think they are. Psychologists have proposed several mechanistic interpretations, while ecologists have suggested a functional interpretation: the effect of unpredictability on fat reserves and hoarding behavior is an evolutionary strategy acting against the risk of starvation when food is in short supply. Both perspectives are complementary, and we argue that the psychology of incentive motivational processes can shed some light on the causal mechanisms leading animals to seek and consume more food under uncertainty in the wild. Our theoretical approach is in agreement with neuroscientific data relating to the role of dopamine, a neurotransmitter strongly involved in incentive motivation, and its plausibility has received some explanatory and predictive value with respect to Pavlovian phenomena. Overall, we argue that the occasional and unavoidable absence of food rewards has motivational effects (called incentive hope) that facilitate foraging effort. It is shown that this hypothesis is computationally tenable, leading foragers in an unpredictable environment to consume more food items and to have higher long-term energy storage than foragers in a predictable environment.

abstract={Predation risk affects foraging behavior and, particularly, the amount of time devoted to the search for food. When exposed to predation risk, food deprived animals should be risk prone and relax behavioral defenses to a wider extent than well fed individuals. To test for this prediction, we used a 2 × 2 factorial design experiment, manipulating both the energetic state (fed vs. fasted) and exposure to an attack-released cue (injured vs. uninjured conspecifics) of common water frog tadpoles (Pelophylax kl. esculentus). Contrary to expectations, food deprivation significantly lowered the activity level of predator-exposed tadpoles. As in this experiment no food resource was added to test containers, energy conserving behavior might have both delayed starvation and lowered the probability of encountering the potential predator. To test for the effect of food availability on behavioral responses, we performed a second experiment, using the same protocol and procedures, except for adding food to all test containers. All tadpoles showed similar levels of activity, while fed tadpoles exposed to alarm cues tended to swim farther from the cage containing the stimulus than in the first experiment. As many anuran larvae can feed on dead conspecifics, prey-borne cues may have been interpreted as the potential presence of both a food source and a predator, fed tadpoles possibly being more confident than fasted tadpoles in their ability to escape predation in case an actual attack occurs. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Abstract: Correlations between behavioral, physiological, and morphological traits linked to life history have been given the label “pace-of-life syndrome” (POLS), hypothesized to arise through variation in the resolution of a trade-off between present and future reproduction. However, other trade-offs over energy allocation may also have effects and influence the present-future trade-off. We analyzed an optimality model of basal metabolic rate (BMR) across variation in food availability and two types of mortality. The model contained three major features: (1) feedback between activity and energy acquisition, (2) links between BMR and the use of energy for other traits, and (3) allocation trade-offs between BMR and all other traits, between activity and defense, and between defense against activity-related risk and activity-independent risk. The model produced an intermediate optimal BMR that was usually highest at an intermediate level of food availability. Food availability and both types of mortality risk interacted to influence the exact value of optimal BMR. Trait correlations expected in the POLS existed under some environmental conditions, but these correlations flipped sign under different conditions and were not always strong. Our model reproduces trait correlations consistent with the POLS, but also generated a “sloppy” syndrome with considerable non-POLS-like variation. In addition, among-individual, non-adaptive variation in BMR produced adjustments of the other traits. These fit a best-of-a-bad job strategy, and the adjustments further weakened trait correlations. The results emphasize that variation in resources and mortality risk creates a diversity of correlation structures. This complexity means the POLS is likely to be a variable construct. Significance statement: Many attributes important for reproduction and survival are associated. Such associations may arise through common physiological processes and correlated selection. We modeled metabolic rate within a system in which foraging behavior both depended on and mediated the acquisition of resources necessary for metabolism, while energy was allocated among multiple attributes. Variation in several environmental variables (food availability and two types of mortality risk) influenced basal metabolic rate, activity, and defenses against mortality risk. This variation affected the correlations between the traits in complex ways. When basal metabolic rate was non-optimal, evolution of the allocation of energy to other traits partially compensated, but this further eroded consistent trait correlations. Our results indicate that complexity in how energy is acquired and used can potentially disrupt trait correlations normally associated with the pace-of-life syndrome. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Alternate-day fasting (ADF) has gained popularity in recent years. The diet consists of a "fast day" where an individual consumes 0-25% of their energy needs, alternated with a "feast day" where a person is permitted to eat ad libitum.
AIM: This study examined eating behavior traits of successful weight losers during alternate day fasting.
METHODS: Obese participants ( n = 34) took part in 12 months of ADF and were grouped into a high (≥5%) or low-weight-loss (<5%) group post-treatment.
RESULTS: The high-weight-loss group demonstrated increased ( p = 0.04) fullness, decreased ( p = 0.03) hunger, increased dietary protein intake (15% to 20% of kcal, p = 0.04), and better adherence to fast-day calorie goals.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, individuals who achieve clinically significant weight loss with ADF demonstrate improved satiety, increased protein intake, and better adherence to fast-day calorie goals.},

abstract={The immature gastrointestinal (GI) tract makes infants vulnerable to transient disorders including colic, gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) and constipation. These conditions cause a significant distress to infants and caregivers, and are among the most common reasons for the paediatrician referral. In addition, these conditions are associated with a significant morbidity, hospitalisations and high healthcare costs, adding to the burden of the disease. Although they are additions to the ongoing physiological development or arise from maladaptive behavioural responses, the evidence remains limited. The vague aetiology and the self-limiting nature, has devoid these conditions of robust clinical attention, both in the research and clinical practice. Frequent early-life intestinal insults may translate as a risk factor in the development of chronic GI disorders and psychological problems later in life. Emerging evidence suggests that providing an optimal nutritional intervention closer to the breast milk can be a path breaking approach to manage these frequently encountered conditions and aid the growth and development of infants. © 2017},

abstract={Abstract: The hypothesis of pace-of-life syndromes (POLS) predicts relationships between traits including life history traits and risk-taking behaviour that can be mediated by the trade-off between current and future reproductive value. However, alternative causal mechanisms may also generate covariance among these traits without trade-offs. We investigated the relationships between survival to the next year, current reproductive investment and risk-taking behaviour (flight initiation distance) in male collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis, using long-term data. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to uncover whether the associations among traits are mediated by a common latent factor that determines how individuals balance the trade-off between current and future reproductive value. As trade-offs could be concealed when there are differences in resource acquisition between individuals, we also included potential causes of these differences, body mass and body size, in the analysis. We found that risk-taking behaviour was positively related to reproductive investment and negatively to survival to the next year as could be predicted if investment into a risky behaviour is traded against future prospects. However, the most supported SEM model also suggested that survival to the next year was positively related to current reproductive investment, contrary to predictions of a hypothesis based on trade-off. These results remained qualitatively similar when controlling for body condition. In conclusion, we only could derive partial support for the POLS hypothesis. We suggest that aspects of individual quality, and not only trade-offs, should also be considered when interpreting the relationships between life history and behavioural traits. Significance statement: We investigated the association between two life history components (survival to the next year and current reproductive effort) and risk-taking behaviour, relying on long-term records from a passerine bird, to investigate the predictions of the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis. Using structural equation modelling, we found support for a causal model that implies that risk-taking negatively affects survival to the next year and that survival to the next year and current reproductive effort are strongly and positively associated. Controlling for the effect of body condition did not fundamentally change these relationships. We could not find conclusive evidence for the investigated traits being mediated by a common underlying factor, as generally predicted by the POLS hypothesis. However, the sign of the relationship between risk-taking behaviour and survival to the next year was as predicted by the POLS hypothesis. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The planktonic rotifer, Brachionus calyciflorus, displays extensive variation in the length of its anterior and posterior spines. Notably, posterolateral spines may be absent or near body length. Studies of laboratory and natural populations have identified the different factors controlling this variation and have investigated the trade-offs associated with increased spine development. Low temperature and low food availability can induce modest spine elongation that may reduce sinking rate. A kairomone released by the carnivorous rotifer Asplanchna induces pronounced spine elongation, without detectable reproductive cost, that can provide an effective defense against this predator. Endogenous mechanisms also operate: Spine development is inhibited in females hatched from fertilized resting eggs and can be promoted by increasing maternal age. Genetic variation for the length of spines in both noninduced (default) and induced phenotypes occurs among and within populations. Asplanchna in natural communities likely leads to seasonal selection for genotypes that can develop increasingly long spines.},

abstract={Severe shoulder lesions in sows are manifested as ulcers comparable to pressure ulcers in humans. In sows, shoulder lesions appear on the skin overlying the bony prominence of the scapula, and are most commonly observed in the first weeks of lactation. Shoulder ulcers arise due to prolonged compression of blood vessels around the tuber of the scapular spine when the sow is lying, leading to insufficient blood circulation, necrosis, and subsequent ulceration. Due to the nature of shoulder lesions and their estimated occurrence (5%-50% of breeding sows worldwide), they represent an obvious welfare concern. There is also an economic impact due to labor time for treatment, medication, and premature culling of sows. While multiple factors contribute to ulcer development, maintaining optimum body condition in sows appears to be a key factor in prevention. This review summarizes the literature on sow shoulder ulcers, including the causes, prevention, and treatment. Regular monitoring of lesions is recommended, as this will help to identify individual farm causes and prevention measures. While much is known about shoulder ulcers, we conclude that there are significant gaps in the scientific literature regarding the mechanisms of development and healing, pain caused, and effective means for treatment and prevention. © 2018 American Association of Swine Veterinarians.

abstract={Local adaptation is often found to be in a delicate balance with gene flow in marine species with high dispersal potential. Genotyping with mapped transcriptome-derived markers and advanced seascape statistical analyses are proven tools to uncover the genomic basis of biologically relevant traits under environmental selection. Using a panel of 426 gene-linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we scanned 17 samples (n = 539) of sole (Solea solea L.) from the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and applied a node-based seascape analysis. Neutral loci confirmed a clear distinction between the North Sea-Baltic Sea transition zone and the other Eastern Atlantic samples. At a more subtle level, the latter unit split in an English Channel and North Sea group, and a Bay of Biscay and Atlantic Iberian coast group. A fourth group, the Irish and Celtic Sea, was identified with 19 outlier loci. A pattern of isolation by distance (IBD) characterized the latitudinal distribution. Seascape analyses identified winter seawater temperature, food availability and coastal currents to explain a significant component of geographically distributed genetic variation, suggesting that these factors act as drivers of local adaptation. The evidence for local adaptation is in line with the current understanding on the impact of two key ecological factors, the life-history trait winter mortality and the behaviour of inshore/offshore spawning. We conclude that the subtle differentiation between two metapopulations (North Sea and Bay of Biscay) mirrors local adaptation. At least three genomic regions with strong population differentiation point to locally divergent selection. Further functional characterization of these genomic regions should help with formulating adaptive management policies. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2017.

abstract={Inter-specific symbiotic links are often reinforced by morphological, physiological, or behavioral trait modification undergone by the associated species. In some cases, such as in physogastric termitophile staphylinids, such modifications do facilitate the social interaction. Here we inspect chemical traits of the physogastric staphylinid Corotoca melantho (Insecta: Coleoptera) and its termite host Constrictotermes cyphergaster (Insecta: Blattodea: Isoptera), aiming to verify whether staphylinids resemble their host. First, we compared CHC profiles of hosts and guests within and among termitaria, to gather evidence on the origin of such profiles in guests. Then, we examined nitrogen and carbon isotopic signatures of these cohabitants to inspect whether chemical disguise is achieved by predation of host workers by staphylinids. Beetles presented CHC more similar to the CHC of their cohabiting termites than to (i)their conspecifics and (ii)termites from another nest, thereby favouring the hypothesis on CHC acquisition by guests. Isotopic signatures revealed that such similarities could not be majorly determined by share nutrition between these cohabitants. In general, our results evidenced that chemical disguise in termitophiles may function as a strategy for social integration in morphological mimics. © 2018 Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana.

abstract={An understanding of the direct links between animals and their environment can offer insights into the drivers and constraints to animal movement. Constraints on movement interact in complex ways with the physiology of the animal (metabolism) and physical environment (food and weather), but can be modelled using physical principles of energy and mass exchange. Here, we describe a general, spatially explicit individual-based movement model that couples a nutritional energy and mass budget model (dynamic energy budget theory) with a biophysical model of heat exchange. This provides a highly integrated method for constraining an ectothermic animal's movement in response to how food and microclimates vary in space and time. The model uses r to drive a NetLogo individual-based model together with microclimate and energy- and mass-budget modelling functions from the r package “NicheMapR”. It explicitly incorporates physiological and morphological traits, behavioural thermoregulation, movement strategies and movement costs. From this, the model generates activity budgets of foraging and shade-seeking, home range behaviour, spatial movement patterns and life history consequences under user-defined configurations of food and microclimates. To illustrate the model, we run simulations of the Australian sleepy lizard Tiliqua rugosa under different movement strategies (optimising or satisficing) in two contrasting habitats of varying food and shade (sparse and dense). We then compare the results with real, fine-scale movement data of a wild population throughout the breeding season. Our results show that (1) the extremes of movement behaviour observed in sleepy lizards are consistent with feeding requirements (passive movement) and thermal constraints (active movement), (2) the model realistically captures majority of the distribution of observed home range size, (3) both satisficing and optimising movement strategies appear to exist in the wild population, but home range size more closely approximates an optimising strategy, and (4) satisficing was more energetically efficient than optimising movement, which returned no additional benefit in metabolic fitness outputs. This framework for predicting physical constraints to individual movement can be extended to individual-level interactions with the same or different species and provides new capabilities for forecasting future responses to novel resource and weather scenarios. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Background: Folates in their role as key one carbon donors, are essential for two major pathways: the synthesis of DNA and RNA precursors and DNA methylation. A growing body of evidence from epidemiological studies indicates a possible association between nutritional and functional deficiency in folates and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). However, there are no available behavioral animal studies on periconceptional one‑carbon donor deficiency during gestation and the autistic phenotype. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine if the periconceptional alteration of one‑carbon metabolism induced with a folate deficient diet would affect the behaviour of rat offspring. Methods: Female Wistar rats were divided in two groups: control (basal diet, in compliance with standards of regular laboratory diets), or exposed during one month before breeding until Gestational Day 15 to a modified diet with no added folic acid (0.2 mg/kg of food), reduced choline (750 mg/kg of food), and added 1% SST (a non-absorbable antibiotic used to inhibit folate synthesis by gut bacteria). We administered behavioral tests to offspring, i.e., open field (P20), social interactions (P25), marble burying (P30), elevated plus maze (P35), and prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex (sensorimotor gating) (P45). Blood homocysteine levels were used to confirm the deficit in one‑carbon donors. Results: Compared to controls, offspring with the periconceptional deficit in folate showed: (i) congenital body malformations; (ii) reduced social interactions, with a ~ 30% decrease in social sniffing behavior; (iii) reduced exploration of the open arm by 50% in the elevated plus maze test, indicating increased anxiety; (iv) a ~ 160% increased number of marbles buried, indicating repetitive behaviors; and (v) altered sensorimotor gating, with a global 50% decrease in startle inhibition. Conclusion: Maternal periconceptional deficit in folate provokes alterations in the behavior of offspring relevant to the autistic-like phenotype. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Objective: Physical activity (PA) promotes weight maintenance, potentially because of its beneficial effects on feeding behavior regulation via diminished food cue reactivity within brain reward regions. This study examined how levels of PA and sedentary behavior (SB) relate to brain responses to food cues. Methods: Participants (22 lean, 18 with obesity) completed three to five PA recalls over 2 months. Average minutes per day of moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) and SB were calculated. Participants completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging session, viewing food and nonfood images following glucose ingestion. Region of interest (ROI) analysis examined associations between MVPA and brain percent signal change in response to food versus nonfood images, controlling for obesity and sex. Secondary analysis examined associations between SB and brain responses to food cues. Results: Greater MVPA was associated with decreased food cue reactivity after glucose across brain ROIs (β = −0.00057, P = 0.005), controlling for obesity and sex. Greater SB was associated with increased food cue reactivity after glucose across brain ROIs in unadjusted analyses (β = 0.00041, P = 0.026). Conclusions: PA may have beneficial effects on brain regulation of feeding behavior after caloric intake in lean individuals and individuals with obesity. © 2018 The Obesity Society},

abstract={Obesity is a chronic, multifactorial origin disease that has recently become one of the most frequent lifestyle disorders. Unfortunately, current obesity treatments seem to be ineffective. At present, transcranial direct current brain stimulation (tDCS) represents a promising novel treatment methodology that seems to be efficient, well-tolerated and safe for a patient. Unfortunately, the biochemical action of tDCS remains unknown, which prevents its widespread use in the clinical arena, although neurobiochemical changes in brain signaling and metal metabolism are frequently reported. Therefore, our research aimed at exploring the biochemical response to tDCS in situ, in the brain areas triggering feeding behavior in obese animals. The objective was to propose a novel neurochemical (serotoninergic and dopaminergic signaling) and trace metal analysis of Fe, Cu and Zn. In doing so, we used energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Anodal-type stimulation (atDCS) of the right frontal cortex was utilized to down-regulate food intake and body weight gain in obese rats. EDXRF was coupled with the external standard method in order to quantify the chemical elements within appetite-triggering brain areas. Major dopamine metabolites were assessed in the brains, based on the HPLC assay utilizing the external standard assay. Our study confirms that elemental analysis by EDXRF and brain metabolite assay by HPLC can be considered as a useful tool for the in situ investigation of the interplay between neurochemical and Fe/Cu/Zn metabolism in the brain upon atDCS. With this methodology, an increase in both Cu and Zn in the satiety center of the stimulated group could be reported. In turn, the most significant neurochemical changes involved dopaminergic and serotoninergic signaling in the brain reward system. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Individual differences in behaviour characterize humans and animals alike. A hot field in behavioural ecology asks why this variation in ‘personality’ evolved. Theory posits that selection favours the integration of ‘intrinsic state’ and behaviour. Metabolism, hormones, energetic reserves and structural size have particularly been proposed as states covarying with behaviour among-individuals, either genetically or through plasticity integration. We conducted a meta-analysis estimating the amount of among-individual variation in behaviour attributable to variation in state. Our literature search showed that only 22% of the studies claiming to estimate individual-level associations between state and behaviour actually did so. Our meta-analysis revealed that relatively aggressive, bold, explorative and/or active individuals had relatively high metabolic rates, hormone levels, body weights and/or body sizes. The proportion of among-individual variation common to state and behaviour was nevertheless small (approx. 5%). This means that (i) adaptive explanations involving intrinsic states fail to explain much individual variation in behaviour, (ii) empiricists should consider nonlinear, additive or interactive effects of (multiple) intrinsic states, (iii) explanations not involving intrinsic states might be important, or (iv) empirical tests of state-dependent personality theory were inappropriate. Our meta-analysis highlights the importance of feedback between empiricists and theoreticians in the study of adaptive behavioural variation. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Little is known about how variation in nestling begging intensity influences the behaviour of adult raptors and how responses of adult males and females to such variation might differ. Our objective was to manipulate the begging intensity of nestling American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) and examine the responses of adults. We studied 12 pairs of American Kestrels nesting in nest boxes from 1 March to 1 July 2014 at the Blue Grass Army Depot, Madison County, Kentucky. Nest boxes were modified with a separate compartment for a camcorder to record nestling behaviour, and a second camcorder was placed outside the nests to monitor adult behaviour. To manipulate nestling hunger levels, 12 to 26-day-old nestlings in six nests were deprived of food for 24 h and those in the other six nests were fed until satiated. At each nest, we alternated control (no treatment) and treatment (fed or food deprived) days over a 4 day period to minimise the possible effect of nestling age on adult and nestling behaviour. Nestling begging intensity differed among treatments, with nestlings in food-deprived nests begging with greater intensity after food deprivation and those in fed-treatment nests begging with less intensity after being fed. Adult male and female American Kestrels provisioned nestlings at similar rates, with both sexes feeding nestlings at higher rates after food deprivation and at lower rates after fed treatments. Thus, the begging behaviour of nestling American Kestrels varied with hunger level, and adult American Kestrels responded by adjusting provisioning rates. Although the response of adults to nestling begging suggests that natural selection might favour 'dishonest' begging to obtain more food, the potential costs of 'dishonest' begging, such as attracting predators, reduced immunocompetence, and loss of indirect fitness benefits if such begging negatively impacts siblings and parents, may outweigh any possible benefit. © 2018 Science Reviews 2000 Ltd.

abstract={Personality research suggests that individual differences in risk aversion may be explained by links with life-history variation. However, few empirical studies examine whether repeatable differences in risk avoidance behaviour covary with life-history traits among individuals in natural populations, or how these links vary depending on the context and the way risk aversion is measured. We measured two different risk avoidance behaviours (latency to enter the nest and inspection time) in wild great tits (Parus major) in two different contexts— response to a novel object and to a predator cue placed at the nest-box during incubation—and related these behaviours to female reproductive success and condition. Females responded equally strongly to both stimuli, and although both behaviours were repeatable, they did not correlate. Latency to enter was negatively related to body condition and the number of offspring fledged. By contrast, inspection time was directly explained by whether incubating females had been flushed from the nest before the trial began. Thus, our inferences on the relationship between risk aversion and fitness depend on how risk aversion was measured. Our results highlight the limitations of drawing conclusions about the relevance of single measures of a personality trait such as risk aversion. © 2018 The Authors.},

abstract={Many populations of large grazing birds (cranes, geese, swans) have recovered following protection. During migration, these birds often aggregate in large numbers at staging sites and feed on agricultural crops. Because staging sites often coincide with protected wetlands, extensive crop damages may avert both bird and wetland conservation. There is a need to integrate damage mitigation and conservation of large grazing birds staging in agricultural landscapes, based on knowledge of large grazing birds’ spacing behavior. Their space use forms the basis for assessment of damage risk and for the scale at which measures should be implemented. We used high-resolution GPS location data to assess space use of common cranes (Grus grus) at an important staging site in south-central Sweden. We focus on daytime behaviour because this is the time when foraging cranes may cause crop damage and when preventive measures such as scaring and culling are conducted. We found that the daily activity area (mean 4.4 km2) did not vary within staging periods. Cranes exhibited high site fidelity during staging, as their activity area over the staging period (mean 15.6 km2) was considerably smaller than the entire staging site (&gt;200 km2). However, on a daily scale cranes gradually shifted activity areas, forming a space use pattern analogous to overlapping rings. This pattern is presumably explained by heterogeneous and unpredictable food availability caused by continuous changes in agricultural practices, weather conditions and competition. Considering the size of crane activity areas over the staging period and the scale of current damage preventive measures (e.g., hunting permissions given for a few fields [mean size 0.049 km2] at a time), we suggest that current preventive measures might be implemented on a too small scale compared to that of crane space use. Our findings highlight the necessity of adapting crop damage preventive measures to the scale of bird space use to facilitate both bird conservation and agricultural practices at wetlands staging sites along the flyways. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Dietary supplement consumption (DSC) has become popular due to its potential ability to increase one’s intake of nutrients and thereby relieve disease. The amount of dietary supplement use varies depending on setting and subjects, and thus far, the association between demographic and lifestyle factors and dietary intake have not been studied in hospital personnel. Objective: This study aimed to assess dietary supplement use and factors associated with it among personnel in Rajavithi Hospital. Material and Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted between January and June 2016. Four hundred staff who had worked in the hospital for at least one year were recruited; they completed a self-administered questionnaire which consisted of queries relating to their demographic characteristics such as age, gender, education, underlying diseases, health behavior, types of supplement and reasons for choosing to take dietary supplements. The differences between qualitative and quantitative variables were calculated using Chi-square and Student t-test as appropriate, and binary logistic regression was employed for factors associated with DSC. The ethics committee of Rajavithi Hospital approved the present study. Results: The majority of the participants were female, and the mean age (±SD) was 40.40±11.18 years. Just over two-thirds (67.1%) had normal BMI, and the prevalence of dietary supplement use was 25.5%. Five factors were significantly associated with the use of dietary supplement: increasing age (OR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95 to 0.99; p = 0.008); educational level higher than bachelor degree (OR = 2.55; 95% CI: 1.23 to 5.28; p = 0.012); stomachache (OR = 2.16; 95% CI: 1.05 to 4.45; p = 0.036); poor sleep quality (OR = 1.93; 95% CI: 1.17 to 3.18, p = 0.010); and diet avoidance (OR = 1.90; 95% CI: 1.09 to 3.31, p = 0.024). The most common reasons for the consumption of dietary supplements were their having obtained the approval of the food and drug administration, and their easy availability. Conclusion: Dietary supplement consumption was low compared to the findings of other studies in the literature. Age, education, stomachache, sleep quality, and diet avoidance were factors associated with DSC. Hospital personnel should take special care to use supplements rationally and be aware of their risks and adverse side effects. © 2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Animals integrate external cues with information about internal conditions such as metabolic state to execute the appropriate behavioral and developmental decisions. Information about food quality and quantity is assessed by the intestine and transmitted to modulate neuronal functions via mechanisms that are not fully understood. The conserved Target of Rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) controls multiple processes in response to cellular stressors and growth factors. Here we show that TORC2 coordinates larval development and adult behaviors in response to environmental cues and feeding state in the bacterivorous nematode C. elegans. During development, pheromone, bacterial food, and temperature regulate expression of the daf-7 TGF-β and daf-28 insulin-like peptide in sensory neurons to promote a binary decision between reproductive growth and entry into the alternate dauer larval stage. We find that TORC2 acts in the intestine to regulate neuronal expression of both daf-7 and daf-28, which together reflect bacterial-diet dependent feeding status, thus providing a mechanism for integration of food signals with external cues in the regulation of neuroendocrine gene expression. In the adult, TORC2 similarly acts in the intestine to modulate food-regulated foraging behaviors via a PDF-2/PDFR-1 neuropeptide signaling-dependent pathway. We also demonstrate that genetic variation affects food-dependent larval and adult phenotypes, and identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with these traits. Together, these results suggest that TORC2 acts as a hub for communication of feeding state information from the gut to the brain, thereby contributing to modulation of neuronal function by internal state. © 2018 O’Donnell et al.},

abstract={Most previous studies of animal vigilance behavior have been based on Pulliam' s classical model, which emphasizes that individuals' vigilance occurs independently and is, therefore, unaffected by the vigilant state of other individuals in the same group. However, recent theoretical and empirical studies have challenged this model and have reported that, depending on the degree of vigilance synchronization, the collective vigilance can be either imitation-based synchronized vigilance or coordinated vigilance that avoids overlapping bouts. In the present study, we observed the vigilance behavior of wintering black-necked crane (Grus nigricollis) families in the Yarlung Zangbo River Nature Reserve. The black-necked crane is a globally endangered species that lives exclusively in the Tibetan Plateau. We captured videos in the field and then scanned 30-s intervals of the footage to record individual and collective vigilance behavior. Further, we used Student's t-test to determine the effects of age and predation vulnerability at the individual level. The results indicated that juveniles spent significantly less time in vigilance than their parents, mainly owing to lack of vigilance and feeding experience, which necessitates juveniles to spend more time feeding to meet their energetic and developmental requirements. However, the presence of juveniles in family groups had no effect on the vigilance of adult cranes, and according to one-way ANOVA, there was no difference in the collective vigilance of different types of black-necked crane family groups. Meanwhile, a paired t-test, which was used to compare the observed and predicted collective vigilance values in order to determine the vigilance synchronization of wintering black-necked cranes, indicated that there was no synchronization tendency. The difference between the predicted and observed values was not significant between adult cranes, all family members, or adults and juveniles. Vigilance patterns are adaptive behaviors of animals in particular environments. In the wintering habitat of black-necked cranes, there is no targeting predator, and the black-necked cranes are generally protected as a symbol of auspiciousness in the Tibetan area. Although black-necked cranes that forage in farmland are inevitably disturbed by humans, the degree of interference and predation risk is insufficient to induce high-intensity vigilance synchronization that mainly function for reducing predator risk. In addition, when food availability becomes a key factor for survival, energy acquisition takes precedence over safety assurance, and as a result, the need for synchronized vigilance is reduced. Studying vigilance synchronization can reveal the vigilance pattern of black-necked cranes in the field and provide meaningful information for their management and conservation. © 2018 Science Press.

abstract={Development of an acute oral toxicity test with a terrestrial-phase amphibian was considered necessary to remove the uncertainty within the field of agrochemical risk assessments. The bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) was selected for use as it is a representative of the family Ranidae and historically this species has been used as an amphibian test model species. Prior to definitive study, oral gavage methods were developed with fenthion and tetraethyl pyrophosphate. Dimethoate and malathion were subsequently tested with both male and female juvenile bullfrogs in comprehensive acute oral median lethal dose (LD50) studies. Juvenile bullfrogs were administered a single dose of the test article via oral gavage of a single gelatin capsule of dimethoate technical (dimethoate) or neat liquid Fyfanon® Technical (synonym malathion), returned to their respective aquaria, and monitored for survival for 14 d. The primary endpoint was mortality, whereas behavioral responses, food consumption, body weight, and snout–vent length (SVL) were used to evaluate indications of sublethal toxicity (secondary endpoints). Acute oral LD50 values (95% fiducial interval) for dimethoate were 1459 (1176–1810, males) and 1528 (1275–1831, females), and for malathion they were 1829 (1480–2259, males) and 1672 (1280–2183, females) mg active substance/kg body weight, respectively. Based on the results of these studies, the methodology for the acute oral gavage administration of test items to terrestrial-phase amphibians was demonstrated as being a practical method of providing data for risk assessments.

abstract={Abstract: Laboratory studies of animal behavior can use animals with different developmental histories, including those that have spent most of their lives in the field or those raised in the laboratory. Both types of animals are assumed to respond similarly to experimental treatments. The goal of this study was to test if this assumption is true, if field-collected and lab-reared animals respond similarly to experimental treatments. In the first experiments, we test how diet (high lipid or protein) affected mating behaviors of male jumping spiders, Phidippus audax. Male spiders had opposite responses to diet based on their rearing condition in both scramble competition and male-male interaction trials. Field-collected spiders fed with high-protein diets and lab-reared spiders fed with high-lipid diets found mates quicker and were more aggressive than their counter parts fed with different diets. Field-collected spiders were also more active in open arenas and courted females more actively than lab-reared spiders. In a second experiment, we tested spiders for preference of flower color, and found that both lab-reared and field-collected spiders selected flowers with color over white flowers. However, field-collected spiders prefer red flowers with UV fluorescence, while lab-reared spiders seem to prefer red without UV. These results suggest that lab-reared and field-collected animals can respond differently to the same experimental treatments. Further work is needed to test if this happens in other animals, and which types of individuals (lab-reared or field collect) best reflect the responses of animals in nature. Significance statement: Laboratory studies are commonly used to study animal behavior. Animals used in these studies can be either raised in the laboratory or collected from the field just prior to the study. While lab-reared and field-collected animals can differ sometimes in their behavior (e.g., more or less active in response to a treatment), they are both assumed to respond in qualitatively the same manner. However, this does not appear to be the case in our study of a common species of jumping spider, Phidippus audax. Lab-reared and field-collected animals responded in opposite directions to identical treatment conditions. These results suggest that the developmental histories of animals can fundamentally affect how they respond to experimental treatments in the laboratory and, hence, the conclusions drawn from such studies. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Although research on the behavior of individual animals has been growing in recent years, the role that individual variation among animals may play in the outcome of species interactions in nature may be somewhat overlooked in natural resource management. Recognizing potential implications of individual behavioral variation can aid in developing more cost-effective and sustainable management techniques. Four illustrative examples are provided.• Livestock foraging behaviors are important to understand, as they affect an animal''s ability to locate and identify forage with nutritional qualities required for optimal growth. Studying the behavior of individual animals can help livestock producers anticipate and influence livestock grazing patterns to increase efficiency and productivity.• Sage-grouse populations have declined dramatically in many areas, and managers are required to consider their needs in all management decisions where the species persists. Sage-grouse exhibit complex mating, nesting, and migratory behaviors that are important to recognize for management to be successful.• Mountain lions were generally assumed to prey mainly upon mule deer, but recent studies have found that individual lions may specialize on alternate prey such as feral horses or bighorn sheep. The Bureau of Land Management spends millions of dollars each year to manage feral horse populations. Revelations surrounding prey switching in individual mountain lions may support management goals in which feral horse predation is occurring but may hinder bighorn sheep translocation efforts by wildlife managers.• Many plants important to land managers, including grasses, shrubs, and trees, are dispersed by granivorous rodents that store seeds in scattered caches, and a growing body of literature reveals that the majority of seedling recruitment for some of these species is attributable to scatter-hoarding by rodents. This relationship can be utilized for restoration applications, and variation in seed preferences among individual animals may be valuable in this regard. © 2017},

abstract={Predators can significantly affect prey by removing prey individuals and by changing prey behavior. The tradeoff between foraging behavior and predation risk may result in a trophic cascade that can have important effects on ecosystem processes. For herbivores that can feed both above- and belowground, it is likely that predation risk affects the location of feeding. We tested whether two species of predatory marsh crabs affected feeding behavior of the herbivorous crab, Sesarma reticulatum. We found that predatory crabs could kill or injure Sesarma and that Sesarma did less damage to its food plant Spartina alterniflora in the presence of the more dangerous predator. Sesarma prefers to feed on and grows better on belowground rhizomes than aboveground leaves; however, the costs of digging burrows to access rhizomes lead to higher mortality if it is the only diet option. The location of feeding did not affect total biomass of S. alterniflora. For Sesarma, a choice in feeding location allows the crabs the behavioral flexibility to balance the risks of predation, the nutritional benefit of feeding belowground, and the survival costs of belowground feeding. Similar tradeoffs are likely to increase the success of other herbivores that can feed both above- and belowground. © 2018 Vu and Pennings.},

abstract={1. Insects that emerge from rivers provide nutritional subsidies to local riparian predators. Adult damselflies and dragonflies often benefit from aquatic resources, but their high mobility and evasiveness have made it difficult to monitor their diets. 2. A dual fatty acid and stable isotope analysis approach was used to investigate the links between Odonata size and behaviour with proportions of their aquatically derived nutritional sources. Additionally, the study investigated the variation in dietary contributions of aquatic food sources to Odonata between two sections of a river, each with different aquatic productivity rates. 3. Variations in body size and foraging method of Odonata in the Kowie River (South Africa) contributed to differences in the contributions of aquatic food sources to their diets. Large Odonata that consumed prey in flight had smaller proportions of aquatic indicator fatty acids and stable isotope-generated proportions of aquatic food sources than did the smaller Odonata that consumed prey from perches. 4. There was a considerable amount of interspecific variation in indicators of aquatic feeding, but Odonata at an upstream site had smaller proportions of aquatic indicators than those at a downstream site which had higher insect emergence rates. 5. The findings of this study contribute information on the dynamics of feeding ecology among adult Odonata, and the substantial contributions of aquatic prey (>80% of total diet in some cases) indicated that cross-boundary trophic linkages via odonates are strong in the Kowie River. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society},

abstract={Background: Early life stress (ELS) in macaques in the form of insecure maternal attachment putatively induces epigenetic adaptations resulting in a “thrifty phenotype” throughout the life cycle. For instance, ELS induces persistent increases in insulin resistance, hippocampal and corpus callosum atrophy and reduced “behavioral plasticity”, which, taken together, engenders an increased risk for mood and anxiety disorders in humans but also a putative sparing of calories. Herein, we test the hypothesis whether a thrifty phenotype induced by ELS is peripherally evident as hypotrophy of cardiac structure and function, raising the possibility that certain mood disorders may represent maladaptive physiological and central thrift adaptations. Methods: 14 adult bonnet macaques (6 males) exposed to the maternal variable foraging demand (VFD) model of ELS were compared to 20 non-VFD adult subjects (6 males). Left ventricle end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD), Left ventricle end-systolic dimension (LVESD) and stroke volume (SV) were calculated using echocardiography. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured only in females. Previously obtained neurobehavioral correlates available only in males were analyzed in the context of cardiac parameters. Results: Reduced LVESD (p < 0.05) was observed when controlled for age, sex, body weight and crown-rump length whereas ejection fraction (EF) (p = 0.037) was greater in VFD-reared versus non-VFD subjects. Pulse pressure was lower in VFD versus non-VFD females (p < 0.05). Male timidity in response to a human intruder was associated with reduced LVEDD (p < 0.05). Conclusions: ELS is associated with both structural and functional reductions of left ventricular measures, potentially implying a body-wide thrifty phenotype. Parallel “thrift” adaptations may occur in key brain areas following ELS and may play an unexplored role in mood and anxiety disorder susceptibility. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Many prey species detect predators through chemoreception, particularly in low-visibility aquatic environments. Moreover, injury-released chemical cues from conspecifics are often perceived as a reliable indicator of predation threat. We examined whether males of the freshwater caridean shrimp Palaemon argentinus (Nobili, 1901) react to different types of infochemicals associated with predation threat. Shrimp were exposed to chemical stimuli from starved individuals of a predatory fish (Australoheros facetus (Jenyns, 1842)) and from crushed conspecific shrimp. Our experiment showed that P. argentinus reacts to waterborne substances associated with predation threat, indicating that chemical cues mediate behavioural antipredator responses. Shrimp adopted an appropriate antipredator behaviour (reduced swimming activity) in response to chemical stimuli from A. facetus, and from crushed conspecifics, relative to a distilled-water control. The chemical stimuli from crushed conspecifics elicited the strongest reduction in swimming activity. Reduced movement, a common response in prey animals to the presence of predators, was not entirely consistent because shrimp increased their walking time in response to the chemical stimuli that were investigated. The ability to alter behaviour based on vision-independent perception of ambient risk would be highly useful for macroinvertebrate prey species such as P. argentinus living in eutrophic shallow lakes where visibility is often reduced. Our results demonstrated chemosensory recognition of predation risk highlighting the important role of chemical cues in the behavioural ecology of this shrimp, especially with regards to predator-prey interactions. © The Author(s) 2017.

abstract={This study (1) investigated variation among populations and the effects of sex and body size on boldness, activity and shoal-association tendency among wild zebrafish, and (2) tested for existence of correlations between behaviours, controlling for sex and body size. Individuals across four natural populations were tested for general activity in a novel situation, number of predator inspections undertaken and tendency to associate with a conspecific shoal in the presence of predators. Results showed a significant effect of population on boldness with a population from high-predation habitat being bolder than populations from low-predation habitats. Males showed significantly higher tendencies than females to associate with a conspecific shoal in the presence of predators. Further, a negative relationship was found between activity and boldness only within two low-predation populations. Individual body size had a strong effect on the activity-boldness relationship within the low-predation population from flowing water habitat. Smaller fish were bolder and less active while larger fish were more cautious and active. Overall, the results indicated that while population-level behavioural responses might be shaped by predation pressure, state-dependent factors could determine behavioural correlations among individuals within populations. © 2018 The Authors.},

abstract={Background Several studies have linked childhood hunger to an increased risk for later depression. However, as yet, there has been little research on this relation in adults of all ages or whether there are sex differences in this association. The current study examined these issues using data from a national population-based sample. Methods Data were analyzed from 5095 adults aged 25–84 collected during the Estonian Health Interview Survey 2006. Information was obtained on the frequency of going to bed hungry in childhood and on depressive symptoms using the Emotional State Questionnaire (EST-Q). Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between hunger and depression while controlling for other demographic, socioeconomic and health-related variables. Results In a fully adjusted model, going to bed hungry in childhood either sometimes or often was associated with significantly increased odds for depressive symptoms. When the analysis was stratified by sex the association was more evident in men where any frequency of childhood hunger was linked to adult depression while only women who had experienced hunger often had higher odds for depressive symptoms in the final model. Limitations Data on childhood hunger were retrospectively reported and may have been affected by recall bias. We also lacked information on potentially relevant variables such as other childhood adversities that might have been important for the observed associations. Conclusion Childhood hunger is associated with an increased risk for depressive symptoms among adults. Preventing hunger in childhood may be important for mental health across the life course. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This chapter aims to describe significant aspects of the most common nutritional/metabolic diseases caused by insufficient or disbalanced nutrients intake, such as carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, and macro or trace minerals, and their repercussion in goat metabolism. Goats are opportunistic feeding behavior animals, choosing the best nutrients in both hard environments or even in feed availability periods. In some conditions, e.g., poor quality forages in nutrients, and/or when energy or nutrient requirements overpasses their intake capacity and availability, goats may not keep metabolic homeostasis. Pregnant toxemia, urolithiasis, polioencephalomalacia, and selenium or vitamin E deficiency are major diseases with impact in production, reproduction and/or health in both low- and high-producing goats or their kids. In high-producing dairy goats, due to their higher nutritional demands, increased incidence of the called "production diseases" is observed. Subacute ruminal acidosis, lactational ketosis, hepatic lipidose, hypocalcemia and low milk fat syndrome are also major problem in dairy herds to require special attention. Risk factors of these disorders should be taken into account in nutritional and feed management programs. A holistic approach regarding these programs and herd health management are crucial to control or prevent nutritional and metabolic diseases in farms. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Predation is a strong selective force that affects prey population and ecosystem dynamics. Detecting predators and associated levels of threat is crucial to prey responses. Once a predator is detected, anti-predatory responses improve the chances of survival of prey. We used Aedes aegypti larvae to study behavioural responses to predation threat from guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Specifically, we tested the relative importance of chemical cues, both in isolation and in combination with physical cues, in eliciting anti-predatory behaviours. Larvae responded more strongly, by reducing the lengths of their wriggle bursts, when presented with a combination of chemical and physical cues than with chemical cues alone. Anti-predatory responses often come with an associated cost, and we expect that the ability to pay these costs should influence responses to predation risk. To test this, we compared wriggling patterns of satiated vs starved larvae in the same experiment. We found that, under predation risk, starved larvae were willing to take more risks than satiated larvae were. We sought to experimentally test the assumption that anti-predator behaviours increase the survival of prey. To do this, starved guppies were made to choose between displays of simulated larvae, moving in short and long wriggle bursts as observed in the previous experiment. The fish preferentially attacked larvae moving in long bursts, demonstrating the survival value of the larval anti-predatory response of shifting to a preponderance of short wriggle bursts. Our study identifies specific ways in which trade-offs between predation risk and energetic costs could affect anti-predator behaviour. © 2017 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.},

abstract={For marine top predators like seabirds, the oceans represent a multitude of habitats regarding oceanographic conditions and food availability. Worldwide, these marine habitats are being altered by changes in climate and increased anthropogenic impact. This is causing a growing concern on how seabird populations might adapt to these changes. Understanding how seabird populations respond to fluctuating environmental conditions and to what extent behavioral flexibility can buffer variations in food availability can help predict how seabirds may cope with changes in the marine environment. Such knowledge is important to implement proper long-term conservation measures intended to protect marine predators. We explored behavioral flexibility in choice of foraging habitat of chick-rearing black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla during multiple years. By comparing foraging behavior of individuals from two colonies with large differences in oceanographic conditions and distances to predictable feeding areas at the Norwegian shelf break, we investigated how foraging decisions are related to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We found that proximity to the shelf break determined which factors drove the decision to forage there. At the colony near the shelf break, time of departure from the colony and wind speed were most important in driving the choice of habitat. At the colony farther from the shelf break, the decision to forage there was driven by adult body condition. Birds furthermore adjusted foraging behavior metrics according to time of the day, weather conditions, body condition, and the age of the chicks. The study shows that kittiwakes have high degree of flexibility in their behavioral response to a variable marine environment, which might help them buffer changes in prey distribution around the colonies. The flexibility is, however, dependent on the availability of foraging habitats near the colony. © 2017 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={For social foragers, movement as a group could increase foraging efficiency through collective discovery of high-quality food sources. This would require an efficient mechanism for transferring information about food quality between individuals. Conversely, the constraints of foraging as a cohesive group could decrease efficiency; grouping may persist to serve other functions such as protection from predators. To test what drives cohesion in herbivores, we manipulated patch shape and within-patch pattern of food quality and quantified the effects on group level diet selection by a social herbivore, the fallow deer, Dama dama. We arranged feeders containing fodder in lines or blocks, and manipulated the pattern of food quality within patches by adding tannin, a plant secondary compound that decreases palatability. We quantified the relative consumption of low- and high-tannin food to compare diet selectivity at the group level between patch treatments. If group foraging evolved to increase foraging efficiency, altering the spatial arrangement of food should not affect diet selectivity because information about food location and quality is shared. We found, however, that the herd expressed different levels of selectivity between both patch shapes and food quality patterns. Deer selected better diets in blocks than lines. In lines, the herd selected better diets when quality varied between alternate feeders rather than between the two halves of the patch, suggesting a reliance on personal rather than group information. Deer consumed the most at patch centres in all treatments except in blocks with high-tannin centres, but diet selection was poorer in the latter compared to blocks with low-tannin centres. Aggregation at the centre of patches appears to have restricted exploitation of the best food. Predation pressure and/or resource variability may have favoured the evolution of a foraging strategy that prioritizes social cohesion over effective diet selection. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Seasonal variation in food resources and predation risk imposes major constraints on herbivores, which must adjust their behaviour to maximize their energy intake and survival. In seasonally driven landscapes, it is not yet clear what the primary drivers are that shape seasonal variation in vigilance and feeding rates. These rates have been shown to vary in relation to various environmental, social and individual factors, but many of these factors also vary through the year, due to variation in food supply. We studied wild female eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, under low predation risk over a year to investigate whether vigilance and feeding rates varied seasonally and whether this variation was mainly driven by food quantity or quality, group size or individuals' reproductive states. Both vigilance and feeding rates varied seasonally, as did food quantity and quality and group size. Vigilance, including antipredator (head orientation away from the group) and exclusive (i.e. vigilance without chewing) vigilance, decreased and feeding rate increased with increasing group size. However, because group size increased with food quality and quantity, food resources emerged as the primary driver of variation in behavioural strategies. These results suggest that the observed effects of group size on the trade-off between food acquisition and safety are in fact corollaries of the seasonal variation in food supply in our study system, in which the risk of predation on adults is low, and hence are by-products of the foraging choices made by kangaroos in response to the dynamics of the quantity and quality of food. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={In recent years, the frequent occurrence of food safety incidents has brought great impact on consumers’ confidence in food safety, which has caused the food problem to become an important livelihood issue that needs to be improved and solved. The essence of food safety incidents is the market failure caused by the asymmetry of food safety information. Therefore, by taking the food safety as object of study, this paper firstly adopts the questionnaire research method to investigate the consumer’s food safety risk perception. Besides, according to the theories such as consumer behaviour decision-making and asymmetric information etc., the model of consumer decision-making behaviour based on a rational model was constructed, and the factors that affect consumer decision-making behaviour were studied. The results show that consumers are more concerned about the safety issues of food quality, but the satisfaction of the government’s supervision and food producer’ control on food quality is not high; consumers’ information recognition of food safety, risk perception, and consumer’s expectation all will directly or indirectly affect consumer decision-making behaviour. Finally, it proposes the suggestions and countermeasures for improving China’s food safety supervision as well as strengthening consumers’ food safety awareness, which is expected to help reduce consumer perception of food safety risks and restore their confidence in food safety. © 2018, Anka Publishers.

abstract={Late arrival on the breeding grounds has been associated with reduced fitness in migratory birds. Because migratory stopover accounts for the majority of time spent on migration, how individuals respond to both exogenous and endogenous factors associated with stopover will influence the pace of migration and arrival timing on the breeding grounds. Among the most important endogenous factors, body condition (i.e. fat stores) is expected to influence both movement behavior and departure decisions of individual migrants during stopover. In a novel experiment, we manipulated the condition of after-second-year (adult) male American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) captured during spring migratory stopover and radio-tracked all individuals after release using a passive automated telemetry array and conventional hand tracking. After accounting for the positive effect of tailwind and capture date on departure probability, we demonstrated that body condition influenced both the movement behavior of individuals and stopover duration. Individual movement decreased throughout the stopover period at a rate of 0.7 km day-1, supporting the notion that birds progressively limit their movements as stopover progresses. However, treatment birds whose condition was experimentally reduced (i.e. food-restricted) exhibited ∼3.4 times greater daily movement rates, and control birds were 4 times more likely to depart on a given day than treatment birds. These results underscore the importance of energetic condition in mediating the movement and stopover dynamics of migratory birds. Further, despite their capacity to make behavioral adjustments, our results suggest migratory songbirds that experience decreases in body condition during migration (which could result from inclement weather or low-quality stopover habitat) are likely to be delayed in their arrival on the breeding grounds, which could lower reproductive performance and ultimately have population-level ramifications. © 2017 American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Throughout the animal kingdom, individual variation in reproductive success is commonly observed, even under similar environmental conditions. However, the mechanisms behind such differences remain unclear. The notion of behavioural consistency in animals has developed rapidly since the early 21st century partly as an approach to understand among-individual differences. In this context, a number of studies have highlighted the influence of pair assortment in personality on breeding success. In this study, we related breeding success to individual behaviour, specifically a risk-taking behaviour, and pair assortment per behaviour in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) over two breeding seasons of contrasting food availability. On Bird Island, Algoa Bay, South Africa, we used indices of boldness and overall mobility in penguins’ nest defence behaviour as a response to a standard pedestrian approach during chick-rearing. These behaviours were consistent over the trials and indicated these traits may be related to personality in African penguins. Individuals were categorized as risk-prone (“bold,” “mobile”) or risk-averse (“shy,” “non-mobile”). We then assessed their breeding success through chick growth and survival over 4 weeks in 2015 and 2016. There was weak positive assortment of pairs in relation to nest defence behaviour. However, pair assortment did not significantly influence birds’ breeding success. Shy penguins were generally the most successful (had the highest chick growth rates), which was especially apparent during a food shortage in 2016, possibly reflecting a higher energy investment when foraging. In contrast, chicks from bold parents grew significantly slower, especially in 2016. Bold parents may defend their nest successfully against predation or intra-specific aggression when food is abundant, but when predation risks are limited and food availability is low, this strategy may not be beneficial. In the context of climate change, where food shortage events may become more frequent, risk-averse individuals may be favoured and genetic diversity may be reduced in African penguins. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Zoo-housed bears are prone to exhibiting stereotypic behaviors, generally considered indicators of negative welfare. We explored the effects of a variable-time feeding enrichment schedule on behavioral indicators of welfare in four bear species at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo. We distributed the diets of eight bears in one of five enrichment items, for two consecutive days each, and monitored behavior throughout the day. In Experiment 1, we compared variable-time to fixed-time presentation of enrichment over two, 10-day periods. Overall, bears performed more exploratory behavior when enriched (p &lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, variable-time enrichment was associated with a greater increase in exploratory behavior than fixed-time enrichment when compared to baseline (p &lt; 0.001). Both fixed-time (punadjusted &lt;0.05, padjusted = 0.07) and variable-schedule (punadjusted &lt;0.05, padjusted = 0.09) enrichment were also associated with similar decreases in abnormal behavior compared to baseline. For Experiment 2, we tested habituation to enrichment over 30 days using multiple items and a semi-variable presentation schedule. Again during the enrichment period, bears exhibited increased exploratory behavior (p &lt; 0.0001) and decreased abnormal behaviors compared to baseline (punadjusted = 0.05, padjusted = 0.09). We observed no habituation during the 30-day sustained enrichment period for these behaviors. Collectively, these results suggest that daily, variable-schedule feeding enrichment, with intermittent presentation of unique enrichment items, increases behavioral indicators of positive welfare and decreases behavioral indicators of negative welfare. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Attacks by aquatic predators generate frontal water disturbances characterised by low-frequency gradients in pressure and particle motion. Low-frequency hearing is highly developed in cephalopods. Thus, we examined behavioural responses in juvenile cuttlefish to infrasonic accelerations mimicking main aspects of the hydrodynamic signals created by predators. In the experimental set-up, animals and their surrounding water moved as a unit to minimise lateral line activation and to allow examination of the contribution by the inner ear. Behavioural responses were tested in light versus darkness and after food deprivation following a 'simulated' hunting opportunity. At low acceleration levels, colour change threshold at 3, 5 and 9 Hz was 0.028, 0.038 and 0.035 m s-2, respectively. At higher stimulus levels, jet-propulsed escape responses thresholds in daylight were 0.043, 0.065 and 0.069 m s-2 at 3, 5 and 9 Hz, respectively, and not significantly different from the corresponding darkness thresholds of 0.043, 0.071 and 0.064 m s-2. In a simulated hunting mode, escape thresholds were significantly higher at 3 Hz (0.118 m s-2) but not at 9 Hz (0.134 m s-2). Escape responses were directional, and overall followed the direction of the initial particle acceleration, with mean escape angles from 313 to 33 deg for all three experiments. Thus, in the wild, particle acceleration might cause escape responses directed away from striking predators but towards suction-feeding predators. We suggest that cuttlefish jet-propulsed escape behaviour has evolved to be elicited by the early hydrodynamic disturbances generated during predator encounters, and that the inner ear plays an essential role in the acoustic escape responses. © 2018.

abstract={There is a growing interest in the behavioural and life history mechanisms that allow animal species to cope with rapidly expanding urban habitats, which impose frequent proximity to humans. A particular case of behavioral bottleneck (i.e. conflicting interests) faced by animals in urban environments is how they will modulate the defence of their offspring against the potential danger represented by humans, an aspect that has received scarce research attention. We examined the nest defense against humans by a dense breeding population of a raptor, the Black Kite Milvus migrans, within the megacity of Delhi (India). Here, kites live on a diet dominated by human waste and meat offered through religiously motivated bird feeding practices. Nest defense levels increased with the number of offspring, and with the progression of the breeding season. Defense also intensified close to ritual-feeding areas and with increasing human waste in the streets, suggesting synergistic effects of food availability, parental investment, personality-boldness and habituation to humans, with consequent attenuation of fear. Thus, the behavioural response to a perceived threat reflected the spatial mosaic of activity of humans in the city streets, their cultural practices of ritual-feeding, and their waste-management. For synurbic species, at the higher-end spectrum of adaptation to an urban life, human cultural practices and attitudes may well be the most defining dimensions of their urban niche. Our results suggest that, after initial urban colonization, animals may continue to adapt to the typically complex, heterogeneous environments of cities through fine-grained behavioural adjustments to human practices and activities.},

abstract={Supplemental feeding, whether intentional or accidental, alters wildlife foraging behaviors and may have consequences at the population and ecosystem levels. Wildlife feeding may also cause animals to develop aggressive behaviors toward conspecifics and people. The risks to humans is potentially accrued when the species is a native predator. Food-based attraction has been implicated in the development of human-directed aggression in the dingo (Canis lupus dingo) population on Fraser Island, Queensland, Australia. Management strategies such as education programs, prohibition of inappropriate human behaviors, and fencing of garbage dumps have been implemented to stop the (intentional or inadvertent) feeding of dingoes by people. Despite these efforts, dingoes continue to obtain human-sourced food, suggesting that other means of supplemental feeding are still available. One possible source of subsidized food is recreational fishing, which is a popular activity on the island. We conducted a quasi-experimental study during May–June 2014 of dingo foraging behaviors on the eastern beach of Fraser Island. We video-recorded the behaviors of lone and groups of dingoes when they were in the vicinity of anglers or by themselves. We hypothesized that if recreational fishing was a source of subsidies to dingoes, then there would be differences in dingo foraging behavior among the 2 groups. We found that in the absence of anglers, dingoes spent 81% of their time engaged in mobile food-related behaviors. When anglers were present, however, they spent 52% of their time sitting and resting. These results suggest that dingoes shifted from active searching to a sit and wait foraging mode upon detecting recreational anglers. We observed an event in which a dingo spent 2 hours resting near an angler, then dug up the fish remains buried by the man as soon as he had left the area. This and other anecdotal evidence support the view that the changes in dingo foraging activity detected in this study were related to increased opportunities to secure food from anglers. Recreational fishing may play an important role in the inadvertent subsidizing of dingoes on Fraser Island, although further investigations are needed before proposing and implementing additional conservation and management actions. © 2017 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2017},

abstract={Cognitive processes related to the collection, storage and use of information (e.g. learning, memory) contribute to reducing uncertainty about the environment and can thus be key to survival and reproduction. However, information processing is rarely cost-free, and thus cognitive adaptations are expected to be fined-tuned to prevailing ecological and social conditions. Models and laboratory experiments underline the importance of environmental variability in determining the value of information; however, we still know very little on the link between environmental variability and cognitive abilities in wild populations. Here we outline a series of studies in which we assessed information use and learning in conspecifics living along two ecological gradients that impact variability of the food supply: elevation and urbanization. While low- and high-elevation great tits, Parus major, were found to differ in accuracy in a reversal learning task, the difference was in the direction opposite to our prediction, with low-elevation birds outperforming their high-elevation counterparts. Furthermore, we found no relationship between urbanization and spatial memory accuracy in black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, despite urban habitats being known to harbour more stable food supplies during the winter and, thus, potentially providing lower incentive to invest in food hoarding and spatial memory. However, as predicted, chickadees in urban habitats explored a new environment faster and seemed to rely less heavily on social information about novel food patches compared to forest chickadees. Our results point to the need to better link predictive models with experienced fluctuations in food availability for individual foragers and to take into account social as well as ecological variables that can impact the value of information and may covary along natural gradients of harshness. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Renewable forms of energy production can have major societal benefits including reduced carbon pollution and decreased dependence on fossil fuels but are not without associated costs. For example, habitat degradation at renewable energy production sites may affect the persistence of wildlife populations. We assessed the effects of wind farms in the San Gorgonio Wind Resource Area near Palm Springs, California, 2013–2015, on local populations of the side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana). The side-blotched lizard is a common and ubiquitous desert reptile that is a major consumer of invertebrates and, in turn, represents a key prey base for many avian, reptilian, and mammalian predators. We used spatially explicit capture-recapture methods to compare a comprehensive set of population-level vital signs (i.e., abundance, population growth rate, survival, recruitment, body condition, age structure, activity area size, movement rates) among populations at 4 wind farms and at 5 reference areas. Although our models indicate that wind facilities have a weak negative effect on side-blotched lizard survival, our overall results suggest that wind farms do not substantially influence the demography or behavior of these small lizards. Population response to general anthropogenic disturbance (quantified as an index of road type and density) was more pronounced, with lower population growth rates, adult-skewed age structure, and reduced body condition at highly disturbed wind farm and reference sites. We therefore conclude that wind-power facilities can support healthy populations of side-blotched lizards, indicating that wind energy development is compatible with a native Mojave Desert species. However, our results show that anthropogenic disturbance, as measured by the type and density of roadways, has a negative effect on lizard populations, and should be carefully planned whether associated with energy development or not. Our study demonstrates a methodological approach that can be applied to other species, including those with lower tolerances to disturbance, to measure their response to renewable energy development. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018},

abstract={Learning by observing others has been acknowledged as a powerful learning strategy. Whereas in several species observation of fear conditioning or other operational procedures can improve subsequent performance during actual learning, much less attention has been paid to observational learning of spatial discrimination tasks. To this end, we developed a set of procedures in which the spatial memory of adult rats, Rattus norvegicus, was tested in an eight-arm radial maze. Moreover, in view of controversial information concerning the incidence of mistakes made by demonstrators on the effectiveness of observational learning, our observer rats watched experienced or nontrained demonstrators. Food-deprived observers and demonstrators were initially habituated to the maze with all arms baited. Then observers were placed in a mesh cage positioned above the maze while a demonstrator rat was locating the spatial position of three baited arms. Rats observing conspecifics progressively learning the spatial discrimination improved subsequent performance compared to a control group watching an empty maze, but only if the configuration of baited arms presented during demonstration and testing matched. Therefore, rats integrated relevant spatial information during observation and used it efficiently when their spatial discrimination was tested in the maze. However, when the information was provided by trained demonstrators, making no mistakes and visiting only baited arms, observer rats failed to exhibit improved performance. Nevertheless, when given an initial habituation without food rewards, rats were subsequently able to benefit from observation of trained demonstrators thus showing that watching mistakes was not necessary for successful observational learning. Together, these findings indicate that rats can acquire spatial information via observation enabling more pertinent search strategies during testing and that for observation to be beneficial, what is observed must be sufficiently relevant or novel to complement existing knowledge (here initial habituation with or without rewards). © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Because of the well-established effect of food neophobia on children's variety of food consumption, the availability of valid measures of food neophobia in young children is necessary. We studied a Portuguese version of the Child's Food Neophobia Scale (CFNS), assessing its validity and reliability. The CFNS was completed by 388 parents of 2-to 6-year-old children. Construct validity was examined through an exploratory factorial analysis and a confirmatory factorial analysis. Measurement invariance (child's age and sex) and reliability analysis were examined. Correlational analyses between the CFNS and children's eating habits, food preferences and temperament dimensions were run. The results support a two-factor solution, suggesting two opposite dimensions: Food Neophobia and Food Neophilia. Invariance analysis showed the same structure for both age groups (2- to 4- vs. 5- to 6-year old), although only partial metric invariance across sex groups was attained. For both Food Neophobia and Food Neophilia subscales, good internal consistency and excellent test–retest reliability were achieved, as well as a moderate negative association between the two groups of items. Higher scores in Food Neophobia and lower scores in Food Neophilia were significantly correlated with a more inhibited temperament, lower preference for healthy foods, acceptance of fewer foods, less frequent consumption of healthy foods, and consumption of a smaller variety of fruits, vegetables and legumes. Children's unhealthy food intake was not associated with both CNFS subscales. Our preliminary findings support the adequacy of this version of CFNS for the Portuguese population. Further studies are needed to confirm the two-dimensional structure of the scale and explore the implications of this structure.

abstract={Programmes that promote dietary behaviour change for the prevention of chronic disease must include components that are rooted in best practice and associated with effectiveness. The purpose of this overview of systematic reviews was to examine the characteristics and dietary behaviour change outcomes of nutrition interventions among populations with or at risk of non-communicable chronic diseases. Systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) testing dietary behaviour change interventions published between January 2006 and November 2015 were identified via searches in Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO. Quality of reviews were appraised using AMSTAR. Dietary behaviour change and intervention details were extracted and systematically summarised. Fifteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Dietary behaviour changes in response to nutrition interventions were significant in over half of interventions. Reducing dietary fat and increasing fruits and vegetables were the most common behaviour changes. The characteristics of nutrition interventions and their relationship to effectiveness for dietary behaviour change among chronic disease or at-risk populations were reported inconsistently. However, associative evidence exists to support more frequent contacts and the use of specific behaviour change techniques. No clear relationships were found between effectiveness and intervention setting, mode of delivery or intervention provider, although some population-specific relationships were identified. Interventions that promote long-term maintenance of dietary behaviour changes are lacking in the literature. This comprehensive umbrella review identifies specific characteristics of interventions that are associated with effectiveness in interventions that promote dietary behaviour change among different at-risk populations. In order to maximise outcomes, public health, health promotion and healthcare organisations should consider these results in order to inform the development and improvement of nutrition programmes. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={Extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones are becoming more frequent, but efforts to understand their impact on wildlife have focused on population-level change rather than the behavioural responses of individuals. In this study, we monitored individually marked Brown Dippers Cinclus pallasii in upland Taiwanese streams in order to investigate the movements of these birds following typhoons in 2004, 2012 and 2013. Individuals moved significantly longer distances immediately after floods compared with before, and in typhoon years compared with other years. Most of these movements involved temporary displacement from a major stream to one of its tributaries, where population size and food abundance are typically lower. These results suggest that movements after flooding were not driven by food abundance but that relatively poor quality streams may provide an important refuge for birds following typhoons. © 2017 British Ornithologists’ Union},

abstract={The threat of predation influences decisions made by prey animals and alters the way that prey interact with other species in their environment. Animals often alter their foraging behaviour in response to a predatory threat by increasing or decreasing food consumption or by changing their feeding preferences to focus on foods that limit their exposure to the threat. Changes in grazing pressure and diet selectivity can have significant impacts on the abundance and diversity of the prey's food resources. In this study, we examined the indirect effects of a predatory fish on macrophyte biomass, mediated by crayfish responses to predator odours. Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides, Centrarchidae) were housed in flow-through stream mesocosms to produce odour cues that initiated a nonconsumptive effect on rusty crayfish (Faxonius rusticus, Cambaridae) held in an adjacent section of the stream. Crayfish were offered three species of macrophytes (Myriophyllum exalbescens, Haloragaceae; Elodea canadensis, Hydrocharitaceae; Chara spp., Characeae) and were allowed to graze for 48 hr. Consumption of each plant species was measured by weighing the plant samples before and after every trial. The plant samples were further analysed for total phenolic content using the Folin–Ciocalteu method. Foraging and shelter use behaviours were quantified by analysis of video recordings for time spent foraging in the mesocosm and time spent in the shelter zone of the mesocosm. Crayfish consumed greater quantities of macrophyte tissue when predator cues were present, and this result was unexpected and is contrary to most observations in the literature. When threatened, the crayfish also showed a preference for two of the macrophyte species, which did not exist in trials without bass odour. This could be due to differences in total phenolic content among the three plant species tested. The results provide evidence for a strong indirect effect of predatory fish on the macrophyte community mediated by changes in crayfish behaviour under threat. Crayfish act as keystone species in stream ecosystems; thus, changes in their foraging behaviour and dietary preferences caused by exposure to predator odour cues could have important effects on macrophyte communities in lotic systems. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Indirect risk effects of predators on prey behavior can have more of an impact on prey populations than direct consumptive effects. Predation risk can elicit more vigilance behavior in prey, reducing the amount of time available for other activities, such as foraging, which could potentially reduce foraging efficiency. Understanding the conditions associated with predation risk and the specific effects predation risk have on prey behavior is important because it has direct influences on the profitability of food items found under various conditions and states of the forager. The goals of this study were to assess how ducks perceived predation risk in various habitat types and how strongly perceived risk versus energetic demand affected foraging behavior. We manipulated food abundance in different wetland types in Illinois, USA to reduce confounding between food abundance and vegetation structure. We conducted focal-animal behavioral samples on five duck species in treatment and control plots and used generalized linear mixed-effects models to compare the effects of vegetation structure versus other factors on the intensity with which ducks fed and the duration of feeding stints. Mallards fed more intensively and, along with blue-winged teal, used longer feeding stints in open habitats, consistent with the hypothesis that limited visibility was perceived to have a greater predation risk than unlimited visibility. The species temporally nearest to nesting, wood ducks, were willing to take more risks for a greater food reward, consistent with an increase in a marginal value of energy as they approached nesting. Our results indicate that some duck species value energy differently based on the surrounding vegetation structure and density. Furthermore, increases in the marginal value of energy can be more influential than perceived risk in shaping foraging behavior patterns. Based on these findings, we conclude that the value of various food items is not solely determined by energy contained in the item but by conditions in which it is found and the state of the forager. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Folic acid, a B vitamin, is vital for early neurodevelopment and is well known for its protective effect against neural tube defects. Various national health agencies worldwide recommend that women of childbearing age take approximately 0.4 to 1mg of supplemental folic acid daily to reduce the risk of neural tube defects in offspring. Several countries have tried to promote folic acid intake through mandatory fortification programs to reduce neural tube defects. Supplementation combined with mandatory fortification of foods has led to high levels of folic acid and related metabolites in women of childbearing age. Recent studies have reported that oversupplementation, defined as exceeding either the recommended dietary allowance or the upper limit of the daily reference intake of folic acid, may have negative effects on human health. This review examines whether maternal oversupplementation with folic acid affects the neurodevelopment of offspring. Data from animal studies suggest there are behavioral, morphological, and molecular changes in the brain of offspring. Additional studies are required to determine both the dosage of folic acid and the timing of folic acid intake needed for optimal neurodevelopment in humans. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Food addiction is characterized by poorly controlled intake of highly-palatable, calorically-dense, foods. While previous studies indicate that risk factors for food addiction are similar to substance use disorders (SUD), these studies have looked at food addiction and SUD in independent samples, limiting the ability to directly compare food addiction to SUD. The present study was conducted to assess rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, childhood and adult trauma exposure, as well as presence and severity of emotion dysregulation, in a sample of women (N = 229) who either meet criteria for no addiction, food addiction only or SUD only. The prevalence of food addiction was 18.3% and the prevalence of SUD was 30.6% in this sample. Women with food addiction and women with SUD endorsed more depression and PTSD symptoms when compared with individuals with no addiction. Individuals with food addiction and SUD had higher total emotion dysregulation scores, specifically with difficulties in goal directed behaviors, non-acceptance of emotional responses, impulse control, limited access to emotion regulation strategies, and lack of emotional clarity, when compared to individuals with no addiction (all p's < 0.05). There were no differences in PTSD and depression symptoms and emotion dysregulation scores between food addiction and SUD groups (all p > 0.05). However, women with SUD endorsed higher levels of total childhood (p < 0.01) and adulthood trauma (p < 0.01) as compared with women with no addiction or food addiction. These results suggest that women with food addiction and those with SUD share similar psychological characteristics and risk factors, with the exception of trauma histories. These findings have implications for the detection of risk for and treatment of these disorders. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Introduction: Incorporation of young people to higher education implies the emancipation of the family home, some to share a flat with other students or to live in university residences. This fact can influence at behavioral level (identity and personality) and health. Specifically, social and academic factors can be related to diet in this stage. This study aims to describe the level of adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MD) and its association with social and academic factors in a sample of Spanish university students, as well as to determine the relationship between level of adherence to MD and sex, place of residence, degree and religious tendency. Material and Methods: This descriptive and cross-sectional study was carried out with a sample composed by 597 university students aged between 17 and 20 years old (M=19.04; DT=2.71), where 156 were men (26.1%) and 441 women (73.9%) from the province of Granada and the transboundary cities of Ceuta and Melilla. The Questionnaire of Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and an ad hoc questionnaire for social factors were used to assess the variables for this study. It was assessed the prevalence of MD and its association with socio-academic factors using a binary logistic regression. Results: The results showed that a 70% of the subjects presented a high adherence to MD and a 63.8% live in their family home. It was shown that students living in cross-border cities (Ceuta and Melilla) had three times more risk of having a worse adherence to MD than those of the peninsula. No differences were found in the dietary pattern according to sex, scope of knowledge, domicile or religious tendency. Conclusions: It is shown that the quality of the dietary pattern of Spanish university students varies according to social factors, such as the place of residence and the university campus. © 2018 Asociacion Espanola de Dietistas Nutricionistas.},

abstract={Anthropogenic global change, including agricultural intensification and climate change, poses a substantial challenge to many herbivores due to a reduced availability of feeding resources. The concomitant food stress is expected to detrimentally affect performance, amongst others in dispersal-related traits. Thus, while dispersal is of utmost importance to escape from deteriorating habitat conditions, such conditions may negatively feedback on the ability to do so. Therefore, we here investigate the impact of larval and adult food stress on traits related to dispersal ability, including morphology, physiology, flight performance, and exploratory behavior, in a butterfly. We show that inadequate nutrition during development and in the adult stage diminishes flight performance, despite some re-allocation of somatic resources. Detrimental effects of food stress on flight performance were mainly caused by reductions in body mass and storage reserves. Similar results were found for exploratory behavior. Furthermore, exploratory behavior was found to be (moderately) repeatable at the individual level, which might indicate the existence of a personality trait. This notion is further supported by the fact that flight performance and exploratory behavior were positively correlated, potentially suggesting the existence of a dispersal syndrome. In summary, our findings may have important implications for dispersal in natural environments, as the conditions requiring dispersal the most impair flight ability and thereby likely dispersal rates. © 2018 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Purpose: Using the family activity of hobby stock-keeping (“petstock”) as a context, this paper aims to extend singularization theory to model the negotiations, agencies and resistances of children, parents and petstock, as they work through how animals become food within the boundaries of the family home. In doing so, the authors present an articulation of this process, deciphering the cultural biographies of petstock and leading to an understanding of the emergent array of child animal food-product preferences. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from petstock-keeping parents through a mixture of ethnographic, in-depth interviewing and netnographic engagements in this qualitative, interpretive study; with parents offering experiential insights into animal meat and food-product socialization behaviours played out within the family environments. Findings: The findings discuss the range of parental behaviours, motivations and activities vis-à-vis petstock, and their children’s responses, ranging from transgression to full compliance, in terms of eating home-raised animal food-products. The discussion illustrates that in the context of petstock, a precocious child food preference agency towards animal meat and food products is reported to emerge. Research limitations/implications: This research has empirical and theoretical implications for the understanding of the development of child food preference agency vis-à-vis animal food products in the context of family petstock keeping. Practical implications: The research has the potential to inform policy makers around child education and food in regard to how child food preferences emerge and can inform marketers developing food-based communications aimed at children and parents. Originality/value: Two original contributions are presented: an analysis of the under-researched area of how children’s food preferences towards eating animal food products develop, taking a positive child food-choice agency perspective, and a novel extension of singularization theory, theorizing the radical transformation, from animal to food, encountered by children in the petstock context. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose In recent years, a new term—orthorexia nervosa (ON)—has been introduced in the field of clinical assessment and psychotherapy. Orthorexia nervosa is defined as a fixation on healthy food and a pathological obsession to eat food with more natural, higher quality ingredients. Although instruments to measure ON are available, no study on the psychometric properties of the original developed instrument by Bratman (Orthorexia nervosa: Overcoming the obsession with healthful eating, Broadway Books, New York, 2000) in a large clinical sample exists until now. Methods The study was conducted in a large clinic in Germany. The study sample consisted of N = 1122 inpatients, 70% were female, and the mean age was 41 years (SD = 14 years). The main diagnoses at the end of treatment were affective disorders (46%), followed by eating disorders (13%), anxiety disorders (10%), and personality disorders (10%). The patients filled out several instruments, like the Ortho-10, the 10-item version of the orthorexia nervosa instrument, and other construct-related, disorder-specific and construct-distant instruments. Results The exploratory factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure: an eating disorder-specific factor and an orthorexia-nervosa specific factor. The eating disorder factor showed good convergent and discriminative validity in which patients with eating disorders and those without could correctly be classified. However, the orthorexia-nervosa specific factor revealed no informational gain compared to the eating disorder-specific factor in this clinical sample. Conclusions Further investigation is necessary to approach the concept of ON and its sense in clinical samples.

abstract={Understanding ecosystem stability is one of the greatest challenges of ecology. Over several decades, it has been shown that allometric scaling of biological rates and feeding interactions provide stability to complex food web models. Moreover, introducing adaptive responses of organisms to environmental changes (e.g. like adaptive foraging that enables organisms to adapt their diets depending on resources abundance) improved species persistence in food webs. Here, we introduce the concept of metabolic adjustment, i.e. the ability of species to slow down their metabolic rates when facing starvation and to increase it in time of plenty. We study the reactions of such a model to nutrient enrichment and the adjustment speed of metabolic rates. We found that increasing nutrient enrichment leads to a paradox of enrichment (increase in biomasses and oscillation amplitudes and ultimately extinction of species) but metabolic adjustment stabilises the system by dampening the oscillations. Metabolic adjustment also increases the average biomass of the top predator in a tri-trophic food chain. In complex food webs, metabolic adjustment has a stabilising effect as it promotes species survival by creating a large diversity of metabolic rates. However, this stabilising effect is mitigated in enriched ecosystems. Phenotypic plasticity of organisms must be considered in food web models to better understand the response of organisms to their environment. As metabolic rate is central in describing biological rates, we must pay attention to its variations to fully understand the population dynamics of natural communities. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Fishing gears are designed to exploit the natural behaviors of fish, and the concern that fishing may cause evolution of behavioral traits has been receiving increasing attention. The first intuitive expectation is that fishing causes evolution toward reduced boldness because it selectively removes actively foraging individuals due to their higher encounter rate and vulnerability to typical gear. However, life-history theory predicts that fishing, through shortened life span, favors accelerated life histories, potentially leading to increased foraging and its frequent correlate, boldness. Additionally, individuals with accelerated life histories mature younger and at a smaller size and therefore spend more of their life at a smaller size where mortality is higher. This life-history evolution may prohibit increases in risk-taking behavior and boldness, thus selecting for reduced risk-taking and boldness. Here, we aim to clarify which of these three selective patterns ends up being dominant. We study how behavior-selective fishing affects the optimal behavioral and life-history traits using a state-dependent dynamic programming model. Different gear types were modeled as being selective for foraging or hiding/resting individuals along a continuous axis, including unselective fishing. Compared with unselective harvesting, gears targeting hiding/resting individuals led toward evolution of increased foraging rates and elevated natural mortality rate, while targeting foraging individuals led to evolution of decreased foraging rates and lower natural mortality rate. Interestingly, changes were predicted for traits difficult to observe in the wild (natural mortality and behavior) whereas the more regularly observed traits (length-at-age, age at maturity, and reproductive investment) showed only little sensitivity to the behavioral selectivity. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={The rodent whisker system, with barrel cortex as its most prominent structure, has evolved into a powerful model system to study sensory processing. However, despite the vast amount of data collected on barrel cortex neural activity patterns, as well as its circuitry and plasticity, the precise behavioral and cognitive operations for which this structure is needed are still elusive. Proposed functions of barrel cortex include detection, discrimination, coordination of whisker movements during exploratory locomotion or active touch, and associative learning. Departing from a definition of what exactly constitutes a function and how the involvement of a brain area in a specific task can be established conclusively, we here review the arguments suggesting barrel cortex is involved in either of these functions. We conclude that currently available data do not unequivocally support a crucial role of barrel cortex in core sensorimotor functions like sensory processing for detection and discrimination or motor processing for movement. Instead, it appears that barrel cortex’ contribution to behavior becomes ever more critical for performance with increasing cognitive load. We argue that our ignorance about barrel cortex’ involvement in behavior is partly due to the lack of basic experiments employing permanent lesioning of the barrel field, as well as neglect of procedural parameters determining cognitive load in behavioral tasks. It is our belief that close attention to these factors in future experiments will help to eventually discover what barrel cortex is actually good for. © 2017 IBRO},

abstract={MC4R represents a key player involved in melanocortin-mediated control of energy balance. Recently identified near MC4R variant rs17782313 (T > C) can serve as a contributing factor for obese phenotype but its association with obesity has never been sought in a sample of the Pakistani population. The role of genetic variants as causal factors varies across populations. Association studies in a specific population can help us to distinguish global from local gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. This is the first study that investigated the association of rs17782313 with obesity and various obesity-linked anthropometric, metabolic, physical, and behavioural traits in Pakistani subjects including 306 OW/OB (overweight and obese) and 300 NW (normal weight) individuals. The comparison of various aforementioned obesity-linked continuous and categorical variables between OW/OB and NW subjects revealed that almost all variables were found significantly aberrant (p < 0.05) in OW/OB subjects as compared to their age- and gender-matched NW controls indicating greater risk of developing various cardio-metabolic disorders. The genotyping of rs17782313 showed significant association of this variant with obesity and obesity-linked anthropometric traits in females suggesting the gender-specific effect of this variant in our population. The minor allele C increased the risk of obesity by 1.55 times (95% CI = 1.1-2.18, p = 0.01) whereas homozygous CC genotype increased the risk by 2.43 times (95% CI = 1.19-4.96, p = 0.015) in females. However, no association of rs17782313 was observed with any of the obesity-linked metabolic, physical, and behavioural traits except random eating timings. In conclusion, the current study significantly contributes to the knowledge of the genetic proneness to obesity in Pakistani females. This could also be helpful for forthcoming meta-analysis studies elucidating which variants are truly associated with the susceptibility to develop an obese phenotype. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={This article focuses on the division of labor between evolution and development in solving sequential, state-dependent decision problems. Currently, behavioral ecologists tend to use dynamic programming methods to study such problems. These methods are successful at predicting animal behavior in a variety of contexts. However, they depend on a distinct set of assumptions. Here, we argue that behavioral ecology will benefit from drawing more than it currently does on a complementary collection of tools, called reinforcement learning methods. These methods allow for the study of behavior in highly complex environments, which conventional dynamic programming methods do not feasibly address. In addition, reinforcement learning methods are well-suited to studying how biological mechanisms solve developmental and learning problems. For instance, we can use them to study simple rules that perform well in complex environments. Or to investigate under what conditions natural selection favors fixed, non-plastic traits (which do not vary across individuals), cue-driven-switch plasticity (innate instructions for adaptive behavioral development based on experience), or developmental selection (the incremental acquisition of adaptive behavior based on experience). If natural selection favors developmental selection, which includes learning from environmental feedback, we can also make predictions about the design of reward systems. Our paper is written in an accessible manner and for a broad audience, though we believe some novel insights can be drawn from our discussion. We hope our paper will help advance the emerging bridge connecting the fields of behavioral ecology and reinforcement learning. © 2018 The Authors.},

abstract={Chemical cues from predators (kairomones) are used by many aquatic and terrestrial animals when deciding on behavioral responses to predation threats. These responses may also be affected by the animal’s physiological state (e.g., nutrition level, parasitism, or prior injury), which could alter normal responses to kairomones. In this study, we examined effects of leg autotomy (the voluntary sacrifice of a leg) on subsequent responses to predator chemical cues in females of the riparian-zone wolf spider Pardosa valens. In a fully-crossed design, spiders with all legs intact or with one leg removed were exposed to one of two cue treatments for 90 min: a control (no predator cue) or one with chemical cues (silk and excreta) from a larger sympatric wolf spider, Rabidosa santrita. We then introduced an R. santrita into each container, and recorded subsequent survival of P. valens. Survivorship was significantly higher for individuals previously exposed to predator cues than for those in the control group; however, autotomy had no effect on survivorship, which was similar for both intact and autotomized spiders in both the predator-cue and control treatments. In addition, although P. valens were more likely to be found off the substrate than on it when the predator was added in each of the four treatment pairings, this initial position did not influence survivorship. These results therefore indicate that P. valens can behaviorally respond to predator kairomones in ways that reduce their risk of predation, but that this response is unaffected by the prior sacrifice of a leg. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Objectives: We present a study of skeletal damage to four chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) infanticide victims from Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Skeletal analysis may provide insight into the adaptive significance of infanticide by examining whether nutritional benefits sufficiently explain infanticidal behavior. The nutritional hypothesis would be supported if bone survivorship rates and skeletal damage patterns are comparable to those of monkey prey. If not, other explanations, such as the resource competition hypothesis, should be considered. Methods: Taphonomic assessment of two chimpanzee infants included description of breakage and surface modification, data on MNE, %MNE, and bone survivorship. Two additional infants were assessed qualitatively. The data were compared to published information on monkey prey. We also undertook a review of published infanticide cases. Results: The cases were intercommunity infanticides (one male and three female infants) committed by males. Attackers partially consumed two of the victims. Damage to all four infants included puncture marks and compression fractures to the cranium, crenulated breaks to long bones, and incipient fractures on ribs. Compared to monkey prey, the chimpanzee infants had an abundance of vertebrae and hand/foot bones. Conclusions: The cases described here suggest that chimpanzees may not always completely consume infanticide victims, while reports on chimpanzee predation indicated that complete consumption of monkey prey usually occurred. Infanticidal chimpanzees undoubtedly gain nutritional benefits when they consume dead infants, but this benefit may not sufficiently explain infanticide in this species. Continued study of infanticidal and hunting behavior, including skeletal analysis, is likely to be of interest. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: Concerns about caloric intake associated with alcohol use (e.g., fear of weight gain) are positively associated with compensatory eating behaviors (e.g., caloric restriction, self-induced vomiting), a phenomenon that has been identified across gender. Specific motivations for compensatory behaviors differ; some relate to eating disorder (ED) pathology (e.g., shape and weight concerns), and others to alcohol (e.g., enhancing effects). Research examining motivations for alcohol-related compensatory behaviors in men is limited to date. The current study sought to assess how specific types of alcohol-related compensatory behaviors and their association with ED pathology present differently by gender. Methods: Undergraduates (N = 530, 48% female) completed the Compensatory Eating Behaviors in Response to Alcohol Consumption Scale (CEBRACS), Eating Disorders Diagnostic Scale (EDDS), and reported height, weight, and frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption. Data were examined using linear regression, and relations between CEBRACS behaviors and eating pathology were compared across gender. Results: Factors that were positively associated with EDDS scores for both men and women included alcohol-related dietary restraint, and exercise. For women, but not men, alcohol-related bulimic behavior also contributed to elevations in EDDS scores. Conclusions: Findings indicate that specific types of alcohol-related compensatory eating behaviors (i.e., dietary restraint and exercise) are positively related to ED pathology for both male and female participants. In contrast, bulimic behaviors’ association with ED pathology is gender specific. Understanding gender differences in alcohol-related compensatory behaviors and ED risk may inform gender-specific intervention targets.

abstract={Winter is an ecologically challenging season for ectothermic cold-water fish in natural streams because of reduced flow and freezing. Hydropower regulation in many northern rivers increase winter stream flow and temperatures, and reduce ice formation and surface ice cover. From a background review of knowledge about e.g. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) winter survival strategies, we explore responses to hydropower impacts as a basis for adaptive management, mitigating strategies, and future research. Winter intensity and duration, hydrologic conditions and channel characteristics drive complex ice processes which become more complex and pervasive in smaller, high-gradient streams. Stream ice formation may be divided into the dynamic period ‘freeze-up’ in early winter with sub-surface ice, more stable ‘mid-winter’ with surface ice, and the ecologically challenging ‘ice break-up’ in winter-spring with potential mechanical ice runs and scouring. The characteristics of periods vary depending on climate and hydropower regulation. In reaches downstream of power-plant outlets water temperature may increase and reduce surface ice formation. The mid-winter period destabilize or become absent. In bypass reaches flows decrease and facilitate freezing and ice production. Knowledge about longitudinal water temperature changes is limited. Hydro-peaked systems may aggravate high-low flow effects. A basic winter survival strategy in salmon and trout is energy storage, but also reduced metabolism, tolerance and starvation effected by quiescence. Energy storage may depend on local conditions, but there is little indication of adaptation to local thermal climates. Intraspecific phenotypic plasticity is important. The main behavioural strategy is risk-reducing sheltering in the substratum or deep areas, and nocturnal activity. Local movements between daytime refuges and nighttime slow-current activity areas are usually limited to meters. Larger fish may move more and aggregate in restricted suitable deep-slow refuge habitats such as pools and deep glides. Fish cope with ordinary thermal ice phenomena, and do not appear to become trapped in ice. Surface ice may reduce fish metabolism, but other factors, e.g. availability of substrate shelter, may override this effect. Mechanical ice break-ups and less surface ice may reduce survival. An adaptive mitigating strategy may be higher regulated flows in winter which increase rearing and/or resting habitat and survival, but studies are few and knowledge is limited. However, higher regulated flows also affect temperature regime. Low flows increase ice formation, reduce and fragment available habitat, and may reduce egg and fish survival. Influx of ground water may mitigate these impacts, as will stabilize minimum flows. Sudden drops in regulated water discharge should be avoided. Fish may strand, in particular at low temperatures in the daytime when fish are less mobile and seek shelter. The challenging winter season is understudied, and important management considerations and future research areas for better adaptive management are suggested. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={The potential impact of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) varies considerably among exposed individuals, with some displaying serious alcohol-related effects and many others showing few or no overt signs of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). In animal models, variables such as nutrition, genetic background, health, other drugs, and stress, as well as dosage, duration, and gestational timing of exposure to alcohol can all be controlled in a way that is not possible in a clinical situation. In this review we examine mouse models of PAE and focus on those with demonstrated craniofacial malformations, abnormal brain development, or behavioral phenotypes that may be considered FASD-like outcomes. Analysis of these data should provide a valuable tool for researchers wishing to choose the PAE model best suited to their research questions or to investigate established PAE models for FASD comorbidities. It should also allow recognition of patterns linking gestational timing, dosage, and duration of PAE, such as recognizing that binge alcohol exposure(s) during early gestation can lead to severe FASD outcomes. Identified patterns could be particularly insightful and lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying FASD. © 2018 Published by NRC Research Press.},

abstract={The embodied mammalian brain evolved to adapt to an only partially known and knowable world. The adaptive labeling of the world is critically dependent on the neocortex which in turn is modulated by a range of subcortical systems such as the thalamus, ventral striatum, and the amygdala. A particular case in point is the learning paradigm of classical conditioning where acquired representations of states of the world such as sounds and visual features are associated with predefined discrete behavioral responses such as eye blinks and freezing. Learning progresses in a very specific order, where the animal first identifies the features of the task that are predictive of a motivational state and then forms the association of the current sensory state with a particular action and shapes this action to the specific contingency. This adaptive feature selection has both attentional and memory components, i.e., a behaviorally relevant state must be detected while its representation must be stabilized to allow its interfacing to output systems. Here, we present a computationalmodel of the neocortical systems that underlie this feature detection process and its state-dependent modulation mediated by the amygdala and its downstream target the nucleus basalis of Meynert. In particular, we analyze the role of different populations of inhibitory interneurons in the regulation of cortical activity and their state-dependent gating of sensory signals. In our model, we show that the neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh), which is in turn under control of the amygdala, plays a distinct role in the dynamics of each population and their associated gating function serving the detection of novel sensory features not captured in the state of the network, facilitating the adjustment of cortical sensory representations and regulating the switching between modes of attention and learning. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2017.},

abstract={Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal of high interest to the superfund initiative. Recent epidemiology studies have suggested a possible association between Cd exposure and cognitive as well as olfactory impairments in humans. However, studies in animal models are needed to establish a direct causal relationship between Cd exposure and impairments in cognition and olfaction. This study aims to investigate the toxic effect of Cd on cognition and olfactory function in mice. One group of 8-week-old C57BL/6 male mice was exposed to 3 mg/l Cd (in the form of CdCl2) through drinking water for 20 weeks for behavior tests and final blood Cd concentration analysis. The behavior tests were conducted before, during, and after Cd exposure to analyze the effects of Cd on cognition and olfactory function. Upon completion of behavior tests, blood was collected to measure final blood Cd concentration. Two additional groups of mice were similarly exposed to Cd for 5 or 13 weeks for peak blood Cd concentration measurement. The peak blood Cd concentration was 2.125-2.25 μg/l whereas the final blood Cd concentration was 0.18 μg/l. At this exposure level, Cd impaired hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in novel object location test, T-maze test, and contextual fear memory test. It also caused deficits in short-term olfactory memory and odor-cued olfactory learning and memory. Results in this study demonstrate a direct relationship between Cd exposure and cognitive as well as olfactory impairments in an animal model. © The Author 2017.

abstract={Objectives: This study tested hypotheses drawn from a risk model positing that psychosocial risk plus disease-related and treatment factors contribute to bulimic symptoms in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) transitioning to an insulin pump. The goal of this study was to examine whether diseaserelated factors, particularly disease- and treatment-based disruption in hunger and satiety, contribute to report of bulimic symptoms in youth with T1D after accounting for psychosocial risk factors. Methods: 43 youth (ages 10-17, 54% female) with established T1D were recruited before transition from multiple daily injections to insulin-pump therapy from three tertiary pediatric diabetes centers. Participants completed measures of bulimic symptoms, depressive symptoms dietary restraint, and the Diabetes Treatment and Satiety Scale, a diabetes-specific questionnaire assessing hunger and satiety cues and eating behavior in response to blood glucose levels and treatment. Results: Hierarchical multiple regression was used to assess contributions of psychosocial and disease-based risk to report of bulimic symptoms. After assessing the contributions of body mass index, body image dissatisfaction, and dietary restraint, a significant 2-way interaction emerged between depression and diabetesrelated uncontrollable hunger related to bulimic symptoms (β=1.82, p<.01). Conclusions In addition to psychosocial risk, disease- and treatment-based hunger and satiety dysregulation appear to be important factors contributing to report of bulimic symptoms in youth with T1D. These preliminary findings have significant treatment implications for bulimic symptoms in youth with T1D. © The Author 2017.},

abstract={Five novel dyads, consisting of a tetraphenylporphyrine unit connected to a perylene monoimide diester unit via a flexible bridge-CONH-(CH2)n-(n = 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12), have been synthesized. Their structures were characterized by 13C and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. The UV-vis absorption spectra revealed these dyads have broad optical absorption in the ultraviolet and visible regions due to the complementary absorption of the two units. The differential scanning calorimetry traces and polarized optical microscopy textures showed all these dyads have columnar liquid crystal phases. Cyclic voltammetry revealed the highest occupied molecular orbitals of the dyads located on the porphyrin units, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals located on the perylene units. In addition, these results were in agreement with that of the theoretical modeling. When excited at 423 or 473 nm, the photoluminescent emission spectra showed that the degree of fluorescence quenching of porphyrin units increased as the spacers became shorter. This quenching was ascribed to intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer, which also induced the dyad molecules to form the charge-separated states. The charge-separated molecules were further confirmed by the photocurrent response curves. These behaviors of broad absorption of the ultraviolet-visible light, yielding the charge-separated states of the molecules when excited and the formation of columnar liquid crystal phase made these dyads candidates for single-component photovoltaic active materials. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Being part of the chemical communication system between cells within an organism, they are involved in the regulation of different aspects of animal physiology and behaviour such as feeding, reproduction, development and locomotion. Transcriptomic data from larval and adult tissues have been obtained and mined to generate a comprehensive neuropeptidome for the polyphagous insect pest Spodoptera exigua. Sixty-three neuropeptides have been identified and described based on their tissue specificity and their regulation in response to different abiotic perturbations. Expression analyses have identified those neuropeptides involved in ingestive and digestive behaviour of S. exigua larvae and revealed a general pattern of upregulation in the midgut during larval starvation.

abstract={This study aimed the development of nanocapsules (NCs) for oral indole-3-carbinol (I3C) administration and evaluation of antinociceptive potential of this compound in its two forms, free and nanoencapsulated, using acute pain models. NCs showed adequate physicochemical characteristics and protected the I3C against UVC radiation exposure. It was observed no chemical bond between I3C and polymer by FTIR. Besides, X-ray and DSC analysis suggested that I3C was molecularly dispersed in NCs. The dialysis bag technique showed that almost 100% of the compound was released from NCs at 360 min. Mathematical modeling demonstrated that this release occurred in two rates, with an initial burst effect followed by a slower release of I3C. Regarding the in vivo analysis, time-response curve showed that both forms of I3C caused an inhibition in inflammatory phase of nociception induced by formalin and increased the latency response in hot plate test. Interestingly, NCs were able to prolong the I3C effect in both tests. Furthermore, in dose-response curve, only I3C in its nanoencapsulated form presented effect on inflammatory phase of the formalin test. In conclusion, NCs to I3C incorporation presented adequate nanometric characteristics and prolonged its antinociceptive action in acute pain models tested. © 2017},

abstract={Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) remains a leading preventable cause of structural birth defects and permanent neurodevelopmental disability. The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a powerful embryological research model, and was possibly the first in which the teratogenicity of alcohol was demonstrated. Pharmacologically relevant exposure to alcohol in the range of 20-70 mmol/L (20-80 mg/egg) disrupt the growth of chicken embryos, morphogenesis, and behavior, and the resulting phenotypes strongly parallel those of mammalian models. The avian embryo's direct accessibility has enabled novel insights into the teratogenic mechanisms of alcohol. These include the contribution of IGF1 signaling to growth suppression, the altered flow dynamics that reshape valvuloseptal morphogenesis and mediate its cardiac teratogenicity, and the suppression of Wnt and Shh signals thereby disrupting the migration, expansion, and survival of the neural crest, and underlie its characteristic craniofacial deficits. The genetic diversity within commercial avian strains has enabled the identification of unique loci, such as ribosome biogenesis, that modify vulnerability to alcohol. This venerable research model is equally relevant for the future, as the application of technological advances including CRISPR, optogenetics, and biophotonics to the embryo's ready accessibility creates a unique model in which investigators can manipulate and monitor the embryo in real-time to investigate the effect of alcohol on cell fate. © 2018 Published by NRC Research Press.},

abstract={Life history theory integrates ecological, physiological, and molecular layers within an evolutionary framework to understand organisms’ strategies to optimize survival and reproduction. Two life history hypotheses and their implications for child growth, development, and health (illustrated in the South African context) are reviewed here. One hypothesis suggests that there is an energy trade-off between linear growth and brain growth. Undernutrition in infancy and childhood may trigger adaptive physiological mechanisms prioritizing the brain at the expense of body growth. Another hypothesis is that the period from conception to infancy is a critical window of developmental plasticity of linear growth, the duration of which may vary between and within populations. The transition from infancy to childhood may mark the end of a critical window of opportunity for improving child growth. Both hypotheses emphasize the developmental plasticity of linear growth and the potential determinants of growth variability (including the role of parent–offspring conflict in maternal resources allocation). Implications of these hypotheses in populations with high burdens of undernutrition and infections are discussed. In South Africa, HIV/AIDS during pregnancy (associated with adverse birth outcomes, short duration of breastfeeding, and social consequences) may lead to a shortened window of developmental plasticity of growth. Furthermore, undernutrition and infectious diseases in children living in South Africa, a country undergoing a rapid nutrition transition, may have adverse consequences on individuals’ cognitive abilities and risks of cardio-metabolic diseases. Studies are needed to identify physiological mechanisms underlying energy allocation between biological functions and their potential impacts on health. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Environmental conditions during perinatal development such as maternal undernutrition or overnutrition can program changes in the integration among physiological systems leading to cardio-metabolic diseases. This phenomenon can be understood in the context of the phenotypic plasticity and refers to the adjustment of a phenotype in response to environmental input without genetic change. Experimental studies indicate that fetal exposure to an adverse maternal environment may alter the morphology and physiology that contribute to the development of cardio-metabolic diseases. The significance and role of genetic polymorphism, markers of chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, leptin synthesis disruption, rennin-angiotensin system in intrauterine cardio-metabolic disease programming are discussed. The study demonstrated that both maternal protein restriction and overnutrition alter the central and peripheral control of arterial pressure and metabolism. Breastfeeding may have beneficial effect on obesity risk later in life in genetically predisposed groups. Understanding the mechanisms which affect health outcomes in the offspring influenced by the macronutrient composition of the maternal diet during pregnancy or lactation may lead to new maternal nutrition recommendations, disease prevention strategies, and therapies that reduce the increasing incidence of cardio-metabolic diseases in children and adults. © 2018 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina.

abstract={A suboptimal perinatal environment can adversely influence gamete, embryonic, fetal, and infant development, setting in motion a train of events that increases the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease throughout life. This chapter summarizes the evidence linking an adverse maternal environment to developmental plasticity, in which the fetus adapts to the prevailing environmental conditions, subsequently altering the adult phenotype. Early studies linked low birth weight to the programming of high blood pressure. However, it is now evident that altered fetal development can also occur independently of low birth weight. Thus, the health implications of the maternal environment are much greater than predicted by the proportion of babies suffering growth restriction.We discuss both the stimuli and mechanisms that drive the perinatal programming of arterial pressure. We will consider kidney structure and function as a primary determinant of arterial pressure, as well as vascular, cardiac, and neural adaptations. Finally, therapeutic options to prevent, limit, or reverse these adverse consequences of a challenging start to life are explored. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

abstract={Growth characteristics during periods of early developmental plasticity are linked with later health outcomes and with disease risks. Infant growth is modulated by genetic and exogenous factors including nutrition. We try to explore their underlying mechanisms using targeted metabolomic profiling of small molecules in biological samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify hundreds of molecules in small biosamples, e.g., 50 μL plasma. In the large German LISA birth cohort study, cord blood lysophosphatidylcholines and fatty acids were closely associated with infant birth weight, with a nonsignificant trend towards an association with infant weight gain and later BMI. Studies in infants randomized to different protein intakes in the European CHOP Study show conventional high protein intakes to markedly increase plasma-indispensable amino acids (AA), particularly branched-chain AA (BCAA), while exceeding the infant's capacity of BCAA breakdown, and an increase in the dispensable AA tyrosine previously associated with insulin resistance. In a path model analysis of the relationship of infant plasma AA, growth factors, and infant growth, AA were generally found to induce a stronger response of insulin than IGF-I although effects of individual AA were very different. We conclude that targeted improvement in nutrient supply in pregnancy and infancy may offer large opportunities for promoting desirable child growth patterns and long-term health. © 2018 Nestlé Nutrition Institute, Switzerland/S.

abstract={Plastic adjustments of physiological tolerance to a particular stressor can result in fitness benefits for resistance that might manifest not only in that same environment but also be advantageous when faced with alternative environmental stressors, a phenomenon termed ‘cross-tolerance’. The nature and magnitude of cross-tolerance responses can provide important insights into the underlying genetic architecture, potential constraints on or versatility of an organism's stress responses. In this study, we tested for cross-tolerance to a suite of abiotic factors that likely contribute to setting insect population dynamics and geographic range limits: heat, cold, desiccation and starvation resistance in adult Ceratitis rosa following acclimation to all these isolated individual conditions prior to stress assays. Traits of stress resistance scored included critical thermal (activity) limits, chill coma recovery time (CCRT), heat knockdown time (HKDT), desiccation and starvation resistance. In agreement with other studies, we found that acclimation to one stress typically increased resistance for that same stress experienced later in life. A more novel outcome, however, is that here we also found substantial evidence for cross-tolerance. For example, we found an improvement in heat tolerance (critical thermal maxima, CTmax) following starvation or desiccation hardening and improved desiccation resistance following cold acclimation, indicating pronounced cross-tolerance to these environmental stressors for the traits examined. We also found that two different traits of the same stress resistance differed in their responsiveness to the same stress conditions (e.g. HKDT was less cross-resistant than CTmax). The results of this study have two major implications that are of broader importance: (i) that these traits likely co-evolved to cope with diverse or simultaneous stressors, and (ii) that a set of common underlying physiological mechanisms might exist between apparently divergent stress responses in this species. This species may prove to be a valuable model for future work on the evolutionary and mechanistic basis of cross-tolerance. © 2017 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

abstract={Objectives: Gastrostomy is a method of reference in the renutrition of malnourished elderly people. However, only few physicians use an enteral nutrition. The aim of this study was to analyze the representations and practices of physicians about gastrostomy in patients above 70 years-old, and to identify difficulties encountered in decision making in geriatrics. Materials ans methods: This study was a qualitative research based on individual, semi-directed interviews. Results: Ten physicians, geriatrics and palliative care, were interviewed. Their theoretical knowledge followed French and European recommendations in terms of indication, contra-indication and surveillance of risk factors for gastrostomy. Physicians had a pejorative representation of gastrostomy. It depended on the representation of the “food” which is specific, according to the personality, the design of care and sociocultural references. Difficulties encountered by physicians in decision-making were related to lack of training, lack of experience and influence of individual representations. Decision-making required a global and personalized evaluation of each patient. To make a decision, physician considered the patient's opinion first. Conclusion: Awareness of one's own representations can improve support. Methods to improve geriatric practice about gastrostomy are: training physicians, analysis of complex cases, formalizing multidisciplinary meetings and conducting collegiality ethical reflections. © 2018 Association pour le développement de la recherche en nutrition (ADREN)},

abstract={Background and Objective: There is great interest, supported by clinical experience, in the relationship between Eating Disorders (EDs) and psychiatric symptoms and diseases. The psychopathology of EDs is also referred to many risk and protective factors, and there is some evidence in the literature, also about genetic and neurobiological factors involved. The aim of this review is to examine and synthesize the recent scientific literature on this topic, in particular the complex relationship between Anorexia Nervosa and Neuropsychiatric Disorders. Methods: We analyzed the best of published literature on the topic, identifying keywords and MeSH terms in Pubmed and then searching them. The last search was performed on November 2017. Results: Psychiatric comorbidities are very common in anorexia nervosa. Mood disorders, major depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, developmental disorders among autistic spectrum and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and even some personality disorders, substance abuse and borderline traits have been reported, and some observations suggest a positive genetic correlation between anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia. Conclusion: The great amount of scientific articles dealing with the relationship between EDs and psychopathology confirms the complexity of these problems and the difficulties in diagnosis and treatment. An accurate diagnosis and assessment of clinical risk about psychological, psychiatric, nutritional and somatic aspects are therefore essential for an appropriate therapeutic management of patients affected by anorexia nervosa. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Childhood obesity/overweight (OB/OW) displayed a rapid increase and high prevalence in the last few decades in preschool-aged children, which raised health concerns across the world and motivated researchers to investigate the factors that underlie childhood obesity. The current study examined parenting styles and child-feeding practices as potential predictors for OB/OW in preschool children, controlling for child's temperament, which has been shown to be linked with OB/OW. The sample included 61 normal weight (NW) and 61 obese/overweight (OB/OW) Turkish pre-schoolers (M age = 62.2 months; SD = 7.64, range = 45–80 months). Parenting styles (authoritarian, authoritative), child-feeding practices (restriction, pressure to eat, monitoring), and child's temperament (negative affectivity) were measured with mothers' reports. Results showed that authoritarian parenting and maternal pressure to eat were the two parenting variables that significantly predicted child's weight status; the odds of being OB/OW was 4.71 times higher in children whose mothers used higher authoritarian parenting style, and was 0.44 times lower when mothers pressured their child to eat. These findings suggest that understanding the unique role of different aspects of parenting in the risk of early OB/OW status of children would be important in developing more effective interventions from early years in life. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: Excess dietary fructose intake associated with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance and increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Previous animal studies have reported that diabetic animals have significantly impaired behavioural and cognitive functions, pathological synaptic function and impaired expression of glutamate receptors. Correction of the antioxidant status of laboratory rodents largely prevents the development of fructose-induced plurimetabolic changes in the nervous system. We suggest a novel concept of efficiency of Stevia leaves for treatment of central diabetic neuropathy. Methods: By in vivo extracellular studies induced spike activity of hippocampal neurons during high frequency stimulation of entorhinal cortex, as well as neurons of basolateral amygdala to high-frequency stimulation of the hippocampus effects of Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni plant evaluated in synaptic activity in the brain of fructose-enriched diet rats. In the conditions of metabolic disorders caused by fructose, antioxidant activity of Stevia rebaudiana was assessed by measuring the NOX activity of the hippocampus, amygdala and spinal cord. Results: In this study, the characteristic features of the metabolic effects of dietary fructose on synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons and basolateral amygdala and the state of the NADPH oxidase (NOX) oxidative system of these brain formations are revealed, as well as the prospects for development of multitarget and polyfunctional phytopreparations (with adaptogenic, antioxidant, antidiabetic, nootropic activity) from native raw material of Stevia rebaudiana. Stevia modulates degree of expressiveness of potentiation/depression (approaches but fails to achieve the norm) by shifting the percentage balance in favor of depressor type of responses during high-frequency stimulation, indicating its adaptogenic role in plasticity of neural networks. Under the action of fructose an increase (3-5 times) in specific quantity of total fraction of NOX isoforms isolated from the central nervous system tissue (amygdala, hippocampus, spinal cord) was revealed. Stevia exhibits an antistress, membrane-stabilizing role reducing the level of total fractions of NOX isoforms from central nervous system tissues and regulates NADPH-dependent O2 - -producing activity. Conclusion: Generally, in condition of metabolic disorders caused by intensive consumption of dietary fructose Stevia leaves contributes to the control of neuronal synaptic plasticity possibly influencing the conjugated NOX-specific targets. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Feeding requires the integration of homeostatic drives with emotional states relevant to food procurement in potentially hostile environments. The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) regulates feeding and anxiety, but how these are controlled in a concerted manner remains unclear. Using pharmacogenetic, optogenetic, and calcium imaging approaches with a battery of behavioral assays, we demonstrate that VMH steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) neurons constitute a nutritionally sensitive switch, modulating the competing motivations of feeding and avoidance of potentially dangerous environments. Acute alteration of SF1 neuronal activity alters food intake via changes in appetite and feeding-related behaviors, including locomotion, exploration, anxiety, and valence. In turn, intrinsic SF1 neuron activity is low during feeding and increases with both feeding termination and stress. Our findings identify SF1 neurons as a key part of the neurocircuitry that controls both feeding and related affective states, giving potential insights into the relationship between disordered eating and stress-associated psychological disorders in humans. Viskaitis et al. show that hypothalamic SF1 neurons act as a nutrient-sensitive switch between feeding and anxiety states. They identify a key circuit that permits feeding and related behaviors when its activity is low but primes the animal to stop feeding and to face potential stresses when activity is high. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Metabolism, behaviour and growth are highly flexible in fish species, and inter-individual variation in these traits is evolutionarily and ecologically significant. It has long been suggested that these traits co-vary, although their relationships are debated. In the present study, we investigated whether metabolism, behaviour, growth and the potential relationships among them vary with food availability in sterile triploid carp. In this experimental animal model, we investigated the standard metabolic rate (SMR), growth performance and personality traits (i.e. activity, exploration and boldness) of juvenile individuals before and after 25 days of rearing in which fish were fed either once or twice a day to satiation. Inter-individual differences in SMR in each group showed high repeatability across the experimental period, and twice-fed fish showed higher SMRs than once-fed fish after 25 days of rearing. Compared with the oncefed group, the twice-fed group showed higher feeding rates (FRs) and lower feeding efficiencies (FEs) but similar specific growth rates (SGRs). None of the personality traits was affected by food availability. Furthermore, both boldness and exploration were highly repeatable throughout the experiment in the group fed twice a day, whereas only exploration showed repeatability in the group fed once a day. In the once-fed group, SMR and the personality traits were positively correlated with FR and negatively correlated with FE and/or SGR; however, these relationships did not exist in the twice-fed group due to the surplus of food. These results suggest that food availability significantly affects physiological, behavioural and ecological processes in these fish by altering the trade-off between metabolism and growth.

abstract={Children and adolescents have the highest rates of traumatic brain injury (TBI), with mild TBI (mTBI) accounting for most of these injuries. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable and often suffer from post-injury symptomologies that may persist for months. We hypothesized that the combination of resveratrol (RES), prebiotic fiber (PBF), and omega-3 fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) would be an effective therapeutic supplement for the mitigation of mTBI outcomes in the developing brain. Adolescent male and female Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly assigned to the supplement (3S) or control condition, which was followed by a mTBI or sham insult. A behavioral test battery designed to examine symptomologies commonly associated with mTBI was administered. Following the test battery, tissue was collected from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and primary auditory cortex for Golgi-Cox analysis of spine density, and for changes in expression of 6 genes (Aqp4, Gfap, Igf1, Nfl, Sirt1, and Tau). 3S treatment altered the behavioral performance of sham animals indicating that dietary manipulations modify premorbid characteristics. 3S treatment prevented injury-related deficits in the longer-term behavior measures, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) spine density, and levels of Aqp4, Gfap, Igf1, Nfl, and Sirt1 expression in the PFC. Although not fully protective, treatment with the supplement significantly improved post-mTBI function and warrants further investigation. © 2017 IBRO},

abstract={Objective: Examine the roles of action and coping planning on the intention–behaviour relationship for mothers’ decisions for their young children’s dietary behaviours. Design: Prospective design with two waves of data collection, one week apart. Main outcome measures: Mothers (N = 197, Mage = 34.39, SD = 5.65) of children aged 2–3 years completed a main questionnaire assessing planning constructs and intentions, and a one-week follow-up of the target behaviours–‘healthy eating’ and ‘discretionary choices’. Results: Intention was the strongest predictor of behaviour for both dietary behaviours. For healthy eating, intention moderated the indirect relationship between intention–behaviour via planning; coping planning was less important when intention was strong. Further, intention was not a direct predictor of behaviour when intention was relatively low. Action planning was not a direct predictor of either behaviour after accounting for intention and coping planning; action planning on behaviour was mediated by coping planning (only for healthy eating). Intention was not a direct predictor of coping planning; intention on coping planning was mediated by action planning. Neither type of planning predicted discretionary choices. Conclusion: Current findings contribute novel information on the mechanisms underpinning the effect of action and coping planning on the intention–behaviour relationship. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Understanding animal movements is a key prerequisite for deciphering ecological processes such as population dynamics, community structure or biological invasions. Many animals restrict their movements to certain areas (home ranges) by alternating visits among several suitable sites. The dynamics of these recursive movements are assumed to be primarily driven by food availability and predation risk. In contrast, environmental parasite pressures have rarely been considered as possible drivers of animals' ranging patterns. In this article, we present evidence that environmentally transmitted gastrointestinal parasites may shape recursive movement patterns of a group of free-ranging mandrills, Mandrillus sphinx. These rainforest-dwelling primates returned less frequently and after longer time lags to sites, including sleeping sites, they had contaminated than to sites with low contamination levels. This pattern was especially pronounced during the dry season, when contamination risk was highest. In contrast, rainfall shortened the time between visits, consistent with the hypothesis that rainfall may wash away parasites, allowing a more rapid return to previously used sites. Although resource distribution and predator threat could not be ruled out in this study, we suggest that the risk of acquiring environmentally transmitted parasites is possibly another factor influencing animal ranging patterns as well as habitat selection or species distribution. Consequently, parasites and their distribution in the environment, as well as the possible antiparasite strategy we document here, should be targets for future research on animal movement. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Inactivity is a vastly understudied behavioural category, which may reflect positive or negative affective states in captive or domesticated animals. Increased inactivity in barren-housed animals, in combination with an increased or decreased interest in stimuli, e.g. novel objects, can indicate boredom or apathy. Another theory is that inactivity is an alternative strategy to stereotypies to cope with sub-optimal conditions. The aim of this study was to further our understanding of inactive behaviours and possible associated negative affective states in intensively raised calves fed different diets. In two separate experiments, Holstein-Friesian veal calves (N = 40 + 160) were fed barren or enriched diets: 1) imposed/restricted diet versus free dietary choice (experiment 1); 2) no additional straw versus ad libitum provision of straw (experiment 2); 3) low versus high solid feed provision (experiment 2); 4) bucket versus automated milk dispenser for milk replacer feeding, with high or low solid feed provision (experiment 2). Inactive behaviours, i.e. experiment 1: lie, idle and sleep; experiment 2: lie idle, stand idle, and sleep, were recorded at two ages (experiment 1: 12 and 26 wk; experiment 2: 15 and 24 wk) using instantaneous scan sampling. In experiment 2, latency to touch two novel objects was recorded at 15 and 24 wk. No differences in inactivity were found between calves with a restricted or free choice diet (experiment 1). However, calves fed the more barren diets in experiment 2 showed more lying idle at 24 wk of age, and calves with no ad libitum straw in particular, showed more standing idle at 24 wk of age (P < 0.05). No differences in latency to touch the novel objects were found. Therefore, although barren diets were generally associated with higher levels of inactivity, we found no support that this inactivity reflected boredom or apathy. Only weak associations were found between inactivity and stereotypies, providing only limited support for the idea that these constitute alternative strategies to cope with sub-optimal conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Stress is ubiquitous in nature and organisms have evolved mechanisms to cope with it. Stress responses nevertheless vary based on the type of stress, its duration, magnitude, and the organism's physiological status. We studied here the effect of two separately applied stress types, differing also in their duration, on various behavioral responses of the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum). The two stress types applied were short-term cold stress and long-term low protein stress. The behavioral response variables were movement activity, preference to move along the test arena edges, latency to emerge from shelter, and preference for dark microhabitat, measured at two stages of the beetles’ lives, as young adults after eclosion and one month later. Behavioral responses were stress-specific. Cold-stressed beetles moved over the longest distances but were also the most reluctant to leave an accessible shelter. We interpret this to mean that cold-stressed beetles were the most active under unfavorable conditions and least bold under more favorable, protected conditions. As beetles aged, their movement activity decreased and latency to emerge from shelter increased. Non-stressed beetles were the most consistent in their behavior across all behavioral tests. This finding is similar to those in previous studies and suggests that moderate stress reduces behavioral consistency. While all beetles gained mass during the study period, the two stress types led to different patterns of body mass increase, which was more moderate for cold-stressed than for protein-stressed beetles. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The Deepwater Horizon oil spill contaminated thousands of miles of habitat valuable to hundreds of species of migratory and resident birds of the Gulf of Mexico. Many birds died as a direct result of the oil spill; however, the indirect effects of oil exposure on the flight ability and body condition of birds are difficult to assess in situ. This study utilizes the homing pigeon as a surrogate species for migratory birds to investigate the effect of multiple external oil exposures on the flight performance and body mass change of birds over a series of repeated flights from 136.8 km flight distance. Oiled pigeons took significantly longer to return home, lost more weight during flight, and were unable to recover their weight, resulting in reduction of body weight overtime. Based on our data, migratory birds that were oiled, even partially, by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill likely took longer to complete migration and were likely in poor body condition, increasing their risk of mortality and reproductive failure. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of increased homocysteine levels induced by methionine nutritional overload (twice as standard) and deficiency of the vitamins folate, pyridoxine and cobalamine, which plays an important role in homocysteine metabolism in anxiety-related behaviour, expressed by means of exploratory activity in rats. Twenty-three male Wistar albino rats (4 weeks old, 100±15 g body weight) were divided into three groups: control (n=8), methionine-enriched (Meth+, 7.7 g of methionine/kg chow, n=7) and methionine- enriched vitamin-deficient (Meth+Vit-, 7.7 g of methionine/ kg chow, deficient in folate, pyridoxine and cobalamine - 0.08, 0.01 and 0.01 mg/kg, n=8). All animals had free access to food and water for 30 days. Behavioural testing was performed using the elevated plus maze (EPM) test. Standard parameters for vertical exploratory activity, the number of rearings and the number of head-dippings, as well as the total exploratory activity (summarizing overall exploratory activity in the EPM) were significantly reduced following 30 days of methionine nutritional overload (p<0.05, p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). A methionine-enriched diet coupled with a reduction in some B vitamins resulted in a more pronounced decline in exploratory drive observed in the EPM test compared to the control (p<0.01). The decline in total exploratory activity associated with vitamin deficiency was significant compared to the Meth+ group (p<0.05). The results of this study highlight the important role of homocysteine in the modulation of exploratory activity in rats. Decreased exploratory drive induced by both a methionine- enriched and vitamin-deficient diet could be attributed to an anxiogenic effect of hyperhomocysteinemia. © 2017, University of Kragujevac, Faculty of Science.

abstract={Animal personality, defined as consistent differences between individuals in behavior, has been the subject of hundreds if not thousands of papers. However, little work explores the fitness consequences of variation in behavior within individuals, or intraindividual variability (IIV). We probe the effects of behavioral IIV on predator-prey interaction outcomes in beach-dwelling jumping spiders (Terralonus californicus). Prior studies have found that spiders with higher body condition (body mass relative to size) behave more variably. Thus, we hypothesized that jumping spider activity level IIV would relate positively to foraging performance. To address this, we tested for associations between activity IIV, average activity level, and two measures of foraging success in laboratory mesocosms: change in spider mass and the number of prey killed. Activity IIV positively correlated with the mass that spiders gained from prey, but not with the number of prey killed. This suggests that spiders with high IIV consumed a greater proportion of their prey or used less energy. Interestingly, average activity level (personality) predicted neither metric of foraging success, indicating that behavioral IIV can predict metrics of success that personality does not. Therefore, our findings suggest that IIV should be considered alongside personality in studies of predator-prey interactions. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Large-scale ungulate migrations result in changes in prey availability for top predators and, as a consequence, can alter predator behavior. Migration may include entire populations of prey species, but often prey populations exhibit partial migration with some individuals remaining resident and others migrating. Interactions of migratory prey and predators have been documented in North America and some other parts of the world, but are poorly studied in South America. We examined the response of pumas (Puma concolor) to seasonal migration of guanacos (Lama guanicoe) in La Payunia Reserve in northern Patagonia Argentina, which is the site of the longest known ungulate migration in South America. More than 15,000 guanacos migrate seasonally in this landscape, and some guanacos also are resident year-round. We hypothesized that pumas would respond to the guanaco migration by consuming more alternative prey rather than migrating with guanacos because of the territoriality of pumas and availability of alternative prey throughout the year at this site. To determine whether pumas moved seasonally with the guanacos, we conducted camera trapping in the summer and winter range of guanacos across both seasons and estimated density of pumas with spatial mark–resight (SMR) models. Also, we analyzed puma scats to assess changes in prey consumption in response to guanaco migration. Density estimates of pumas did not change significantly in the winter and summer range of guanacos when guanacos migrated to and from these areas, indicating that pumas do not follow the migration of guanacos. Pumas also did not consume more alternative native prey or livestock when guanaco availability was lower, but rather fed primarily on guanacos and some alternative prey during all seasons. Alternative prey were most common in the diet during summer when guanacos also were abundant on the summer range. The response of pumas to the migration of guanacos differs from sites in the western North America where entire prey populations migrate and pumas migrate with their prey or switch to more abundant prey when their primary prey migrates. © 2017 Gelin et al.

abstract={Obesity and hyperinsulinemia are risk factors for stroke. We tested the hypothesis that caloric restriction, which reduces the incidence of age-related obesity and metabolic syndrome, may represent an efficient and cost-effective strategy for preventing stroke and its devastating consequences. To this end, we placed aged, obese Sprague-Dawley aged rats on a calorie-restricted diet for 8 weeks prior to the experimental infarction. Stroke in this animal model caused a progressive decrease in weight that reached a minimum at day 6 for the young rats, and at day 10 for the aged, ad libitum-fed rats. However, in aged animals that were calorie-restricted prior to stroke, body weight did not decrease after stroke, but we noted accelerated body weight gain shortly thereafter starting at day 5 poststroke. Moreover, calorie-restricted aged animals showed improved behavioral recovery in tasks requiring complex sensorimotor skills, or in tasks requiring cutaneous sensitivity and sensorimotor integration or spatial memory. Likewise, calorie-restricted aged rats showed significant poststroke increases in serum glucose, insulin, and IGF1 levels, as well as CR-specific changes in the expression of gene transcripts involved in glycogen metabolism, IGF signaling, apoptosis, arteriogenesis, and hypoxia. In conclusion, our study shows that recovery from stroke is enhanced in aged rats by a dietary regimen that reduces body weight prior to infarct. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Background Previous research on Uganda's poststroke population revealed that their level of dietary salt knowledge did not lead to healthier consumption choices. Purpose Identify barriers and motivators for healthy dietary behaviors and evaluate the understanding of widely accepted salt regulation mechanisms among poststroke patients in Uganda. Methods Convergent parallel mixed methods triangulation design comprised a cross-sectional survey (n = 81) and 8 focus group discussions with 7-10 poststroke participants in each group. We assessed participant characteristics and obtained insights into their salt consumption attitudes, perceptions, and knowledge. Qualitative responses were analyzed using an inductive approach with thematic analytic procedures. Relationships between healthy dietary salt compliance, dietary salt knowledge, and participant characteristics were assessed using logistic regression analyses. Results Healthy dietary salt consumption behaviors were associated with basic salt knowledge (P <.0001), but no association was found between compliance and salt disease-related knowledge (P =.314). Only 20% and 7% obtained health-related salt knowledge from their health facility and educational sources, respectively, whereas 44% obtained this information from media personalities; 92% of participants had no understanding of nutrition labels, and only 25% of the study population consumed potash—an inexpensive salt substitute that is both rich in potassium and low in sodium. Conclusion One barrier to healthy dietary consumption choices among Uganda's stroke survivors is a lack of credible disease-related information. Improving health-care provider stroke-related dietary knowledge in Uganda and encouraging the use of potash as a salt substitute would help reduce hypertension and thereby lower the risk of stroke. © 2017 National Stroke Association},

abstract={When exposed to an environment that promotes a sedentary lifestyle and food accessibility, some individuals are at a higher risk of weight gain. This individual difference can be explained by gene–environment interactions. It has been shown that some individuals have a genetic predisposition to obesity. In addition, a genetic component has been associated with eating behaviour traits such as cognitive restraint, disinhibition, and susceptibility to hunger, all of which are also linked to obesity. The purpose of this review article is to present the current state of knowledge on the heritability of specific eating behaviour traits and to then identify the genes associated with these behaviours. The findings show that disinhibition and susceptibility to hunger are 2 eating behaviour traits that are particularly heritable and that several candidate genes are now associated with eating behaviour traits. These findings indicate that we are far from equal when it comes to food and can help professionals better understand the variability observed in an intervention context. Identifying genes associated with eating behaviour traits is crucial to better identify and intervene with people at higher risk of weight gain.},

abstract={The prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity has increased in most countries the last decades. Considering this in a simplistic way, we can say that obesity is the result of an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Moreover, the environment from conception to childhood could influence the child’s future health. The first 1000 days of life start with woman’s pregnancy, and offer a unique window of opportunity to contribute to obesity prevention. In light of the actual literature, the aim of our article is to discuss a proposal of 10 good practices to minimize obesity in the first 1000 days emerging from published science. (1) Both the mother’s and the father’s behaviors are important. A balanced diet with appropriate fat and protein intake, and favoring fruits and vegetables, is recommended for both parents during the conception period and pregnancy. Furthermore, overweight/obese women who are planning to become pregnant should reduce their weight before conception. (2) During pregnancy, at birth, and during early life, body composition measurements are crucial to monitor the baby’s growth. (3) Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended at the beginning of life until six months of age. (4) Four to six months of age is the optimal window to introduce complementary feeding. Until one year of age, breast milk or follow-on/commercial formula is the main recommended feeding source, and cow’s milk should be avoided until one year of age. (5) Fruit and vegetable introduction should begin early. Daily variety, diversity in a meal, and repeated exposure to the food, up to eight times, are efficient strategies to increase acceptance of food not well accepted at first. There is no need to add sugar, salt, or sugary fluids to the diet. (6) Respect the child’s appetite and avoid coercive “clean your plate” feeding practices. Adapt the portion of food and don’t use food as reward for good behavior. (7) Limit animal protein intake in early life to reduce the risk of an early adiposity rebound. Growing-up milk for children between one and three years of age should be preferred to cow’s milk, in order to limit intake and meet essential fatty acid and iron needs. (8) The intake of adequate fat containing essential fatty acids should be promoted. (9) Parents should be role models when feeding, with TV and other screens turned-off during meals. (10) Preventive interventions consisting of promoting physical activity and sufficient time dedicated to sleep should be employed. In fact, short sleep duration may be associated with increased risk of developing obesity. Based on literature reviews, and given the suggestions described in this manuscript, concerted public health efforts are needed to achieve the healthy objectives for obesity and nutrition, and to fight the childhood obesity epidemic. © 2017 by the authors.

abstract={Scientists and laypeople have long expressed concern that animals in non-enriched, unchanging environments might experience boredom. However, this had attracted little empirical study: the state is difficult to assess without verbal self-reports, and spontaneous behavioural signs of boredom can vary in humans, making it hard to identify signs likely to be valid in other species. We operationally define boredom as a negative state induced by barren conditions that causes an increased, generalised interest in diverse stimuli. Previously, we demonstrated that this state existed in mink housed in non-enriched cages, compared to those in preferred, stress-reducing enriched enclosures. Further, in some analyses this heightened interest in stimuli positively correlated with time spent lying still but awake, while negatively correlating with locomotor stereotypic behaviour. However, these results needed replication. The current study tested for the same effects, in a new cohort of 20 male mink, by presenting 11 stimuli ranging from those predicted to typically be aversive (e.g. predator cues) to those predicted to be rewarding (e.g. food rewards; moving objects to chase). Where housing treatments differed, non-enriched mink were again more interested in the stimuli presented, spending longer oriented towards and in contact with them (e.g. for aversive stimuli: F1,9 = 6.27, p = 0.034 and F1,9 = 8.24, p = 0.019, respectively). Lying still but awake again correlated with interest in the stimuli (shorter latencies to contact rewarding stimuli: F1,17 = 3.70, p = 0.036; in enriched mink only, more time oriented to and in contact with all stimuli: F1,8 = 9.49, p = 0.015 and F1,8 = 15.9, p = 0.004). In contrast, the previous correlations with stereotypic behaviour were not replicated. We therefore conclude that mink housed in non-enriched cages likely experience boredom-like states, and that time spent lying still while awake could, at least in some types of housing, potentially be used as a cage-side indicator of these states. We also suggest how future researchers might address further fundamental and practical questions about animal boredom, in mink and other species. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Predators select prey so as to maximize energy and minimize manipulation time. In order to reduce prey detection and handling time, individuals must actively select their foraging space (microhabitat) and populations exhibit morphologies that are best suited for capturing locally available prey. We explored how variation in diet correlates with habitat type, and how these factors influence key morphological structures (mouth gape, eye diameter, fin length, fin area, and pectoral fin ratio) in a common microcarnivorous cryptic reef fish species, the triplefin Helcogrammoides cunninghami. In a mensurative experiment carried out at six kelp-dominated sites, we observed considerable differences in diet along 400 km of the Chilean coast coincident with variation in habitat availability and prey distributions. Triplefins preferred a single prey type (bivalves or barnacles) at northern sites, coincident with a low diversity of foraging habitats. In contrast, southern sites presented varied and heterogeneous habitats, where triplefin diets were more diverse and included amphipods, decapods, and cumaceans. Allometry-corrected results indicated that some morphological structures were consistently correlated with different prey items. Specifically, large mouth gape was associated with the capture of highly mobile prey such as decapods, while small mouth gape was more associated with cumaceans and copepods. In contrast, triplefins that capture sessile prey such as hydroids tend to have larger eyes. Therefore, morphological structures co-vary with habitat selection and prey usage in this species. Our study shows how an abundant generalist reef fish exhibits variable feeding morphologies in response to the distribution of potential habitats and prey throughout its range. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Many territorial animals interact less aggressively with neighbours than with strangers, a phenomenon known as the ‘dear enemy’ effect, although some species show the opposite behaviour. Rock hyraxes, Procavia capensis, are social mammals that communicate via a rich acoustic repertoire. Male hyraxes produce elaborate advertisement calls (i.e. songs) both spontaneously and in response to occasional attention-grabbing events (e.g. pup screams, agonistic interaction), as well as to conspecific male songs. When replying to conspecific songs, male hyraxes tend to respond more to familiar males than to strangers, reflecting the ‘nasty neighbour’ effect. Our study relates to the general question of why some species respond aggressively towards neighbours, while others are more aggressive towards strangers. We hypothesized that male hyraxes eventually familiarize themselves with a stranger, subsequently perceiving its intentions as highly threatening and deserving of a vocal response. To simulate the presence of a stranger in the area we exposed wild hyrax groups to playbacks of natural songs of unfamiliar hyraxes. Male rock hyraxes became more likely to reply to a stranger's song over time, but this was independent of the number of times they heard the song. This suggests that either (1) the threat presented by a stranger increases when it is no longer perceived as transient or (2) because listeners do not physically encounter the stranger, they perceive replying aggressively as a low-risk response. Our work implies that species may demonstrate a range of condition-dependent behaviours instead of a dichotomy between the ‘nasty neighbour’ and ‘dear enemy’ strategies. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Scope: Maternal consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) during pregnancy increases the risk of behavioral problems. Folate plays an important role in neuroplasticity and the preservation of neuronal integrity. This study aims at determining the influence of diets supplemented with folate on offspring behavior, and the mechanisms involved. Methods and results: Female mice were fed a control diet, an HFD, control diet supplemented with folate, or an HFD supplemented with folate for 5 weeks before mating. Open field task and elevated plus maze are used to evaluate the offspring behaviors. Results showed that offspring cognitive performance and anxiety-related behaviors, including those related to open field exploration and elevated plus maze, were significantly improved when dams were treated with folate in pregnancy. Moreover, the maternal folate supplement decreased BDNF and Grin2b methylation and upregulated their expressions in the brain of offspring, which were associated with decreasing the expression of DNA methyltransferases compared with those dams were treated only HFD in pregnancy. Conclusion: Maternal folate supplementation ameliorates behavior disorders induced by prenatal high-fat diet. The beneficial effects were associated with methylation and expression alteration of BDNF and Grin2b genes. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim},

abstract={Childhood malnutrition is a risk factor for mental disorders, such as major depression and anxiety. Evidence shows that similar early life adversities induce sex-dependent epigenetic reprogramming. However, little is known about how genes are specifically affected by early malnutrition and the implications for males and females respectively. One relevant target is neuropeptide Y (NPY), which regulates both stress and food-intake. We studied maternal low protein diet (LPD) during pregnancy/lactation in mice. Male, but not female, offspring of LPD mothers consistently displayed anxiety- and depression-like behaviors under acute stress. Transcriptome-wide analysis of the effects of acute stress in the amygdala, revealed a list of transcription factors affected by either sex or perinatal LPD. Among these immediate early genes (IEG), members of the Early growth response family (Egr1/2/4) were consistently upregulated by perinatal LPD in both sexes. EGR1 also bound the NPY receptor Y1 gene (Npy1r), which co-occurred with sex-specific effects of perinatal LPD on both Npy1r DNA-methylation and gene transcription. Our proposed pathway connecting early malnutrition, sex-independent regulatory changes in Egr1, and sex-specific epigenetic reprogramming of its effector gene, Npy1r, represents the first molecular evidence of how early life risk factors may generate sex-specific epigenetic effects relevant for mental disorders. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Although reproductive strategies can be influenced by a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, life history theory provides a rigorous framework for explaining variation in reproductive effort. The terminal investment hypothesis proposes that a decreased expectation of future reproduction (as might arise from a mortality threat) should precipitate increased investment in current reproduction. Terminal investment has been widely studied, and a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic cues that elicit such a response have been identified across an array of taxa. Although terminal investment is often treated as a static strategy, the level at which a cue of decreased future reproduction is sufficient to trigger increased current reproductive effort (i.e., the terminal investment threshold) may depend on the context, including the internal state of the organism or its current external environment, independent of the cue that triggers a shift in reproductive investment. Here, we review empirical studies that address the terminal investment hypothesis, exploring both the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that mediate its expression. Based on these studies, we propose a novel framework within which to view the strategy of terminal investment, incorporating factors that influence an individual’s residual reproductive value beyond a terminal investment trigger—the dynamic terminal investment threshold. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Prior work has suggested a paradoxical positive relationship between the risk behavior alcohol use and the health behavior exercise, particularly in young adults. Though seldom tested, different theoretical perspectives exist on the mechanisms that may explain the positive relationship. The aims of this study were to test theorized mechanisms of association, including common causes shared by both behaviors (e.g., personality, motives, affective), compensatory processes such as exercising to compensate for calories from alcohol consumption, and methodological confounds (e.g., between vs. within subject effects) in a college sample (N = 132; 56.3% male; 76% Caucasian; Mage = 19.15, SD = 0.99) using a cross-sectional design and time line follow back methods. A positive, between-subjects association between alcohol and exercise was found and explained by exercising to compensate for calories of alcohol consumption, enhancement motives, and physical activity enjoyment. However, we also observed a significant and negative within-subjects association between the two constructs, suggesting that, on a given day, individuals who exercise more tended to drink less. Furthermore, individuals who exercised more during the week tended to have declines in weekend drinking over time. Results suggest a complex relationship between exercise and alcohol use among young adults, and highlight the importance of distinguishing between and within subject processes, as well as the temporal ordering of the two behaviors. Implications are discussed in regard to theory, prevention, and intervention. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Background Influenza continues to have a substantial socioeconomic and health impact despite a long established vaccination programme and approved antivirals. Preclinical data suggest that combining antivirals might be more effective than administering oseltamivir alone in the treatment of influenza. Methods We did a randomised, double-blind, multicentre phase 2 trial of a combination of oseltamivir, amantadine, and ribavirin versus oseltamivir monotherapy with matching placebo for the treatment of influenza in 50 sites, consisting of academic medical centre clinics, emergency rooms, and private physician offices in the USA, Thailand, Mexico, Argentina, and Australia. Participants who were aged at least 18 years with influenza and were at increased risk of complications were randomly assigned (1:1) by an online computer-generated randomisation system to receive either oseltamivir (75 mg), amantadine (100 mg), and ribavirin (600 mg) combination therapy or oseltamivir monotherapy twice daily for 5 days, given orally, and participants were followed up for 28 days. Blinded treatment kits were used to achieve masking of patients and staff. The primary endpoint was the percentage of participants with virus detectable by PCR in nasopharyngeal swab at day 3, and was assessed in participants who were randomised, had influenza infection confirmed by the central laboratory on a baseline nasopharyngeal sample, and had received at least one dose of study drug. Safety assessment was done in all patients in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01227967. Findings Between March 1, 2011, and April 29, 2016, 633 participants were randomly assigned to receive combination antiviral therapy (n=316) or monotherapy (n=317). Seven participants were excluded from analysis: three were not properly randomised, three withdrew from the study, and one was lost to follow-up. The primary analysis included 394 participants, excluding 47 in the pilot phase, 172 without confirmed influenza, and 13 without an endpoint sample. 80 (40·0%) of 200 participants in the combination group had detectable virus at day 3 compared with 97 (50·0%) of 194 (mean difference 10·0, 95% CI 0·2–19·8, p=0·046) in the monotherapy group. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal-related disorders, primarily nausea (65 [12%] of 556 reported adverse events in the combination group vs 63 [11%] of 585 reported adverse events in the monotherapy group), diarrhoea (56 [10%] of 556 vs 64 [11%] of 585), and vomiting (39 [7%] of 556 vs 23 [4%] of 585). There was no benefit in multiple clinical secondary endpoints, such as median duration of symptoms (4·5 days in the combination group vs 4·0 days in the monotherapy group; p=0·21). One death occurred in the study in an elderly participant in the monotherapy group who died of cardiovascular failure 13 days after randomisation, judged by the site investigator as not related to study intervention. Interpretation Although combination treatment showed a significant decrease in viral shedding at day 3 relative to monotherapy, this difference was not associated with improved clinical benefit. More work is needed to understand why there was no clinical benefit when a difference in virological outcome was identified.

abstract={Background: Early childhood temperament is increasingly recognized as an important attribute that may impact screen time use, outdoor play and childhood obesity. The relationship between temperament and nutrition in preschool children is less clear. Objective: The objective of the study is to investigate if temperament dimensions (negative affectivity, effortful control and surgency) in early childhood are associated with nutritional risk factors. Methods: Six hundred seventy-eight children were followed (mean age at baseline visit 3.1 years; mean time to follow-up 16.5 months). Parents reported on child temperament and nutritional risk factors during regularly scheduled well-child clinic visits. Results: A mixed effect model demonstrated a significant association between higher negative affectivity (1.03; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.37) and higher effortful control (−0.88; 95% CI −1.27 to −0.49) on concurrent nutritional risk, independent of covariates. Multivariate linear regression analysis identified that higher effortful control, and not negative affectivity, was significantly associated with a decrease in nutritional risk (−0.67; 95% CI −1.10 to −0.24) over time, independent of covariates. There was no relationship identified between surgency and nutritional risk. Conclusion: Three-year-old children with higher effortful control had reduced nutritional risk at 5 years of age. Future nutritional risk prevention strategies may benefit from interventions to increase effortful control in early childhood. © 2016 World Obesity Federation},

abstract={Background: The olfactory system enables organisms to detect chemical cues in the environment and can signal the availability of food or the presence of a predator. Appropriate behavioral responses to these chemical cues are therefore important for organismal survival and can influence traits such as organismal life span and food consumption. However, understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying odor-guided behavior, correlated responses in other traits, and how these constrain or promote their evolution, remain an important challenge. Here, we performed artificial selection for attractive and aversive behavioral responses to four chemical compounds, two aromatics (4-ethylguaiacol and 4-methylphenol) and two esters (methyl hexanoate and ethyl acetate), for thirty generations. Results: Artificial selection for odor-guided behavior revealed symmetrical responses to selection for each of the four chemical compounds. We then investigated whether selection for odor-guided behavior resulted in correlated responses in life history traits and/or food consumption. We found changes in food consumption upon selection for behavioral responses to aromatics. In many cases, lines selected for increased attraction to aromatics showed an increase in food consumption. We then performed RNA sequencing of lines selected for responses to 4-ethylguaiacol to identify candidate genes associated with odor-guided behavior and its impact on food consumption. We identified 91 genes that were differentially expressed among lines, many of which were associated with metabolic processes. RNAi-mediated knockdown of select candidate genes further supports their role in odor-guided behavior and/or food consumption. Conclusions: This study identifies novel genes underlying variation in odor-guided behavior and further elucidates the genetic mechanisms underlying the interrelationship between olfaction and feeding. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Understanding the background mechanisms affecting the emergence and maintenance of consistent between-individual variation within population in single (animal personality) or across multiple (behavioural syndrome) behaviours has key importance. State-dependence theory suggests that behaviour is ‘anchored’ to individual state (e.g. body condition, gender, age) and behavioural consistency emerges through behavioural-state feedbacks. A number of relevant state variables are labile (e.g. body condition, physiological performance) and expected to be affected by short-term environmental change. Yet, whether short-term environmental shifts affect behavioural consistency during adulthood remains questionable. Here, by employing a full-factorial laboratory experiment, we explored if quantity of food (low vs. high) and time available for thermoregulation (3h vs. 10h per day) had an effect on activity and risk-taking of reproductive adult male European green lizards (Lacerta viridis). We focussed on different components of behavioural variation: (i) strength of behavioural consistency (repeatability for animal personality; between-individual correlation for behavioural syndrome), (ii) behavioural type (individual mean behaviour) and (iii) behavioural predictability (within-individual behavioural variation). Activity was repeatable in all treatments. Risk-taking was repeatable only in the low basking treatments. We found significant between-individual correlation only in the low food × long basking time group. The treatments did not affect behavioural type, but affected behavioural predictability. Activity predictability was higher in the short basking treatment, where it also decreased with size ( age). Risk-taking predictability in the short basking treatment increased with size under food limitation, but decreased when food supply was high. We conclude that short-term environmental change can alter various components of behavioural consistency. The effect could be detected in the presence/absence patterns of animal personality and behavioural syndrome and the level of individual behavioural predictability, but not in behavioural type. © 2017 Horváth et al.

abstract={The expression of different behavioral components in the adult rat depends on a number of early influences, including age, hormones, manipulations of sensory cues, and perinatal undernutrition, all of which impact the development of brain areas underlying adaptive processes, maternal behavior, and the response to novelty. The current study investigates the effects of pre- and neonatal undernutrition on various components of maternal behavior of dams exposed to the challenge of an unfamiliar home cage on days 4, 8, and 12 of lactation. Food restriction was initiated from gestational day (G) G6 to G19 when dams received 50–70% of the normal balanced diet, followed by 100% from G20 to G21. After birth, pups were underfed by alternating every 12 h between two lactating dams, one of which, had ligated nipples. Weaning was at 25 days of age followed by an ad libitum diet until postpartum day 90, when females were mated, and subsequently tested for maternal behavior in an unfamiliar cage. The results indicated that in early underfed mothers the frequency of handling wood shavings and of, approaching, licking, crouching, and grasping pups for retrieval was significantly reduced. Moreover, self-grooming increased substantially in the underfed dams, but the frequency of rearing was reduced. Additionally, the body weight of pups nursed by early underfed dams was significantly lower than that of control pups. These findings suggest a relation between early food restriction and the deficient maternal care observed when these dams were challenged by exposure to an unfamiliar home cage. © 2017 ISDN},

abstract={Abstract: The early life stage is typically a selective bottleneck during which individual performance is important for survival. We investigated size, energetic state, and activity, in relation to recapture probability in the youngest free-swimming stage of a territorial fish, the brown trout. In two experiments, we induced compensatory growth in wild-caught brown trout fry, using a restriction-refeeding protocol. Upon refeeding in the laboratory, the restricted trout showed compensatory growth in mass, but not in length. During this compensatory growth phase, we released the fish into their native stream habitat and then recaptured them after 1 month to assess survival and growth. Despite not having fully compensated body size at release, restricted fish did not show continued growth compensation in the stream, indicating that the natural environment limits growth capacity during early life. Individual baseline activity was scored in open-field tests before and after food restriction and was found repeatable but not significantly affected by growth manipulations. Under natural conditions, we found a positive association between open-field activity and survival (as indicated by recapture probability), but no significant differences between food-restricted and control fish. Initial body length positively influenced survival in the first experiment (early summer), but not in the second (late summer). These results contrast with the assumption that high baseline activity should be riskier in natural environments. For territorial animals, we hypothesize that activity is associated with high aggression and territoriality, which facilitates access to high-quality territories providing both shelter from predation and reduced starvation risk, which reduces mortality risk. Significance statement: In the early critical life stage, more active brown trout are better survivors. This finding, which contradicts general assumptions about the balance between predator exposure and food intake, could possibly be due to trout being highly territorial species in which active individuals can claim the best territories. We also find that young trout are likely limited in growth rate by environmental conditions in the wild, as growth compensation following food restriction is possible in the lab, but not realized in natural streams. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

abstract={The presence of gray wolves (Canis lupus) can directly and indirectly affect beef cattle (Bos taurus) production on rangelands of the Northern Rocky Mountains. While fairly extensive knowledge exists for the direct effects of wolf predation threat (e.g., cattle death and injury losses, elevated stress), our understanding of wolf-caused changes in cattle behavior and the associated cascade of potential indirect effects on cattle resource selection, diet quality, activity budgets, and energetic relationships is still largely in its infancy. We investigated whether wolf presence affected the daily travel distance of Global Positioning System (GPS) - collared cattle under a replicated, Impact-Control study conducted in western Idaho and northeastern Oregon during 2008 - 2012. Cattle in three Control (Oregon) study areas, where wolf presence was consistently low, traveled farther per day (13.7 ± 0.396 SE km day-1) than those in three Impact (Idaho) study areas (11.4 ± 0.396 SE km day-1) with moderate to high wolf presence. At Control study areas, cattle traveled farthest per day in July (13.2 ± 0.355 SE km day-1) and were least mobile in October (11.8 ± 0.365 SE km day-1), but daily travel distances were similar across all months for cattle in Impact study areas. This observational study provides evidence suggesting cattle in mountainous grazing areas alter their spatial behavior in response to gray wolf presence. These behavioral changes have energetic consequences that could potentially impact cattle productivity and ranch economics. Additional research into the activity budget and resource selection responses of these collared cattle is required to better understand the specific mechanisms behind these daily travel distance results. © Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Society for Range Management.},

abstract={Objective: Anxiety is a risk factor for disordered eating, but the mechanisms by which anxiety promotes disordered eating are poorly understood. One possibility is local versus global cognitive processing style, defined as a relative tendency to attend to details at the expense of the “big picture.” Anxiety may narrow attention, in turn, enhancing local and/or compromising global processing. We examined relationships between global/local processing style, anxiety, and disordered eating behaviors in a transdiagnostic outpatient clinical sample. We hypothesized that local (vs. global) processing bias would mediate the relationship between anxiety and disordered eating behaviors. Method: Ninety-three participants completed the eating disorder examination—questionnaire (EDE-Q), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)—trait subscale, and the Navon task (a test of processing style in which large letters are composed of smaller letters both congruent and incongruent with the large letter). The sample was predominantly female (95%) with a mean age of 27.4 years (SD = 12.1 years). Results: Binge eating, but not fasting, purging, or excessive exercise, was correlated with lower levels of global processing style. There was a significant indirect effect between anxiety and binge eating via reduced global level global/local processing. Discussion: In individuals with disordered eating, being more generally anxious may encourage a detailed-oriented bias, preventing individuals from maintaining the bigger picture and making them more likely to engage in maladaptive behaviors (e.g., binge eating). © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Personality-dependent dispersal is a key ecological and evolutionary process that is likely to facilitate the successful movement and colonization/invasion success of species. This dispersal syndrome suggests that dispersers should possess a suite of behavioural tendencies that differ from those of nondispersers, thus influencing the composition of populations in the new range and, ultimately, colonization success. However, dispersal is also often condition dependent, and is probably mediated by the interaction between an individual's personality and environmental and social factors such as competition. Accordingly, we investigated whether dispersal tendency was linked to an activity, exploration and social syndrome and/or aggression in a reptile, the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata, which has had a successful invasion history via accidental introductions. Contrary to our prediction, we found that dispersal was not related to activity, exploration or social personality traits. Instead, dispersal tendency was associated with aggression: the most aggressive individuals dispersed further and faster than less aggressive individuals. The presence of aggression-dependent dispersal could be due to either (1) dispersers generally being more aggressive than nondispersers or (2) aggressive individuals forcing nonaggressive individuals into hiding, thus impinging on the ability of subordinates to disperse regardless of their personality. Our study highlights the need to consider the ecological context when examining personality-dependent dispersal and suggests that aggression and the social environment can play an important role in dispersal decisions. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Escape-response behaviour is essential to ensure an individual's survival during a predator attack, however, these behaviours are energetically costly and may cause oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can be reduced by supplementing an individual's diet with exogenous antioxidants or through regular moderate exercise training, which stimulates the upregulation of the endogenous antioxidant system. Two studies have tested the simultaneous effects of dietary antioxidant supplementation and exercise training on animal escape-response behaviour. The present study investigated the effects of dietary carotenoids and exercise training on the escape-response behaviour of Southern Corroboree frogs. Frogs were fed either a carotenoid-supplemented or unsupplemented diet and were exposed to repeated escape-response trials (training) for five consecutive weeks. Carotenoid-supplemented individuals outperformed unsupplemented individuals in initial hopping speed, length of the first hop and hopping distance, however, the performance of frogs in each treatment group became statistically similar after training. Within treatment groups, exercise training significantly improved the hopping speed of unsupplemented frogs, with speeds almost doubling between training weeks one and five. By contrast, exercise training did not significantly improve the hopping speed of carotenoid-supplemented frogs. Our results provide some of the first evidence that exercise training improves escape performance, and that dietary antioxidants may inhibit training-induced benefits. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Sterculia apetala (order: Malvales, family: Sterculiaceae) seed oil contains two cyclopropene fatty acids: sterculic and malvalic acid. Both positive and negative effects have been associated with the consumption of sterculic oil. In Mexico, S. apetala seeds are consumed after being boiled or roasted, used as chocolate flavoring, and utilized as animal fodder. Therefore, it is important to evaluate whether the consumption of this seed has a negative impact on the organism. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of administration of sterculic oil, during an 8-week period, on anxiety-like behavior and spontaneous locomotor activity in Zucker rats, analyzed through light/dark and open-field tests. The results showed that the consumption of sterculic oil decreased exploration latency in light/dark tests, which suggests an anxiolytic-like effect. Alterations in time spent on rearing and grooming were present in open-field tests, but this was not statistically significant, discarding nonspecific motor alterations. The alterations found in this study are possibly related to intrinsic obesity and metabolic complications present in the Zucker rat model, where leptin plays an important role in animal mood, more so than sterculic oil consumption. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. and Korean Society of Food Science and Nutrition 2017.},

abstract={High-throughput experiments are becoming increasingly common, and scientists must balance hypothesis-driven experiments with genome-wide data acquisition. We sought to predict novel genes involved in Drosophila learning and long-term memory from existing public high-throughput data. We performed an analysis using PILGRM, which analyzes public gene expression compendia using machine learning. We evaluated the top prediction alongside genes involved in learning and memory in IMP, an interface for functional relationship networks. We identified Grunge/Atrophin (Gug/Atro), a transcriptional repressor, histone deacetylase, as our top candidate. We find, through multiple, distinct assays, that Gug has an active role as a modulator of memory retention in the fly and its function is required in the adult mushroom body. Depletion of Gug specifically in neurons of the adult mushroom body, after cell division and neuronal development is complete, suggests that Gug function is important for memory retention through regulation of neuronal activity, and not by altering neurodevelopment. Our study provides a previously uncharacterized role for Gug as a possible regulator of neuronal plasticity at the interface of memory retention and memory extinction. © 2017 Kacsoh et al.},

abstract={Abstract: Personality and innovativeness are predicted to drive important functional behaviours that can influence life history strategies within populations. For example, the reactive-proactive personality axis is thought to reflect the ‘pace of life’ syndrome and predicts correlation with foraging; empirical evidence also suggests a positive correlation with routine-like behaviour. Similarly, the adaptive innovation hypothesis predicts that innovators may have a higher food intake when novel foraging opportunities arise, and that they should have a more diverse range of foraging tactics. Experimental tests of these hypotheses are limited. We conducted standardized assays of exploratory behaviour (an index of the reactive-proactive axis) and innovative problem-solving performance on wild-captured great tits, Parus major, temporarily brought into captivity from different woodland types. To test for dietary preferences, birds were provided with three different types of food, and their daily energy intake measured. We found no evidence of a significant relationship between exploratory behaviour and the amount of calories ingested. However, fast-exploring great tits consumed a higher proportion of sunflower seeds, while slower individuals preferred peanuts. Problem-solving performance was positively correlated with energy intake but not food preference. Peanuts accounted for a larger proportion of total daily energy intake for coniferous birds, which also lost more weight on average. Our results illustrate that a complex array of factors can determine foraging behaviour and success, including personality, innovativeness, state variables, time, and habitat origin. This highlights the challenge of explaining how selection acts on foraging performance over time. Significance statement: Experimental tests assessing how personality and innovativeness drive functional behaviour within populations are limited. We studied these links by means of exploratory behaviour and innovative problem-solving performance tests in relation to food preference and energy intake in wild-captured great tits, Parus major, from two different habitats. Personality was related to dietary preference (fast explorers consumed a higher proportion of sunflower seeds, while slower individuals preferred peanuts), and problem-solving was related to energy intake. Moreover, we found differential diet selection between coniferous and deciduous birds. Our results show that foraging behaviour and body mass are driven by multiple factors, including personality, innovativeness, and habitat origin. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

abstract={Obesity affects more than 35% of Americans, increasing the risk of more than 200 comorbid conditions, impaired quality of life and premature mortality. This review aimed to summarize literature published over the past 15 years regarding the prevalence and impact of obesity in people with haemophilia (PWH) and to discuss implementing general guidelines for weight management in the context of the haemophilia comprehensive care team. Although few studies have assessed the effects of obesity on haemophilia-specific outcomes, existing evidence indicates an important impact of weight status on lower extremity joint range of motion and functional disability, with potentially important effects on overall quality of life. Data regarding bleeding tendency in PWH with coexisting obesity are largely inconclusive; however, some individuals may experience reduced joint bleeds following moderate weight loss. Additionally, conventional weight-based dosing of factor replacement therapy leads to increased treatment costs for PWH with obesity or overweight, suggesting pharmacoeconomic benefits of weight loss. Evidence-based recommendations for weight loss include behavioural strategies to reduce caloric intake and increase physical activity, pharmacotherapy and surgical therapy in appropriate patients. Unique considerations in PWH include bleed-related risks with physical activity; thus, healthcare professionals should advise patients on types and intensities of, and approaches to, physical activity, how to adjust treatment to accommodate exercise and how to manage potential activity-related bleeding. Increasing awareness of these issues may improve identification of PWH with coexisting obesity and referral to appropriate specialists, with potentially wide-ranging benefits in overall health and well-being. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={This study explored Pasifika peoples' understandings of Deliberate Self-Harm (DSH) based on the perspective of Pacific health professionals in New Zealand. A total of 20 informants were interviewed using semi-structured Talanoa methods. Informants held professional roles in the mental health, social and addiction sectors in Auckland, (female, n = 10, male, n = 10). DSH was defined as an intentional act of inflicting harm to the physical, mental or spiritual self, and served separate functions from suicidal intent. DSH was defined to include both direct self-harm, as well as indirect forms of self-harm over time including, alcohol and drug misuse, gambling, self-starvation and risk taking behaviours. Intentional harm to the spiritual or the mental self included deliberate disconnection from spiritual faith and holding adverse perspectives and worldviews. Conclusion: Based on the findings it is recommended that a) DSH may be acknowledged as a behaviour that can be separated from suicide in terms of functionality, b) the present clinical DSH diagnosis criteria should include Pacific definitions of DSH, c) best-practice clinical treatment guidelines should accordingly be reviewed to incorporate treatment that encapsulate DSH behaviours relevant to Pacific people, and finally, d) researchers need to adopt operational definitions that reflects Pacific conceptualisations of DSH when conducting studies with Pacific communities in New Zealand. © The material published in this issue is copyright to the New Zealand Psychological Society.},

abstract={The harmful use of alcohol is a component cause for more than 200 diseases. The association between alcohol consumption, risk taking behavior and a range of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS is well established. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS as well as harmful alcohol use in low and middle income countries is high. Alcohol has been identified as a modifiable risk factor in the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. The objective of this paper is to define research priorities for the interaction of alcohol and HIV/AIDS in low and middle income countries. The Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) priority setting methodology was applied in order to assess research priorities of the interaction of alcohol and HIV/AIDS. A group of 171 global and local experts in the field of alcohol and or HIV/AIDS related research were identified and invited to generate research questions. This resulted in 205 research questions which have been categorized and refined by senior researchers into 48 research questions to be evaluated using five criteria: answerability, effectiveness, feasibility, applicability and impact, as well as equity. A total of 59 experts participated independently in the voluntary scoring exercise (a 34% response rate). There was substantial consensus among experts on priorities for research on alcohol and HIV. These tended to break down into two categories, those focusing on better understanding the nexus between alcohol and HIV and those directed towards informing practical interventions to reduce the impact of alcohol use on HIV treatment outcomes, which replicates what Bryant (Subst Use Misuse 41:1465–1507, 2006) and Parry et al. (Addiction 108:1–2, 2012) found. Responses from experts were stratified by location in order to determine any differences between groups. On average experts in the LMIC gave higher scores than the HIC experts. Recent research has shown the causal link between alcohol consumption and the incidence of HIV/AIDS including a better understanding of the pathways through which alcohol use affects ARV adherence (and other medications to treat opportunistic infections) and CD4 counts. The results of this process clearly indicated that the important priorities for future research related to the development and assessment of interventions focusing on addressing alcohol and HIV/AIDS, addressing and exploring the impact of HIV risk and comorbid alcohol use, as well as exploring the risk and protective factors in the field of alcohol and HIV/AIDS. The findings from this priority setting exercise could guide international research agenda and make research funding more effective in addressing the research on intersection of alcohol and HIV/AIDS. © 2017, The Author(s).},

In this review, we discuss how personality traits, mood states, and lifestyle impact brain and behaviour in older adults. Specifically, our review shows that these lifestyle and personality factors affect several brain regions, including the hippocampus, a region key for memory that is affected by cognitive decline in old age as well as AD.

abstract={Despite recent progress on neural pathways underlying individual behaviors, how an animal balances and prioritizes behavioral outputs remains poorly understood. While studying the relationship between hunger-induced feeding and pup-induced maternal behaviors in virgin female mice, we made the unexpected discovery that presence of pups strongly delayed and decreased food consumption. Strikingly, presence of pups also suppressed feeding induced by optogenetic activation of Agrp neurons. Such a suppressive effect inversely correlated with the extents of maternal behaviors, but did not rely on the display of these behaviors, and was also present in virgin males. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of Vglut2+ neurons in the medial preoptic area (mPOA), a region critical for maternal behaviors and motivation, was sufficient to suppress hunger-induced feeding. However, muscimol inhibition of the mPOA, while disrupting maternal behaviors, did not prevent pup suppression of feeding, indicating that neural pathways in other brain regions may also mediate such an effect. Together, these results provide novel insights into neural coordination of pup care and feeding in mice and organizations of animal behaviors in general. © 2017},

abstract={Objective: Several dietary supplements are actively being tested for their dual role of alleviating the metabolic perturbations and restricting the consequent cognitive dysfunctions seen in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the current study was to assess the influence of aqueous extract of cinnamon (CE) on the monosodium glutamate-induced non-transgenic rat model of AD (NTAD) established with insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia, neuronal loss, and cognitive impairment at a very early stage of life. Methods: The experimental design included oral administration of CE (50 mg/kg body weight) for 20 weeks to 2-month and 10-month-old NTAD rats. Following the treatments, the animals attained 7 and 15 months of age, respectively. They were then subjected to behavioural testing, biochemical analysis, and stereology experiments. Results: The results demonstrated that CE treatment improved the insulin sensitivity, increased phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3β (pGSK3β), inhibited the cholinesterase activity, and improved the learning ability in NTAD rats. Histological evaluation has shown an increase in neuron count in the DG sub-field of hippocampus upon treatment with CE. Discussion: These beneficial effects of CE are suggestive of considering cinnamon as a dietary supplement in modulating the metabolic changes and cognitive functions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Feed deprivation has deleterious effects on fish behavior and stress physiology which may susceptible them to disease outbreak. Functional ingredients in diets may substantially impact the physiology and stress responses of host organisms. Here, we hypothesized that the administration of a dietary prebiotic might attenuate the negative influences of feed deprivation on the behavioral profile of anxiety and physiological responses to stress in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Fish were fed with either basal or mannan-oligosaccharide supplemented (0.4% MOS/kg diet) diets, once per day (normal-control: CN, and normal-prebiotic: PN) or once every other day (starved-control: CS, and starved-prebiotic: PS) for 8 weeks. Afterwards, fish were subjected to a novel tank test to measure anxiety. Fish from the CS treatment exhibited more pronounced bottom-dwelling behavior than the other treatments. The number of transitions from the bottom to the top third of the novel tank was significantly higher in PN fish than the CS specimens. No significant differences were found between the CN and PS treatments in all of the anxiety behaviors. CS fish showed higher baseline cortisol levels than the other treatments, which was in line with higher expression of CRH gene in fish subjected to this treatment. Cortisol levels and CRH gene expression of the subjects were also measured after induction of two routine aquaculture stressors. CN and PS fish exhibited similar patterns of cortisol responses at most of the sampling times after stress, and PN specimens showed a significantly lower concentration of cortisol than the other treatments in most cases. Expression of the CRH gene was higher in feed deprived fish immediately after stress induction. Overall, the results show that feed deprivation in some cases influenced anxiety-like behaviors and elevated stress response in zebrafish juveniles; however, the addition of MOS to the diet helped deprived fish exhibit behaviors more typical of normally fed animals. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Empirical studies imply that sex-specific genetic architectures can resolve evolutionary conflicts between males and females, and thereby facilitate the evolution of sexual dimorphism. Sex-specificity of behavioural genetic architectures has, however, rarely been considered. Moreover, as the expression of genetic (co)variances is often environment-dependent, general inferences on sex-specific genetic architectures require estimates of quantitative genetics parameters under multiple conditions.We measured exploration and aggression in pedigreed populations of southern field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) raised on either naturally balanced (free-choice) or imbalanced (protein-deprived) diets. For each dietary condition, we measured for each behavioural trait (i) level of sexual dimorphism, (ii) level of sex-specificity of survival selection gradients, (iii) level of sex-specificity of additive genetic variance, and (iv) strength of the cross-sex genetic correlation.We report here evidence for sexual dimorphism in behaviour as well as sex-specificity in the expression of genetic (co)variances as predicted by theory. The additive genetic variances of exploration and aggression were significantly greater in males compared with females. Cross-sex genetic correlations were highly positive for exploration but deviating (significantly) from one for aggression; findings were consistent across dietary treatments. This suggests that genetic architectures characterize the sexually dimorphic focal behaviours across various key environmental conditions in the wild. Our finding also highlights that sexual conflict can be resolved by evolving sexually independent genetic architectures. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Many prey react to predation risk by altering their phenotype to reduce their chances of being consumed but incur reductions in growth and fecundity when reacting to predators. To determine when to produce defenses, prey collect information and evaluate the costs and benefits of defense induction. Resource availability can affect prey ability and willingness to incur defense costs. When resources are scarce, defenses may suffer disproportionate decreases in energy allocation if defenses would further reduce prey access to resources or if resources are needed to maintain metabolic functions. We tested the effects of predation risk and resource availability on plastic defenses in eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica and present novel findings that oysters continued to produce defended shells in response to predators when resources were limited, even though they grew smaller, lighter shells when deprived of food in control conditions. Predation risk affected all three tested shell metrics (area, weight, and strength), but food availability did not. Although low food levels often limit expression of predator defenses, predator cues caused oysters to build shells that were larger and heavier, with a similar trend for shell strength, in treatments with both low and high food levels, suggesting that predation is an important pressure in this system. The differences between predator and control treatments were greater under conditions of low food availability, and thus, resource availability may influence interpretations of plastic responses to predators. © 2017 The University of Chicago.},

abstract={The exploratory behaviour and the ability of capuchin monkeys to use tools allows them to thrive at times and places of limited food and water abundance, such as in semi-arid environments. Here, we report the behaviours employed by individuals belonging to a wild group of bearded capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus) to access natural water sources in a dry forest of north-eastern Brazil. An adult female employed a twig as a tool and her tail to gain access to accumulated rainwater in a tree hole, and other individuals used their hands and mouth to manipulate orchids' pseudobulbs and the liquid endosperm of palm nuts. The behaviour of wild Sapajus to access water from non-food sources may enable them to circumvent the risk of dehydration in environments with reduced availability of fleshy fruits and with ephemeral and rare water sources. Our findings contribute to the still scarce but accumulating reports on primate drinking behaviour and to the knowledge of tool use in wild populations of capuchin monkeys, enriching our understanding of primate strategies to gain access to a vital resource under challenging conditions. © 2017 S.

abstract={Epidemiological studies reveal associations between obesity/metabolic syndrome and mood disorders. We assessed behavioural changes in rats fed diets enriched in fat and fructose in different proportions and correlated the observed alterations with biochemical changes induced by the diets. Three groups of rats were used as follows: control (C) animals fed regular rat chow, rats fed high-fat diet (HF) and rats fed high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFHF). HF and HFHF animals were also given a 10% fructose solution as drinking water. Behavioural and biochemical parameters were determined. Anxiety was measured by the open-field and the social interaction test. Depression-like behaviour was evaluated by the forced swimming test. The object recognition test was utilized to assess effects on memory. Diet-exposed animals displayed signs of anxiety in the open-field (HF rats had reduced central time; HFHF rats had reduced number of central entries) and in the social interaction test (decreased time of interaction in HF group). In the forced swimming test, the immobility time was prolonged in the HFHF group. While different measures of anxiety scores correlated with visceral adiposity and dyslipidemia, results from both social interaction and forced swimming tests were significantly associated with lipid peroxidation, which in turn also correlated with the metabolic parameters. The experimental diets did not affect the object recognition memory. Both experimental diets induced metabolic derangements in rats and provoked similar anxiety- and depression-like behaviours. Lipid peroxidation seems to play a role in translating diet-induced metabolic alterations into behavioural disorders. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={The risk of both predation and food level has been shown to affect phenotypic development of organisms. However, these two factors also influence animal behavior that in turn may influence phenotypic development. Hence, it might be difficult to disentangle the behavioral effect from the predator or resource-level effects. This is because the presence of predators and high resource levels usually results in a lower activity, which in turn affects energy expenditure that is used for development and growth. It is therefore necessary to study how behavior interacts with changes in body shape with regard to resource density and predators. Here, we use the classic predator-induced morphological defense in fish to study the interaction between predator cues, resource availability, and behavioral activity with the aim to determine their relative contribution to changes in body shape. We show that all three variables, the presence of a predator, food level, and activity, both additively and interactively, affected the body shape of perch. In general, the presence of predators, lower swimming activity, and higher food levels induced a deep body shape, with predation and behavior having similar effect and food treatment the smallest effect. The shape changes seemed to be mediated by changes in growth rate as body condition showed a similar effect as shape with regard to food-level and predator treatments. Our results suggests that shape changes in animals to one environmental factor, for example, predation risk, can be context dependent, and depend on food levels or behavioral responses. Theoretical and empirical studies should further explore how this context dependence affects fitness components such as resource gain and mortality and their implications for population dynamics. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) have invaded benthic habitats of the Laurentian Great Lakes and connected tributary streams. Although connected, these two systems generally differ in temperature (Great Lakes are typically colder), food availability (Dreissenid mussels are more prevalent in Great Lakes), and system size and openness. Here, we compare round goby life histories from inshore Lake Michigan and adjacent tributary systems—an uncommon case study of life-history differences between connected systems. Tributary round gobies grew much faster (average length-at-age of 122.3 vs. 65.7 mm for Age 2 + round gobies), appeared to have shorter life spans (maximum observed age of 2 vs. 5) and had lower age-at-50% maturity (1.6 vs. 2.4 years; females only) compared to gobies from Lake Michigan. In addition, tributary gobies had greater fecundity at Ages 1–2 than lake gobies, but had fewer eggs for a given body size prior to the first spawning event of the summer. We were not able to determine the cause of the observed life-history differences. Nonetheless, the observed differences in growth, maturation and longevity were consistent with known effects of water temperature, as well as predictions of life-history theory for animals at invasion fronts exposed to novel environmental conditions. The high degree of phenotypic plasticity in connected populations of this invasive species has implications for our understanding of invasive species impacts in different habitats. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Given that approximately two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese, there is substantial interest in dieting (dietary restraint) to promote weight loss. However, research on the associations between dietary restraint and binge eating is inconsistent. One possible explanation for contradictory findings is that measures of dietary restraint assess heterogeneous constructs. Nonclinical samples of university student (n = 433; 62.6% female) and community-recruited (n = 407; 47.4% female) adults completed self-report measures of dietary restraint. Exploratory structural equation modeling and exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to identify latent dietary restraint factor(s). Structural equation modeling and multiple regression were used to test associations among latent dietary restraint factor(s), body mass index (BMI), eating-disorder risk, binge eating, and psychopathological and personality variables. Three latent dietary restraint factors emerged: (a) Calorie Counting; (b) Preoccupation With Dieting; and (c) Weight-Focused Restraint. The model demonstrated a good fit to the data. Eating-disorder risk was significantly and positively associated with all restraint factors, whereas higher levels of BMI and binge eating were significantly associated with greater Preoccupation with Dieting and Weight-Focused Restraint only. Our findings indicated that dietary restraint is a heterogeneous construct and that measures of restraint assess different aspects of dieting. Our results have important implications for eating and weight disorders treatment, and suggest that weight-loss interventions that do not simultaneously increase negative attitudes toward one's body may be useful for treating weight disorders, without promoting disordered eating. © 2016 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={The chemical detection of predation risk is direct when based on predator odors, or indirect when an injured conspecific or heterospecific signal it. Physiological adjustments may be necessary in parallel to defensive reactions to cope with an imminent risk. Here, we tested the effects of predator odors and conspecific chemical alarm cues in ventilation response (VR) of frillfin goby, Bathygobius soporator, because this response increases oxygen uptake for supporting behavioral tasks. No VR change was detected in response to odors of predators (catfish) that fed on conspecific, heterospecific fish (tilapia), or were deprived of food and to non-predator (tilapia) that fed chow (non-specific odor control) and odor eluent. The goby's VR, however, increased in response to conspecific alarm cues, but not to heterospecific cues or eluent. Clearly, the VR response in fish depends on the nature of the chemical cue. It is in line with ‘threat-sensitive hypothesis’ as a chemical cue from an injured prey might mean a foraging predator, whilst the mere presence of a predator odor might not. In addition, because VR can increase, decrease or remains unchanged in response to predation risk in other fish species (including other gobies), we reinforces the species-specific chracteristic of VR responses in fish, regarding the results obtained here for frillfin gobies. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Motivation to explore is believed to be widespread among animals, but exploratory behaviour varies within populations. Offering variety in feed is one simple way of allowing intensively housed dairy cattle to express exploratory foraging behaviour. Individuals’ exploration of different feed types, as with other new stimuli, likely reflects a balance between exploratory motivation and fear of novelty. We tested the degree to which Holstein heifers (n = 10) preferred variety in feed vs. a constant, high quality mixed ration, by first providing varying types of forages and then varying flavours of mixed feed. We also investigated individual differences in exploratory behaviour by measuring switching between feed bins. Individual consistency in preferences was assessed between tests, and longer-term consistency was evaluated by comparing these results with behaviour in novel object and novel feed tests before weaning. On average, the heifers preferred the constant, familiar feed (spending on average just 20% of their time at varied feed bins), but this preference varied among individuals (from 0 to 46% of time eating in the forage trial, and 0–93% in the flavour trial). Preference for varied forages correlated positively with intake of novel feed as calves (rs = 0.72, n = 9). Preference for varied flavours showed a negative correlation with latency to approach a novel object (rs = −0.65). It thus appears that preference for variety and exploratory foraging behaviour reflect consistent personality traits. These results suggest that offering novel feeds on a rotating schedule as a supplement to the regular diet may be an effective form of enrichment for at least some individuals within a herd. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Predicting how alterations in sea ice-mediated primary production will impact Arctic food webs remains a challenge in forecasting ecological responses to climate change. One top-down approach to this challenge is to elucidate trophic roles of consumers as either specialists (i.e., consumers of predominantly one food resource) or generalists (i.e., consumers of multiple food resources) to categorize the dependence of consumers on each primary producer. At Hanna Shoal in the Chukchi Sea, Alaska, we used stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data to quantify trophic redundancy with standard ellipse areas at both the species and trophic guild levels. We also investigated species-level trophic plasticity by analyzing the varying extents that three end-members were assimilated by the food web using the mixing model simmr (Stable Isotope Mixing Model in R). Our results showed that ice algae, a combined phytoplankton and sediment organic matter composite (PSOM), and a hypothesized microphytobenthos (MPB) component were incorporated by consumers in the benthic food web, but their importance varied by species. Some primary consumers relied heavily on PSOM (e.g, the amphipods Ampelisca sp. and Byblis sp.; the copepod Calanus sp.), while others exhibited generalist feeding and obtained nutrition from multiple sources (e.g., the holothuroidean Ocnus glacialis, the gastropod Tachyrhynchus sp., the sipunculid Golfingia margaritacea, and the bivalves Ennucula tenuis, Nuculana pernula, Macoma sp., and Yoldia hyperborea). Most higher trophic level benthic predators, including the gastropods Buccinum sp., Cryptonatica affinis, and Neptunea sp, the seastar Leptasterias groenlandica, and the amphipod Anonyx sp. also exhibited trophic plasticity by coupling energy pathways from multiple primary producers including PSOM, ice algae, and MPB. Our stable isotope data indicate that consumers in the Hanna Shoal food web exhibit considerable trophic redundancy, while few species were specialists and assimilated only one end-member. Although most consumers were capable of obtaining nutrition from multiple food sources, the timing, quantity, and quality of ice-mediated primary production may still have pronounced effects on food web structure. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Maternal malnutrition significantly increases offspring risk for both metabolic and neurodevelopmental disorders. Animal models of maternal malnutrition have identified behavioral changes in the adult offspring related to executive function and reward processing. Together, these changes in executive and reward-based behaviors likely contribute to the etiology of both metabolic and neurodevelopmental disorders associated with maternal malnutrition. Concomitant with the behavioral effects, maternal malnutrition alters offspring expression of reward-related molecules and inflammatory signals in brain pathways that control executive function and reward. Neuroimmune pathways and microglial interactions in these specific brain circuits, either in early development or later in adulthood, could directly contribute to the maternal malnutrition-induced behavioral phenotypes. Understanding these mechanisms will help advance treatment strategies for metabolic and neurodevelopmental disorders, especially noninvasive dietary supplementation interventions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Lifestyle intervention can be effective when treating non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) patients. Weight loss decreases cardiovascular and diabetes risk and can also regress liver disease. Weight reductions of ⩾10% can induce a near universal non-alcoholic steatohepatitis resolution and fibrosis improvement by at least one stage. However, modest weight loss (>5%) can also produce important benefits on the components of the NAFLD activity score (NAS). Additionally, we need to explore the role of total calories and type of weight loss diet, micro- and macronutrients, evidence-based benefits of physical activity and exercise and finally support these modifications through established behavioural change models and techniques for long-term maintenance of lifestyle modifications. Following a Mediterranean diet can reduce liver fat even without weight loss and is the most recommended dietary pattern for NAFLD. The Mediterranean diet is characterised by reduced carbohydrate intake, especially sugars and refined carbohydrates (40% of the calories vs. 50–60% in a typical low fat diet), and increased monounsaturated and omega-3 fatty acid intake (40% of the calories as fat vs. up-to 30% in a typical low fat diet). Both TV sitting (a reliable marker of overall sedentary behaviour) and physical activity are associated with cardio-metabolic health, NAFLD and overall mortality. A ‘triple hit behavioural phenotype’ of: i) sedentary behaviour, ii) low physical activity, and iii) poor diet have been defined. Clinical evidence strongly supports the role of lifestyle modification as a primary therapy for the management of NAFLD and NASH. This should be accompanied by the implementation of strategies to avoid relapse and weight regain. © 2017 European Association for the Study of the Liver},

abstract={Abstract: Anti-predator responses in animals are dynamic and depend on multiple factors. However, most of our understanding about animal escape responses comes from studies which examine only a small set of factors at a time and are done over a short period of animal life spans. This limits our understanding of the dynamic nature of animal escape behaviour and the relative importance of individual factors in determining their escape behaviour. We used a repeated-measures study design to assess the anti-predator response of a wild population of a sexually dimorphic tropical lizard, Psammophilus dorsalis. We followed marked individuals throughout their breeding lifespan, repeatedly assayed their escape response and measured representative intrinsic and extrinsic factors that could modulate their escape response. Our findings suggest that intrinsic factors, such as sex and body size, influenced escape response relatively more than extrinsic factors did, such as distance to refuge and perch height. Although individual variables influenced escape behaviour, in a direction mostly consistent with predictions from optimal escape theory, the interaction between factors led to novel insights into how animals dynamically evaluate multiple and changing costs throughout their lifetime to evade predation. Significance statement: Fleeing from a potential predator is crucial to animals and depends on different factors, as there are various costs to escaping. Although several studies in the past have evaluated the role of various factors in determining escape response, the relative importance of factors and how it changes across the lifetime of individuals are not clear. By assessing individuals repeatedly over a substantial part of their lifespan, we could gain insight into how escape response changes as associated factors, intrinsic or extrinsic, change for an individual over time. This approach provided us a more robust and accurate representation of the dynamic nature of escape decisions. We also demonstrate that when multiple factors are considered simultaneously, their relative importance in determining timing of escape can considerably differ from theoretical predictions. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

abstract={Owing to trade-offs between investment in current and future reproduction, factors that diminish a parent's survival prospects, such as predation threat, are expected to increase investment in existing young. Nevertheless, effects of predation risk on parental investment have only rarely been examined, and not at all within the context of filial cannibalism (parental consumption of their own offspring). We examined filial cannibalism and nest characteristics in a small fish with paternal egg care, the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus, both when exposed to a common piscivore, the perch, Perca fluviatilis, and in the absence of predators. We found that when males consumed only some of their eggs (partial filial cannibalism), the number of eaten eggs did not depend on predation threat, possibly indicating that partial clutch consumption is largely motivated by benefits to existing young. Total filial cannibalism (whole clutch consumption) was marginally less common under predator exposure, while its strongest predictor was small clutch size. This suggests that the return on parental investment has a greater influence on total filial cannibalism than the likelihood of future breeding. Regarding nest architecture, males that consumed their entire brood after exposure to a predator built larger nest entrances, possibly to facilitate predator evasion. Males that cared for at least part of their brood, however, maintained small nest entrances regardless of predation threat. Furthermore, more elaborate nests were not associated with greater egg consumption, suggesting that filial cannibalism is not employed to sustain nest building. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Differential allocation (DA) is the adaptive adjustment of reproductive investment (up or down) according to partner quality. A lack of theoretical treatments has led to some confusion in the interpretation of DA in the empirical literature. We present a formal framework for DA that highlights the nature of reproductive benefits versus costs for females mated to males of different quality. Contrary to popular belief, analytical and stochastic dynamic models both show that additive benefits of male quality on offspring fitness have no effect on optimal levels of female investment and thus cannot produce DA. Instead, if offspring fitness is affected multiplicatively by male quality, or male quality affects the female cost function, DA is expected because of changes in the marginal benefits or costs of extra investment. Additive male quality effects on the female cost function can cause a novel form of weak DA, because reduced costs can slightly favor current over future reproduction. Combinations of these distinct effects in more realistic model scenarios can explain various patterns of positive and negative DA reported for different species and mating systems. Our model therefore sheds new light on the diversity of empirical results by providing a strong conceptual framework for the DA hypothesis. © 2017 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={Background: Many genetic variants show highly robust associations with body mass index (BMI). However, the mechanisms through which genetic susceptibility to obesity operates are not well understood. Potentially modifiable mechanisms, including eating behaviors, are of particular interest to public health. Objective: Here we explore whether eating behaviors mediate or modify genetic susceptibility to obesity. Design: Genetic risk scores for BMI (BMI-GRSs) were calculated for 3515 and 2154 adults in the Fenland and EDEN (Etude des déterminants pré et postnatals de la santé et du développement de l’enfant) population-based cohort studies, respectively. The eating behaviors—emotional eating, uncontrolled eating, and cognitive restraint—were measured through the use of a validated questionnaire. The mediating effect of each eating behavior on the association between the BMI-GRS and measured BMI was assessed by using the Sobel test. In addition, we tested for interactions between each eating behavior and the BMI-GRS on BMI. Results: The association between the BMI-GRS and BMI was mediated by both emotional eating (EDEN: P-Sobel = 0.01; Fenland: P-Sobel = 0.02) and uncontrolled eating (EDEN: P-Sobel = 0.04; Fenland: P-Sobel = 0.0006) in both sexes combined. Cognitive restraint did not mediate this association (P-Sobel . 0.10), except among EDEN women (P-Sobel = 0.0009). Cognitive restraint modified the relation between the BMI-GRS and BMI among men (EDEN: P-interaction = 0.0001; Fenland: P-interaction = 0.04) and Fenland women (P-interaction = 0.0004). By tertiles of cognitive restraint, the association between the BMI-GRS and BMI was strongest in the lowest tertile of cognitive restraint, and weakest in the highest tertile. Conclusions: Genetic susceptibility to obesity was partially mediated by the “appetitive” eating behavior traits (uncontrolled and emotional eating) and, in 3 of the 4 population groups studied, was modified by cognitive restraint. High levels of cognitive control over eating appear to attenuate the genetic susceptibility to obesity. Future research into interventions designed to support restraint may help to protect genetically susceptible individuals from weight gain. © 2017 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={In animal societies, behavioral idiosyncrasies of the individuals often guide which tasks they should perform. Such personality-specific task participation can increase individual task efficiency, thereby improving group performance. While several recent studies have documented group-level benefits of within-group behavioral (i.e., personality) diversity, how these benefits are realized at the individual level is unclear. Here we probe the individual-level benefits of personality-driven task participation in the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola. In S. dumicola, the presence of at least one highly bold individual catalyzes foraging behavior in shy colony members, and all group constituents heavily compete for prey. We assessed boldness by examining how quickly spiders resumed normal movement after a simulated predator attack. We test here whether (1) participants in collective foraging gain more mass from prey items and (2) whether bold individuals are less resistant to starvation than shy spiders, which would motivate the bold individuals to forage more. Next, we assembled colonies of shy spiders with and without a bold individual, added one prey item, and then tracked the mass gain of each individual spider after this single feeding event. We found that spiders that participated in prey capture (whether bold or shy) gained more mass than nonparticipators, and colonies containing a single bold spider gained more total mass than purely shy colonies. We also found that bold spiders participated in more collective foraging events and were more susceptible to starvation than shy spiders, suggesting that the aggressive foraging of bold individuals may represent a strategy to offset starvation risk. These findings add to the body of evidence that animal personality can shape social organization, individual performance, and group success. © The Author (2017).},

abstract={Objectives The potential role of an addictive process in problematic eating is a growing area of interest and debate. Children are more vulnerable to the negative effects of addictive substances than adults and may be at increased risk for addictive-like eating behavior. No prior study has evaluated the association of addictive-like eating with objectively measured eating behavior in adults or children. We examined the association between “food addiction” and observed food consumption among children and whether age moderated this association. Method Seventy children participated in an observed dinner meal, completed a dietary recall interview, and answered the Yale Food Addiction Scale for Children (YFAS-C), a questionnaire assessing symptoms of “food addiction”. Children's total calories ordered, calories consumed at dinner, calories consumed post-dinner, and a total of calories consumed at dinner and post-dinner were calculated along with their BMI percentile. We used generalized estimated equation models to investigate the relationship between the YFAS-C and food consumption. Results Elevated “food addiction” symptoms, but not BMI percentile, were positively associated with an increased amount of calories consumed at dinner and post-dinner. Age significantly moderated the relationship between YFAS-C and caloric intake, with only younger children exhibiting this association. Conclusions As the first study of objectively measured eating behavior, we found addictive-like eating scores in children were positively associated with the total amount of calories consumed. Among younger children, “food addiction” was more strongly associated with the total calories consumed than BMI percentile, highlighting the importance of assessing behavioral phenotypes when evaluating caloric intake. This association between addictive-like eating and caloric intake among younger, but not older children may be due to differences in inhibitory control and dietary restraint. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The trophic behavior of marine predators varies according to the level of competition to which they are exposed. In general, populations that inhabit lower productivity systems face a strong intraspecific competition, which contributes to the development of different foraging strategies to maximize nutritional efficiency. Given the high trophic flexibility of Zalophus wollebaeki, this species is considered appropriate for the analysis of such behavior. Furthermore, this trophic flexibility has allowed them to persist in a seemingly marginal ecosystem. In this study, we used a comparative analysis of variables (diet and dive behavior) related to Z. wollebaeki trophic niche plasticity to better understand their foraging ecology, using techniques such scat analysis, satellite telemetry and complementarily an isotopic analysis. Scat analysis revealed intra-population variation in their diet, represented by prey from different environments (epipelagic and benthic). These results are supported by the animals' locations at sea and diving profiles. Global Positioning System (GPS) and time-depth recorder (TDR) records showed the existence of two groups, with differing feeding areas and diving behavior. Also the δ15N values showed differences in the trophic level at which the species fed. These results constitute a relevant finding in the evolutionary behavior of the species, showing that Z. wollebaeki has developed a high degree of foraging flexibility, thus increasing its survival rate in an ecosystem that is highly demanding in terms of resource availability.

abstract={Human development strongly influences large carnivore survival and persistence globally. Behavior changes are often the first measureable responses to human disturbances, and can have ramifications on animal populations and ecological communities. We investigated how a large carnivore responds to anthropogenic disturbances by measuring activity, movement behavior, and energetics in pumas along a housing density gradient. We used log-linear analyses to examine how habitat, time of day, and proximity to housing influenced the activity patterns of both male and female pumas in the Santa Cruz Mountains. We used spatial GPS location data in combination with Overall Dynamic Body Acceleration measurements recorded by onboard accelerometers to quantify how development density affected the average distances traveled and energy expended by pumas. Pumas responded to development differently depending on the time of day; at night, they were generally more active and moved further when they were in developed areas, but these relationships were not consistent during the day. Higher nighttime activity in developed areas increased daily caloric expenditure by 10.1% for females and 11.6% for males, resulting in increases of 3.4 and 4.0 deer prey required annually by females and males respectively. Our results support that pumas have higher energetic costs and resource requirements in human-dominated habitats due to human-induced behavioral change. Increased energetic costs for pumas are likely to have ramifications on prey species and exacerbate human-wildlife conflict, especially as exurban growth continues. Future conservation work should consider the consequences of behavioral shifts on animal energetics, individual fitness, and population viability. © 2017 Wang et al.

The study was undertaken between 2011 and 2015 in a major tertiary care university hospital. METHODS: All patients aged ≥85 years undergoing any elective procedure during the study period were included. Patients were followed up for 30 days postoperatively. The preoperative conditions studied were demographic data, grade of surgical complexity (1-3), preoperative comorbidities, and some characteristically geriatric conditions (functional reserve, nutrition, cognitive status, polypharmacy, dependency, and frailty). The outcome measures were 30-day all-cause mortality (primary end point), morbidity, prolonged length of stay, and escalation of care in living conditions. RESULTS: Of 139 eligible patients, 127 completed follow-up. The 30-day mortality was 7.9%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.2-12.6. It had 3 predictors: malnutrition (odds ratio [OR], 15; 95% CI, 3-89), complexity 3 (OR, 9.1; CI, 2-52), and osteoporosis/osteoporotic fractures (OR, 14.7; CI, 2-126). Significant predictors for morbidity (40%) were ischemic heart disease (OR, 3.9; CI, 1-11) and complexity 3 (OR, 3.6; CI, 2-9), while a nonfrail phenotype (OR, 0.3; CI, 0.1-0.8) was found to be protective. Only 2 factors were found to be predictive of longer admissions, namely complexity 3 (OR, 4.4; CI, 2-10) and frailty (OR, 2.7; CI, 2-7). Finally, risk factors for escalation of care in living conditions were slow gait (a surrogate for frailty, OR, 2.5; CI, 1-6), complexity 3 (OR, 3.2; CI, 1-7), and hypertension (OR, 2.9; CI, 1-9). CONCLUSIONS: The eldest old is a distinct group with a considerable mortality rate and their own particular risk factors. Surgical complexity and certain geriatric variables (malnutrition and frailty), which are overlooked in American Society of Anesthesiologists and most other usual scores, are particularly relevant in this population. Inclusion of these factors along with appropriate comorbidities for risk stratification should guide better decision making for families and doctors alike and encourage preoperative optimization of patients. © 2017 International Anesthesia Research Society.},

abstract={The embodied mammalian brain evolved to adapt to an only partially known and knowable world. The adaptive labeling of the world is critically dependent on the neocortex which in turn is modulated by a range of subcortical systems such as the thalamus, ventral striatum, and the amygdala. A particular case in point is the learning paradigm of classical conditioning where acquired representations of states of the world such as sounds and visual features are associated with predefined discrete behavioral responses such as eye blinks and freezing. Learning progresses in a very specific order, where the animal first identifies the features of the task that are predictive of a motivational state and then forms the association of the current sensory state with a particular action and shapes this action to the specific contingency. This adaptive feature selection has both attentional and memory components, i.e., a behaviorally relevant state must be detected while its representation must be stabilized to allow its interfacing to output systems. Here, we present a computational model of the neocortical systems that underlie this feature detection process and its state-dependent modulation mediated by the amygdala and its downstream target the nucleus basalis of Meynert. In particular, we analyze the role of different populations of inhibitory interneurons in the regulation of cortical activity and their state-dependent gating of sensory signals. In our model, we show that the neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh), which is in turn under control of the amygdala, plays a distinct role in the dynamics of each population and their associated gating function serving the detection of novel sensory features not captured in the state of the network, facilitating the adjustment of cortical sensory representations and regulating the switching between modes of attention and learning. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC},

abstract={Tests based on hyponeophagia phenomena are the most widely used to check the efficacy and efficiency of new-generation chronic antidepressant treatments. Even so, these tests lack strict consensus about their methodology, which reduces their validity, reproducibility and makes translatability difficult. Therefore, after an extensive literature review on this subject, we propose a methodological protocol for the Novelty-Suppressed Feeding Test to normalize this situation. Animals were induced to a reserpine-induced depression model and were then chronically treated with duloxetine, desvenlafaxine or vehicle. After a 14-day treatment, a standardized Novelty-Suppressed Feeding Test was performed. Standardization included three-phase deprivation and the introduction of standard highly palatable food. The duloxetine-treated and desvenlafaxine-treated animals exhibited behavioral improvement of depressive-like symptoms. They took less time to eat from the center of the open-field, and approached food more times per minute than the vehicle-treated animals. This normalization proposal proves effective in measuring the antidepressant effect on chronic treatment. Thus introducing this normalization proposal would reduce inter-laboratory variability and increase the validity and robustness of this behavioral test. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Since its first sighting in 2012 in Haifa Bay, Israel, the population of the Indo-Pacific moon crab, Matuta victor, has increased greatly along the Israeli littoral and spread to Lebanon and the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. To examine possible interactions with the Levantine nearshore psammophilic community, the crab’s feeding behaviour was observed in situ and the foregut contents of 69 specimens collected in December 2015 and June 2016 were analysed. Its omnivorous diet was confirmed and previously unknown intraspecific competitive feeding behaviour is reported. The agonistic behaviour may denote behavioural flexibility that enables the crabs to colonize and persist in a depauperate novel habitat. Site-specific disturbance regimen related to human activities seems to have had a critical role in driving the rapid population increase. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Evidence from epidemiological, clinical, and experimental studies have clearly shown that disease risk in later life is increased following a poor early life environment, a process preferentially termed developmental programming. In particular, this work clearly highlights the importance of the nutritional environment during early development with alterations in maternal nutrition, including both under- and overnutrition, increasing the risk for a range of cardiometabolic and neurobehavioral disorders in adult offspring characterized by both adipokine resistance and obesity. Although the mechanistic basis for such developmental programming is not yet fully defined, a common feature derived from experimental animal models is that of alterations in the wiring of the neuroendocrine pathways that control energy balance and appetite regulation during early stages of developmental plasticity. The adipokine leptin has also received significant attention with clear experimental evidence that normal regulation of leptin levels during the early life period is critical for the normal development of tissues and related signaling pathways that are involved in metabolic and cardiovascular homeostasis. There is also increasing evidence that alterations in the epigenome and other underlying mechanisms including an altered gut-brain axis may contribute to lasting cardiometabolic dysfunction in offspring. Ongoing studies that further define the mechanisms between these associations will allow for identification of early risk markers and implementation of strategies around interventions that will have obvious beneficial implications in breaking a programmed transgenerational cycle of metabolic disorders. © 2017 Reynolds, Segovia and Vickers.},

abstract={Background: Low physical activity and reduced physical functioning are common after renal transplantation, resulting in a reduced quality of life. Another common post-transplantation complication is poor cardio-metabolic health, which plays a main role in long-term outcomes in renal transplant recipients (RTR). It is increasingly recognized that weight gain in the first year after transplantation, especially an increase in fat mass, is a highly common contributor to cardio-metabolic risk. The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes of usual care to the effects of exercise alone, and exercise combined with dietary counseling, on physical functioning, quality of life and post-transplantation weight gain in RTR. Methods: The Active Care after Transplantation study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with three arms in which RTR from 3 Dutch hospitals are randomized within the first year after transplantation to usual care, to exercise intervention (3 months supervised exercise 2 times per week followed by 12 months active follow-up), or to an exercise + diet intervention, consisting of the exercise training with additional dietary counseling (12 sessions over 15 months by a renal dietician). In total, 219 participants (73 per group) will be recruited. The primary outcome is the subdomain physical functioning of quality of life, (SF-36 PF). Secondary outcomes include other evaluations of quality of life (SF-36, KDQOL-SF, EQ-5D), objective measures of physical functioning (aerobic capacity and muscle strength), level of physical activity, gain in adiposity (body fat percentage by bio-electrical impedance assessment, BMI, waist circumference), and cardiometabolic risk factors (blood pressure, lipids, glucose metabolism). Furthermore, data on renal function, medical history, medication, psychological factors (motivation, kinesiophobia, coping style), nutrition knowledge, nutrition intake, nutrition status, fatigue, work participation, process evaluation and cost-effectiveness are collected. Discussion: Evidence on the effectiveness of an exercise intervention, or an exercise + diet intervention on physical functioning, weight gain and cardiometabolic health in RTR is currently lacking. The outcomes of the present study may help to guide future evidence-based lifestyle care after renal transplantation. Trial registration: Number: NCT01047410. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Previous studies suggest an interaction between the level of physical activity and diet preference. However, this relationship has not been well characterized for sex differences that may exist. The present study examined the influence of sex on diet preference in male and female Wistar rats that were housed under either sedentary (no wheel access) (SED) or voluntary wheel running access (RUN) conditions. Following a 1 week acclimation period to these conditions, standard chow was replaced with concurrent ad libitum access to a choice of 3 pelleted diets (high-fat, high-sucrose, and high-corn starch) in the home cage. SED and RUN conditions remained throughout the next 4 week diet preference assessment period. Body weight, running distance, and intake of each diet were measured daily. At the conclusion of the 4 week diet preference test, animals were sacrificed and brains were collected for mRNA analysis. Fecal samples were also collected before and after the 4 week diet preference phase to characterize microbiota composition. Results indicate sex dependent interactions between physical activity and both behavioral and physiological measures. Females in both RUN and SED conditions preferred the high-fat diet, consuming significantly more high-fat diet than either of the other two diets. While male SED rats also preferred the high-fat diet, male RUN rats consumed significantly less high-fat diet than the other groups, instead preferring all three diets equally. There was also a sex dependent influence of physical activity on both reward related opioid mRNA expression in the ventral striatum and the characterization of gut microbiota. The significant sex differences in response to physical activity observed through both behavioral and physiological measures suggest potential motivational or metabolic difference between males and females. The findings highlight the necessity for further exploration between male and female response to physical activity and feeding behavior. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The inability to learn an adaptive coping strategy in a novel stressful condition leads to dysfunctional stress coping, a marker of mental disturbances. This study tested the involvement of dorsal striatal dopamine receptors in the dysfunctional coping with the Forced Swim test fostered by a previous experience of reduced food availability. Adult male mice were submitted to a temporary (12 days) reduction of food availability [food-restricted (FR)] or continuously free-fed (FF). Different groups of FF and FR mice were used to evaluate: (1) dorsal striatal mRNA levels of the two isoforms of the dopamine D2 receptor (D2S, D2L). (2) Forced Swim-induced c-fos expression in the dorsal striatum; (3) acquisition and 24 h retention of passive coping with Forced Swim. Additional groups of FF mice were tested for 24 h retention of passive coping acquired during a first experience with Forced Swim immediately followed by intra-striatal infusion of vehicle or two doses of the dopamine D2/D3 receptors antagonist sulpiride or the D1/D5 receptors antagonist SCH23390. Previous restricted feeding selectively reduced mRNA levels of both D2 isoforms and abolished Forced Swim-induced c-fos expression in the left Dorsolateral Striatum and selectively prevented 24 h retention of the coping strategy acquired in a first experience of Forced Swim. Finally, temporary blockade of left Dorsolateral Striatum D2/D3 receptors immediately following the first Forced Swim experience selectively reproduced the behavioral effect of restricted feeding in FF mice. In conclusion, the present results demonstrate that mice previously exposed to a temporary reduction of food availability show low striatal D2 receptors, a known marker of addiction-associated aberrant neuroplasticity, as well as liability to relapse into maladaptive stress coping strategies. Moreover, they offer strong support to a causal relationship between reduction of D2 receptors in the left Dorsolateral Striatum and impaired consolidation of newly acquired adaptive coping. © 2017 Campus, Canterini, Orsini, Fiorenza, Puglisi-Allegra and Cabib.},

abstract={The risk of schizophrenia is increased in offspring whose mothers experience malnutrition during pregnancy. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are dietary components that are crucial for the structural and functional integrity of neural cells, and PUFA deficiency has been shown to be a risk factor for schizophrenia. Here, we show that gestational and early postnatal dietary deprivation of two PUFAs - arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) - elicited schizophrenia-like phenotypes in mouse offspring at adulthood. In the PUFA-deprived mouse group, we observed lower motivation and higher sensitivity to a hallucinogenic drug resembling the prodromal symptoms in schizophrenia. Furthermore, a working-memory task-evoked hyper-neuronal activity in the medial prefrontal cortex was also observed, along with the downregulation of genes in the prefrontal cortex involved in oligodendrocyte integrity and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic system. Regulation of these genes was mediated by the nuclear receptor genes Rxr and Ppar, whose promoters were hyper-methylated by the deprivation of dietary AA and DHA. In addition, the RXR agonist bexarotene upregulated oligodendrocyte- and GABA-related gene expression and suppressed the sensitivity of mice to the hallucinogenic drug. Notably, the expression of these nuclear receptor genes were also downregulated in hair-follicle cells from schizophrenia patients. These results suggest that PUFA deficiency during the early neurodevelopmental period in mice could model the prodromal state of schizophrenia through changes in the epigenetic regulation of nuclear receptor genes. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Background: Animal welfare should be prioritized not only for the animal's life sustainability but also for supporting the sustainability of living organism's life on the earth. However, Indonesian people have not understood it yet, thereby still treating animals arbitrarily and not appreciating either domesticated or wild animals. Aim: This research aimed to analyze the zoo agent's action in applying the five freedoms principle for animal welfare in Taman Satwa Taru Jurug (thereafter called TSTJ) or Surakarta Zoo and Gembira Loka Zoo (GLZ) of Yogyakarta Indonesia using Giddens structuration theory. Materials and Methods: The informants in this comparative study with explorative were organizers, visitors, and stakeholders of zoos selected using purposive sampling technique. The informants consisted of 19 persons: 8 from TSTJ (Code T) and 10 from GLZ (Code G) and representatives from Natural Resource Conservation Center of Central Java (Code B). Data were collected through observation, in-depth interview, and Focus Group Discussion and Documentation. Data were analyzed using an interactive model of analysis consisting of three components: Data reduction, data display, and conclusion drawing. Data validation was carried out using method and data source triangulations. Results: Food, nutrition, and nutrition level have been given consistent with the animals' habit and natural behavior. Animal keepers always maintain their self-cleanliness. GLZ has provided cages according to the technical instruction of constructing ideal cages, but the cages in TSTJ are worrying as they are not consistent with standard, rusty, and damaged, and animals have no partner. Some animals in GLZ are often sick, whereas some animals in TSTJ are dead due to poor maintenance. The iron pillars of cages restrict animal behavior in TSTJ so that they have not had freedom to behave normally yet, whereas, in GLZ, they can move freely in original habitat. The animals in the two zoos have not been free from disruption, stress, and pressure due to the passing over vehicles. Conclusion: There should be strategic communication, information, and education, community development, and law enforcement for the animal welfare. © Demartoto, et al. Open Access.},

Little explored in this regard is the role of phenotypic plasticity, although it can influence eco-evolutionary dynamics and hence evolutionary rates. Here we quantify the evolution of life history and plasticity in Trinidadian guppies transplanted from high to novel low predation environments. Common-garden results show that after only nine years, or 13-27 generations, the introduced guppies have diverged from their ancestral population in both litter size and offspring weight and in the plastic response of both traits to food availability. Given these findings, it is clear that local adaptation includes both changes in mean traits and changes in plasticity. © 2017 by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists.},

abstract={Objectives To examine whether there was a bidirectional association between cognition and depressive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and to explore the role of socio-demographic factors and daily performance in this association. Methods We conducted a longitudinal study of 104 community-dwelling patients with confirmed AD from Taiyuan, China. We assessed cognition and depressive symptoms (dependent variables) with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Geriatric Depression Scale-30 (GDS-30), respectively. Socio-demographic information and daily performance were treated as explanatory variables. A multivariate multilevel model was built to investigate the interrelationship between patients’ cognition and depression, as well as the effect of related factors on both outcomes. Results MoCA scores were negatively correlated with GDS-30 both at the subject level (correlation coefficient r3 = −0.68, χ2 = 19.26, P &lt; 0.001) and time point level (r2 = −0.35, χ2 = 35.68, P &lt; 0.001) in patients with AD. Multivariate analysis showed several significant factors for cognitive function, including educational level, personality, hobbies, exercise, reading, aluminum utensil use, dietary restriction and hypertension (regression coefficients: 0.60, 0.52, 0.51, 0.48, 0.45, −0.48, 0.67, and −0.74, respectively). Significant factors for depressive symptoms included family status, employment before retirement, homemaking, reading, aluminum utensil use, dietary restriction, and hypertension (regression coefficients: 3.09, −1.33, −1.62, −1.31, 0.96, −1.15, and 1.14, respectively). Conclusion These findings indicated that cognition was negatively associated with depression in patients with AD, and both were influenced by reading, aluminum utensil use, dietary restriction, and hypertension. Considering patient factors may help to slow the progression of dementia. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Human and animal studies indicate that maternal obesity can negatively impact aspects of metabolism and neurodevelopment in the offspring. Not known, however, is whether maternal exercise can alter these adverse outcomes. In this study, Long-Evans female rats were provided a high fat (60%; HFD) or control diet (CD) 44 days before mating and throughout gestation and lactation. Running wheels were available to half of each diet group during the gestational period only, resulting in four conditions: CD diet with (CDRW) or without (sedentary; CDSED) exercise, and HFD with (HFRW) or without (HFSED) exercise. Only male offspring (one per litter) were available for this study: they were put on control diet two weeks after weaning and examined using behavioral evaluations up to four months of age. Before weaning, offspring of CDRW dams weighed less than offspring from CDSED or HFD dams. After weaning, the lower weight in CDRW offspring generally persisted. Adult offspring from HFSED dams performed worse than the HFRW group in a Morris water maze during initial spatial training as well as reversal learning; memory was not impacted. No differences between groups were seen in tests of novel object recognition, social approach, or chocolate milk preference. Thus, maternal diet and exercise produced differential effects on body weights and cognitive behaviors in the offspring, and the data demonstrate a positive impact of maternal exercise on the offspring in that it ameliorated some deleterious behavioral effects of a maternal high fat diet. © 2017},

abstract={Objective An absence of food literacy measurement tools makes it challenging for nutrition practitioners to assess the impact of food literacy on healthy diets and to evaluate the outcomes of food literacy interventions. The objective of the present scoping review was to identify the attributes of food literacy. Design A scoping review of peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted and attributes of food literacy identified. Subjects included in the search were high-risk groups. Eligible articles were limited to research from Canada, USA, the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Results The search identified nineteen peer-reviewed and thirty grey literature sources. Fifteen identified food literacy attributes were organized into five categories. Food and Nutrition Knowledge informs decisions about intake and distinguishing between 'healthy' and 'unhealthy' foods. Food Skills focuses on techniques of food purchasing, preparation, handling and storage. Self-Efficacy and Confidence represent one's capacity to perform successfully in specific situations. Ecologic refers to beyond self and the interaction of macro-and microsystems with food decisions and behaviours. Food Decisions reflects the application of knowledge, information and skills to make food choices. These interdependent attributes are depicted in a proposed conceptual model. Conclusions The lack of evaluated tools inhibits the ability to assess and monitor food literacy; tailor, target and evaluate programmes; identify gaps in programming; engage in advocacy; and allocate resources. The present scoping review provides the foundation for the development of a food literacy measurement tool to address these gaps. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={Objective Among young children excessive externalizing behaviors often predict adolescent conduct and substance use disorders. Adolescents with those disorders show aberrant brain function when choosing between risky or cautious options. We therefore asked whether similarly aberrant brain function during risky decision-making accompanies excessive externalizing behaviors among children, hypothesizing an association between externalizing severity and regional intensity of brain activation during risky decision-making. Method Fifty-eight (58) 9–11 year-old children (both sexes), half community-recruited, half with substance-treated relatives, had parent-rated Child Behavior Checklist Externalizing scores. During fMRI, children repeatedly chose between doing a cautious behavior earning 1 point or a risky behavior that won 5 or lost 10 points. Conservative permutation-based whole-brain regression analyses sought brain regions where, during decision-making, activation significantly associated with externalizing score, with sex, and with their interaction. Results Before risky responses higher externalizing scores were significantly, negatively associated with neural activation (t's: 2.91–4.76) in regions including medial prefrontal cortex (monitors environmental reward-punishment schedules), insula (monitors internal motivating states, e.g., hunger, anxiety), dopaminergic striatal and midbrain structures (anticipate and mediate reward), and cerebellum (where injuries actually induce externalizing behaviors). Before cautious responses there were no significant externalizing:activation associations (except in post hoc exploratory analyses), no significant sex differences in activation, and no significant sex-by-externalizing interactions. Conclusions Among children displaying more externalizing behaviors extensive decision-critical brain regions were hypoactive before risky behaviors. Such neural hypoactivity may contribute to the excessive real-life risky decisions that often produce externalizing behaviors. Substance exposure, minimal here, was a very unlikely cause. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Recent studies suggest that individuals with better problem-solving and/or learning performance have greater reproductive success, and that individuals may thus benefit from choosing mates based on these performances. However, directly assessing these performances in candidate mates could be difficult. Instead, the use of indirect cues related to problem-solving and/or learning performance, such as condition-dependent phenotypic traits, might be favored. We investigated whether problem-solving and learning performance on a novel non-foraging task correlated with sexually selected plumage colouration in a natural population of great tits Parus major. We found that males successful in solving the task had darker blue-black crowns than non-solvers, and that males solving the task more rapidly over multiple attempts (i.e. learners) exhibited blue-black crowns with higher UV chroma and shorter-wavelength hues than non-learners. In contrast, we found no link between behavioural performance on the task and the yellow breast colouration in either sex. Our findings suggest that blue-black crown colouration could serve as a signal of problem-solving and learning performance in wild great tit males. Further research remains necessary to determine whether different sexually selected traits are used to signal cognitive performance for mate choice, either directly (i.e. cognitive performance influencing individual's health and ornamentation through diet for example) or indirectly (i.e. due to a correlation with a third factor such as individual quality or condition). © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={In psychiatry, comparative analyses of therapeutic options and the aggregation of data from clinical trials across different therapeutic approaches play an important role in clinical decision making, treatment guidelines, and health policy. This approach assumes that trials of pharmacological and behavioural therapies generally produce the same level of evidence when properly designed. However, trial design for behavioural interventions has some unique characteristics and control groups vary widely, which influence the effects observed in any given trial. In this Personal View, we review various control conditions typically used in psychiatry, outline their effect on the internal validity and expected effect size of a trial, and propose a decision framework for choosing a control condition depending on the risk to the patient population and the stage of development of the therapeutic intervention. We argue that the choice of control group and its justification need to be taken into consideration when comparing behavioural and pharmacological therapies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={During adolescence, individuals experience a broad range of dynamic environments as they strive to establish independence. Learning to respond appropriately in both new and previously encountered environments requires that an individual identify and learn the meaning of cues indicating that a behavior is appropriate, or alternatively, that it should be altered or inhibited. Although the ability to regulate goal-directed behavior continues to develop across adolescence, the specific circumstances under which adolescents experience difficulty with inhibitory control remain unclear. Here we review recent findings in our laboratory that address how adolescents learn to proactively inhibit a response. Much of our research has utilized a negative occasion setting paradigm, in which one cue (a feature) gates the meaning of a second cue (a target). The feature provides information that resolves the ambiguity of the target and indicates the appropriate behavioral response to the target. As such, we have been able to determine how adolescents learn about ambiguous stimuli, such as those whose meaning changes in accordance with other features of the surrounding environment. We consider why adolescents in particular exhibit difficulty in negative occasion setting compared to either pre-adolescents or adults. In addition, we review findings indicating that a balance in neural activity between orbitofrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens is necessary to support normal negative occasion setting. Finally, we consider aspects of associative learning that may contribute to adolescent inhibitory control, as well as provide insight into adolescent behavior as a whole. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell lies anatomically at a critical intersection within the brain's reward system circuitry, however, its role in voluntary choice behavior remains unclear. Rats with electrolytic lesions in the NAc shell were tested in a novel foraging paradigm. Over a continuous two-week period they freely chose among four nutritionally identical but differently flavored food pellets by pressing corresponding levers. We examined the lesion's effects on three behavioral dynamics components: motivation (when to eat), preference bias (what to choose) and persistence (how long to repeat the same choice). The lesion led to a marked increase in the preference bias: i.e., increased selection of the most-preferred choice option, and decreased selection of the others. We found no effects on any other behavioral measures, suggesting no effect on motivation or choice persistence. The results implicate the NAc shell in moderating the instrumental valuation process by inhibiting excessive bias toward preferred choice options. © The Author (2017).},

abstract={There are very few studies on the need to perform exploratory behaviour of sows around farrowing and during lactation, except for during the nest-building period. Exploratory behaviour in pigs may reflect appetitive foraging motivated by hunger, or appetitive behaviour related to other motivations, such as nest building. However, exploration may also be motivated by curiosity, stimulated by novelty or search for novelty. The aim of this study was to test novel methods of evaluating exploratory motivation in sows around farrowing and during lactation. We used ten second or third parity sows, housed in conventional crates from day 8 before expected farrowing until weaning, on day 28 after farrowing. Motivation to perform exploratory behaviour was evaluated by measuring the use of a manipulable and chewable object (a wooden device, MCO) and responses during a novel object test (NO). In addition, we studied if exploratory motivation is related to the energy status of the sow, measured as sow weight change during lactation, piglet weight gain, and leptin level in saliva. The exploratory motivation of sows appeared to change during the period of study. Although all sows used the MCO, the use was very low throughout the study (below 3 g per day on average), and almost non-existent during the first weeks after farrowing. The latency to touch the object in the NO test was correlated between test days before and after farrowing, while the sow showed more interest in the object before than after farrowing. MCO use during the last week of lactation was higher in sows with a lower weight after weaning, suggesting a link between explorative motivation and energy status in the sow. These results indicate a need for further studies on how to best meet the possible exploratory need of sows during their time in the farrowing room. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Importance: Although borderline personality disorder (BPD)-one of the most common, burdensome, and costly psychiatric conditions-is characterized by repeated interpersonal conflict and instable relationships, the neurobiological mechanism of social interactive deficits remains poorly understood. Objective: To apply recent advancements in the investigation of 2-person human social interaction to investigate interaction difficulties among people with BPD. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-brain information flowin BPDwas examined from May 25, 2012, to December 4, 2015, in pairs of participants studied in 2 linked functional magnetic resonance imaging scanners in a university setting. Participants performed a joint attention task. Each pair included a healthy control individual (HC) and either a patient currently fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for BPD (cBPD) (n = 23), a patient in remission for 2 years or more (rBPD) (n = 17), or a second HC (n = 20). Groups were matched for age and educational level. Main Outcomes and Measures: A measure of cross-brain neural couplingwas computed following previously published work to indicate synchronized flow between right temporoparietal junction networks (previously shown to host neural coupling abilities in health). This measure is derived from an independent component analysis contrasting the time courses of components between pairs of truly interacting participants compared with bootstrapped control pairs. Results: In the sample including 23 women with cBPD (mean [SD] age, 26.8 [5.7] years), 17 women with rBPD (mean [SD] age, 28.5 [4.3] years), and 80 HCs (mean [SD] age, 24.0 [3.4] years]) investigated as dyads, neural coupling was found to be associated with disorder state (η2 = 0.17; P = .007): while HC-HC pairs showed synchronized neural responses, cBPD-HC pairs exhibited significantly lower neural coupling just above permutation-based data levels (η2 = 0.16; P = .009). No difference was found between neural coupling in rBPD-HC and HC-HC pairs. The neural coupling in patients was significantly associated with childhood adversity (T = 2.3; P = .03). Conclusions and Relevance: This study provides a neural correlate for a core diagnostic and clinical feature of BPD. Results indicate that hyperscanningmay deliver state-associated biomarkers for clinical social neuroscience. In addition, at least some neural deficits of BPD may be more reversible than is currently assumed for personality disorders. © 2017 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Psychosocial stress is associated with an increased intake of palatable foods and weight gain in stress-reactive individuals. Personality traits have been shown to predict stress-reactivity. However, it is not known if personality traits influence brain activity in regions implicated in appetite control during psychosocial stress. The current study assessed whether Gray's Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS) scale, a measure of stress-reactivity, was related to the activity of brain regions implicated in appetite control during a stressful period. Twenty-two undergraduate students participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment once during a non-exam period and once during final exams in a counter-balanced order. In the scanner, they viewed food and scenery pictures. In the exam compared with the non-exam condition, BIS scores related to increased perceived stress and correlated with increased blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response to high-calorie food images in regions implicated in food reward and subjective value, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, (vmPFC) and the amygdala. BIS scores negatively related to the functional connectivity between the vmPFC and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The results demonstrate that the BIS trait influences stress reactivity. This is observed both as an increased activity in brain regions implicated in computing the value of food cues and decreased connectivity of these regions to prefrontal regions implicated in self-control. This suggests that the effects of real life stress on appetitive brain function and self-control is modulated by a personality trait. This may help to explain why stressful periods can lead to overeating in vulnerable individuals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Food neophobia has been shown to be associated with a range of personality traits (including anxiety, lower sensation seeking) and additionally sensory aspects of food such as taste and texture. Running parallel to that work, research has demonstrated higher incidences of food neophobia in autistic populations and separately evidence of hypersensitivity in some sensory domains. The aim of the current study was to extend our understanding by exploring whether the broader aspects of autistic traits can predict food neophobia in a non-autistic population and whether this is mediated by differences in olfactory sensitivity. In the present study, student participants (N = 50) completed questionnaires measuring their food neophobia (FNS) and preferences for foreign cuisine, autistic traits (Autistic Quotient, AQ), and then completed an olfactory threshold test for a food related odour. The findings demonstrated a positive association between food neophobia and the magnitude of autistic traits and interestingly, an inverse relation between preference for foreign cuisine and olfactory sensitivity; those individuals less inclined toward foreign cuisine had poorer sensitivity to a food related odour. Since AQ was not related to olfactory sensitivity, these findings suggest the relation between autistic traits and food neophobia is unlikely to be mediated by olfactory sensitivity. More broadly however, our sense of smell is associated with experiencing a wider diet. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to play a critical role in behavioral flexibility by monitoring action–outcome contingencies. How PFC ensembles represent shifts in behavior in response to changes in these contingencies remains unclear. We recorded single-unit activity and local field potentials in the dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) of male rats during a set-shifting task that required them to update their behavior, among competing options, in response to changes in action–outcome contingencies. As behavior was updated, a subset of PFC ensembles encoded the current trial outcome before the outcome was presented. This novel outcome-prediction encoding was absent in a control task, in which actions were rewarded pseudorandomly, indicating that PFC neurons are not merely providing an expectancy signal. In both control and set-shifting tasks, dmPFC neurons displayed postoutcome discrimination activity, indicating that these neurons also monitor whether a behavior is successful in generating rewards. Gamma-power oscillatory activity increased before the outcome in both tasks but did not differentiate between expected outcomes, suggesting that this measure is not related to set-shifting behavior but reflects expectation of an outcome after action execution. These results demonstrate that PFC neurons support flexible rule-based action selection by predicting outcomes that follow a particular action. © 2017 the authors.},

abstract={The translation of the growing increase of findings emerging from basic nutritional science into meaningful and clinically relevant dietary advices represents nowadays one of the main challenges of clinical nutrition. From nutrigenomics to deep phenotyping, many factors need to be taken into account in designing personalized and unbiased nutritional solutions for individuals or population sub-groups. Likewise, a concerted effort among basic, clinical scientists and health professionals will be needed to establish a comprehensive framework allowing the implementation of these new findings at the population level. In a world characterized by an overwhelming increase in the prevalence of obesity and associated metabolic disturbances, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, tailored nutrition prescription represents a promising approach for both the prevention and management of metabolic syndrome. This review aims to discuss recent works in the field of precision nutrition analyzing most relevant aspects affecting an individual response to lifestyle/nutritional interventions. Latest advances in the analysis and monitoring of dietary habits, food behaviors, physical activity/exercise and deep phenotyping will be discussed, as well as the relevance of novel applications of nutrigenomics, metabolomics and microbiota profiling. Recent findings in the development of precision nutrition are highlighted. Finally, results from published studies providing examples of new avenues to successfully implement innovative precision nutrition approaches will be reviewed. © 2017 by the authors.

abstract={Antipsychotic-induced weight gain is a major management problem for clinicians. It has been shown that weight gain and obesity lead to increased cardiovascular and cere-brovascular morbidity and mortality, reduced quality of life and poor drug compliance. This narrative review discusses the propensity of various antipsychotics to cause weight gain, the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions available to counteract this effect and its impact on adherence. Most antipsychotics cause weight gain. The risk appears to be highest with olanzapine and clozapine. Weight increases rapidly in the initial period after starting antipsychotics. Patients continue to gain weight in the long term. Children appear to be particularly vulnerable to antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Tailoring antipsychotics according to the needs of the individual and close monitoring of weight and other metabolic parameters are the best preventive strategies at the outset. Switching to an agent with lesser tendency to cause weight gain is an option, but carries the risk of relapse of the illness. Nonpharmacologic interventions of dietary counseling, exercise programs and cognitive and behavioral strategies appear to be equally effective in individual and group therapy formats. Both nonpharmacologic prevention and intervention strategies have shown modest effects on weight. Multiple compounds have been investigated as add-on medications to cause weight loss. Metformin has the best evidence in this respect. Burden of side effects needs to be considered when prescribing weight loss medications. There is no strong evidence to recommend routine prescription of add-on medication for weight reduction. Heterogeneity of study methodologies and other confounders such as lifestyle, genetic and illness factors make interpretation of data difficult. © 2017 Dayabandara et al.},

abstract={Group living has been proposed to yield benefits that enhance fitness above the level that would be achieved through living as solitary individuals. Dominance hierarchies occur commonly in these social assemblages, and result, by definition, in resources not being evenly distributed between group members. Determinants of rank within a dominance hierarchy can be associated with morphological characteristics, previous experience of the individual, or personality traits such as exploration tendencies. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether greater exploration and positive responses to novel objects in homing pigeons (Columba livia) measured under laboratory conditions were associated with (i) greater initial exploration of the local area around the home loft during spontaneous exploration flights (SEF), (ii) faster and more efficient homing flights when released from further afield, and (iii) whether the traits of greater exploration and more positive responses to novel objects were more likely to be exhibited by the more dominant individuals within the group. There was no relationship between laboratory-based novel object exploration and position within the dominance hierarchy. Pigeons that were neophobic under laboratory conditions did not explore the local area during SEF opportunities. When released from sites further from home, neophobic pigeons took longer routes to home compared to those birds that had not exhibited neophobic traits under laboratory conditions, and had spontaneously explored to a greater extent. The lack of exploration in the neophobic birds is likely to have resulted in the increased costs of homing following release: unfamiliarity with the landscape likely led to the greater distances travelled and less efficient routes taken. Birds that demonstrated a lack of neophobia were not the dominant individuals inside the loft, and thus would have less access to resources such as food and potentially mates. However, a lack of neophobia makes the subordinate position possible, because subordinate birds that incur high travel costs would become calorie restricted and lose condition. Our results address emerging questions linking individual variation in behaviour with energetics and fitness consequences. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this time of massive global change, species are now frequently interacting with novel players. Greater insight into the impact of these novel interactions on traits linked to fitness is essential, because effects on these traits can hinder population existence or promote rapid adaptation. Sexually selected weapons and ornaments frequently influence fitness and often have heightened condition-dependence in response to nutrition. Condition-dependence in response to different ecological conditions, a form of developmental plasticity, may be responsible for much of the intraspecific variation in sexually selected ornaments and weapons in wild populations. Here we examined the consequences of developing on a novel plant for the expression of size and shape in the leaf-footed cactus bug Narnia femorata (Hemiptera: Coreidae). The males of this species possess enlarged, sexually dimorphic femurs on their hind legs. These legs are used as weapons in male–male contests. Females are typically larger in overall body size. Our study revealed that developing upon a novel host can lead to pronounced phenotypically plastic change in sexually dimorphic traits. Male hind femurs were greatly impacted by the novel diet to the extent that the sexual dimorphism in hind femurs was lost. Further, dimorphism in body size increased, as males became tiny adults while females better maintained their body size. These patterns underscore the complex effects that novel species interactions may have on sexual phenotypes. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: Inequitable access to healthy food may contribute to health disparities. This study examines the relationship between the prevalence of adult diabetes and food access in the U.S. by county economic/racial composition. Methods: An ecological study from 2012 was used to estimate the relationship between diabetes and retail food outlet access. County diabetes prevalence was measured based on individual responses to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey question, "Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have diabetes?" If the answer was "yes" individuals were classified as having diabetes. Retail food outlets included grocery stores, supercenters, farmer's markets, full-service restaurants, fast food restaurants and convenience stores. Counties were categorized as "high-poverty" or "low-poverty". Counties were categorized as low (< 4.6%), medium (4.6%-31.0%), and high (> 31.0%) percent minority residents. Multiple linear regression models estimated the association between retail food outlets and diabetes, controlling for confounders, and testing for interactions between retail food outlets and county racial composition. Regression models were conditioned on county economic composition. Data were analyzed in 2016. Results: Density of retail foods outlets varied greatly by county economic and racial composition; counties with medium-minority populations had the least access to grocery stores and the highest access to fast food restaurants and convenience stores. Low poverty/low-minority population counties had the greatest access to farmer's markets and grocery stores. For low poverty/low-minority counties, grocery stores were associated with decreased of diabetes prevalence. Supercenters were associated with an increase in diabetes prevalence for high-poverty/low-minority counties. Only low poverty/medium-minority counties had a statistically significant relationship between farmer's markets and diabetes prevalence. Fast food restaurants were found to be positively associated with diabetes prevalence in all counties except high poverty/medium-minority. However, only low poverty/low-minority counties had a statistically significant relationship. Across all models, access to full service restaurants were significantly associated with lower prevalence of diabetes. Generally, access to convenience stores were associated with increased diabetes prevalence, except for high poverty/low-minority counties. Conclusions: The food environment is more strongly associated with diabetes prevalence for wealthier counties with a lower proportion of minority residents. This is important given efforts to increase food access in vulnerable communities. Availability of healthier food may not be enough to change health outcomes. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Pregnancy is frequently followed by the development of obesity. Aside from psychological factors, hormonal changes influence weight gain in pregnant women. We attempted to assess the potential association between personality type and the extent of gestational weight gain. The study group involved 773 women after term delivery (age 26.3 ± 3.9 years, body mass before pregnancy 61.2 ± 11.1 kg). Weight gain during pregnancy was calculated by using self-reported body mass prior to and during the 38th week of pregnancy. Personality type was assessed using the Polish version of the Framingham Type A Behavior Patterns Questionnaire (adapted by Juczynski). Two hundred forty-six (31.8%) study subjects represented type A personalities, 272 (35.2%) type B and 255 (33.0%) an indirect type. Gestational weight gain was related to the behavior patterns questionnaire score and age. In women <30 years with type A personality, the weight gain was higher than in women with type B behavior of the same age. In women >30, the gestational weight gain was larger for type B personalities. Type A personality and increased urgency in younger pregnant women increases the risk of developing obesity during pregnancy in women below 30 years old. A higher level of competitiveness demonstrates a risk factor of excessive weight gain during pregnancy regardless of age. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Growth in cattle may be related to animal temperament via alterations in intake or feed conversion. However, temperament is ill-defined, and different temperament measures may relate differently to production traits or interact with dietary factors in their effects. To examine relationships between diet, temperament, growth, and health, 160 crossbred steers (262 ± 22 kg) were used in a 56-d RCBD experiment with a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial treatment structure with 5 pens/treatment. Steers were pen fed a corn silage-based diet with or without monensin (41.9 g/t DM), ad libitum. Temperament treatments (assigned on d ˗7) were exit velocity (EV; slow vs. fast) and objective chute score (OCS; low vs. high), a novel temperament measure, representing the CV of weights collected at 5 measures/s for 10 s while an animal’s head was restrained in a chute. Both were measured on d ˗7, 0, 14, 28, 55, and 56. Subjective chute scores (SCS; visual estimates of animal activity obtained simultaneously with OCS measures) were measured on d ˗7 and d 56. Jugular blood samples from d 28 were analyzed for antibody response to leptospirosis vaccine and NEFA concentrations. No monensin × OCS × EV interactions were detected (P ≥ 0.11). There was a positive correlation between SCS and OCS (P < 0.01; r = 0.57). Changes in OCS and EV across the duration of the study differed among treatments (treatment × day, P < 0.10) and indicated that initial measures may be better proxies of growth than average measures. There were no interactions between EV and OCS (P ≥ 0.15) for any response variable and no interactions among treatments (P ≥ 0.31), nor main effects of temperament factors (P ≥ 0.12) for DMI (%BW). Monensin decreased DMI (P < 0.01) similarly across all levels of EV and OCS. Gains and G:F responses to monensin depended on OCS (P < 0.10) but not EV (P ≥ 0.80). Gain was reduced (P < 0.10) by monensin with low, but not high, OCS, and G:F was increased (P < 0.10) by monensin on high, but not low, OCS. Gain during the second 4 wk was lesser (P = 0.04) in fast, compared with slow, EV animals. Results provide novel indications that certain temperament measures can interact with dietary manipulation to influence animal performance. © 2017 American Society of Animal Science.

abstract={Exploitation of anthropogenic foods has profound effects on various aspects of the behavior and ecology of nonhuman primates. On the Cape Peninsula, South Africa, incentives to exploit novel resources are high and most local chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) feed on anthropogenic foods. Here we investigate the foraging profile, activity budget, and ranging behavior of a Peninsula group that feeds exclusively on natural foods. We predicted that the group would exploit the marine foods available to them and feed more extensively on subterranean foods, spend more time feeding and traveling, and occupy a larger area and travel further than groups that feed on anthropogenic foods, and groups elsewhere that occupy highly productive habitats. We tracked the group using handheld GPS units, and recorded behavioral data using instantaneous scan sampling in four seasons through 13 months. Our predictions were supported with the study group feeding on marine foods during all for seasons, but allocating a small percentage (&lt;5%) of their total feeding time to exploiting these foods. Also, the group used a greater area (45.3 km2) and traveled further (5.9 km/day), and allocated more time to feeding and traveling, than previously studied groups on the Peninsula that exploit anthropogenic foods. These findings highlight behavioral variation in baboons associated with anthropogenic food use. Comparison of our results with those reported elsewhere should allow management authorities to more accurately predict changes in behavior of cercopithecoid monkeys as their access to anthropogenic foods is gradually restricted. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Research on perception of threat in urban animals is fast expanding, but analyses of their capacity to exploit novel resources are scant. Experimental predictions regarding urban/non-urban behavioral differences are grounded in disparate statements regarding the ecological conditions that prevail in urban environments. We evaluate critically whether urban habitats favor high neophilia, innovation and learning in established populations. Extreme spatial complexity of urban landscapes coupled with increased resource predictability due to human routine activities should favor neophilia and learning. Cities provide exciting new opportunities to investigate empirically whether variation in these traits is related to variation in environmental complexity and predictability as forecast by a body of theoretical work. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Broad phylogenetic patterns in sexual size dimorphism (SSD) are shaped by sex differences in net selection pressures (e.g. sexual selection, fecundity selection, survival selection), but environmental and ecological factors can also affect the expression of SSD. Discussions of proximate ecological influences on SSD have focused on niche divergence; for example, increase in a prey type used by only one sex can elevate growth rates of that sex but not the other. Food limitation also can generate spatial and temporal variation in SSD. Under restricted prey abundance, curtailed growth may mask SSD even if the optimal size is greater for one sex than the other. Because an increase in food availability elicits increased feeding and growth by the sex that benefits more from increased body size, variation in prey abundance can generate variation in SSD. We used mark-recapture methods to study growth rates relative to prey (frog) abundance in two species of sexually dimorphic colubrid snake species in tropical Australia. In slatey-grey snakes (Stegonotus cucullatus), a species in which larger body size enhances reproductive output in both sexes (because larger males win combat bouts, and larger females produce more/heavier eggs), increased abundance of frogs caused equivalent increases in growth rates in both sexes and hence did not affect SSD. In keelbacks (Tropidonophis mairii), a species in which larger size enhances reproductive output in females more than males (reflecting a lack of male–male combat), increased abundance of frogs elicited higher growth rates of females only. Thus, SSD in keelbacks was modified by prey abundance. Our results show that the magnitude of sex differences in adult body size can be influenced by proximate environmental factors and support the hypothesis of sex-specific targets for maximum feeding rates.

abstract={General mechanisms underlying the distribution and fitness of synanthropic predators in human-influenced landscapes remain unclear. Under the consumer resource-matching hypothesis, synanthropes are expected to distribute themselves among habitats according to resource availability, such that densities are greater in human-subsidized habitats, but mean individual fitness is equal among habitats because of negative density dependence. However, “under-matching” to human food resources can occur, because dominant individuals exclude subordinates from subsidized habitats and realize relatively high fitness. We integrated physiological, behavioral, and demographic information to test resource-matching hypotheses in Steller’s jays (Cyanocitta stelleri), a synanthropic nest predator, to understand how behavior and social systems can influence how synanthropes respond to food subsidies. Jays consumed more human foods at subsidized (park campground) sites than jays at unsubsidized (interior forest) sites based on stable isotope analyses. Jays that occurred at higher densities were in better body condition (based on feather growth bars and lipid analyses), and had greater reproductive output at subsidized than unsubsidized sites. Jays with breeding territories in subsidized sites maintained relatively small home ranges that overlapped with multiple conspecifics, and exhibited a social system where dominant individuals typically won contests over food. Thus, jays appeared to be under-matched to prevalent resource subsidies despite high densities and behaviors expected to lead to resource matching. Our results also indicate that local resource subsidies within protected areas can result in source habitats for synanthropes, potentially impacting sensitive species over broader spatial scales. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

abstract={Sympatric predators are predicted to partition resources, especially under conditions of food limitation. Spatial heterogeneity that influences prey availability might play an important role in the scales at which potential competitors select habitat. We assessed potential mechanisms for coexistence by examining the role of heterogeneity in resource partitioning between sympatric raptors overwintering in the southern Great Plains. We conducted surveys for wintering Red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) and Northern Harrier (Circus cyanea) at two state wildlife management areas in Oklahoma, USA. We used information from repeated distance sampling to project use locations in a GIS. We applied resource selection functions to model habitat selection at three scales and analyzed for niche partitioning using the outlying mean index. Habitat selection of the two predators was mediated by spatial heterogeneity. The two predators demonstrated significant fine-scale discrimination in habitat selection in homogeneous landscapes, but were more sympatric in heterogeneous landscapes. Red-tailed hawk used a variety of cover types in heterogeneous landscapes but specialized on riparian forest in homogeneous landscapes. Northern Harrier specialized on upland grasslands in homogeneous landscapes but selected more cover types in heterogeneous landscapes. Our study supports the growing body of evidence that landscapes can affect animal behaviors. In the system we studied, larger patches of primary land cover types were associated with greater allopatry in habitat selection between two potentially competing predators. Heterogeneity within the scale of raptor home ranges was associated with greater sympatry in use and less specialization in land cover types selected. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Genetic and environmental factors contribute to the etiology of anorexia nervosa (AN). The co-twin control design is one of the most powerful methods available to evaluate environmental factors that could contribute to differences between monozygotic (MZ) twins who are discordant for AN. Using available data from a unique and rare sample of 22 Swedish female MZ pairs discordant for AN, we compared personality, life events, comorbidity, and health factors. Twins with AN had significantly higher perfectionism scores than unaffected co-twins and reported younger ages at first diet than unaffected co-twins who had dieted. Consistent with previous literature, more twins with AN reported gastrointestinal problems than unaffected co-twins. Although not significant due to low statistical power, more unaffected co-twins reported experiencing emotional neglect than twins with AN. Early dieting may be a harbinger of the development of AN or an early symptom. Higher perfectionism may represent a risk factor, sequela, or both. Sibling perception of neglect is noteworthy given the impact of an ill child with AN on family function and wellbeing. The health and wellbeing of siblings should be addressed clinically when one child in the family suffers from AN. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Collective decision making is one of the main mechanisms of organization in social insects. However, individual decision making can also play an important role, depending on the type of foraging behaviour. In the termite-hunting ant species Megaponera analis information about foraging sites is collected by only a handful of individual scouts that have to convey this information to the colony as accurately as possible to optimize their foraging behaviour. We therefore looked at predictions made by optimal foraging theory to better understand the interplay between collective and individual decision making in this obligate group-raiding predator. We found a clear positive relation between raid size (200–500 ants) and termite abundance at the foraging site thereby confirming predictions of the maximization of energy theory. Furthermore, selectivity of the food source increased with distance, thus confirming central place prediction theory. The confirmation of these theories suggests that individual scouts must be the main driver behind raid size, choice and raiding behaviour. The marginal value theorem was also confirmed by our results: time spent at the hunting ground increased with distance and prey quantity. This raises questions on how foraging time at the food source is regulated in a group-hunting predator. Hunger decreased selectivity of scouts with respect to food sources, while average raid size increased and more scouts left the nest in search of prey, thus implying that scouts are aware of the hunger state of the colony and adapt their decision making accordingly. Remarkably, most central place foraging behaviours in M. analis were not achieved by collective decisions but rather by individual decisions of scout ants. Thus, 1% of the colony (10–20 scouts) decided the fate and foraging efficiency of the remaining 99%. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Background:The association between the development of obesity and its metabolic comorbidities, and chronic consumption of high-fat diet (HFD) has been well-demonstrated. Interestingly, emerging evidence indicates that obesity is also associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorders including anxiety and depression. Although HFD feeding is associated with anxiety-related behaviors, previous studies have reported inconsistent findings on the direction of this relationship. Therefore, in this study we sought to investigate the link between HFD feeding, body weight, energy states and anxiety levels in mice and specifically to determine if the duration of HFD exposure has distinct effects on anxiety-related behaviors.Methods:To disentangle the temporal dynamic effects of HFD feeding on anxiety-related behaviors, mice were fed a HFD or regular chow (RC) diet and were assayed periodically for anxiety-related behaviors by using behavioral tests (open field test; OFT) and the elevated plus maze. To determine if obesity phenotypes correlate with anxiety-related behaviors, changes in anxiety-related behaviors in OFTs were correlated with changes in both body weight and glucose sensitivity following various levels of HFD and RC exposure.Results:Our results demonstrate a time-dependent biphasic effect of HFD feeding on anxiety-related behaviors. At 5 weeks, mice fed HFD show a reduction in anxiety-related behaviors when compared to pair-fed RC mice. At 8 weeks of HFD or RC feeding, anxiety levels were the same in both groups. Following 15 weeks of HFD and RC feeding, however, mice displaying metabolic symptoms of obesity showed increased anxiety-related behaviors relative to mice resilient to obesity phenotypes, independent of feeding conditions.Conclusions:Taken together our findings suggest that HFD bi-directionally effects anxiety-related behaviors such that short-term exposure to a HFD reduces anxiety levels, while longer exposure to a HFD promotes anxiety levels selectively in mice that display metabolic symptoms of obesity. Regardless of diet (HFD or RC), heavier animals display increased anxiety-like behaviors. These findings indicate diverse overlapping roles for HFD and body weight in modulating anxiety-related behaviors, and may partly resolve previous inconsistencies in studies examining the relationship between HFD feeding and anxiety. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

abstract={Understanding trophic relationships among marine predators in remote environments is challenging, but it is critical to understand community structure and dynamics. In this study, we used stable isotope analysis of skin biopsies to compare the isotopic, and thus, trophic niches of three sympatric delphinids in the waters surrounding Palmyra Atoll, in the Central Tropical Pacific: the melon-headed whale (Peponocephala electra), Gray’s spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris longirostris), and the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). δ15N values suggested that T. truncatus occupied a significantly higher trophic position than the other two species. δ13C values did not significantly differ between the three delphinds, potentially indicating no spatial partitioning in depth or distance from shore in foraging among species. The dietary niche area - determined by isotopic variance among individuals - of T. truncatus was also over 30% smaller than those of the other species taken at the same place, indicating higher population specialization or lower interindividual variation. For P. electra only, there was some support for intraspecific variation in foraging ecology across years, highlighting the need for temporal information in studying dietary niche. Cumulatively, isotopic evidence revealed surprisingly little evidence for trophic niche partitioning in the delphinid community of Palmyra Atoll compared to other studies. However, resource partitioning may happen via other behavioral mechanisms, or prey abundance or availability may be adequate to allow these three species to coexist without any such partitioning. It is also possible that isotopic signatures are inadequate to detect trophic partitioning in this environment, possibly because isotopes of prey are highly variable or insufficiently resolved to allow for differentiation. © 2017, Public Library of Science.

abstract={Mushrooms are valued for their nutritional as well as medicinal properties. Ganoderma species are used traditionally to treat neurological disorders but scientific evidence for this is insufficient. The present study was designed to systematically evaluate the anti-amnesic effect of selected Ganoderma species i.e. G. mediosinense and G. ramosissimum. Extracts of selected mushroom species were evaluated for their antioxidant activity and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition using in-vitro assays (DPPH and Ellman tests respectively). The anti-amnesic potential of the most active extract (i.e. 70% methanol extract of G. mediosinense) was confirmed using mouse model of scopolamine-induced amnesia. Mice were treated with bioactive extract and donepezil once orally before the induction of amnesia. Cognitive functions were evaluated using passive shock avoidance (PSA) and novel object recognition (NOR) tests. The effect on brain AChE activity, brain oxidative stress (TBARS level) and neuronal damage (H & E staining) were also assessed. In-vitro results showed strong antioxidant and AChE inhibitory activities by G. mediosinense extract (GME). Therefore, it was selected for in-vivo studies. GME pre-treatment (800 mg/kg, p.o.) reversed the effect of scopolamine in mice, evident by significant decrease (p <0.05) in the transfer latency time and increase in object recognition index in PSA and NOR, respectively. GME significantly reduced the brain AChE activity and oxidative stress. Histopathological examination of brain tissues showed decrease in vacuolated cytoplasm and increase in pyramidal cells in brain hippocampal and cortical regions. GME exerts anti-amnesic effect through AChE inhibition and antioxidant mechanisms. © 2017},

abstract={Background: There is limited research in young infants, particularly <3 months of age, on maternal feeding practices in spite of increasing evidence that early weight gain velocity is a determinant of later obesity risk. Objective: To examine associations between maternal executive function (cognitive control over one's own behaviour), maternal feeding decisions and infant weight and adiposity gains. Methods: We used a checklist to assess cues mothers use to decide when to initiate and terminate infant feedings at 2 weeks and 3 months of age (N = 69). Maternal executive function was assessed using the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery subtests for executive function and infant body composition using air displacement plethysmography. Results: Mothers with higher executive function reported relying on fewer non-satiety cues at 2 weeks of age (β = −0.29, p = 0.037) and on more infant hunger cues at 3 months of age (β = 0.31, p = 0.018) in their decisions on initiating and terminating feedings. Responsive feeding decisions, specifically the use of infant-based hunger cues at 3 months, in turn were associated with lower gains in weight-for-length (β = −0.30, p = 0.028) and percent body fat (β = −0.2, p = 0.091; non-covariate adjusted β = −0.27, p = 0.029). Conclusions: These findings show both an association between maternal executive function and responsive feeding decisions and an association between responsive feeding decisions and infant weight and adiposity gains.

abstract={The common bed bug (Cimex lectularius L.) (Hemiptera: Cimicidae) is an obligate blood-sucking insect that has been resurging in many countries. Researching this pest's behavior will help design more effective control methods. In this study, we evaluated the effect of feeding history and time elapsed from field collection on bed bug movement behavior and response to chemical lure or carbon dioxide stimulation in the laboratory. After CO 2 was released, bed bugs unfed for 3 d began to return to harborages; in contrast, the ones unfed for 2 and 4 wk spent significantly more time outside their harborages during the first 1 h after than the 1 h before CO 2 release. After CO 2 release, there was an increase in activity (time spent moving outside harborage) in all bed bugs with different feeding history or time elapsed from field collection. During the 8-h observation period when CO 2 was present, bed bug males unfed for 4 wk spent significantly more time exploring outside harborages than the ones unfed for 3 d, 1 wk, and 2 wk. Nymphs collected 1-2 wk and 1 yr ago spent significantly more time exploring outside harborages than the ones collected 43 yr ago. Bed bug's exploratory activity (the total percentage of bed bugs trapped in both baited and unbaited interceptors) was significantly affected by their time elapsed from field collection and their exploratory activity level was 1-2 wk > 6 mo > 5 and 43 yr. Both feeding history and time elapsed from field collection significantly affected bed bug movement, whereas bed bug's response to chemical lure or CO 2 (the percentage of bed bugs trapped in the baited interceptor, summarized as the number of bed bugs trapped in the baited interceptor divided by the total number of trapped bed bugs in both baited and unbaited interceptors) was unaffected by the time elapsed from field collection. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={Background: Nutrient deprivation during early development has been associated with the predisposition to metabolic disorders in adulthood. Considering its interaction with metabolism, appetite and behavior, the endocannabinoid (eCB) system represents a promising target of developmental programming. Methods: By cross-fostering and variation of litter size, early postnatal nutrition of CB6F1-hybrid mice was controlled during the lactation period (3, 6, or 10 pups/mother). After weaning and redistribution at P21, all pups received standard chow ad libitum. Gene expression analyses (liver, visceral fat, hypothalamus) were performed at P50, eCB concentrations were determined in liver and visceral fat. Locomotor activity and social behavior were analyzed by means of computer-assisted videotracking. Results: Body growth was permanently altered, with differences for length, weight, body mass index and fat mass persisting beyond P100 (all 3>6>10,p<0.01). This was paralleled by differences in hepatic IGF-I expression (p<0.01). Distinct gene expression patterns for key enzymes of the eCB system were observed in fat (eCB-synthesis: 3>6>10 (DAGLα p<0.05; NAPE-PLD p = 0.05)) and liver (eCB-degradation: 3>6>10 (FAAH p<0.05; MGL p<0.01)). Concentrations of endocannabinoids AEA and 2-AG in liver and visceral fat were largely comparable, except for a borderline significance for higher AEA (liver, p = 0.049) in formerly overfed mice and, vice versa, tendencies (p<0.1) towards lower AEA (fat) and 2-AG (liver) in formerly underfed animals. In the arcuate nucleus, formerly underfed mice tended to express more eCB-receptor transcripts (CB1R p<0.05; CB2R p = 0.08) than their overfed fellows. Open-field social behavior testing revealed significant group differences, with formerly underfed mice turning out to be the most sociable animals (p<0.01). Locomotor activity did not differ. Conclusion: Our data indicate a developmental plasticity of somatic growth, behavior and parameters of the eCB system, with long-lasting impact of early postnatal nutrition. Developmental programming of the eCB system in metabolically active tissues, as shown here for liver and fat, may play a role in the formation of the adult cardiometabolic risk profile following perinatal malnutrition in humans. © 2017 Schreiner et al.

abstract={Background Impulsivity has been found to be associated with overeating and obesity. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may enhance inhibitory control while reducing food craving and intake. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether tDCS stimulation modifies food choice, craving and consumption as a function of trait impulsivity. Methods Forty-two predominantly healthy-weight women received active tDCS stimulation to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and sham stimulation in a within participant design. Trait impulsivity was measured with a short form of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. Participants completed a computerized food-choice task, during which their mouse movements were traced. Current food craving was measured by a modified version of the Food Cravings Questionnaire-State as well as by desire to eat ratings for food pictures. Food intake was measured in a taste test. Results There were no tDCS effects on any of the dependent variables. Trait impulsivity (and non-planning impulsivity in particular) was positively associated with higher calorie intake in the taste test, irrespective of tDCS stimulation. Conclusion The current findings question the efficacy of single-session tDCS stimulation of the right dLPFC to reduce food craving, high caloric food choice and calorie intake in non-selected, predominantly healthy weight women. However, they do support the idea that trait impulsivity is related to overeating and, therefore, may be a risk factor for obesity. Future research needs to specify which appetitive behaviors can be modulated by brain stimulation and which populations might profit from it the most. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={• On the basis of strong evidence, the dose-responsive benefits of breastfeeding for both the infant and the mother are well established and should be the basis for recommending mothers to breastfeed exclusively. (25,26) • On the basis of strong evidence, pain, sore nipples, and insufficient milk supply are the main reasons for early cessation of breastfeeding. (24,35) • On the basis of strong evidence, hospital practices supportive of breastfeeding in the hours and days after birth make a difference in breastfeeding rates. However, currently, less than 20% of US births occur in Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative-designated facilities. • On the basis of consensus, in the first few weeks, stools commonly occur with every feeding or every other feeding. The "breastfed stool variant" occurs in about one-third of breastfed infants at about 4 to 6 weeks. One soft, voluminous stool occurs usually every 3 to 4 days, thought to be due to almost complete absorption of human milk • On the basis of consensus, developmental phases bring challenges for the breastfeeding dyad. Just when breastfeeding is getting established, infants go through a period of crying that may be misinterpreted as hunger and can lead to unnecessary supplementation. At about 4 months of age, most infants can become distracted during a feeding and are challenging to keep on the task of completing a full feeding. Nursing in a quiet, dark room with minimal distractions can help. • On the basis of strong evidence and consensus, because milk supply is established in the first few weeks postpartum, access to trained internal staff or early referral for breastfeeding management and support is essential to ensure breastfeeding exclusivity. Hospital-based clinics or other maternal support groups provide additional support. (58,59) • The breastfeeding touch points in Table 3 offer guidance for common issues that arise when supporting exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months postpartum and beyond. © 2017 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

abstract={Background: Addressing impaired foetal growth is recognized as a public health priority. Certain risk factors for this condition, such as poor nutritional status at birth, have been found to be highly correlated with poverty. However, the role of psychosocial factors, specifically the mother's mental health and exposure to violence during pregnancy, have yet to be further explored. Our objective was to determine if there is a measurable association between combined psychosocial factors, specifically domestic violence and mental disorders, and birth outcomes, specifically birth nutritional status and preterm delivery. Methods: We followed 775 women from an underserved, urban area, beginning their 28th week of gestation. Diagnostic interviews were performed to determine if any of the mothers had any of the following disorders: mood disorder, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), substance dependence, psychotic disorder, or anti-social personality disorder. Physical, psychological, and sexual domestic violence were also assessed. Results: Domestic violence and mental disorders were highly correlated in our sample. About 27.15% of the women in our study experienced domestic violence, and about 38.24% of them were diagnosed with mental disorders. The main association we found between combined psychosocial factors and neonate outcomes was between anxiety (IRR=1.83; 95%CI=1.06-3.17)/physical violence (IRR=1.95; 95%CI=1.11-3.42) and the rate of small-for-gestational age (SGA) in new-borns. More specifically, the combination of anxiety (beta=-0.48; 95%CI=-0.85/-0.10) and sexual violence (beta=-1.58; 95%CI=-2.61/-0.54) was also associated with birth length. Maternal risk behaviours such as smoking, drinking, inadequate prenatal care, and inadequate weight gain could not sufficiently explain these associations, suggesting that these psychosocial factors may be influencing underlying biological mechanisms. Conclusion: Domestic violence against women and mental disorders amongst pregnant women are extremely prevalent in under-resourced, urban areas and ultimately, have detrimental effects on birth outcomes. It is imperative that actions be taken to prevent violence and improve mental health during pregnancy. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={According to life history theory, increased investment in reproductive function (physiology and behaviour) at different times throughout the life course affects the risk of many diseases and, ultimately, longevity. Although genetic factors contribute to interindividual and interpopulation variation in reproductive traits, the dominant source of variability is phenotypic plasticity during development and adult life. Reproductive traits in both sexes evolved sensitivity to ecological conditions, as reflected in contemporary associations of hormone concentrations with geographical setting, nutritional status, and physical activity level. Lifetime exposure to increased concentrations of sex hormones is associated with the risk of some cancers, hence decreasing fertility patterns contribute to secular increases in their incidence. Conversely, increased investment in reproductive function might compromise somatic investment in health, such that faster sexual maturation and higher parity increases risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. An evolutionary perspective on reproductive biology could improve the efficacy of public health efforts to reduce the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers and other non-communicable diseases. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Perinatal exposure to maternal obesity and high-fat diet (HFD) consumption not only poses metabolic risks to offspring but also impacts brain development and mental health. Using a non-human primate model, we observed a persistent increase in anxiety in juvenile offspring exposed to a maternal HFD. Postweaning HFD consumption also increased anxiety and independently increased stereotypic behaviors. These behavioral changes were associated with modified cortisol stress response and impairments in the development of the central serotonin synthesis, with altered tryptophan hydroxylase-2 mRNA expression in the dorsal and median raphe. Postweaning HFD consumption decreased serotonergic immunoreactivity in area 10 of the prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that perinatal exposure to HFD consumption programs development of the brain and endocrine system, leading to behavioral impairments associated with mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders. Also, an early nutritional intervention (consumption of the control diet at weaning) was not sufficient to ameliorate many of the behavioral changes, such as increased anxiety, that were induced by maternal HFD consumption. Given the level of dietary fat consumption and maternal obesity in developed nations these findings have important implications for the mental health of future generations. © 2017 Thompson, Valleau, Barling, Franco, DeCapo, Bagley and Sullivan.},

abstract={Energy-dense, yet nutritionally poor food is a high-risk factor for mental health disorders. This is of particular concern during adolescence, a period often associated with increased consumption of low nutritional content food and higher prevalence of mental health disorders. Indeed, there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms linking unhealthy diet and mental disorders. Deficiency in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is a hallmark of poor nutrition and mood disorders. Here, we developed a mouse model of n-3 PUFA deficiency lasting from adolescence into adulthood. Starting nutritional deficits in dietary n-3 PUFAs during adolescence decreased n-3 PUFAs in both medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens, increased anxiety-like behavior, and decreased cognitive function in adulthood. Importantly, we discovered that endocannabinoid/mGlu5-mediated LTD in the mPFC and accumbens was abolished in adult n-3-deficient mice. Additionally, mPFC NMDAR-dependent LTP was also lacking in the n-3-deficient group. Pharmacological enhancement of the mGlu5/eCB signaling complex, by positive allosteric modulation of mGlu5 or inhibition of endocannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol degradation, fully restored synaptic plasticity and normalized emotional and cognitive behaviors in malnourished adult mice. Our data support a model where nutrition is a key environmental factor influencing the working synaptic range into adulthood, long after the end of the perinatal period. These findings have important implications for the identification of nutritional risk factors for disease and design of new treatments for the behavioral deficits associated with nutritional n-3 PUFA deficiency. © 2017 the authors.},

abstract={Background: Foraging efficiency determines whether animals will be able to raise healthy broods, maintain their own condition, avoid predators and ultimately increase their fitness. Using accelerometers and GPS loggers, features of the habitat and the way animals deal with variable conditions can be translated into energetic costs of movement, which, in turn, can be translated to energy landscapes.We investigated energy landscapes in Gentoo Penguins Pygoscelis papua from two colonies at New Island, Falkland/Malvinas Islands. Results: In our study, the marine areas used by the penguins, parameters of dive depth and the proportion of pelagic and benthic dives varied both between years and colonies. As a consequence, the energy landscapes also varied between the years, and we discuss how this was related to differences in food availability, which were also reflected in differences in carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values and isotopic niche metrics. In the second year, the energy landscape was characterized by lower foraging costs per energy gain, and breeding success was also higher in this year. Additionally, an area around three South American Fur Seal Arctocephalus australis colonies was never used. Conclusions: These results confirm that energy landscapes vary in time and that the seabirds forage in areas of the energy landscapes that result in minimized energetic costs. Thus, our results support the view of energy landscapes and fear of predation as mechanisms underlying animal foraging behaviour. Furthermore, we show that energy landscapes are useful in linking energy gain and variable energy costs of foraging to breeding success. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Energetic status and body size are inconstant bodily states often considered to have feedback effects on behaviour. Feedbacks can be negative, like starvation-threshold feedbacks (lower state values = increased risk taking due to higher energy need, and vice versa), or positive, like state-dependent safety feedbacks (higher state values = lower vulnerability when expressing risky behaviours, and vice versa). Few studies have investigated feedback effects during the early-life survival bottleneck of territorial species, when rapid growth is particularly important to maintain competitive ability. We investigated effects of body size and energetic status on the emergence latency into an unknown environment in highly territorial brown trout fry. We manipulated energetic status using high and low food rations in different combinations over two consecutive periods. In contrast to results from other small-sized fishes, no general behavioural effects of energetic state were detected, but larger fish had on average shorter emergence latency. Starvation-threshold feedbacks were not supported, but the size effect favours the presence of a state-dependent safety feedback. When individuals were split into clusters characterised by long (>34 s) and short (<34 s) emergence latency, a state-dependent safety feedback, based on energetic status, was found in the short-latency cluster. Positive state-dependent feedbacks may reflect the high level of competition among wild trout fry during the first summer, particularly among the more active individuals (i.e., from the short latency cluster). High state levels could be utilised to gain advantages over lesser competitors (e.g., to establish territories), particularly if the overall risk of starvation is higher than the risk of predation. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

abstract={Adaptations to captivity that reduce fitness are one of many reasons, which explain the low success rate of reintroductions. One way of testing this hypothesis is to compare an important behavioural response in captive and wild members of the same species. Thanatosis, is an anti-predator strategy that reduces the risk of death from predation, which is a common behavioral response in frogs. The study subjects for this investigation were captive and wild populations of Mantella aurantiaca. Thanatosis reaction was measured using the Tonic Immobility (TI) test, a method that consists of placing a frog on its back, restraining it in this position for a short period of time and then releasing it and measuring how much time was spent feigning death. To understand the pattern of reaction time, morphometric data were also collected as body condition can affect the duration of thanatosis. The significantly different TI times found in this study, one captive population with shorter responses, were principally an effect of body condition rather than being a result of rearing environment. However, this does not mean that we can always dismiss the importance of rearing environment in terms of behavioural skills expressed. © 2017 Passos et al.

abstract={Despite being globally widespread in coastal regions, the impacts of light pollution on intertidal ecosystems has received little attention. Intertidal species exhibit many night-time-dependent ecological strategies, including feeding, reproduction, orientation and predator avoidance, which are likely negatively affected by shifting light regimes, as has been observed in terrestrial and aquatic taxa. Coastal lighting may shape intertidal communities through its influence on the nocturnal foraging activity of dogwhelks (Nucella lapillus), a widespread predatory mollusc that structures biodiversity in temperate rocky shores. In the laboratory, we investigated whether the basal and foraging activity of this predator was affected by exposure to night-time lighting both in the presence and absence of olfactory predator cues (Carcinus maenas, common shore crab). Assessments of dogwhelks’ behavioural responses to night-time white LED lighting were performed on individuals that had been acclimated to night-time white LED lighting conditions for 16 days and individuals that had not previously been exposed to artificial light at night. Dogwhelks acclimated to night-time lighting exhibited natural refuge-seeking behaviour less often compared to control animals, but were more likely to respond to and handle prey irrespective of whether olfactory predator cues were present. These responses suggest night-time lighting likely increased the energetic demand of dogwhelks through stress, encouraging foraging whenever food was available, regardless of potential danger. Contrastingly, whelks not acclimated under night-time lighting were more likely to respond to the presence of prey under artificial light at night when olfactory predator cues were present, indicating an opportunistic shift towards the use of visual instead of olfactory cues in risk evaluation. These results demonstrate that artificial night-time lighting influences the behaviour of intertidal fauna such that the balance of interspecific interactions involved in community structuring may be affected. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Objective: To determine the frequency of weight control behaviors (WCBs) and their correlation with body mass index (BMI) and weight-based self-evaluation. Methods: Data were collected by the Brazilian Internet Study on Temperament and Psychopathology (BRAINSTEP) from 27,501 volunteers (30.4% men, mean age 28.9±8.7 years). Results: The most prevalent WCBs for men and women were exhaustive physical exercise and prolonged fasting, respectively. Frequent exhaustive physical exercise was the only behavior more often adopted by men. BMI was positively associated with WCBs, which were very frequent in obese subjects. About 15% of normal-weight women reported using diuretics and laxatives, and 12.2% reported vomiting as a WCB at least occasionally. Among subjects who regarded body weight highly in their self-evaluation, there was a strong positive association with all WCBs, at similar degrees, in both genders. Compared to those who never base their intrinsic personal value on body weight, those who frequently base intrinsic value on body weight were at 25-30 times higher risk of inducing vomiting. Conclusion: The prevalence of participants adopting WCBs was high, especially in women and obese subjects. Weight-based self-evaluation was more strongly associated with WCBs than BMI. © 2017, Associacao Brasileira de Psiquiatria. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Rationale: A major issue in the addiction field is the limited number of animal models of the voluntary induction and maintenance of alcohol dependence in outbred rats. Objectives: To address this issue, we developed a novel apparatus that vaporizes alcohol for 2–10 min after an active nosepoke response. Methods: Male Wistar rats were allowed to self-administer alcohol vapor for 8 h/day every other day for 24 sessions (escalated) or eight sessions (non-escalated). Escalated and non-escalated rats were then tested for progressive ratio responding. Anxiety-like behavior, somatic signs of withdrawal, and hyperalgesia were assessed during acute withdrawal. Results: The results showed that rats exhibited excellent discrimination between the active and inactive operanda (>85%), and the escalated rats quickly increased their blood alcohol levels from ~50 to >200 mg% in ~6 weeks. Compared with non-escalated rats, escalated rats exhibited severe addiction-like behavior, including somatic signs of withdrawal, anxiety-like behavior, hyperalgesia, and higher responding on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that outbred rats will voluntarily self-administer alcohol vapor to the point of dependence without the use of forced alcohol administration, sweeteners, food/water restriction, operant pretraining, or behavioral/genetic selection. This novel animal model may be particularly useful for medication development to help unveil the neuronal circuitry that underlies the voluntary induction of alcohol addiction and identify novel molecular targets that are specifically recruited after the voluntary induction and maintenance of alcohol dependence. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Proximate mechanisms underpinning between-individual variation in repeatedly expressed behaviours (animal personality) remain poorly understood. Recent theoretical models have focused on the concept of adaptive state-dependent behaviour, proposing that repeatable differences in behaviour emerge due to individual differences in repeatable state variables such as metabolic rate, age, sex or body size. Few studies have attempted to investigate the effect of state on personality empirically, and evidence for links between individual variation in state and personality remains equivocal. We used a captive colony of southern corroboree frogs, Pseudophryne corroboree, to (1) test for innate, temporally repeatable behavioural differences (animal personality) along the activity, exploration/avoidance and boldness/shyness behavioural axes, (2) test for behavioural syndromes (between-individual correlations between behavioural traits) and (3) determine whether behavioural traits are correlated with body size at the between-individual level. Individuals exhibited repeatable variation along all three behavioural axes, but between-individual correlations did not deviate from zero, providing no evidence for behavioural syndromes. Body size explained 40% of the between- individual variance in exploration behaviour, with larger frogs exhibiting greater mobility and travelling further in a novel environment. These associations indicate that there is potential for innate body size variation in P. corroboree to act as an important state variable underpinning repeatable between-individual behavioural differences. Future research may test this idea experimentally. Continued investigation of state-dependent individual behaviour in P. corroboree and other animals is likely to provide important insights into the proximate causes of animal personality. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Food choice is influenced by many interacting factors in humans. Its multidimensional and complex nature is well recognized, particularly within the sensory and consumer food science field. However, the vast majority of the studies aimed at understanding determinants of food choices, preferences, and eating behaviours are affected by important limitations: the limited number of factors that are considered at once and the sample size. Furthermore, sensory and hedonic responses to actual food stimuli are often not included in such studies. The Italian Taste project is a large-scale study (three thousand respondents in three years) launched by the Italian Sensory Science Society aimed at addressing these limitations by exploring the associations among a variety of measures – biological, genetic, physiological, psychological and personality-related, socio-cultural – describing the dimensions of food liking, preference, behaviour and choice, and their relevance in determining individual differences within a given food culture framework. In addition, the study includes also the collection of sensory and hedonic responses to actual food stimuli commonly consumed in Italy and prepared to elicit a variation in the strength (from weak to strong) of bitterness, sweetness, saltiness, sourness, pungency, umami and astringency. The aims of the present paper are twofold. Firstly, the paper is aimed to illustrate the variables selected to explore the different dimensions of food choice and to report the experimental procedure adopted for data collection. Secondly, the paper is aimed at showing the potential of the Italian Taste dataset on the basis of the data collected in the first year of the project. For the purpose, we selected a small number of variables known to influence food choices from data collected in the first year of the project on 1225 individuals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Understanding the molecular basis of mosquito behavioural complexity plays a central role in designing novel molecular tools to fight against their vector-borne diseases. Although the olfactory system plays an important role in guiding and managing many behavioural responses including feeding and mating, but the sex-specific regulation of olfactory responses remain poorly investigated. From our ongoing transcriptomic data annotation of olfactory tissue of blood fed adult female An. culicifacies mosquitoes; we have identified a 383 bp long unique transcript encoding a Drosophila homolog of the quick-to-court protein. Previously this was shown to regulate courtship behaviour in adult male Drosophila. A comprehensive in silico analysis of the quick-to-court (qtc) gene of An. culicifacies (Ac-qtc) predicts a 1536 bp single copy gene encoding 511 amino acid protein, having a high degree of conservation with other insect homologs. The age-dependent increased expression of putative Ac-qtc correlated with the maturation of the olfactory system, necessary to meet the sex-specific conflicting demand of mating (mate finding) versus host-seeking behavioural responses. Sixteen to eighteen hours of starvation did not alter Ac-qtc expression in both sexes, however, blood feeding significantly modulated its response in the adult female mosquitoes, confirming that it may not be involved in sugar feeding associated behavioural regulation. Finally, a dual behavioural and molecular assay indicated that natural dysregulation of Ac-qtc in the late evening might promote the mating events for successful insemination. We hypothesize that Ac-qtc may play a unique role to regulate the sex-specific conflicting demand of mosquito courtship behaviour versus blood feeding behaviour in the adult female mosquitoes. Further elucidation of this molecular mechanism may provide further information to evaluate Ac-qtc as a key molecular target for mosquito-borne disease management. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Nutritional conditions in early life can have a lasting impact on health and disease risk, though the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. In the healthy individual, physiological and behavioral responses to stress are coordinated in such a way as to mobilize resources necessary to respond to the stressor and to terminate the stress response at the appropriate time. Induction of proinflammatory gene expression within the brain is one such example that is initiated in response to both physiological and psychological stressors, and is the focus of the current study. We tested the hypothesis that early life nutrition would impact the proinflammatory transcriptional response to a stressor. Pregnant and lactating dams were fed one of three diets; a low-protein diet, a high fat diet, or the control diet through pregnancy and lactation. Adult male offspring were then challenged with either a physiological stressor (acute lipopolysaccharide injection, IP) or a psychological stressor (15 min restraint). Expression of 20 proinflammatory and stress-related genes was evaluated in hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, amygdala and ventral tegmental area. In a second cohort, behavioral responses (food intake, locomotor activity, metabolic rate) were evaluated. Offspring from low protein fed dams showed a generally reduced transcriptional response, particularly to LPS, and resistance to behavioral changes associated with restraint, while HF offspring showed an exacerbated transcriptional response within the PFC, a reduced transcriptional response in hypothalamus and amygdala, and an exacerbation of the LPS-induced reduction of locomotor activity. The present data identify differential proinflammatory transcriptional responses throughout the brain driven by perinatal diet as an important variable that may affect risk or resilience to stressors. © 2016},

abstract={Increased perceived predation risk can cause behavioral and physiological responses to reduce direct predation mortality, but these responses can also cause demographic costs through reduced reproductive output. Such indirect costs of predation risk have received increased attention in recent years, but the relative importance of direct vs. indirect predation costs to population growth (λ) across species remains unclear. We measured direct nest predation rates as well as indirect benefits (i.e., reduced predation rates) and costs (i.e., decreased reproductive output) arising from parental responses to perceived offspring predation risk for 10 songbird species breeding along natural gradients in nest predation risk. We show that reductions in seasonal fecundity from behavioral responses to perceived predation risk represent significant demographic costs for six of the 10 species. However, demographic costs from these indirect predation effects on seasonal fecundity comprised only 12% of cumulative predation costs averaged across species. In contrast, costs from direct predation mortality comprised 88% of cumulative predation costs averaged across species. Demographic costs from direct offspring predation were relatively more important for species with higher within-season residual-reproductive value (i.e., multiple-brooded species) than for species with lower residual-reproductive value (i.e., single-brooded species). Costs from indirect predation effects were significant across single- but not multiple-brooded species. Ultimately, demographic costs from behavioral responses to offspring predation risk differed among species as a function of their life-history strategies. Yet direct predation mortality generally wielded a stronger influence than indirect effects on seasonal fecundity and projected λ across species. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America},

abstract={Escaping from a predator is a matter of life or death, and prey are expected to adaptively alter their physiology under chronic predation risk in ways that may affect escape. Theoretical models assume that escape performance is mass dependent, whereby scared prey strategically maintain an optimal body mass to enhance escape. Experiments testing the mass-dependent predation risk hypothesis have demonstrated that prior experience of predation risk can affect body mass, and the behavioural decisions about evasive actions to take. Other studies on natural changes in body mass indicate that mass can affect escape. No single experiment has tested if all of these components are indeed linked, which is a critical necessary condition underpinning the mass-dependent predation risk hypothesis. We tested all components of the mass-dependent predation risk hypothesis in a repeated measures experiment by presenting predator and non-predator cues to brown-headed cowbirds housed in semi-natural conditions. Exposure to predator cues affected body mass, fat, pectoral muscle thickness and evasive actions (take-off angle and speed), but not the physiological capacity to escape, as measured by flying ability. Examining individual variation revealed that flying ability was unrelated to mass loss in either sex, unrelated to mass gain in males, and only females that gained a very large amount of mass flew poorly. We next conducted a body mass manipulation in the laboratory to rigorously test whether small to large perturbations in mass can ever affect flying ability. We induced either no change in mass (control), a moderate reduction of <10% or a more extreme reduction of >10% which the literature suggests should enhance flight. Flying ability was maintained regardless of treatment. Examining individual variation revealed the same precise patterns as in the first experiment. We conclude that prey may alter their mass and evasive actions in response to predation risk, but their escape ability remains robust and inelastic, presumably because disabling oneself is likely to lead to disastrous consequences. We suggest that animals may only face a mass-dependent predation risk trade-off in a narrow set of circumstances linked to life-history stages that require large amounts of mass gain, for example, parturition and migration.

abstract={The taste reactivity test is considered as an objective measure to assess the hedonic impact of tastes. Both the appetitive and aversive pattern of responses are plastic and can change based on previous experience. The present study assessed the repertoire of taste responses elicited by sucrose and quinine in preweanling rats, and described changes in these taste reactivity patterns after exposure to the other tastant. We exposed infant rats (17 days old at the start of training) to sweet (2% sucrose) or bitter (0.01% quinine) tastants during 4, 10-min trials in two different random sequences. The subjects were weighed before and after each trial to provide a measure of percent body weight gained. The following taste reactivity responses were registered: duration of mouthing and paw lick, frequency of chin rub, head shake and flailing of the forelimbs, frequency and duration of face washing, wall climbing and paw tread. The consummatory and affective taste responses changed depending on the order in which the solutions were administered. The order of exposure to the tastants did not affect the levels of sucrose intake. Conversely, rat pups showed more ingestive, and fewer aversive, responses to the sweet tastant when access to the solution followed the intraoral infusion of quinine. Likewise, intraoral delivery of quinine elicited a more aversive taste reactivity pattern when delivered after the access to sucrose than when presented to sucrose-naïve pups. This research contributes to the analysis of taste reactivity responses during the early ontogeny of the rat and highlights the importance of previous experiences on the subsequent assessment of rewards. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The present study explored the applicability of stable isotope analysis for the detection of paternal brood cannibalism in the seaweed pipefish Syngnathus schlegeli. As expected, the δ15N values for liver, which conveys short-term dietary information about the recent reproductive season, were higher in males than in females. In contrast, the δ15N values for muscle, which reflects longer-term feeding habits that span both the reproductive and non-reproductive seasons, did not significantly differ between the sexes. This finding indicates that males occupy a higher trophic position than females only during the reproductive season, and it is probable that this difference is a result of paternal uptake of nutrients from embryos in the brood pouch. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objectives: We evaluated risk-sensitive foraging in adult male western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) occupying a savanna environment at Fongoli, Senegal. The aim of this study was to determine how the risks of predation and heat stress influenced their behavior while feeding on a key food, fruit of the baobab tree (Adansonia digitata). Materials and Methods: Proximity of fruiting baobab trees to anthropogenic landmarks were compared to food intake, feeding rate, and behavioral indicators of fear in adult males (N = 11) at Fongoli. Additionally, we compared foraging to vegetative habitats, baobab ripe fruit nutritive quality, surface water availability, and foraging party composition. Results: Fruit abundance increased with proximity to anthropogenic landmarks, and chimpanzees exhibited higher frequencies of antipredator behaviors as they approached these risky areas. However, predation risk did not deter adult males from visiting these fruiting trees; instead, risky foraging bouts were associated with higher food intakes and longer feeding times. Additionally, higher feeding rates were observed in open-canopy habitats, and this behavior may have minimized their risk of heat stress. Conclusions: Adaptations that minimize predation risk are widespread in mammalian prey species, but these traits are poorly understood in chimpanzees. Great apes encounter few nonhuman predators capable of successfully capturing and killing them; thus, such events are rarely observed. Although people rarely hunt chimpanzees in Senegal, we found that adult males perceived humans as predators and adjusted their behavior while foraging in risky habitats. From an applied perspective, risk-taking behavior is important for understanding and mitigating the problem of crop-feeding in locations where chimpanzees and humans live in sympatry. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Elevated brain reward and attention region response, and weaker inhibitory region response to high-calorie food images have been found to predict future weight gain. These findings suggest that an intervention that reduces reward and attention region response and increases inhibitory control region response to such foods might reduce overeating. We conducted a randomized pilot experiment that tested the hypothesis that a multi-faceted food response and attention training with personalized high- and low-calorie food images would produce changes in behavioral and neural responses to food images and body fat compared to a control training with non-food images among community-recruited overweight/obese adults. Compared to changes observed in controls, completing the intervention was associated with significant reductions in reward and attention region response to high-calorie food images (Mean Cohen's d = 1.54), behavioral evidence of learning, reductions in palatability ratings and monetary valuation of high-calorie foods (p = 0.009, d's = 0.92), and greater body fat loss over a 4-week period (p = 0.009, d = 0.90), though body fat effects were not significant by 6-month follow-up. Results suggest that this multifaceted response and attention training intervention was associated with reduced reward and attention region responsivity to food cues, and a reduction in body fat. Because this implicit training treatment is both easy and inexpensive to deliver, and does not require top-down executive control that is necessary for negative energy balance obesity treatment, it may prove useful in treating obesity if future studies can determine how to create more enduring effects. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

An evolutionary perspective may help understand why humans are so prone to this condition in modern environments, and why this risk is unequally distributed. A simple conceptual model treats diabetes risk as the function of two interacting traits, namely 'metabolic capacity' which promotes glucose homeostasis, and 'metabolic load' which challenges glucose homoeostasis. This conceptual model helps understand how long-term and more recent trends in body composition can be considered to have shaped variability in diabetes risk. Hominin evolution appears to have continued a broader trend evident in primates, towards lower levels of muscularity. In addition, hominins developed higher levels of body fatness, especially in females in relative terms. These traits most likely evolved as part of a broader reorganization of human life history traits in response to growing levels of ecological instability, enabling both survival during tough periods and reproduction during bountiful periods. Since the emergence of Homo sapiens, populations have diverged in body composition in association with geographical setting and local ecological stresses. These long-term trends in both metabolic capacity and adiposity help explain the overall susceptibility of humans to diabetes in ways that are similar to, and exacerbated by, the effects of nutritional exposures during the life-course. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

abstract={This is a time of striking progress in the field of eating disorders, and outstanding young psychological scientists are playing an important role in this progress. This special section provides a sample of this work, which is characterized by a diversity of research questions and methods. The importance of transdiagnostic processes that increase risk for both disordered eating and other dysfunction is reflected in articles that identify shared familial risk across disorders, integrate transdiagnostic and eating disorder-specific risk, and examine the impact of affective processing on restricting behavior. The importance of eating disorder-specific risk is reflected in an article on disorder-specific relations between hunger and taste. The importance of integrative risk models across levels of analysis is reflected in articles that investigate the heritable component of interactions between broad personality and disorderspecific risk factors, the momentary impact of personality traits on precipitants of binge-purge episodes, brain system function responses to environmental stressors, and cross-generational transmission of risk. The importance of further understanding the nature and scope of eating disorder pathology is reflected in a meta-analysis of purging disorder and an investigation of genetic effects on disordered eating in males. This commentary places these articles in the context of challenges facing the field and considers the future of eating disorders research. © 2017 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Background In blinded randomised controlled trials, statin therapy has been associated with few adverse events (AEs). By contrast, in observational studies, larger increases in many different AEs have been reported than in blinded trials. Methods In the Lipid-Lowering Arm of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial, patients aged 40–79 years with hypertension, at least three other cardiovascular risk factors, and fasting total cholesterol concentrations of 6·5 mmol/L or lower, and who were not taking a statin or fibrate, had no history of myocardial infarction, and were not being treated for angina were randomly assigned to atorvastatin 10 mg daily or matching placebo in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled phase. In a subsequent non-randomised non-blind extension phase (initiated because of early termination of the trial because efficacy of atorvastatin was shown), all patients were offered atorvastatin 10 mg daily open label. We classified AEs using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. We blindly adjudicated all reports of four prespecified AEs of interest—muscle-related, erectile dysfunction, sleep disturbance, and cognitive impairment—and analysed all remaining AEs grouped by system organ class. Rates of AEs are given as percentages per annum. Results The blinded randomised phase was done between February, 1998, and December, 2002; we included 101 80 patients in this analysis (5101 [50%] in the atorvastatin group and 5079 [50%] in the placebo group), with a median follow-up of 3·3 years (IQR 2·7–3·7). The non-blinded non-randomised phase was done between December, 2002, and June, 2005; we included 9899 patients in this analysis (6409 [65%] atorvastatin users and 3490 [35%] non-users), with a median follow-up of 2·3 years (2·2–2·4). During the blinded phase, muscle-related AEs (298 [2·03% per annum] vs 283 [2·00% per annum]; hazard ratio 1·03 [95% CI 0·88–1·21]; p=0·72) and erectile dysfunction (272 [1·86% per annum] vs 302 [2·14% per annum]; 0·88 [0·75–1·04]; p=0·13) were reported at a similar rate by participants randomly assigned to atorvastatin or placebo. The rate of reports of sleep disturbance was significantly lower among participants assigned atorvastatin than assigned placebo (149 [1·00% per annum] vs 210 [1·46% per annum]; 0·69 [0·56–0·85]; p=0·0005). Too few cases of cognitive impairment were reported for a statistically reliable analysis (31 [0·20% per annum] vs 32 [0·22% per annum]; 0·94 [0·57–1·54]; p=0·81). We observed no significant differences in the rates of all other reported AEs, with the exception of an excess of renal and urinary AEs among patients assigned atorvastatin (481 [1·87%] per annum vs 392 [1·51%] per annum; 1·23 [1·08–1·41]; p=0·002). By contrast, during the non-blinded non-randomised phase, muscle-related AEs were reported at a significantly higher rate by participants taking statins than by those who were not (161 [1·26% per annum] vs 124 [1·00% per annum]; 1·41 [1·10–1·79]; p=0·006). We noted no significant differences between statin users and non-users in the rates of other AEs, with the exception of musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (992 [8·69% per annum] vs 831 [7·45% per annum]; 1·17 [1·06–1·29]; p=0·001) and blood and lymphatic system disorders (114 [0·88% per annum] vs 80 [0·64% per annum]; 1·40 [1·04–1·88]; p=0·03), which were reported more commonly by statin users than by non-users. Interpretation These analyses illustrate the so-called nocebo effect, with an excess rate of muscle-related AE reports only when patients and their doctors were aware that statin therapy was being used and not when its use was blinded. These results will help assure both physicians and patients that most AEs associated with statins are not causally related to use of the drug and should help counter the adverse effect on public health of exaggerated claims about statin-related side-effects.

abstract={Background: Chemical defences are widespread in animals, but how their production is adjusted to ecological conditions is poorly known. Optimal defence theory predicts that inducible defences are favoured over constitutive defences when toxin production is costly and the need for it varies across environments. However, if some environmental changes occur predictably (e.g. coupled to transitions during ontogeny), whereas others are unpredictable (e.g. predation, food availability), changes in defences may have constitutive as well as plastic elements. To investigate this phenomenon, we raised common toad (Bufo bufo) tadpoles with ad libitum or limited food and in the presence or absence of chemical cues on predation risk, and measured their toxin content on 5 occasions during early ontogeny. Results: The number of compounds showed limited variation with age in tadpoles and was unaffected by food limitation and predator cues. The total amount of bufadienolides first increased and later decreased during development, and it was elevated in young and mid-aged tadpoles with limited food availability compared to their ad libitum fed conspecifics, whereas it did not change in response to cues on predation risk. We provide the first evidence for the active synthesis of defensive toxin compounds this early during ontogeny in amphibians. Furthermore, the observation of increased quantities of bufadienolides in food-restricted tadpoles is the first experimental demonstration of resource-dependent induction of elevated de novo toxin production, suggesting a role for bufadienolides in allelopathy. Conclusions: Our study shows that the evolution of phenotypic plasticity in chemical defences may depend on the ecological context (i.e. predation vs. competition). Our results furthermore suggest that the age-dependent changes in the diversity of toxin compounds in developing toads may be fixed (i.e., constitutive), timed for the developmental stages in which they are most reliant on their chemical arsenal, whereas inducible plasticity may prevail in the amount of synthesized compounds. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Although there are many effective lifestyle interventions for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) prevention, insight into effective intervention pathways, especially of long-term interventions, is often lacking. This study aims to provide insight into the effective intervention pathways of the SLIMMER diabetes prevention intervention using mediation analyses. Methods: In total, 240 participants at increased risk of T2DM were included in the analyses over 18 months. The intervention was a combined lifestyle intervention with a dietary and a physical activity (PA) component. The primary and secondary outcomes were change in fasting insulin (pmol/L) and change in body weight (kg) after 18 months, respectively. Firstly, in a multiple mediator model, we investigated whether significant changes in these outcomes were mediated by changes in dietary and PA behavior. Secondly, in multiple single mediator models, we investigated whether changes in dietary and PA behavior were mediated by changes in behavioral determinants and the participants' psychological profile. The mediation analyses used linear regression models, where significance of indirect effects was calculated with bootstrapping. Results: The effect of the intervention on decreased fasting insulin was 40% mediated by change in dietary and PA behavior, where dietary behavior was an independent mediator of the association (34%). The effect of the intervention on decreased body weight was 20% mediated by change in dietary and PA behavior, where PA behavior was an independent mediator (17%). The intervention significantly changed intake of fruit, fat from bread spread, and fiber from bread. Change in fruit intake was mediated by change in action control (combination of consciousness, self-control, and effort), motivation, self-efficacy, intention, and skills. Change in fat intake was mediated by change in action control and psychological profile. No mediators could be identified for change in fiber intake. The change in PA behavior was mediated by change in action control, motivation, and psychological profile. Conclusion: The effect of the SLIMMER intervention on fasting insulin and body weight was mediated by changes in dietary and PA behavior, in distinct ways. These results indicate that changing dietary as well as PA behavior is important in T2DM prevention. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Food availability and predation risk can have drastic impacts on animal behaviour and populations. The tradeoff between foraging and predator avoidance is crucial for animal survival and will strongly affect individual body mass, since large fat reserves are beneficial to reduce starvation but may increase predation risk. However, two-factor experiments simultaneously investigating the interactive effects of food and predation risk, are still rare. We studied the effects of food supplementation and natural predation risk imposed by pygmy owls Glaucidium passerinum on the abundance and fat reserves of tit species in boreal forests of north Europe, from January to March in 2012 and in 2013. Food supplementation increased the number of individuals present in a given forest patch, whereas the level of predation risk had no clear impact on the abundance of tit species. The stronger impact of food supply respect to predation risk could be the consequence of the harsh winter conditions in north Europe, with constant below-zero temperatures and only few (5–7 h) daylight hours available for foraging. Predation risk did not have obvious effects on tit abundance but influenced food consumption and, together with food supplementation, affected the deposition of subcutaneous fat in great tits Parus major. High owl predation risk had detrimental effects on body fat reserves, which may reduce over-winter survival, but the costs imposed by pygmy owl risk were compensated when food was supplemented. The starvation–predation tradeoff faced by great tits in winter may thus be mediated through variation in body fat reserves. In small species living in harsh environment, this tradeoff appeared thus to be biased towards avoidance of starvation, at the cost of increasing predation risk. © 2016 The Authors},

abstract={1. The food plant quality influences feeding preferences and various life history traits of herbivorous insects. However, the effects of different host plant qualities on the behavioural phenotype have rarely been studied in behavioural ecology, especially in a pest-crop-framework. 2. Behavioural phenotypes of insects may not only be affected by external environmental factors, such as the host plant quality but are also shaped by internal factors, such as the sex and the age of individuals. 3. To study host plant effects on behavioural phenotypes, we reared mustard leaf beetles (Phaedon cochleariae Fabricius) either on their natural host watercress or on the crop cabbage, on which this beetle can be a pest. The behavioural phenotype was characterised twice in the adult lifetime by measuring six behavioural traits tested in distinct contexts. 4. Depending on the context, different behavioural traits were specifically affected by the host plant, the sex and/or the age. Beetles fed on cabbage became more active with age. Furthermore, the boldness tested in an unprotected environment context was influenced by the host, with beetles fed on cabbage being bolder, whereas the boldness in a hiding or predator attack context was affected by the age and/or the interaction of host plant × sex. 5. In conclusion, beetles fed on the crop cabbage develop a different behavioural phenotype compared to beetles fed on watercress. Previous results showed that beetles reared on cabbage have a higher reproductive output. Thus, beetles fed on the crop potentially express a faster pace-of-life. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society},

abstract={Individuals within a population often exhibit consistent differences in important behavioral traits such as parental care. One interesting, yet largely unexplored explanation for the existence of these consistent differences among parents is the idea that cognitive differences between individuals could lead to between-individual variation in parenting behavior. I used a wild population of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) to test the nature of the relationship between aspects of cognitive ability (problem-solving performance and learning) and parental care behavior, both measured in the wild. Furthermore, because parental care is tightly linked to fitness, I also investigated the relationship between problem-solving performance and offspring survival. Parent sparrows were presented with a novel problem-solving task that required them to remove an obstacle to obtain food. While there was no relationship between the ability to complete the task and measures of parental care (nestling provisioning rate or likelihood of provisioning with large food items), parents that solved the task quickly had higher provisioning rates than slow solvers. Additionally, the ability of fathers to complete the problem-solving task was positively related to offspring survival. These results provide evidence that aspects of problem-solving performance are positively correlated with parenting behavior and fitness in the wild. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={1. Human-induced rapid environmental change may decrease food resources and create unfavourable conditions for native species. Organisms showing a flexible foraging behaviour can exploit novel or alternative foods and are more likely to persist, whereas less flexible organisms might suffer starvation and numerical reductions. 2. This study assessed whether declines in the quality and availability of seeds prompted by grazing provoke behavioural and numerical responses in Pogonomyrmex mendozanus ants, and aimed to test whether behavioural flexibility buffers habitat degradation and prevents numerical declines. 3. Heavy grazing caused seed reductions, especially of the highly consumed and preferred grass seeds, and triggered two kinds of ant responses. Ants expanded their diet by incorporating a greater proportion of non-seed items, and they reduced foraging activity. As a consequence, the rate of food intake per colony lessened, particularly that of carbohydrate-rich seeds like grass seeds. Colony density under heavy grazing also fell. 4. Habitat degradation triggered a cascade of mechanisms that starts with a decrease in the seed resources and continues with changes in ant behaviour. However, behavioural responses were insufficient to prevent ant numerical declines. The results of this study suggest that the reduction in the colony density under habitat degradation was provoked by ant nutritional deficit and starvation, and predict a deterioration in body condition, colony performance and reproduction of ants, which deserve further assessment. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society},

abstract={Predation is a significant cause of nest failure in passerine birds, and, thus, natural selection is expected to favor behavioral plasticity to allow birds to respond to perceived changes in predation risk. However, behavioral plasticity in response to perceived predation risk, and its potential fitness-related costs, are understudied. In a wild population of breeding house wrens (Troglodytes aedon), we tested the hypotheses that (1) birds show behavioral plasticity in response to perceived nest-predation risk to reduce self-risk or risk to offspring, but (2) this plasticity incurs fitness-related costs. We experimentally increased the perceived risk of nest predation by enlarging the diameter of the nestbox entrance from the standard 3.2 to 5.0 cm once incubation began. Unexpectedly, large-hole females spent significantly less time being vigilant than small-hole (control) females during late incubation. Both males and females also exhibited plasticity in their provisioning behavior. Large-hole males increased and large-hole females decreased provisioning visits with increasing brood size, whereas small-hole males and females behaved similarly and were unaffected by brood size. Females did not show plasticity in their incubation or brooding behavior. Notwithstanding this behavioral plasticity in response to increased perceived predation risk, treatment had no effect on hatching success or early hatchling survival, nor did it affect nestling body condition or fledging success. We conclude, therefore, that house wrens show behavioral plasticity in response to perceived nest-predation risk, but that any short-term fitness-related costs associated with this flexibility appear negligible. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Developmental plasticity is a key feature of many organisms and individuals can benefit from early programming to optimize their phenotypes for the expected environmental conditions. However, environmental conditions may sometimes change unexpectedly. Mismatches between early and adult life, for example, can have important repercussions for adult phenotypes, potentially leading to better performance under matched than mismatched conditions as predicted by the predictive adaptive response hypothesis. We conducted a long-term experimental manipulation of dietary conditions in a population of zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata. Broods were exposed to two early nutritional treatments until independence and we used a split-brood design to independently manipulate nutritional conditions after independence to create matched and mismatched nutritional environments in later life. Developmental trajectories of all individuals were followed for more than 5 years and we scored behavioural responses in trials in a special environment and while interacting with a special object three times during adult life. Overall, we found no evidence for early programming affecting morphology. Tarsus and wing length were exclusively influenced by the early nutrition. Body weight showed lasting effects of the early treatment and independent effects of nutritional condition during adulthood, but no effects of environmental matching or mismatching. Special-object trials showed effects of the adult nutritional treatment while environmental matching affected hopping activity in special environments. These behavioural responses showed substantial long-term individual stability over a 3-month period and were only marginally smaller when measured over a period of more than 4 years. Interestingly, survival of individuals from low-quality early nutritional condition was higher compared with high-quality early condition individuals, which became evident only after years of survival monitoring. Beyond the nutritional treatment itself, we found sizable brood identity effects that slowly but steadily declined with age, indicating a significant but decaying effect of natural variation in parental provisioning on adult phenotypes. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Animal personality has been studied extensively in recent years, yet multidimensionality in tendencies of risk-related behavior, and the role of such consistency from a mating tactics perspective, is yet to be investigated. We used a semi-domesticated herd of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) to examine individual subdominant male propensity to risk mating attempts on guarded females, as well as flight initiation distance (FID), within the personality paradigm to elucidate potential fitness consequences of consistency from an adaptive perspective. Data were collected at the Kutuharju Reindeer Research Station in Kaamanen, Finland, where measures of personality were generated using field observation data based on the relative frequency of dominant male–subdominant male agonistic interactions over 4 years and subdominant males' FID measured over 1 year. Individual propensity for transient mating attempts was not significantly repeatable and did not significantly predict reproductive success or somatic cost during the mating season. Individuals varied consistently in FID, and although repeatable, FID was not related to reproductive success or somatic cost. Proximate state-dependent or social mechanisms may be driving decision-making with respect to mating effort, whereas consistent between-individual differences in FID may be maintained by mechanisms unrelated to life-history trade-offs involving productivity. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Many species of ants fall prey to pit-digging larval antlions (Myrmeleon spp.), extremely sedentary predators that wait, nearly motionless at the bottom of their pit traps, for prey to stumble inside. Previous research, both in the field and laboratory, has demonstrated a remarkable ability of these ants to rescue trapped nestmates, thus sabotaging antlions’ attempts to capture them. Here we show that pavement ants, Tetramorium sp. E, an invasive species and a major threat to biodiversity, possess yet another, more effective, antipredator strategy, namely the ability to learn to avoid antlion traps following a single successful escape from a pit. More importantly, we show that this learned antipredator behavior, an example of natural aversive learning in insects, is more complicated than a single cue-to-consequence form of associative learning. That is, pavement ants were able to generalize, after one experience, from the learned characteristics of the pit and its specific location, to other pits and other contexts that differed in many features. Such generalization, often described as a lack of precise stimulus control, nonetheless would be especially adaptive in nature, enabling ants to negotiate antlions’ pit fields, which contain a hundred or more pits within a few centimetres of one another. Indeed, the ability to generalize in exactly this way almost certainly is responsible for the sudden, and heretofore inexplicable, behavioural modifications of ants in response to an invasion of antlions in the vicinity of an ant colony. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A behavioural ecological approach to the relationship between pit-digging larval antlions and their common prey, ants, provides yet another example of how the specific ecological niche that species inhabit imposes selection pressures leading to unique behavioural adaptations. Antlions rely on multiple strategies to capture prey with a minimal expenditure of energy and extraordinary efficiency while ants employ several different strategies for avoiding capture, including rescue of trapped nestmates. Importantly, both ants and antlions rely heavily on their capacity for learning, a tool that sometimes is overlooked in predator-prey relationships, leading to the implicit assumption that behavioural adaptations are the result of fixed, hard-wired responses. Nonetheless, like hard-wired responses, learned behaviour, too, is uniquely adapted to the ecological niche, a reminder that the expression of associative learning is species-specific. Beyond the study of ants and antlions, per se, this particular predator-prey relationship reveals the important role that the capacity to learn plays in coevolutionary arms races. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Context: Accumulation of brain iron is linked to aging and protein-misfolding neurodegenerative diseases. High iron intake may influence important brain health outcomes in later life.
Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to examine evidence from animal and human studies of the effects of high iron intake or peripheral iron status on adult cognition, brain aging, and neurodegeneration.
Data Sources: MEDLINE, Scopus, CAB Abstracts, the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials, and OpenGrey databases were searched.
Study Selection: Studies investigating the effect of elevated iron intake at all postnatal life stages in mammalian models and humans on measures of adult brain health were included.
Data Extraction: Data were extracted and evaluated by two authors independently, with discrepancies resolved by discussion. Neurodegenerative disease diagnosis and/or behavioral/cognitive, biochemical, and brain morphologic findings were used to study the effects of iron intake or peripheral iron status on brain health. Risk of bias was assessed for animal and human studies. PRISMA guidelines for reporting systematic reviews were followed.
Results: Thirty-four preclinical and 14 clinical studies were identified from database searches. Thirty-three preclinical studies provided evidence supporting an adverse effect of nutritionally relevant high iron intake in neonates on brain-health-related outcomes in adults. Human studies varied considerably in design, quality, and findings; none investigated the effects of high iron intake in neonates/infants.
Conclusions: Human studies are needed to verify whether dietary iron intake levels used in neonates/infants to prevent iron deficiency have effects on brain aging and neurodegenerative disease outcomes. © The Author(s) 2017.

abstract={Prey have evolved a number of defenses against predation, and predators have developed means of countering these protective measures. Although caterpillars of the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus L., are defended by cardenolides sequestered from their host plants, the Chinese mantid Tenodera sinensis Saussure guts the caterpillar before consuming the rest of the body. We hypothesized that this gutting behavior might be driven by the heterogeneous quality of prey tissue with respect to toxicity and/or nutrients. We conducted behavioral trials in which mantids were offered cardenolide-containing and cardenolide-free D. plexippus caterpillars and butterflies. In addition, we fed mantids starved and unstarved D. plexippus caterpillars from each cardenolide treatment and nontoxic Ostrinia nubilalis Hü bner caterpillars. These trials were coupled with elemental analysis of the gut and body tissues of both D. plexippus caterpillars and corn borers. Cardenolides did not affect mantid behavior: mantids gutted both cardenolide-containing and cardenolide-free caterpillars. In contrast, mantids consumed both O. nubilalis and starved D. plexippus caterpillars entirely. Danaus plexippus body tissue has a lower C:N ratio than their gut contents, while O. nubilalis have similar ratios; gutting may reflect the mantid's ability to regulate nutrient uptake. Our results suggest that post-capture prey processing by mantids is likely driven by a sophisticated assessment of resource quality. © The Authors 2017.

abstract={During gestation, fetal nutrition is entirely dependent on maternal diet. Maternal consumption of excess fat during pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk of neurologic disorders in offspring, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, and schizophrenia. In a mouse model, high-fat diet (HFD)-fed offspring have cognitive and executive function deficits as well as whole-genome DNA and promoter-specific hypomethylation in multiple brain regions. Dietary methyl donor supplementation during pregnancy or adulthood has been used to alter DNA methylation and behavior. Given that extensive brain development occurs during early postnatal life-particularly within the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain region critical for executive function-we examined whether early life methyl donor supplementation (e.g., during adolescence) could ameliorate executive function deficits observed in offspring that were exposed to maternal HFD. By using operant testing, progressive ratio, and the PFC-dependent 5-choice serial reaction timed task (5-CSRTT), we determined that F1 female offspring (B6D2F1/J) from HFD-fed dams have decreased motivation (decreased progressive ratio breakpoint) and require a longer stimulus length to complete the 5-CSRTT task successfully, whereas early life methyl donor supplementation increased motivation and shortened the minimum stimulus length required for a correct response in the 5-CSRTT. Of interest, we found that expression of 2 chemokines, CCL2 and CXCL10, correlated with the median stimulus length in the 5-CSRTT. Furthermore, we found that acute adult supplementation of methyl donors increased motivation in HFD-fed offspring and those who previously received supplementation with methyl donors. These data point to early life as a sensitive time during which dietary methyl donor supplementation can alter PFC-dependent cognitive behaviors. © FASEB.},

abstract={Unhealthy behaviors, including smoking, poor nutrition, excessive alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and sedentary lifestyles, are global risk factors for non-communicable diseases and premature death. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a unique approach to optimize health messages by examining how the brain responds to information relating to health. Our aim was to systematically review fMRI studies that have investigated variations in brain activation in response to health messages relating to (i) smoking; (ii) alcohol consumption; (iii) physical activity; (iv) diet; and (v) sedentary behavior. The electronic databases used were Medline/PubMed, Web of Science (Core Collection), PsychINFO, SPORTDiscuss, Cochrane Library and Open Grey. Studies were included if they investigated subjects aged ≥ 10 years and were published before January 2017. Of the 13,836 studies identified in the database search, 18 studies (smoking k = 15; diet k = 2; physical activity/sedentary behavior k = 1) were included in the review. The prefrontal cortex was activated in seven (47%) of the smoking-related studies and the physical activity study. Results suggest that activation of the ventromedial, dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex regions were predictive of subsequent behavior change following exposure to aversive anti-smoking stimuli. Studies investigating the neurological responses to anti-smoking material were most abundant. Of note, the prefrontal cortex and amygdala were most commonly activated in response to health messages across lifestyle behaviors. The review highlights an important disparity between research focusing on different lifestyle behaviors. Insights from smoking literature suggest fMRI may help to optimize health messaging in relation to other lifestyle behaviors. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

This idea fits into the broader Developmental Origins of Health and Diseases (DOHAD) hypothesis, which holds that stressful in utero exposure manifests as disease in adulthood.

abstract={Anthropogenic environments are a dominant feature of the modern world; therefore, understanding which traits allow animals to succeed in these urban environments is especially important. Overall, generalist species are thought to be most successful in urban environments, with better general cognition and less neophobia as suggested critical traits. It is less clear, however, which traits would be favoured in urban environments in highly specialized species. Here, we compared highly specialized food-caching mountain chickadees living in an urban environment (Reno, NV, USA) with those living in their natural environment to investigate what makes this species successful in the city. Using a ‘common garden’ paradigm, we found that urban mountain chickadees tended to explore a novel environment faster and moved more frequently, were better at novel problem-solving, had better long-term spatial memory retention and had a larger telencephalon volume compared with forest chickadees. There were no significant differences between urban and forest chickadees in neophobia, food-caching rates, spatial memory acquisition, hippocampus volume, or the total number of hippocampal neurons. Our results partially support the idea that some traits associated with behavioural flexibility and innovation are associated with successful establishment in urban environments, but differences in long-term spatial memory retention suggest that even this trait specialized for food-caching may be advantageous. Our results highlight the importance of environmental context, species biology, and temporal aspects of invasion in understanding how urban environments are associated with behavioural and cognitive phenotypes and suggest that there is likely no one suite of traits that makes urban animals successful. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Background: Screen-time and eating behaviours are associated in adolescents, but few studies have examined the clustering of these health behaviours in this age group. The identification of clustered health behaviours, and influences on adolescents’ clustered health behaviours, at the time when they are most likely to become habitual, is important for intervention design. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and clustering of health behaviours in adolescents, and examine the sociodemographic, individual, behavioural, and home social and physical environmental correlates of clustered health behaviours. Methods: Adolescents aged 11-12 years (n = 527, 48% boys) completed a questionnaire during class-time which assessed screen-time (ST), fruit and vegetable (FV), and energy-dense (ED) snack consumption using a Food Frequency Questionnaire. Health behaviours were categorised into high and low frequencies based on recommendations for FV and ST and median splits for ED snacks. Adolescents reported on their habits, self-efficacy, eating at the television (TV), eating and watching TV together with parents, restrictive parenting practices, and the availability and accessibility of foods within the home. Behavioural clustering was assessed using an observed over expected ratio (O/E). Correlates of clustered behaviours were examined using multivariate multinomial logistic regression. Results: Approximately 70% reported having two or three health risk behaviours. Overall, O/E ratios were close to 1, which indicates clustering. The three risk behaviour combination of low FV, high ED, and high ST occurred more frequently than expected (O/E ratio = 1.06 95% CI 1.01, 1.15. Individual, behavioural, and social and physical home environmental correlates were differentially associated with behavioural clusters. Correlates consistently associated with clusters included eating ED snacks while watching TV, eating at the TV with parents, and the availability and accessibility of ED snack foods within the home. Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of screen time and unhealthy eating, and screen time is coupled with unhealthy dietary behaviours. Strategies and policies are required that simultaneously address reductions in screen time and changes to habitual dietary patterns, such as TV snacking and snack availability and accessibility. These may require a combination of individual, social and environmental changes alongside conscious and more automatic (nudging) strategies. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Objective: We examine weight control behavior used to (a) compensate for caloric content of heavy alcohol use; and (b) enhance the psychoactive effects of alcohol among college students. We evaluate the role of gender orientation and sex. Participants: Participants completed an online survey (N = 651; 59.9% women; 40.1% men). Method: Weight control behavior was assessed via the Compensatory-Eating-and-Behaviors-in Response-to-Alcohol-Consumption-Scale. Control variables included sex, race/ethnicity, age, and depressive symptoms. Gender orientation was measured by the Bem Sex Role Inventory. The prevalence and probability of alcohol-related weight control behavior using ordinal logistic regression are reported. Results: Men and women do not significantly differ in compensatory-weight-control-behavior. However, regression models suggest that recent binge drinking, other substance use, and masculine orientation are positively associated with alcohol-related weight control behavior. Conclusions: Sex was not a robust predictor of weight control behavior. Masculine orientation should be considered a possible risk factor for these behaviors and considered when designing prevention and intervention strategies. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={It has often been proposed that bolder, more explorative or more active individuals also have a higher resting metabolic rate (RMR), indicating metabolic costs of these personality types. However, such individuals might often be restless and thus excluded from RMR datasets, leading to a significant sampling bias. We tested (1) whether such a bias occurs when animals are measured for a relatively common but short time period of 3 h, and if so, (2) whether alternative measures of metabolic rate, that allow the incorporation of non-resting individuals, would reveal associations between metabolism and personality. For this, we studied free-living individuals of the African striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio) both during the moist season (N = 25 individuals) with high food availability and the dry season (N = 48 individuals) with low food availability. We assessed variation in the latency to explore a novel object, and the time spent active and time spent in the centre of a neutral arena. We examined links between personality and (i) RMR and (ii) four alternative metabolic rate (MR) metrics: average MR, highest MR, lowest MR and span of MR. Twenty-nine percent of the measured individuals had to be excluded from our RMR study because they remained restless during respirometry trials. Striped mice showed a behavioural syndrome where fast explorers also spent more time in centre and more time active than slow explorers. Individuals that did not rest during respirometry trials were faster explorers and in the moist season, they were also more active and spent more time in the centre than individuals that rested. We found no relationship between RMR and the behavioural syndrome, which might be due to the exclusion of individuals with a certain behavioural type, leaving a subset of compliant individuals. In the moist season, we found positive relationships between the behavioural syndrome and span of MR and lowest MR. In the dry season, low food availability may mask links between the behavioural syndrome and alternative MR measures due to reduced overall activity in striped mice. Our study demonstrated the importance to consider personality when measuring RMR and suggests that some alternative MRs may be useful to examine relationships between metabolism and personality when it is impossible to measure individuals over extended time periods. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Recognizing a deadly pathogen and generating an appropriate immune reaction is essential for any organism to survive in its natural habitat. Unlike vertebrates and higher primates, invertebrates depend solely on the innate immune system to defend themselves from an attacking pathogen. In this study, we report a behavioral defense strategy observed in Drosophila larvae that helps them escape and limit an otherwise lethal infection. A bacterial infection in the gut is sensed by the larval central nervous system, which generates an alteration in the larva's food preference, leading it to stop feeding and move away from the infectious food source. We have also found that this behavioral response is dependent on the internal nutritive state of the larvae. Using this novel behavioral assay as a read-out, we further identified hugin neuropeptide to be involved in the evasion response and detection of bacterial signals. © 2017.

abstract={Nutritional ketosis may enhance cerebral energy metabolismand has received increased interest as a way to improve or preserve performance and resilience. Most studies to date have focused on metabolic or neurological disorders while anecdotal evidence suggests that ketosis may enhance performance in the absence of underlying dysfunction. Moreover, decreased availability of glucose in the brain following stressful events is associated with impaired cognition, suggesting the need for more efficient energy sources. We tested the hypotheses that ketosis induced by endogenous or exogenous ketones could: (a) augment cognitive outcomes in healthy subjects; and (b) prevent stress-induced detriments in cognitive parameters. Adult, male, Sprague Dawley rats were used to investigate metabolic and behavioral outcomes in 3 dietary conditions: ketogenic (KD), ketone supplemented (KS), or NIH-31 control diet in both control or chronic stress conditions. Acute administration of exogenous ketones resulted in reduction in blood glucose and sustained ketosis. Chronic experiments showed that in control conditions, only KD resulted in pronounced metabolic alterations and improved performance in the novel object recognition test. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response revealed that KD-fed rats maintained peripheral ketosis despite increases in glucose whereas no diet effects were observed in ACTH or CORT levels. Both KD and KS-fed rats decreased escape latencies on the third day of water maze, whereas only KD prevented stress-induced deficits on the last testing day and improved probe test performance. Stress-induced decrease in hippocampal levels of β-hydroxybutyrate was attenuated in KD group while both KD and KS prevented stress effects on BDNF levels. Mitochondrial enzymes associated with ketogenesis were increased in both KD and KS hippocampal samples and both endothelial and neuronal glucose transporters were affected by stress but only in the control diet group. Our results highlight the complex relationship between peripheral metabolism, behavioral performance and biochemical changes in the hippocampus. Endogenous ketosis improved behavioral and metabolic parameters associated with energy metabolism and cognition while ketone supplementation replicated the biochemical effects within the hippocampus but only showed modest effects on behavioral improvements. © 2017 Brownlow, Jung, Moore, Bechmann and Jankord.},

abstract={In animals, nervous systems regulate the ingestion of food and water in a manner that reflects internal metabolic need. While the coordination of these two ingestive behaviors is essential for homeostasis, it has been unclear how internal signals of hunger and thirst interact to effectively coordinate food and water ingestion. In the last year, work in insects and mammals has begun to elucidate some of these interactions. As reviewed here, these studies have identified novel molecular and neural mechanisms that coordinate the regulation of food and water ingestion behaviors. These mechanisms include peptide signals that modulate neural circuits for both thirst and hunger, neurons that regulate both food and water ingestion, and neurons that integrate sensory information about both food and water in the external world. These studies argue that a deeper understanding of hunger and thirst will require closer examination of how these two biological drives interact. © 2017 WILEY Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Risk assessment and behavioral responses to predation can depend on demographic and environmental factors. We studied the escape behavior of the sand-diving lizard Meroles anchietae in the Namib Desert, using simulated predator approaches and measuring latency to burying in sand. Lizards showed a clear preference for burying on a slipface. Flight initiation distance was largely influenced by the starting distance separating the lizard and pursuer, and whether the animal was initially sighted on or off a slipface. In general, longer starting distances were associated with longer flight initiation distances. The total flight distance covered by lizards before burying was inversely related to body size, and positively related to initial distance from a slipface crest. Distance from a slipface crest was associated with increased total flight distance, most dramatically for those initially sighted on a dune slipface. Even when shelter is ubiquitous, sand-dive patterns depend on location on a dune and body condition. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Arboreality has evolved in a wide range of taxa, but its adaptive significance has rarely been examined in natural ecosystems. Euhadra brandtii sapporo is an arboreal land snail distributed in a restricted area of Hokkaido, Japan. We hypothesized that arboreality provides the species with significant survival advantages, which we tested via field observations and experiments. A monitoring census showed that E. b. sapporo hibernates in winter in the ground litter, climbs into the canopy in early spring and returns to the ground in late autumn. This seasonal movement appears to be effective for escaping from predation by ground-dwelling carabine beetles, whose activity was high during the summer based on a pitfall-trap census. Manipulative field experiments were conducted to compare survival rates in arboreal and ground-dwelling environments. We collected 120 E. b. sapporo individuals in summer and tethered 40 in tree canopies and 80 on the ground; half those on the ground were covered by baskets to prevent predation by large animals. The survival rate after 11 days was highest in the canopy, followed by that on the ground with a basket and was lowest on the ground without a basket. Predation was the main cause of death, but some died from other causes. Similar results were obtained in autumn, except for higher survival rates of the ground treatments. Analyses of carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios suggest that the land snail uses epiphytic lichens and mosses as food resources. In conclusion, arboreality has a marked advantage in reducing mortality in E. b. sapporo and is probably supported by food availability as well. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={While competing males and choosy females may be common in animal mating systems, male choice can evolve under certain conditions. Sexual cannibalism is such a condition because of the high mortality risk for males. In mantids, female body condition is associated with male mate preference, with fat females preferred, due to at least two reasons: females in poor nutritional condition are likely to attack and predate males, and fat females can potentially increase the number of offspring. Thus, the risk of cannibalism and female fecundity can influence male mating behavior. In this study, we attempted to separate these factors by using the praying mantid Tenodera angustipennis to examine whether male preference for fat female mantids was based on avoiding sexual cannibalism (cannibalism avoidance hypothesis) or preference for female fecundity (fecundity preference hypothesis). The feeding regimes were experimentally manipulated to discriminate between the effects of female fecundity and female hunger status on male and female mating behaviors. We found that recently starved females more frequently locomoted toward the male, and that male abdominal bending was less intensive and escape was sooner from recently starved females. These female and male behavioral responses to female hunger condition may reveal male avoidance of dangerous females in this mantid. © 2017, Japan Ethological Society and Springer Japan.},

abstract={Some species actively change color and pattern for camouflage on a range of background types. Such dynamic camouflage may be particularly advantageous for species inhabiting heterogeneous habitats, such as intertidal zones, where individuals are exposed to both terrestrial and marine predators depending on tides and wave action. Most studies of dynamic pattern camouflage have focused on relatively few species, and rarely species inhabiting the intertidal zone. We used image analysis and predator (avian) vision modelling to determine if rock gobies (Gobius paganellus) change their body pattern in response to their background, and to explore how background marking size influence pattern change. Rock gobies rapidly (within 1 min) changed their pattern when placed on checkerboards with different sized squares, and on backgrounds resembling natural substrates. On backgrounds resembling natural substrates, those with a small grain size, such as sand, elicited a larger degree of pattern change than those with a larger grain size. However, despite this, the majority of fish showed little or no improvement in background matching over time. Instead, the markings elicited are characteristic of disruptive coloration and may function primarily through breaking up the body outline rather than via improved match to the background pattern itself. © 2017 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract={Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a cluster of signs that increases the risk to develop diabetes mellitus type 2 and cardiovascular disease. In the last years, a growing interest to study the relationship between MS and psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, has emerged obtaining conflicting results. Diet-induced MS rat models have only examined the effects of high-fat or mixed cafeteria diets to a limited extent. We explored whether an anxiety- like behavior was associated with MS in non-stressed rats chronically submitted to a high-sucrose diet (20% sucrose in drinking water) using three different anxiety paradigms: the shock-probe/burying test (SPBT), the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and the open-field test (OFT). Behaviorally, the high-sucrose diet group showed an increase in burying behavior in the SPBT. Also, these animals displayed both avoidance to explore the central part of the arena and a significant increase in freezing behavior in the OFT and lack of effects in the EPM. Also, high-sucrose diet group showed signs of an MS-like condition: significant increases in body weight and body mass index, abdominal obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia. Plasma leptin and resistin levels were also increased. No changes in plasma corticosterone levels were found. These results indicate that rats under a 24-weeks high-sucrose diet develop an MS associated with an anxiety-like behavior. Although the mechanisms underlying this behavioral outcome remain to be investigated, the role of leptin is emphasized. © 2017 Rebolledo-Solleiro et al.

abstract={Background: Inappropriate dietary eliminations may impair quality of life, affect children's growth and unnecessarily impact on healthcare costs. Previous retrospective studies reported that around 25% of children continue a food-avoidance diet despite a negative oral food challenge (OFC). A definite pattern has not been found yet for patients not reintroducing the food. This study aimed to examine the role of child's nutritional attitudes and maternal anxiety in reintroducing food after a negative OFC. Methods: A prospective study was conducted involving 81 mothers of children with IgE-mediated food allergy. They completed a survey on nutritional behaviour and attitudes and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory on the day of OFC and 6 months later. Results: In total, 11.1% of children never or rarely ate the food after a negative OFC. Consumption of the reintroduced food is positively correlated to child's interest in tasting new foods before and after OFC and to changes in child's nutritional habits after OFC. It is negatively correlated to monotony of the diet after OFC. No correlations were found with other participants’ characteristics or maternal anxiety. State anxiety significantly decreased after the OFC. A correlation was found between trait and state anxiety and the degree of change in nutritional habits after OFC. Conclusions: Evaluating child's approach towards food before the OFC is a promising approach to identify patients at risk of food reintroduction failure. Furthermore, it underlined the importance of reassessing food consumption in all patients after a negative OFC and supporting patients in the reintroduction of food. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

abstract={Ghrelin receptor (Ghr-R) signaling in neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) can modulate dopaminergic function and the reward-related effects of both palatable foods and drugs of abuse. In this study, we re-introduced the Ghr-R in VTA neurons in Ghr-R knockout mice (Ghr-RVTA mice) to specifically study the importance of the constitutively active Ghr-R for VTA neuronal signaling. Our results showed that re-introduction of the Ghr-R in the VTA had no impact on body weight or food intake under basal conditions. However, during novel environment stress Ghr-RVTA mice showed increased food intake and energy expenditure compared to Ghr-R knockout mice, demonstrating the significance of Ghr-R signaling in the response to stress. Ghr-RVTA mice also showed increased cocaine-induced locomotor activity compared to Ghr-R knockout mice, highlighting the importance of ghrelin signaling for the reward-related effects of activation of VTA neurons. Overall, our data suggest that re-introduction of the Ghr-R in the mesolimbic reward system of Ghr-R knockout mice increases the level of activation induced by both cocaine and novelty stress. © 2017 by the authors.

abstract={Maternal separation (MS) is an extensively used early life stress model. There is some variability in the MS lengths used. Maternal separation leads to emotional and behavioral alterations such as anxiety, despair, or memory problems. We performed MS in Wistar rats with two length models from postnatal day 1 until day 10 and from postnatal day 1 until day 21 during 4 h per day in both groups. We performed a test battery of a wide range of behaviors to measure anxiety, despair, prepulse inhibition, recognition memory, and associative memory both in adolescent and adult subjects. We found that the longer model leads to anxious behavior and impairs recognition in adolescence and adulthood whereas the shorter one deteriorates associative/emotional learning only in adolescence and protects against anhedonic-like behaviors. In our opinion, these results can be explained by the fact that different lengths lead to different profiles: the longer one is an anxious profile, whereas the shorter one is more impulsive. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

We recently reported that a rare missense mutation in the gene for the transcriptional repressor histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) is associated with the risk of developing an ED in humans. Methods To understand the biological consequences of this missense mutation, we created transgenic mice carrying this mutation by introducing the alanine to threonine mutation at position 778 of mouse Hdac4 (corresponding to position 786 of the human protein). Bioinformatic analysis to identify Hdac4-regulated genes was performed using available databases. Results Male mice heterozygous for HDAC4A778T did not show any metabolic or behavioral differences. In contrast, female mice heterozygous for HDAC4A778T display several ED-related feeding and behavioral deficits depending on housing condition. Individually housed HDAC4A778T female mice exhibit reduced effortful responding for high-fat diet and compulsive grooming, whereas group-housed female mice display increased weight gain on high-fat diet, reduced behavioral despair, and increased anxiety-like behaviors. Bioinformatic analysis identifies mitochondrial biogenesis including synthesis of glutamate/gamma-aminobutyric acid as a potential transcriptional target of HDAC4A778T activity relevant to the behavioral deficits identified in this new mouse model of disordered eating. Conclusions The HDAC4A778T mouse line is a novel model of ED-related behaviors and identifies mitochondrial biogenesis as a potential molecular pathway contributing to behavioral deficits. © 2016 Society of Biological Psychiatry},

abstract={A selection for behavioural traits has been practised since man tamed the aurochs. Compared with other areas of breeding (evaluation and selection with regard to milk yield traits, conformation traits etc.), however, only relatively little work is done on behavioural genetics in cattle. The reason for this is: behavioural traits are often difficult to measure accurately and the associated observed values often do not follow a normal distribution. In addition, cattle are kept in herds which are structured by the owner of the livestock, and thus learning from members of the herd regularly has an effect on the genetic components. The present study aims to provide an overview of more recent findings on the behavioural genetics of cattle. The focus is primarily on genetic aspects of feeding, reproductive and social behaviour, and on temperament. In selected functional cycles, behavioural changes can be supported by a further increase in the yield of highly productive cows. When all other variables are constant, the increased energy needs and nutritional requirements of the high-yield cows lead to the high-yield animals taking comparatively longer to feed than lower-yield animals. Thus, the high-yield cow has less time to rest. This conflict situation is likely to be exacerbated by a further intensive selection for a higher milk yield. Thus, the daily amount of time available for particular behaviours at a stock level (highyield dairy cows) could be a valuable management tool in the future for detecting the risk of a 'fatigue syndrome' and thus for assessing the well-being of high-yield dairy cows in practice. Livestock management systems always represent a compromise between different requirements. Animal welfare, and thus the well-being of the animals, is becoming increasingly important for the acceptance of livestock farming in society. The consumer must recognise that animal-friendly livestock management methods cannot be had at "zero cost". The creation of transparency and thus the verifiability of the livestock management act as a guide for the consumer. The establishment of a consensus between the farmer, the vet and the consumer about the livestock management method to be applied demonstrably leads to a stabilisation of the market share and the standing of the farmers who use animal-friendly livestock management systems. sur la génétiqe du comportement chez le bœuf. Comme justification, il reste à mentionner les facteurs suivants: il est souvent difficile d'effectuer des mesures exactes des caractères du comportement et les valeurs corrrespondantes observées ne suivent souvent pas la répartition normale. De plus, les bovins sont gardés en troupeaux que l'éleveur structure et, partant, l'apprentissage des membres du troupeau, ce qui influe régulièrement sur la composante génétique. Avec la présente étude, on souhaite donner un aperçu sur les nouvelles connaissances recueillies en matière de génétique s'agissant du comportement du bœuf. L'accent est mis sur les aspects génétiques du comportement dans le cas de la prise d'aliments, de la reproduction et du comportement social, de même que du tempérament présentés ici. Avec l'accroissement supplémentaire des performances des vaches laitières hautement productives, il est possible d'apporter la preuve des changements de comportement dans les cercles de fonction choisis. Les besoins accrus en énergie, voire en nutriments, de la vache à haute performance -en maintenant les autres facteurs d'influence - conduisent à ce que l'animal à haute performance nécessite davantage de temps pour s'alimenter par comparaison avec un animal moins performant. De ce fait, il reste moins de temps à la vache à haute performance pour le repos. Cette situation conflictuelle devrait se renforcer avec une sélection encore plus intensive visant une production laitière supérieure. Cette situation conflictuelle devrait se renforcer avec une sélection encore plus intense visant l'augmentation de la production de lait. Ainsi le budget-temps quotidien pour certains comportements au niveau du troupeau (vaches à haute performance) pourrait devenir à l'avenir un instrument de gestion précieux afin de déceler précocément le risque d'un syndrome de fatigue et d'apprécier le bien-être des vaches à haute performance dans la pratique. Les systèmes d'élevage constituent toujours un compromis entre les diverses exigences. Pour l'acceptation de la détention des animaux utiles par la société, le respect des besoins des animaux, et donc leur bien-être, prennent une signification croissante. Le consommateur doit reconnaître que le procédé de garde des animaux en conformité avec leurs besoins ne s'obtient pas au coût zéro. L'établissement de la transparence et donc de la contrôlabilité lors de la détention aident le consommateur à s'orienter. La réalisation d'un consensus entre l'agriculteur, le vétérinaire et le consommateur au sujet du procédé de détention à appliquer conduit manifestement à une stabilisation de la part de marché et de la réputation des agriculteurs qui produisent dans des systèmes de détention conformes aux besoins des animaux.},

abstract={Parental care is remarkably diverse in its modes both within and across taxa. Within amphibians, various pre- and post-hatching care behaviours have been described in frogs. In contrast, the current knowledge about salamander parental care is largely limited to pre-hatching attendance by females. In particular, post-hatching parental care by male salamanders have never been described and analysed in detail. A recent study revealed various modes of pre-hatching care provided by male Japanese giant salamanders (Andrias japonicus). Their hatched larvae are known to stay in the nest with the father (i.e. den master) for several months before dispersal, which led to the hypothesis that den masters continue providing care for hatchlings. To test this hypothesis, we videotaped and analysed post-hatching behaviours of two male A. japonicus that remained in the nests with hatchlings in situ. We also developed and tested several predictions regarding the post-hatching care behaviours in comparison to the pre-hatching behaviours. While one male abandoned the nest, the other male remained in the nest and provided care until the larvae dispersed in the following spring. The comparative analyses on three parental care behaviours (tail fanning, agitating/checking and hygienic filial cannibalism) between pre- and post-hatching care suggest their flexible and condition-dependent nature. Furthermore, the comparison in larval mortality and potential predators between the attended and abandoned nest revealed the crucial role of a den master in improving offspring survivorship. Our observations also disclosed the possibility of leech infection posing a serious threat to larval giant salamanders. The life-history traits associated with the evolution of such prolonged post-hatching paternal care in salamanders are fully aquatic life cycle, external fertilization and stream habitat. The rare combination of these traits is unique to the family Cryptobranchidae which consists of the three imperiled and secretive giant salamanders. © 2016 The Zoological Society of London},

abstract={Alarm calling is a widespread antipredator behaviour, but it is not always a reliable indication of real danger. Individuals must decide when to respond to alarm calls as a function of the relative costs and benefits, but experiments investigating contextual influences are rare. We used playback experiments in conjunction with supplementary feeding and the presentation of direct predator cues to examine variation in receiver responses to alarm calls in a habituated population of wild dwarf mongooses. First, we investigated whether individuals adjust their response to alarm calls depending on their own satiation level and spatial position of the caller. Individuals were more likely to respond to alarm calls when they had received supplementary food, and hence could prioritize minimization of predation risk over starvation. There was also increased responsiveness to alarm calls given by individuals from elevated positions compared to those on the ground; sentinels (raised guards) are more likely to detect potential predators than foragers, and alarm calls from elevated positions are probably perceived as more reliable. When individuals did respond, they were more likely to flee following an alarm call given from ground level; foragers are likely to detect predators in closer proximity than sentinels, requiring more urgent escape responses. Second, we examined how individuals combine social information provided by alarm calls with personal information relating to predator presence. Receiver responses to terrestrial and aerial alarm calls did not differ when they followed interaction with an olfactory predator cue compared to an olfactory control cue. Following interaction with a terrestrial predator cue, however, latency to nonvigilance was significantly longer after hearing an aerial alarm call than after hearing a terrestrial alarm call, potentially because of social information novelty. Our results provide experimental evidence that receivers respond flexibly to alarm calls depending on receiver, signaller and external factors. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Predicting habitat quality is a major challenge for animals selecting a breeding patch, because it affects reproductive success. Breeding site selection may be based on previous experience, or on social information from the density and success of competitors with an earlier phenology. Variation in animal breeding phenology is often correlated with variation in habitat quality. Generally, animals breed earlier in high-quality habitats that allow them to reach a nutritional threshold required for breeding earlier or avoid nest predation. In addition, habitat quality may affect phenological overlap between species and thereby interspecific competition. Therefore, we hypothesized that competitor breeding phenology can be used as social cue by settling migrants to locate high-quality breeding sites. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally advanced and delayed hatching phenology of two resident tit species on the level of study plots and studied male and female settlement patterns of migratory pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca. The manipulations were assigned at random in two consecutive years, and treatments were swapped between years in sites that were used in both years. In both years, males settled in equal numbers across treatments, but later arriving females avoided pairing with males in delayed phenology plots. Moreover, male pairing probability declined strongly with arrival date on the breeding grounds. Our results demonstrate that competitor phenology may be used to assess habitat quality by settling migrants, but we cannot pinpoint the exact mechanism (e.g. resource quality, predation pressure or competition) that has given rise to this pattern. In addition, we show that opposing selection pressures for arrival timing may give rise to different social information availabilities between sexes. We discuss our findings in the context of climate warming, social information use and the evolution of protandry in migratory animals. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={A wide range of health benefits have been ascribed to soya intake including a lowered risk of osteoporosis, heart disease, breast cancer, and menopausal symptoms. Because it is a hormonally active diet, however, soya can also be endocrine disrupting, suggesting that intake has the potential to cause adverse health effects in certain circumstances, particularly when exposure occurs during development. Consequently, the question of whether or not soya phyto-oestrogens are beneficial or harmful to human health is neither straightforward nor universally applicable to all groups. Possible benefits and risks depend on age, health status, and even the presence or absence of specific gut microflora. As global consumption increases, greater awareness and consideration of the endocrine-disrupting properties of soya by nutrition specialists and other health practitioners is needed. Consumption by infants and small children is of particular concern because their hormone-sensitive organs, including the brain and reproductive system, are still undergoing sexual differentiation and maturation. Thus, their susceptibility to the endocrine-disrupting activities of soya phyto-oestrogens may be especially high. As oestrogen receptor partial agonists with molecular and cellular properties similar to anthropogenic endocrine disruptors such as bisphenol A, the soya phyto-oestrogens provide an interesting model for how attitudes about what is 'synthetic' v. what is 'natural,' shapes understanding and perception of what it means for a compound to be endocrine disrupting and/or potentially harmful. This review describes the endocrine-disrupting properties of soya phyto-oestrogens with a focus on neuroendocrine development and behaviour. © 2016 The Author.},

abstract={Adolescent psychiatric patients are vulnerable to weight problems and show an overrepresentation of overweight compared to the healthy population. One potential factor that can contribute to the etiology of overweight is higher impulsivity. As of yet, it is unclear whether it is a general impulse control deficit or weight-related aspects such as lower impulse control in response to food that have an impact on body weight. As this may have therapeutic implications, the current study investigated differences between overweight and non-overweight adolescent psychiatric inpatients (N = 98; aged 12–20) in relation to trait impulsivity and behavioral inhibition performance. The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and two go/no-go paradigms with neutral and food-related stimulus materials were applied. Results indicated no significant differences concerning trait impulsivity, but revealed that overweight inpatients had significantly more difficulties in inhibition performance (i.e. they reacted more impulsively) in response to both food and neutral stimuli compared to non-overweight inpatients. Furthermore, no specific inhibition deficit for high-caloric vs. low-caloric food cues emerged in overweight inpatients, whereas non-overweight participants showed significantly lower inhibition skills in response to high-caloric than low-caloric food stimuli. The results highlight a rather general, non-food-specific reduced inhibition performance in an overweight adolescent psychiatric population. Further research is necessary to enhance the understanding of the role of impulsivity in terms of body weight status in this high-risk group of adolescent inpatients. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Predator avoidance depends on prey being able to discern how risk varies in space and time, but this is made considerably more complicated if risk is simultaneously present from multiple predators. This is the situation for an increasing number of mammalian prey species, as large carnivores recover or are reintroduced in ecosystems on several continents. Roe deer Capreolus capreolus in southern Norway illustrate a case in which prey face two predators with contrasting patterns of predation risk. They face a catch-22 situation: spatially avoiding the risk from one predator (lynx Lynx lynx in dense habitat) implies exposure to the other (hunters in open habitat). Using GPS-data from 29 roe deer, we tested for daily and seasonal variation in roe deer selection for habitat with respect to the habitats’ year-round average risk level. Generally, roe deer altered their habitat selection between night and day in a pattern consistent with being able to avoid predicted risk from the nocturnal lynx during night and predicted risk from human hunters during day. However, seasonal variation in habitat selection only partially corresponded with the predicted seasonal variation in risk. Whereas roe deer avoided areas with high risk from hunters more strongly during the hunting season than in other seasons, there was a lack of selection towards areas and time periods lowering the risk of lynx predation during winter. It seems likely that the risk of starvation and thermal stress constrain roe deer habitat selection during this energetically challenging season with cold temperatures, snow cover and limited natural forage. The habitat selection pattern of roe deer fits thus only partly with the two contrasting risk gradients they face. Adjusting risk-avoidance behavior temporally can be an adaptive response in the case of several predators whose predation patterns differ in space and time. © 2016 The Authors},

abstract={Aggressive signaling is a key social behavior of male Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens). Successfully establishing a territory and defending it from intruders has direct fitness effects, making Betta splendens a prime model for studies examining the biological underpinnings of aggressive behavior. Current research has outlined serotonin transporter pathways as one key component for the engagement and coordination of aggressive behavior in Betta splendens. Using the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, we examined the impact of 10 μmol exposures on associative learning and aggression between mirror and conspecific social reinforcers. Our results provide clear evidence that exposure to fluoxetine reduces aggression and impairs learning independent of social reinforce type. In addition, our results provide support for motor inhibition of aggressive behavior as the main behavioral mechanism of action for fluoxetine. Placed within the broader context of behavioral syndromes, our results, along with others, implicate serotonergic pathways as a key biological correlate of the bold-aggressive phenotype. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Addiction is a mental illness in which psychiatric conditions imply a prominent burden. Psychopathological symptoms in substance use disorder (SUD) patients are usually viewed as being assignable to the sphere of a personality trait or of comorbidity, leaving doubts about the presence of a specific psychopathology that could only be related to the toxicomanic process. Our research group at the University of Pisa has shed light on the possible definition of a specific psychopathological dimension in SUDs. In heroin use disorder patients, performing an exploratory principal component factor analysis (PCA) on all the 90 items included in the SCL-90 questionnaire led to a five-factor solution. The first factor accounted for a depressive "worthlessness and being trapped" dimension; the second factor picked out a "somatic symptoms" dimension; the third identified a "sensitivity-psychoticism" dimension; the fourth a "panic-anxiety" dimension; and the fifth a "violence-suicide" dimension. These same results were replicated by applying the PCA to another Italian sample of 1,195 heroin addicts entering a Therapeutic Community Treatment. Further analyses confirmed the clusters of symptoms, independently of demographic and clinical characteristics, active heroin use, lifetime psychiatric problems, kind of treatment received, and, especially, other substances used by the patient such as alcohol or cocaine. Moreover, these clusters were able to discriminate patients affected by addiction from those affected by psychiatric diseases such as major depressive disorder. Our studies seem to suggest the trait-dependent, rather than the state-dependent, nature of the introduced psychopathology dimensions of SUDs. © 2017 Maremmani, Pani, Rovai, Bacciardi and Maremmani.},

abstract={Animals use rules to initiate behaviors. Such rules are often described as triggers that determine when behavior begins. However, although less explored, these selection rules are also an opportunity to establish sensorimotor constraints that influence how the behavior ends. These constraints may be particularly significant in influencing success in prey capture. Here we explore this in dragonfly prey interception. We found that in the moments leading up to takeoff, perched dragonflies employ a series of sensorimotor rules that determine the time of takeoff and increase the probability of successful capture. First, the dragonfly makes a head saccade followed by smooth pursuit movements to orient its direction-of-gaze at potential prey. Second, the dragonfly assesses whether the prey's angular size and speed co-vary within a privileged range. Finally, the dragonfly times the moment of its takeoff to a prediction of when the prey will cross the zenith. Each of these processes serves a purpose. The angular size-speed criteria biases interception flights to catchable prey, while the head movements and the predictive takeoff ensure flights begin with the prey visually fixated and directly overhead—the key parameters that underlie interception steering. Prey that do not elicit takeoff generally fail at least one of the criterion, and the loss of prey fixation or overhead positioning during flight is strongly correlated with terminated flights. Thus from an abundance of potential targets, the dragonfly selects a stereotyped set of takeoff conditions based on the prey and body states most likely to end in successful capture. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This book reviews strategies for assessing and treating pediatric obesity in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (ND). It synthesizes empirical findings and clinical strategies to offer the latest knowledge in key areas, including risk factors, physical activity, nutrition, treatment planning, goal-setting, and engagement with patients. A four-stage treatment model presents clinical guidance in triaging treatment and tailoring interventions to children's changing medical, behavioral, emotional, and cognitive needs. The book complements current pediatric ND literature by presenting clear guidelines for integrating treatment for obesity into existing treatment of these young patients. Topics featured in this book include: The effect of neurodevelopmental disorders on the assessment of obesity in children. The impact of developmental delays on physical activities and health behaviors. Strategies for promoting weight management goals in pediatric ND. Suggestions on how to engage and support families and caregivers. The role of prevention in weight management within pediatric ND. Assessing and Treating Pediatric Obesity in Neurodevelopmental Disorders is a must-have resource for clinicians, scientist-practitioners, and related professionals as well as researchers, professors, and graduate students in clinical child and school psychology, public health, social work, pediatrics, occupational therapy, and nutrition. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

abstract={Sleep is a universal behavior, essential for humans and animals alike to survive. Its importance to a person's physical and mental health cannot be overstated. Although lateralization of function is well established in the lesion, split-brain and task based neuroimaging literature, and more recently in functional imaging studies of spontaneous fluctuations of the fMRI BOLD signal during wakeful rest, it is unknown if these asymmetries are present during sleep. We investigated hemispheric asymmetries in the global brain signal during non-REM sleep. Here we show that increasing sleep depth is accompanied by an increasing rightward asymmetry of regions in visual cortex including primary bilaterally and in the right hemisphere along the lingual gyrus and middle temporal cortex. In addition, left hemisphere language regions largely maintained their leftward asymmetry during sleep. Right hemisphere attention related regions expressed a more complicated relation with some regions maintaining a rightward asymmetry while this was lost in others. These results suggest that asymmetries in the human brain are state dependent. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

The experimental diets were supplemented with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 g MOS kg−1 and were fed to juvenile fish (0.47 ± 0.017 g) in triplicates for six weeks. Significant differences were found in the final body weight, body weight intake, percent body weight intake, and specific growth rate among treatments. The regression analyses showed that the optimum MOS level was 4–4.1 g MOS kg−1 diet. Fish fed 4 g MOS kg−1 feed showed higher survival than the other treatments. Also, using the novel tank test, fish fed with 4 g MOS kg−1 diet showed lower anxiety by swimming in the upper portion of the tank. The other behavior parameters remained unaffected by the prebiotic. The results indicated the beneficial effect of the prebiotic MOS on growth and partly on welfare of zebrafish juveniles. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Irisin, a novel exercise-induced myokine, has attracted attention with its effects on energy metabolism. This study was conducted to determine the possible effects of irisin on nutritional behaviour. In this study, 40 male Wistar Albino rats were separated into 4 groups (n = 10 for each group). Osmotic mini-pumps were connected to metal cannulas implanted to lateral ventricle; and artificial cerebrospinal fluid (vehicle), and 10 and 100 nM of irisin was infused for 7 days. The daily food and water consumptions and body weights of rats were followed up. After the infusion, the animals were killed, and the hypothalamus and blood samples were collected. NPY, POMC, and UCP2 mRNA levels in the hypothalamus were examined by RT-PCR. In serum, leptin and ghrelin levels as well as the levels of metabolic parameters were measured by using ELISA. It was determined that irisin administration increased the daily food consumption (p < 0.05), without causing significant changes in water consumption and body weight. Irisin also caused increases in ghrelin level in circulation and NPY and UCP2 mRNA levels in the hypothalamus, whereas it decreased the leptin level in circulation and POMC mRNA levels in the hypothalamus (p < 0.05). Otherwise, irisin caused decrease in LDL, triglycerides and cholesterol levels, while increasing HDL and glucose levels (p < 0.05). Results indicates that long-term irisin treatment increases food intake without increasing body weight associated with increased ghrelin, NPY and UCP2 mRNAs, and decreased leptin and POMC mRNA in the hypothalamus. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

We analyzed yolk lipid and hormone concentrations, and HPA-axis activity in hens fed a control diet (high n-6/n-3 ratio) or a diet enriched in n-3 PUFAs (low n-6/n-3 ratio) for 6 consecutive weeks. Their chicks were tested for neophobia during the first week of life. We found higher corticosterone metabolites in droppings of hens fed the diet enriched in n-3 and significantly higher concentrations of yolk progesterone, androstenedione, and estradiol in their eggs compared to controls. Chicks of hens fed the n-3 enriched diet showed a lower body mass at hatch than controls and expressed higher neophobia when exposed to a novel object.

abstract={The arid and semi-arid zones of Australia are characterized by highly variable and unpredictable environmental conditions which affect resources for flora and fauna. Environments which are highly unpredictable in terms of both resource access and distribution are likely to select for a variety of adaptive behavioral strategies, intrinsically linked to the physiological control of behavior. How unpredictable resource distribution has affected the coevolution of behavioral strategies and physiology has rarely been quantified, particularly not in Australian birds. We used a captive population of wild-derived zebra finches to test the relationships between behavioral strategies relating to food access and physiological responses to stress and body condition. We found that individuals that were in poorer body condition and had higher peak corticosterone levels entered baited feeders earlier in the trapping sequence of birds within the colony. We also found that individuals in poorer body condition fed in smaller social groups. Our data show that the foraging decisions which individuals make represent not only a trade-off between food access and risk of exposure, but their underlying physiological response to stress. Our data also suggest fundamental links between social networks and physiological parameters, which largely remain untested. These data demonstrate the fundamental importance of physiological mechanisms in controlling adaptive behavioral strategies and the dynamic interplay between physiological control of behavior and life-history evolution. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Abstract: Predator presence and shortage of food resources can alter behavior and cause chronic physiological stress, with long-term detrimental effects on the prey. Recently, it has been hypothesized that cellular damage via oxidative stress could be associated with such effects. Variation in food availability and predation risk could modify the oxidative/antioxidant status of prey. However, data from wild populations is scarce and, importantly, the interactive effects of these major ecological factors on oxidative/antioxidant status are poorly understood. We present the first study in a wild vertebrate, addressing the combined effects of experimental food supplementation and increased predation risk (cues of Mustela erminea) on antioxidant status of female pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca). We tested the effects during breeding, assuming that such variation could modify the antioxidant cost of reproduction. Supplementary food increased female body mass, independently of predator treatment. However, timing of breeding and reproductive investment remained unaffected by the treatments. Principal component 1 (PC 1) of antioxidant levels [reflecting superoxidase dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione (tGSH)] showed lower values in the food-supplemented than non-food-supplemented group. Neither PC 2 [reflecting catalase (CAT) and GSH/GSSG ratio] nor PC 1 was affected by predation risk, and further, predation risk did not alter the effect of supplementary food on either PC. These results suggest that food resources may have a stronger impact than predation risk on female antioxidant status during breeding. This is the first fully experimental study focusing on the interactive effects of key environmental variables on antioxidant status in wild vertebrates; more studies are however needed to understand the role of these factors in shaping the cost of reproduction. Significance statement: Predator presence and shortage of food resources may modify animal behavior and cause chronic physiological stress response with long-term detrimental effects on the prey. Recently, it has been hypothesized that cellular damage via oxidative stress (i.e., imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidant defenses) could be associated with such effects, but evidence from wild populations is scarce. Importantly, the interactive effects of food and predation are not well understood. For the first time in a vertebrate, we experimentally studied the combined effects of food availability and (simulated) predation risk on antioxidant status, using wild breeding passerines. Higher food availability, but not increased perceived predation risk, lowered the antioxidant defenses. Predation risk did not alter the effect of supplementary food. The role of such interactions in shaping the cost of reproduction (via antioxidant/oxidative status) should be further studied. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Recent evidence pointed out that the prevalence of depression has reached epidemic proportions in last decades. This increase has been linked to many environmental factors, among these the influence of dietary factors has gained great attention. In particular, it has been reported that low n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) intake in diet is correlated to the development of depressive and anxiety-like symptoms. Furthermore, maternal malnutrition is a widely accepted risk factor for developing mental illness in later adulthood; among others, depression has been strongly associated to this event. On the other hand, we have previously found that acute intracerebral injection of the soluble beta amyloid 1–42 (Aβ1–42) peptide induces a depressive-like behavior in rats, associated to altered hypothalamic–pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation and reduced cortical serotonin and neurotrophin levels. The aim of the present work was to study the effect of pre- and post-natal (5 weeks post-weaning) exposure to diets differently enriched in n-3, n-6, as well as n-6/n-3 PUFA balanced, on immobility time displayed on the forced swimming test (FST), along with neuroendocrine quantification in offspring rats. Results showed that n-6 PUFA-enriched diet increased depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, as shown by the elevation in the immobility time in the FST test and self-grooming in the open field test. Those effects were accompanied by reduced cortical serotonin, high plasmatic corticosterone and hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor levels. Finally, enhanced plasmatic Aβ1–42 levels after n-6 PUFA diet and reduced plasmatic Aβ1–42 levels after n-3 PUFA were found. Taken together, our data indicate that Aβ1–42 might be crucially involved in behavioral alterations found after n-6 rich PUFA diet and strongly endorse the protective role of n-3 and the detrimental effect of improper n-6 PUFA diet consumption. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={We studied the breeding biology of the south temperate Cape Penduline Tit (Anthoscopus minutus) in order to compare its life history traits with those of related north temperate members of the family Remizidae, namely the Eurasian Penduline Tit (Remiz pendulinus) and the Verdin (Auriparus flaviceps). We used this comparison to test key predictions of three hypotheses thought to explain latitudinal variation in life histories among bird species—the seasonality and food limitation hypothesis, nest predation hypothesis and adult mortality hypothesis. Contrary to the general pattern of smaller clutch size and lower adult mortality among south-temperate birds living in less seasonal environments, the Cape Penduline Tit has a clutch size larger than that of the Verdin and similar to that of the Eurasian Penduline Tit, and higher adult mortality than both of the other two species. The most notable difference between the Cape Penduline Tit and the two other species is in parental behavioural strategy, with the former exhibiting bi-parental care at all stages of nesting together with facultative cooperative breeding, whereas the Eurasian Penduline Tit has uni-parental care and the Verdin has a combination of female-only incubation but bi-parental nestling care. Consequently, in comparison to the other two species, the Cape Penduline Tit exhibits greater nest attentiveness during incubation, a similar per-nestling feeding rate and greater post-fledging survival. Its relatively large clutch size, high parental investment and associated high adult mortality in a less seasonal environment are consistent with key predictions of the adult mortality hypothesis but not with key predictions of the seasonality and food limitation hypothesis in explaining life history variation among Remizidae species. These results add to a growing body of evidence of the importance of age-specific mortality in shaping life history evolution. © 2016, Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.},

abstract={The advantages of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, including low genetic redundancy, functional simplicity, and the ability to conduct large-scale genetic screens, have been essential for understanding the molecular nature of circadian (_24 hr) rhythms, and continue to be valuable in discovering novel regulators of circadian rhythms and sleep. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of these interrelated biological processes in Drosophila and the wider implications of this research. Clock genes period and timeless were first discovered in large-scale Drosophila genetic screens developed in the 1970s. Feedback of period and timeless on their own transcription forms the core of the molecular clock, and accurately timed expression, localization, post-transcriptional modification, and function of these genes is thought to be critical for maintaining the circadian cycle. Regulators, including several phosphatases and kinases, act on different steps of this feedback loop to ensure strong and accurately timed rhythms. Approximately 150 neurons in the fly brain that contain the core components of the molecular clock act together to translate this intracellular cycling into rhythmic behavior. We discuss how different groups of clock neurons serve different functions in allowing clocks to entrain to environmental cues, driving behavioral outputs at different times of day, and allowing flexible behavioral responses in different environmental conditions. The neuropeptide PDF provides an important signal thought to synchronize clock neurons, although the details of how PDF accomplishes this function are still being explored. Secreted signals from clock neurons also influence rhythms in other tissues. SLEEP is, in part, regulated by the circadian clock, which ensures appropriate timing of sleep, but the amount and quality of sleep are also determined by other mechanisms that ensure a homeostatic balance between sleep and wake. Flies have been useful for identifying a large set of genes, molecules, and neuroanatomic loci important for regulating sleep amount. Conserved aspects of sleep regulation in flies and mammals include wake-promoting roles for catecholamine neurotransmitters and involvement of hypothalamus-like regions, although other neuroanatomic regions implicated in sleep in flies have less clear parallels. Sleep is also subject to regulation by factors such as food availability, stress, and social environment. We are beginning to understand how the identified molecules and neurons interact with each other, and with the environment, to regulate sleep. Drosophila researchers can also take advantage of increasing mechanistic understanding of other behaviors, such as learning and memory, courtship, and aggression, to understand how sleep loss impacts these behaviors. Flies thus remain a valuable tool for both discovery of novel molecules and deep mechanistic understanding of sleep and circadian rhythms. © 2017 by the Genetics Society of America.},

abstract={Common reports of over-response to food cues, difficulties with calorie restriction, and difficulty adhering to dietary guidelines suggest that eating behaviors could be interrelated in ways that influence weight management efforts. The feasibility of identifying robust eating phenotypes (showing face, content, and criterion validity) was explored based on well-validated individual eating behavior assessments. Adults (n = 260; mean age 34 years) completed online questionnaires with measurements of nine eating behaviors including: appetite for palatable foods, binge eating, bitter taste sensitivity, disinhibition, food neophobia, pickiness and satiety responsiveness. Discovery-based visualization procedures that have the combined strengths of heatmaps and hierarchical clustering were used to investigate: 1) how eating behaviors cluster, 2) how participants can be grouped within eating behavior clusters, and 3) whether group clustering is associated with body mass index (BMI) and dietary self-efficacy levels. Two distinct eating behavior clusters and participant groups that aligned within these clusters were identified: one with higher drive to eat and another with food avoidance behaviors. Participants’ BMI (p = 0.0002) and dietary self-efficacy (p < 0.0001) were associated with cluster membership. Eating behavior clusters showed content and criterion validity based on their association with BMI (associated, but not entirely overlapping) and dietary self-efficacy. Identifying eating behavior phenotypes appears viable. These efforts could be expanded and ultimately inform tailored weight management interventions. © 2017},

abstract={During the breeding season, males often produce costly and extravagant displays or physical ornaments to attract females. Numerous studies have established that testosterone could directly influence the expression of certain sexual signals. However, few of these studies have focused on the indirect role that testosterone could play in modulating prey detection and visual performance to improve the foraging ability of males and hence their acquisition of nutritional resource. In the present study, we experimentally modified the testosterone levels of European tree frog males (Hyla arborea), staying in the natural range previously measured in the field, and we investigated the effect of testosterone on the foraging ability of individuals. Foraging capacities were measured on males placed in an arena with a virtual cricket moving on a computer screen. Our results demonstrated a significant effect of testosterone on the hunting behavior of H. arborea. We observed that testosterone reduced the orientation latency to virtual prey for supplemented males compared to controls. In addition, testosterone significantly increased the attack promptness of male frogs. Finally, our experiment did not demonstrate any impact of testosterone on male attack success. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Resveratrol, a caloric restriction mimetic, is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Oxidative stress has been implicated in the etiology of a number of neuropsychiatric disorders including generalized anxiety and schizophrenia. This study investigated the anxiolytic and antipsychotic potentials of resveratrol in murine models of anxiety and schizophrenia. Mice were pretreated with resveratrol (200 and 400 mg/kg) in 1% carboxymethyl cellulose for 14 days and subjected to behavioural tests on the 15th day. Anxiolytic activity of resveratrol was determined using the hole board and staircase tests while its anti-psychotic property was evaluated via apormorphine induced stereotypy and swim-induced grooming tests. Although resveratrol did not significantly reduce the mean number of head dips at doses used in the hole board test, it significantly (p < 0.01) decreased the mean episodes of rearing without significantly altering the total number of upward steps climbed in the staircase test. Resveratrol significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the mean climbing scores in the first ten minutes of the apormorphine induced stereotypic climbing and significantly decreased (p < 0.01) episodes and total duration of swim induced grooming in mice. Administration of resveratrol at doses used in this study produced anxiolysis and anti-psychotic effects in mice. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Maternal obesity is known to predispose offspring to metabolic and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. While the mechanisms underlying these phenomena are unclear, high fat diets dramatically alter intestinal microbiota, and gut microbiota can impact physiological function. To determine if maternal diet-induced gut dysbiosis can disrupt offspring neurobehavioral function, we transplanted high fat diet- (HFD) or control low fat diet-Associated (CD) gut microbiota to conventionally-housed female mice. Recipient mice were then bred and the behavioral phenotype of male and female offspring was tracked. While maternal behavior was unaffected, neonatal offspring from HFD dams vocalized less upon maternal separation than pups from CD dams. Furthermore, weaned male offspring from HFD dams had significant and selective disruptions in exploratory, cognitive, and stereotypical/compulsive behavior compared to male offspring from CD dams; while female offspring from HFD dams had increases in body weight and adiposity. 16S metagenomic analyses confirmed establishment of divergent microbiota in CD and HFD dams, with alterations in diversity and taxonomic distribution throughout pregnancy and lactation. Likewise, significant alterations in gut microbial diversity and distribution were noted in offspring from HFD dams compared to CD dams, and in males compared to females. Regression analyses of behavioral performance against differentially represented taxa suggest that decreased representation of specific members of the Firmicutes phylum predict behavioral decline in male offspring. Collectively, these data establish that high fat diet-induced maternal dysbiosis is sufficient to disrupt behavioral function in murine offspring in a sex-specific manner. Thus these data reinforce the essential link between maternal diet and neurologic programming in offspring and suggest that intestinal dysbiosis could link unhealthy modern diets to the increased prevalence of neurodevelopmental and childhood disorders. © 2017 Bruce-Keller et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.},

abstract={Birds should store body reserves if starvation risk is anticipated; this is known as an ‘interrupted foraging response’. If foraging remains unrestricted, however, body mass should remain low to limit the predation risk that gaining and carrying body reserves entails. In temperate environments mass gain in female birds during breeding is often attributed to egg formation and mass loss after incubation to flight adaptation or the effect of reproductive workload, rather than as a result of an adaptive interrupted foraging response to the limited foraging time or unpredictable foraging conditions that breeding demands. In tropical environments, foraging conditions vary more within the breeding season than in temperate environments, and so studies in tropical environments are more suited to decouple the potentially confounded effects of increase in body reserves versus egg formation on the body mass of breeding birds. In this study, we test whether breeding results in an interrupted foraging response in a tropical savannah system using body mass data collected over a 15-year period from female common bulbuls Pycnonotus barbatus. This species breeds both in the wet and dry season, despite fewer resources being available in the dry season. Breeding stage predicted female body mass: body mass peaked abruptly during incubation, but was not closely associated with the egg-laying stage, and declined during brood rearing. Breeding females were heavier in the dry season than in the wet season. In the dry season, heavier birds were more likely to incubate eggs or brood chicks. These observations suggest that increased body reserves are required to buffer the consequence of limited foraging time or impoverished foraging conditions, which may be most pronounced during incubation and in the dry season, respectively. Such mass increases are consistent with an interrupted foraging response, which may apply to temperate zone birds experiencing foraging restrictions during breeding. © 2016 The Authors},

abstract={The regulation of gene expression in response to environmental and behavioural cues is critical for many biological processes. Histone tail modifications are dynamic and, as such, can regulate gene expression in response to extracellular conditions. Many of the enzymes involved in adding and removing these modifications require cofactors that are products of intermediary metabolism pathways, thus linking cellular metabolism to the regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, the expression and activity of such enzymes are influenced by the cellular concentrations of metabolic products. Under- and over-nutrition can induce epigenetic changes that influence chromatin structure and define a metabolic program. Importantly, recent studies have demonstrated that such changes during the pre- and peri-natal periods can be long-lasting, influencing the disease risk later in life and could be transmitted to subsequent generations. Moreover, damaging gene expression patterns observed in metabolic diseases such as diabetes are driven by persistent changes in chromatin structure, raising the possibility of targeting epigenetic pathways for the treatment of disease. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: Information on long-term follow up of childhood-onset anorexia nervosa is scarce. This study investigated long-term (>10 years) course, outcome and prognostic factors for hospitalized childhood-onset anorexia nervosa restricting type (ANR). Methods: Forty-one ANR girls admitted to a single regional center participated. Median age at first admission was 13.3 years (range, 8.6–15.6 years). The longitudinal clinical course was retrospectively determined for a median follow-up period of 17.1 years (range, 10.4–21.1 years). We analyzed physical, psychological, and social variables to predict partial remission (PR) and full remission (FR). Results: The completion rate of follow up >10 years was high at 97%. At final evaluation (n = 38), distribution of prognosis was as follows: FR, n = 27 (71%); PR, n = 6 (16%); and non-remission, n = 5 (13%). The cumulative ratio of PR and FR increased during the first 5–6 years, and gradually reached a plateau at around 10 years. More than 10 years after the onset, one patient eventually achieved FR, and one patient died. Seven patients were rehospitalized and two died due to suicide during the entire follow up. On multivariate analysis, family disorders/problems rating score was a significant predictor of PR and FR. Conclusions: This study included hospitalized ANR children aged ≤15 years, the youngest cohort ever reported. Long-term prognosis is generally favorable, but the mortality rate was 5%. Careful long-term follow up >10 years is needed to evaluate outcome of childhood-onset ANR, and family therapy is important in high-risk patients with family disorders/problems. © 2016 Japan Pediatric Society},

abstract={Foraging animals balance the need to seek food and energy against the accompanying dangers of injury and predation. To do so, they rely on learning systems encoding reward and danger. Whereas much is known about these separate learning systems, little is known about how they interact to shape and guide behavior. Here we show a key role for the rat paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), a nucleus of the dorsal midline thalamus, in this interaction. First, we show behavioral competition between reward and danger: the opportunity to seek food reward negatively modulates expression of species-typical defensive behavior. Then, using a chemogenetic approach expressing the inhibitory hM4Di designer receptor exclusively activated by a designer drug in PVT neurons, we show that the PVTis central to this behavioral competition. ChemogeneticPVTsilencing biases behavior toward either defense or reward depending on the experimental conditions, but does not consistently favor expression of one over the other. This bias could not be attributed to changes in fear memory retrieval, learned safety, or memory interference. Rather, our results demonstrate that the PVT is essential for balancing conflicting behavioral tendencies toward danger and reward, enabling adaptive responding under this basic selection pressure. © 2017 the authors.},

abstract={The global increase in rates of obesity has been accompanied by a similar surge in the number of autism diagnoses. Accumulating epidemiological evidence suggest a possible link between overweight and the risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), as well as autism severity. In laboratory animals, several studies have shown a connection between various environmental factors, including diet-induced obesity, and the development of autism-related behaviors. However, the effect of high-fat or imbalanced diet on a pre-existing autism-like phenotype is unclear. In this study, we employed the BTBR inbred mouse strain, a well-established mouse model for autism, to assess the impact of inadequate fattening nutrition on the autism-related behavioral phenotype. Male mice were fed by high-fat diet (HFD) or control balanced diet (control) from weaning onward, and tested in a series of behavioral assays as adults. In addition, we measured the hypothalamic expression levels of several genes involved in oxytocin and dopamine signaling, in search of a possible neurobiological underlying mechanism. As an internal control, we also employed similar metabolic and behavioral measures on neurotypical C57 mice. Compared to control-fed mice, BTBR mice fed by HFD showed marked aggravation in autism-related behaviors, manifested in increased cognitive rigidity and diminished preference for social novelty. Moreover, the total autism composite (severity) score was higher in the HFD group, and positively correlated with higher body weight. Finally, we revealed negative correlations associating dopamine signaling factors in the hypothalamus, to autism-related severity and body weight. In contrast, we found no significant effects of HFD on autism-related behaviors of C57 mice, though the metabolic effects of the diet were similar for both strains. Our results indicate a direct causative link between diet-induced obesity and worsening of a pre-existing autism-related behavior and emphasize the need for adequate nutrition in ASD patients. These findings might also implicate the involvement of hypothalamic dopamine in mediating this effect. © 2016 IBRO},

abstract={Background: Prenatal exposure to infection is a recognized environmental risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders of developmental origins such as autism or schizophrenia. Experimental work in animals indicates that this link is mediated by maternal immune activation (MIA) involving interactions between cytokine-associated inflammatory events, oxidative stress, and other pathophysiological processes such as hypoferremia and zinc deficiency. Maternal administration of the viral mimic polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) in mice produces several behavioral phenotypes in adult offspring of relevance to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Methods: Here, we investigated whether some of these phenotypes might also present in juveniles. In addition, given the known immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects of vitamin D, we also investigated whether the co-administration of vitamin D could block MIA-induced ASD-related behaviors. We co-administered the hormonally active form of vitamin D, 1α,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3 (1,25OHD), simultaneously with poly(I:C) and examined (i) social interaction, stereotyped behavior, emotional learning and memory, and innate anxiety-like behavior in juveniles and (ii) the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in maternal plasma and fetal brains. Results: We show that like adult offspring that were exposed to MIA, juveniles display similar deficits in social approach behavior. Juvenile MIA offspring also show abnormal stereotyped digging and impaired acquisition and expression of tone-cued fear conditioning. Importantly, our study reveals that prenatal administration of 1,25OHD abolishes all these behavioral deficits in poly(I:C)-treated juveniles. However, prenatal administration of vitamin D had no effect on pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in dams or in fetal brains suggesting the anti-inflammatory actions of vitamin D are not the critical mechanism for its preventive actions in this ASD animal model. Conclusions: This work raises the possibility that early dietary supplementation with vitamin D may open new avenues for a successful attenuation or even prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders following maternal inflammation during pregnancy. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Monk Parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) is a successful invader of many European urbanised habitats. Here, we report evidence of interspecific interactions between this species and some synanthropic co-occurring birds in three urban parks of Rome (central Italy). In both nesting and feeding sites, we recorded 158 interactions with seven syntopic species in eight colonial focal nests (0.74 events/hr). The number and frequency of interactions significantly differ among nests and species, the Italian Sparrow (Passer italiae) being the most interactive species. For this species, the frequency of interactions was normally distributed between different months with a peak in June. We also observed a case of nest cohabitation, as well as predatory attacks carried out by Hooded Crow (Corvus cornix). As far as foraging sites are concerned, 11 out of 74 clusters of parakeets (15%) hosted four bird species, mainly Starling, Sturnus vulgaris, but we did not observe any interactions. Although Monk Parakeet is a social bird generally tolerant towards other species near their nests and in foraging areas, we observed interspecific interactions in nesting sites as a response to competitive or predatory mechanisms. Italian Sparrows interact because they use parakeet nests as a secondary structure for nesting (cohabitation) and, probably, because of the wide availability of food resources (invertebrates) useful for juvenile recruitment. The interaction of parakeets with Hooded Crow is a response to predatory attacks on eggs or juveniles. However, interspecific interactions seem to be occasional events in nesting sites and are apparently absent in feeding sites, where competitive behaviour is probably reduced due to high availability of plant resources. In urbanised areas, where Monk Parakeets have recently been introduced, the number of competitors and predators might be very reduced (both in number of events and species) in comparison to native areas where competition and predatory mechanisms reflect long-term co-evolutionary dynamics. © 2016 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.},

abstract={The distribution of latencies and interresponse times (IRTs) of rats was compared between two fixed-interval (FI) schedules of food reinforcement (FI 30 s and FI 90 s), and between two levels of food deprivation. Computational modeling revealed that latencies and IRTs were well described by mixture probability distributions embodying two-state Markov chains. Analysis of these models revealed that only a subset of latencies is sensitive to the periodicity of reinforcement, and prefeeding only reduces the size of this subset. The distribution of IRTs suggests that behavior in FI schedules is organized in bouts that lengthen and ramp up in frequency with proximity to reinforcement. Prefeeding slowed down the lengthening of bouts and increased the time between bouts. When concatenated, latency and IRT models adequately reproduced sigmoidal FI response functions. These findings suggest that behavior in FI schedules fluctuates in and out of schedule control; an account of such fluctuation suggests that timing and motivation are dissociable components of FI performance. These mixture-distribution models also provide novel insights on the motivational, associative, and timing processes expressed in FI performance. These processes may be obscured, however, when performance in timing tasks is analyzed in terms of mean response rates. © 2016, Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

abstract={It is well known that predators often influence the foraging behaviour of prey through the so-called “fear effect”. However, it is also possible that predators could change prey behaviour indirectly by altering the prey’s food supply through a trophic cascade. The predator–sea urchin–kelp trophic cascade is widely assumed to be driven by the removal of sea urchins by predators, but changes in sea urchin behaviour in response to predators or increased food availability could also play an important role. We tested whether increased crevice occupancy by herbivorous sea urchins in the presence of abundant predatory fishes and lobsters is a response to the increased risk of predation, or an indirect response to higher kelp abundances. Inside two New Zealand marine reserves with abundant predators and kelp, individuals of the sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus were rarer and remained cryptic (i.e. found in crevices) to larger sizes than on adjacent fished coasts where predators and kelp are rare. In a mesocosm experiment, cryptic behaviour was induced by simulated predation (the addition of crushed conspecifics), but the addition of food in the form of drift kelp did not induce cryptic behaviour. These findings demonstrate that the ‘fear’ of predators is more important than food availability in promoting sea urchin cryptic behaviour and suggest that both density- and behaviourally mediated interactions are important in the predator–sea urchin–kelp trophic cascade. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Abstract: Risk-taking decisions in front of a predator are crucial for the fitness of the animals. Risk-taking behaviour can be hypothesised to depend on escape ability, which is difficult to study in the wild. In this field study, we investigated whether escape ability (i) is a consistent individual-specific characteristic and (ii) can explain between-individual variation in risk-taking behaviour in male collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis). We estimated escape ability by the time that was needed to capture individuals by hand in an outdoor aviary during both the courtship and the nestling feeding phases. We estimated risk-taking by human-induced flight initiation distance (FID) and parental nest-defence behaviour. We also measured variables that reflect individual quality and condition to assess how these affect escape ability. Time to capture was weakly repeatable in the within- and between-season contexts, but was considerably repeatable within a day. We found that time to capture decreased between courtship and nestling feeding phases, probably due to parallel changes in body condition (as shown by the systematic decline of individual body mass between phases correlating with within-individual changes in time to capture). Overall, time to capture was not significantly related to risk-taking behaviour, but we found a negative correlation between time to capture and FID in yearlings. In conclusion, escape ability in flycatchers seems to be a condition-dependent plastic trait, and it has the potential to affect immediate risk-taking decisions. Significance statement: We investigated the proximate determinants of escape ability in collared flycatcher males and whether this trait can be a potential driver of risk-taking behaviour, which is a rarely considered issue. We measured escape ability as time needed to capture birds in an outdoor aviary by hand. We found that escape ability was repeatable only in a short-term context, and differed between the courtship and chick-feeding periods, probably due to parallel changes in body condition. Furthermore, escape ability in yearlings (but not in adults) correlated with an estimate of risk-taking in the wild indicating that males with better ability to escape take higher risk. Our findings highlight that individual decisions about risk-taking might partially rely on how individuals assess their potential escape success. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Stress alters the ability to form, recall and maintain memory according to the Yerkes-Dodson/Hebb (YDH) law. The effects of environmentally relevant stressors, such as low environmental calcium and crowding, on learning and memory have previously been described in a laboratory-reared 'average' strain of Lymnaea stagnalis (i.e. the Dutch strain) as well as two strains of freshly collected L. stagnalis with enhanced memory formation abilities (i.e. 'smart' snails). Here, we use L. stagnalis to study the effects of other environmentally relevant stressors on memory formation in two other strains of freshly collected snails, one 'smart' and one 'average'. The stressors we examined are thermal, resource restriction combined with food odour, predator detection and, for the first time, tissue injury (shell damage). We show that the same stressor has significantly different effects on memory formation depending on whether snails are 'smart' or 'average'. Specifically, our data suggest that a stressor or a combination of stressors act to enhance memory in 'average' snails but obstruct memory formation in 'smart' snails. These results are consistent with the YDH law and our hypothesis that 'smart' snails are more easily stressed than 'average' snails. © 2017. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.},

abstract={Aims and objectives: To explore the cultural factors related to dietary and fluid restriction behaviours among older Chinese patients. Background: Excess dietary sodium and fluid intake are risk factors contributing to the worsening and rehospitalisation for heart failure in older patients. Managing the complex fluid and diet requirements of heart failure patients is challenging and is made more complicated by cultural variations in self-management behaviours in response to a health threat. Design: Qualitative study using semi-structured in interviews and framework analysis. Methods: The design of this study is qualitative descriptive. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 heart failure patients. Data were analysed through content analysis. Results: Seven cultural themes emerged from the qualitative data: the values placed on health and illness, customary way of life, preference for folk care and the Chinese healthcare system, and factors related to kinship and social ties, religion, economics and education. Conclusions: Dietary change and management in response to illness, including heart failure, is closely related to individuals’ cultural background. Healthcare providers should have a good understanding of cultural aspects that can influence patients’ conformity to medical recommendations. Relevance to clinical practice: Heart failure patients need support that considers their cultural needs. Healthcare providers must have a good understanding of the experiences of people from diverse cultural backgrounds. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Moving shadows signify imminent threat to foraging juvenile crayfish, and the animals respond with one of two discrete anti-predatory behaviors: They either freeze in place or rapidly flex their tails, which quickly propels them away from the approaching danger signal. Although a freeze might be the more risky choice, it keeps the animal near the expected food reward, while a tail-flip is effective in avoiding the shadow, but puts critical distance between the animal and its next meal. We manipulated the satiation level of juvenile crayfish to determine whether their behavioral choices are affected by internal energy states. When facing the same visual danger signal, animals fed to satiation produced more tail-flips and fewer freezes than unfed animals, indicating that intrinsic physiological conditions shape value-based behavioral decisions. Escape tail-flip latencies, however, were unaffected by satiation level, and an increase in food quality only produced a minor behavioral shift toward more freezing in both fed and unfed animals. Thus, satiation level appears to be the dominant factor in regulating decision making and behavioral choices of crayfish. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Despite growing interest, the behavioural ecology of deep-sea organisms is largely unknown. Much of this scarcity in knowledge can be attributed to deepwater animals being secretive or comparatively ‘rare’, as well as technical difficulties associated with accessing such remote habitats. Here we tested whether two species of giant marine isopod (Bathynomus giganteus, Booralana tricarinata) captured from 653 to 875 m in the Caribbean Sea near Eleuthera, The Bahamas, exhibited an activity behavioural syndrome across two environmental contexts (presence/absence of food stimulus) and further whether this syndrome carried over consistently between sexes. We also measured routine metabolic rate and oxygen consumption in response to a food stimulus in B. giganteus to assess whether these variables are related to individual differences in personality. We found that both species show an activity syndrome across environmental contexts, but the underlying mechanistic basis of this syndrome, particularly in B. giganteus, is unclear. Contrary to our initial predictions, neither B. giganteus nor B. tricarinata showed any differences between mean expression of behavioural traits between sexes. Both sexes of B. tricarinata showed strong evidence of an activity syndrome underlying movement and foraging ecology, whereas only male B. giganteus showed evidence of an activity syndrome. Generally, individuals that were more active and bolder, in a standard open arena test were also more active when a food stimulus was present. Interestingly, individual differences in metabolism were not related to individual differences in behaviour based on present data. Our study provides the first measurements of behavioural syndromes and metabolism in giant deep-sea isopods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Rats and mice exposed to repeated stress or a single severe stress exhibit a sustained increase in energetic, endocrine, and behavioral response to subsequent novel mild stress. This study tested whether the hyper-responsiveness was due to a lowered threshold of response to corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) or an exaggerated response to a standard dose of CRF. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to 3 h of restraint on each of 3 consecutive days (RRS) or were non-restrained controls. RRS caused a temporary hypophagia but a sustained reduction in body weight. Eight days after the end of restraint, rats received increasing third ventricle doses of CRF (0–3.0 μg). The lowest dose of CRF (0.25 μg) increased corticosterone release in RRS, but not control rats. Higher doses caused the same stimulation of corticosterone in the two groups of rats. Fifteen days after the end of restraint, rats were food deprived during the light period and received increasing third ventricle doses of CRF at the start of the dark period. The lowest dose of CRF inhibited food intake during the first hour following infusion in RRS, but not control rats. All other doses of CRF inhibited food intake to the same degree in both RRS and control rats. The lowered threshold of response to central CRF is consistent with the chronic hyper-responsiveness to CRF and mild stress in RRS rats during the post-restraint period. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Many species that inhabit anthropogenically altered landscapes also opportunistically use human food refuse. Gulls readily exploit anthropogenic food sources (e.g. rubbish dumps and other places of human refuse) and often ‘steal’ food from people eating out of doors. Their behaviour suggests that gulls perceive little risk around people and so we examined whether opportunity costs, that is access to anthropogenic food sources, influence risk monitoring and escape responses in Silver Gulls (Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae) around outdoor restaurants (‘food’ sites), where the gulls would scavenge food from people. We recorded alert distance (AD) and flight initiation distance (FID) and compared them with nearby sites where the same cohort of gulls was not interacting with people (‘no-food’ sites). We used two approach speeds (with the prediction that gulls would take greater efforts to avoid a potential predation threat when approached at speed). Gulls foraging at food sites had lower AD and FID than those approached at no-food sites. They were not simply ignoring the person, as they demonstrated longer AD when approached at speed but no difference in FID and therefore appeared to be responding to a small geographic scale ‘behavioural footprint’ of anthropogenic influences. Our study also challenges universality of the assumption that starting distance is necessarily correlated with FID, especially in sites where there are many people that animals are constantly monitoring – to determine the risk they represent as well as the likelihood of potential food opportunities. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Selection acting on males can reduce mutation load of sexual relative to asexual populations, thus mitigating the twofold cost of sex, provided that it seeks and destroys the same mutations as selection acting on females, but with higher efficiency. This could happen due to sexual selection—a potent evolutionary force that in most systems predominantly affects males. We used replicate populations of red flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum) to study sex-specific selection against deleterious mutations introduced with ionizing radiation. We found no evidence for selection being stronger in males than in females; in fact, we observed a nonsignificant trend in the opposite direction. This suggests that selection on males does not reduce mutation load below the level expected under the (hypothetical) scenario of asexual reproduction. Additionally, we employed a novel approach, based on a simple model, to quantify the relative contributions of sexual and offspring viability selection to the overall selection observed in males. We found them to be similar in magnitude; however, only the offspring viability component was statistically significant. In summary, we found no support for the hypothesis that selection on males in general, and sexual selection in particular, contributes to the evolutionary maintenance of sex. © 2016 The Author(s).

abstract={In most countries producing milk, indus-try-or other stakeholder-driven initiatives are in place to improve welfare and overall dairy farming sustainability. Those initiatives typically include a system of verification of reaching targets and progress over time. Reliable indicators are a fundamental requirement to provide public assurance and allow improvement on farms. Assessing dairy cattle welfare through outcome measures of welfare is done today through visual evaluations, including those of lameness, injuries, hygiene, and body condition. Numerical scoring charts for visual evaluation have been validated, and training programs have been developed to achieve high repeatability of assessors. Sampling strategies have been validated to determine how many animals and how many days are required to obtain reliable estimates of prevalence. However, visual evaluations require long periods of data collection, and multiple visits on farm, along with repeated checks of assessors to ensure repeatability over time, are, in turn, very costly to implement. An attractive alternative is relying on automated measures as activity monitors are becoming common on commercial farms; among those, lying time retains the most attention. The use of herd lying time in both free-stall and tie-stall situations has been validated. Current research is looking at relationships between lying time and other outcome measures of welfare, as well as lying time and risk factors for welfare in the environment (e.g., poor stall configuration or hoof trimming routine). We are not quite yet ready to rely solely on lying time to assess welfare; however, activity monitoring could certainly contribute to early detection of health and welfare issues (e.g., frequency of visits to the robotic milking system). Another interesting avenue is the development of early outcome measures of welfare and, possibly, remote indicators, for example, performance data collected routinely in Dairy Herd Improvement agencies’ databases. The rationale is that a herd with good health and high longevity should be at lower risk of poor welfare. Research is needed to identify predictors and their conditions of use, allowing us to discriminate good vs. poor welfare status, at both the individual and herd levels. Finally, milk samples are already collected routinely to check quality and safety. It would be convenient to be able to predict cow welfare status directly with the milk using biomarkers, but again, we are not there yet. © 2017 American Society of Animal Science.

abstract={Sharks play a key role in the structure of marine food webs, but are facing major threats due to overfishing and habitat degradation. Although sharks are also assumed to be at relatively high risk from climate change due to a low intrinsic rate of population growth and slow rates of evolution, ocean acidification (OA) has not, until recently, been considered a direct threat. Newstudies have been evaluating the potential effects of end-of-century elevated CO2 levels on sharks and their relatives' early development, physiology and behaviour. Here, we review those findings and use a meta-Analysis approach to quantify the overall direction and magnitude of biological responses to OA in the species of sharks that have been investigated to date. While embryo survival and development time are mostly unaffected by elevated CO2, there are clear effects on body condition, growth, aerobic potential and behaviour (e.g. lateralization, hunting and prey detection). Furthermore, studies to date suggest that the effects of OA could be as substantial as those due to warming in some species. A major limitation is that all past studies have involved relatively sedentary, benthic sharks that are capable of buccal ventilation-no studies have investigated pelagic sharks that depend on ram ventilation. Future research should focus on species with different life strategies (e.g. pelagic, ram ventilators), climate zones (e.g. polar regions), habitats (e.g. open ocean), and distinct phases of ontogeny in order to fully predict how OA and climate change will impact higher-order predators and therefore marine ecosystem dynamics. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={In social insects, the efficiency of exploitation of resources and colony defence are mediated by chemical communication. In colonies dependent on nutritionally limited resources, corpses represent both a food resource and a risk of pathogens. Because this risk vs. reward changes with time after death, behavioural plasticity in the response to corpses would be advantageous. How social insects regulate this trade-off remains unknown. We conducted quantitative behavioural bioassay and chemical analysis to study corpse management in the eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes. We hypothesized that R. flavipes responds differently towards corpses with prolonged post-mortem time, and this behavioural plasticity is mediated by the dynamic change in death cues. We show that R. flavipes uses a post-mortem signalling system that depends on an early death cue that stimulates corpse retrieval and cannibalism, and late death cues that stimulate recruitment and burial. A blend of 3-octanone and 3-octanol is released immediately after death, with the alcohol (possibly in conjunction with the ketone) playing a clear role as a death cue. This cue enables the colony to recycle nutrients before decomposition occurs and before risk of pathogens increases. The accumulation of late death cues, decomposition products shared by diverse arthropods, elicits a behavioural switch from cannibalism to burial. The ability to detect and respond to the dead is vital to group-living animals. Our study reveals a behavioural shift in corpse management triggered by the interplay of an early death cue and late death cues, which balances risks and rewards associated with corpses. The post-mortem chemical communication highlights the adaptation of a social insect to its ecological niche. © 2016 The Authors. Functional Ecology © 2016 British Ecological Society},

abstract={Understanding biological mechanisms that shape vulnerability to emotional dysfunction is critical for elucidating the neurobiology of psychiatric illnesses like anxiety and depression. To elucidate molecular and epigenetic alterations in the brain that contribute to individual differences in emotionality, our laboratory utilized a rodent model of temperamental differences. Rats bred for low response to novelty (Low Responders, LRs) are inhibited in novel situations and display high anxiety, helplessness, and diminished sociability compared to High Novelty Responder (HR) rats. Our current transcriptome profiling experiment identified widespread gene expression differences in the amygdala of adult HR/LR rats; we hypothesize that HR/LR gene expression and downstream behavioral differences stem from distinct epigenetic (specifically DNA methylation) patterning in the HR/LR brain. Although we found similar levels of DNA methyltransferase proteins in the adult HR/LR amygdala, next-generation sequencing analysis of the methylome revealed 793 differentially methylated genomic sites between the groups. Most of the differentially methylated sites were hypermethylated in HR versus LR, so we next tested the hypothesis that enhancing DNA methylation in LRs would improve their anxiety/depression-like phenotype. We found that increasing DNA methylation in LRs (via increased dietary methyl donor content) improved their anxiety-like behavior and decreased their typically high levels of Forced Swim Test (FST) immobility; however, dietary methyl donor depletion exacerbated LRs’ high FST immobility. These data are generally consistent with findings in depressed patients showing that treatment with DNA methylation-promoting agents improves depressive symptoms, and highlight epigenetic mechanisms that may contribute to individual differences in risk for emotional dysfunction. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The ability to learn is ubiquitous in animals but highly variable within and between species, populations and individuals. Diet-related circumstances, such as diet quantity and quality can influence both long-term constitutive (genetic; by selection) and short-term operational (non-genetic; by the immediate circumstances) learning performance. Here, we scrutinized the causes of loss of learning ability, following multi-generational feeding on pollen, in a line of the predatory mite Amblyseius swirskii, which was previously well able to learn prey during early life, enhancing foraging later in life. We investigated whether, and, if so, how quickly, a transgenerational diet switch to live prey restores the early learning ability of foraging predatory mites. The first experiment shows that the early learning ability was restored after switching the diet of the pollen-fed predator line to live spider mites for two generations before conducting the behavioral assay. The second experiment reveals that offspring regained their learning ability if the diet of their mothers was switched from pollen to spider mites for 3 or 10 days before offspring production. Both experiments in concert suggest transgenerational, pollen-induced operational loss of learning ability in the predatory mite A. swirskii. Maternally-transmitted nutrient deficiency and/or maternally-induced epigenetic changes are the most plausible explanations for the pollen diet-induced loss of learning ability. Our study represents a key example for maternal diet-induced variation in learning ability. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={Objective: A meeting of multidisciplinary biobehavioral scientists and National Institutes of Health (NIH) program staff was convened by the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives, Office of the Director, NIH to examine mechanisms associated with humans' ability to self-regulate appetite and appetitive behavior. Methods: Based upon prior discussions of the NIH Obesity Research Task Force Behavioral Phenotyping Work Group, the premise was adopted that, in modern society, multiple factors on multiple levels interact to create circumstances wherein self-control of appetite is difficult, leading to overconsumption of unhealthy foods versus healthy eating patterns, contributing to our current levels of obesity. Through presentations and group discussions, the panel examined how foundational processes/mechanisms directly and indirectly affect appetitive behavior and how these processes can be manipulated to affect food intake and thereby weight. The meeting identified evidence-based mechanisms with the potential to impact self-regulation of appetite and appetitive states (hunger, satiety, food wanting, restraint, reward) and associated behaviors such as overconsumption, eating in the absence of hunger, food seeking, and decision-making that could inform novel weight intervention strategies in free-living, nonlaboratory settings. Conclusion: The three summary papers contained in this issue represent the synthesis of the material presented at the meeting and the panel's recommendations on how existing evidence regarding mechanisms and pathways to appetitive behavior can be used to inform future research and novel prevention and intervention strategies to impact prevalence of obesity.

abstract={The present work studies whether chronic prenatal stress (PS) influences the long-term sex-dependent neuropsychological status of offspring and the effects of an early dietary intervention in the dam. In addition, dams were fed with either a high-fat sugar diet (HFSD) or methyl donor supplemented diet (MDSD). PS procedure did not affect body weight of the offspring. MDSD induced decreases in body weight both in male and female offspring (1 month) that were still present in aged rats. HFSD induced an increase in body weight both in male and female offspring that did not persist in aged rats. In the Porsolt forced swimming test, only young males showed increases in immobility time that were reversed by MDSD. In old female rats (20 months), PS-induced cognitive impairment in both the novel object recognition test (NORT) and in the Morris water maze that was reversed by MDSD, whereas in old males, cognitive impairments and reversion by MDSD was evident only in the Morris water maze. HFSD induced cognitive impairment in both control and PS old rats, but there was no additive effect of PS and HFSD. It is proposed here that the diversity of symptoms following PS could arise from programming effects in early brain development and that these effects could be modified by dietary intake of the dam. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Seagrass, an important subtidal marine ecosystem, is being lost at a rate of 110 km2 year−1, leading to fragmented seagrass seascapes. Habitat fragmentation is predicted to affect trophic levels differently, with higher trophic levels being more sensitive, stressing the importance of a multi-trophic perspective. Utilizing the trophic relationship between the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) and hard clam (Mercenaria mercenaria), where adult blue crabs prey on juvenile blue crabs, and juvenile blue crabs prey on small hard clams, we examined whether predation rates, abundance, and behavior of predators and prey differed between continuous and fragmented seagrass in a multi-trophic context at two sites in Barnegat Bay, NJ. We tested the hypothesis that fragmented habitats would differentially affect trophic levels within a tri-trophic system, and our results supported this hypothesis. Densities of adult blue crabs were higher in fragmented than continuous habitats. Densities of juvenile blue crabs, the primary predator of hard clams, were lower in fragmented habitats than continuous, potentially due to increased predation by adult blue crabs. Clams experienced lower predation and burrowed to a shallower depth in fragmented habitats than in continuous habitat, likely due in part to the low densities of juvenile blue crabs, their primary predator. Our results suggest that while trophic levels are differentially affected, the impact of habitat fragmentation may be stronger on intermediate rather than top trophic levels in some marine systems. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Background: Current obesity theories suggest that the repeated intake of highly palatable high-sugar foods causes adaptions in the striatum, parietal lobe, and prefrontal and visual cortices in the brain that may serve to perpetuate consumption in a feedforward manner. However, the data for humans are cross-sectional and observational, leaving little ability to determine the temporal precedence of repeated consumption on brain response. Objective: We tested the impact of regular sugar-sweetened beverage intake on brain and behavioral responses to beverage stimuli. Design: We performed an experiment with 20 healthy-weight individuals who were randomly assigned to consume 1 of 2 sugarsweetened beverages daily for 21 d, underwent 2 functional MRI sessions, and completed behavioral and explicit hedonic assessments. Results: Consistent with preclinical experiments, daily beverage consumption resulted in decreases in dorsal striatal response during receipt of the consumed beverage (r = 20.46) and decreased ventromedial prefrontal response during logo-elicited anticipation (r = 20.44). This decrease in the prefrontal response correlated with increases in behavioral disinhibition toward the logo of the consumed beverage (r = 0.54; P = 0.02). Daily beverage consumption also increased precuneus response to both juice logos compared with a tasteless control (r = 0.45), suggesting a more generalized effect toward beverage cues. Last, the repeated consumption of 1 beverage resulted in an explicit hedonic devaluation of a similar nonconsumed beverage (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Analogous to previous reports, these initial results provide convergent data for a role of regular sugar-sweetened beverage intake in altering neurobehavioral responses to the regularly consumed beverage that may also extend to other beverage stimuli. Future research is required to provide evidence of replication in a larger sample and to establish whether the neurobehavioral adaptations observed herein are specific to high-sugar and/or nonnutritive-sweetened beverages or more generally related to the repeated consumption of any type of food. © 2017 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Predators can influence prey traits and behavior (nonconsumptive effects [NCEs]), often with cascading effects for basal resources and ecosystem function. But critiques of NCE experiments suggest that their duration and design produce results that describe the potential importance of NCEs rather than their actual importance. In light of these critiques, we re-evaluated a toadfish (predator), crab (prey), and oyster (resource) NCE-mediated trophic cascade. In a 4-month field experiment, we varied toadfish cue (NCE) and crab density ( approximating variation in predator consumptive effects, CE). Toadfish initially benefitted oyster survival by causing crabs to reduce consumption. But this NCE weakened over time (possibly due to prey hunger), so that after 2 months, crab density (CE) dictated oyster survivorship, regardless of cue. However, the NCE ultimately re-emerged on reefs with a toadfish cue, increasing oyster survivorship. At no point did the effect of toadfish cue on mud crab foraging behavior alter oyster population growth or sediment organic matter on the reef, which is a measure of benthic-pelagic coupling. Instead, both decreased with increasing crab density. Thus, within a system shown to exhibit strong NCEs in short-term experiments (days) our study supported predictions from theoretical models: (a) within the generation of individual prey, the relative influence of NCEs appears to cycle over longer time periods (months); and (b) predator CEs, not NCEs, drive longer-term resource dynamics and ecosystem function. Thus, our study implies that the impacts of removing top predators via activities such as hunting and overfishing will cascade to basal resources and ecosystem properties primarily through density-mediated interactions. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Renewal, or reinstatement, of responding to food cues after extinction may explain the inability to resist palatable foods and change maladaptive eating habits. Previously, we found sex differences in context-dependent renewal of extinguished Pavlovian conditioned responding to food cues. Context-induced renewal involves cue-food conditioning and extinction in different contexts and the renewal of conditioned behavior is induced by return to the conditioning context (ABA renewal). Male rats showed renewal of responding while females did not. In the current study we sought to identify recruitment of key neural systems underlying context-mediated renewal and sex differences. We examined Fos induction within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), hippocampal formation, thalamus and amygdala in male and female rats during the test for renewal. We found sex differences in vmPFC recruitment during renewal. Male rats in the experimental condition showed renewal of responding and had more Fos induction within the infralimbic and prelimbic vmPFC areas compared to controls that remained in the same context throughout training and testing. Females in the experimental condition did not show renewal or an increase in Fos induction. Additionally, Fos expression differed between experimental and control groups and between the sexes in the hippocampal formation, thalamus and amygdala. Within the ventral subiculum, the experimental groups of both sexes had more Fos compared to control groups. Within the dorsal CA1 and the anterior region of the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, in males, the experimental group had higher Fos induction, while both females groups had similar number of Fos-positive neurons. Within the capsular part of the central amygdalar nucleus, females in the experimental group had higher Fos induction, while males groups had similar amounts. The differential recruitment corresponded to the behavioral differences between males and females and suggests the medial prefrontal cortex-hippocampal-thalamic system is a critical site of sex differences during renewal of appetitive Pavlovian responding to food cues. These findings provide evidence for novel neural mechanisms underlying sex differences in food motivation and contextual processing in associative learning and memory. The results should also inform future molecular and translational work investigating sex differences and maladaptive eating habits. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: We assessed the impact of a family history of diabetes on type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and behavioral traits in young Korean adults. Methods: Subjects aged 25-44 years were included, and the presence of a family history of diabetes was obtained by a self-reported questionnaire (the Korea National Health and Nutrition Survey 2010). We compared the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and other metabolic parameters, including blood pressure and lipid profile. Results: Of 2059 participants, those with a family history of diabetes involving first-degree relatives (n = 489, 23.7%) had a significantly higher prevalence of impaired fasting glucose (14.3 vs. 11.7%) and type 2 diabetes (6.7 vs. 1.8%), compared to those without a family history (P < 0.001). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (21.3 vs. 12.1%, P < 0.001) and its components (except for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) were greater in subjects with a family history of diabetes. Among subjects exhibiting normal glucose tolerance (n = 1704), those with a family history of diabetes had higher fasting glucose (89.0 vs. 87.8 mg/dL, P < 0.001) and triglyceride (100.5 vs. 89.0 mg/dL, P < 0.001), and lower beta cell function by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-β; 134.2 vs. 137.5, P = 0.020). The obesity indices (body mass index, waist circumference, and triglyceride) were significantly correlated with those of both parents (P < 0.01 for all variables). Risk-reducing behavior, including regular exercise (18.2 vs. 19.7%, P = 0.469) and calorie intake (2174.8 vs. 2149.1 kcal/day, P = 0.636), did not markedly differ according to a family history of diabetes. Conclusions: Young adults with a family history of diabetes had an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, even though they currently exhibited a normal glycemic profile.

abstract={Background: Few studies have reported the systematic use of exclusive enteral nutrition in the perioperative setting. Aim: To test the hypothesis that exclusive enteral nutrition provides a safe and effective bridge to surgery and reduces post-operative complications, in adult patients with Crohn's disease requiring urgent surgery for stricturing or penetrating complications. Methods: Patients treated with exclusive enteral nutrition prior to surgery were each matched with two control patients for disease behaviour, type of surgery, age at diagnosis and disease duration. Data on disease phenotype, nutritional status, operative course and post-operative complications were obtained. Results: Twenty-five per cent [13/51] patients treated with exclusive enteral nutrition avoided surgery. Exclusive enteral nutrition had no effect on pre-operative weight, but it significantly reduced serum CRP [median at baseline 36 (interquartile range, IQR: 13–91] vs. pre-operation 8 (4–31) mg/L, P = 0.02]. The median (IQR) length of surgery was shorter in patients pre-optimised with exclusive enteral nutrition than controls [3.0 (2.5–3.5) vs. 3.5 (3.0–4.0) hours respectively, P < 0.001]. Multivariable logistic regression analysis confirmed that going straight-to-surgery compared exclusive enteral nutrition pre-optimisation was associated with a ninefold increase in the incidence of post-operative abscess and/or anastomotic leak [OR 9.1; 95% CI (1.2–71.2), P = 0.04]. Conclusions: Exclusive enteral nutrition frequently down-stages the need for surgery in patients presenting with stricturing or penetrating complications of Crohn's disease; it is associated with a reduction in systemic inflammation, operative times and the incidence of post-operative abscess or anastomotic leak. Further trials are needed to elucidate how exclusive enteral nutrition may improve operative outcomes. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Objectives Studies have established a strong genetic component in eating behavior. The TaqI A1 polymorphism (rs1800497) has previously been associated with obesity and eating behavior. Additionally, this polymorphism has been associated with diminished dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) density, higher body mass, and food reinforcement. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the DRD2 rs1800497 polymorphism and eating behavior in Chilean children. Methods This was a cross-sectional study in which we selected 258 children (44% girls, 56% boys; ages 8–14 y) with a wide variation in body mass index. Anthropometric measurements were performed by standard procedures. Eating behavior was assessed using the Eating in Absence of Hunger Questionnaire (EAHQ), Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and the Food Reinforcement Value Questionnaire. Genotype of the rs1800497 was determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Association of the TaqI A1 variant (T allele) with eating behavior was assessed using nonparametric tests. Results Compared with normal-weight children, the obese group demonstrated higher scores on the External Eating and Fatigue/Boredom subscales of the EAHQ. Higher scores were assessed in Food Responsiveness, Emotional Overeating, Enjoyment to Food and Desire to Drink subscales (P < 0.001) and lower scores of the Satiety Responsiveness and Slowness in Eating (P < 0.05). In the sex-specific analysis, the TaqI A1 allele was associated with higher scores on Satiety Responsiveness and Emotional Undereating subscales in obese girls, and higher scores of Enjoyment of Food subscale in boys. Conclusion The TaqI A1 polymorphism may be a risk factor for eating behavior traits that may predispose children to greater energy intake and obesity. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The adaptive benefits of extended phenotypic plasticity are imprecisely defined due to a paucity of experiments examining traits that are manipulable and measurable across environments. Spider webs are often used as models to explore the adaptive benefits of variations in extended phenotypes across environments. Nonetheless, our understanding of the adaptive nature of the plastic responses of spider webs is impeded when web architectures and silk physicochemical properties appear to co-vary. An opportunity to examine this co-variation is presented by modifying prey items while measuring web architectures and silk physiochemical properties. Here, we performed two experiments to assess the nature of the association between web architectures and gluey silk properties when the orb web spider Argiope keyserlingi was fed a diet that varied in either mass and energy or prey size and feeding frequency. We found web architectures and gluey silk physicochemical properties to co-vary across treatments in both experiments. Specifically, web capture area co-varied with gluey droplet morphometrics, thread stickiness and salt concentrations when prey mass and energy were manipulated, and spiral spacing co-varied with gluey silk salt concentrations when prey size and feeding frequency were manipulated. We explained our results as A. keyserlingi plastically shifting its foraging strategy as multiple prey parameters simultaneously varied. We confirmed and extended previous work by showing that spiders use a variety of prey cues to concurrently adjust web and silk traits across different feeding regimes. © 2017.

abstract={Rothbart's model of temperament, defined as individual differences in reactivity and self-regulation, has a strong heuristic value with applications in a wide variety of children's outcomes. Our objective was to test Rothbart's model applied to children's food behaviours and BMI outcome through behavioural measures. Our hypotheses, according to Rothbart's model, were as follows: (i) self-regulation in eating modulates appetite reactivity; (ii) appetite reactivity increases the risk of excess BMI, whereas self-regulation in eating limits this risk. One hundred and four children aged between 7 and 12 years completed four behavioural tasks to assess scores for two components of appetite reactivity (i.e. appetite arousal and appetite persistence) and two components of self-regulation in eating (i.e. self-regulation in eating without hunger and self-regulation in eating speed). Their heights and weights were measured in order to calculate their BMI-for-age. T-tests and regression analysis were used to verify our hypotheses. None of the scores of self-regulation in eating was directly associated with BMI but we observed a significant impact of self-regulation in eating without hunger on appetite arousal (p-value = 0.04), together with a modest but significant association between appetite persistence and BMI (p-value = 0.02). We can thus conclude that our behavioural measures could be used for the determination of the child's eating temperament. Further studies are needed to investigate how to use these measures to improve the treatment of overweight in children. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Introduction: Although mefloquine use is known to be associated with a risk of severe neuropsychiatric adverse reactions that are often preceded by prodromal symptoms, specific combinations of neurologic or psychiatric reactions associated with mefloquine use are not well described in the literature. This study sought to identify a distinct neuropsychiatric syndrome class associated with mefloquine use in reports of adverse events. Methods: Latent class modeling of US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data was performed using indicators defined by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities neurologic and psychiatric high-level group terms, in a study dataset of FAERS reports (n = 5332) of reactions to common antimalarial drugs. Results: A distinct neuropsychiatric syndrome class was identified that was strongly and significantly associated with reports of mefloquine use (odds ratio = 3.92, 95% confidence interval 2.91–5.28), defined by a very high probability of symptoms of deliria (82.7%) including confusion and disorientation, and a moderate probability of other severe psychiatric and neurologic symptoms including dementia and amnesia (18.6%) and seizures (18.1%). The syndrome class was also associated with symptoms that are considered prodromal including anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and abnormal dreams, and neurological symptoms such as dizziness, vertigo, and paresthesias. Conclusions: This study confirms in FAERS reports the existence of a severe mefloquine neuropsychiatric syndrome class associated with common symptoms that may be considered prodromal. Clinical identification of the characteristic symptoms of this syndrome class may aid in improving case finding in pharmacovigilance studies of more serious adverse reactions to the drug. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={Animal behavior is shaped through interplay among genes, the environment, and previous experience. As in mammals, satiety signals induce quiescence in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we report that the C. Elegans transcription factor ETS-5, an ortholog of mammalian FEV/Pet1, controls satiety-induced quiescence. Nutritional status has a major influence on C. Elegans behavior. When foraging, food availability controls behavioral state switching between active (roaming) and sedentary (dwelling) states; however, when provided with high-quality food, C. Elegans become sated and enter quiescence. We show that ETS-5 acts to promote roaming and inhibit quiescence by setting the internal "satiety quotient"through fat regulation. Acting from the ASG and BAG sensory neurons, we show that ETS-5 functions in a complex network with serotonergic and neuropeptide signaling pathways to control food-regulated behavioral state switching. Taken together, our results identify a neuronal mechanism for controlling intestinal fat stores and organismal behavioral states in C. Elegans, and establish a paradigm for the elucidation of obesity-relevant mechanisms.},

abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by deficits in sociability and communication, and increased repetitive and/or restrictive behaviors. While the etio-pathogenesis of ASD is unknown, clinical manifestations are diverse and many possible genetic and environmental factors have been implicated. As such, it has been a great challenge to identify key neurobiological mechanisms and to develop effective treatments. Current therapies focus on co-morbid conditions (such as epileptic seizures and sleep disturbances) and there is no cure for the core symptoms. Recent studies have increasingly implicated mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD. The fact that mitochondria are an integral part of diverse cellular functions and are susceptible to many insults could explain howa wide range of factors can contribute to a consistent behavioral phenotype in ASD. Meanwhile, the high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD), used for nearly a century to treat medically intractable epilepsy, has been shown to enhance mitochondrial function through a multiplicity of mechanisms and affect additional molecular targets that may address symptoms and comorbidities of ASD. Here, we reviewthe evidence for the use of metabolism-based therapies such as the KD in the treatment of ASD as well as emerging co-morbid models of epilepsy and autism. Future research directions aimed at validating such therapeutic approaches and identifying additional and novel mechanistic targets are also discussed. © 2017 Cheng, Rho and Masino.},

abstract={Since 5-HT6 receptors play role in controlling feeding and satiety and dopamine is essential for normal feeding behavior, we evaluated the ability of EMD 386088-5-HT6 receptor partial agonist and dopamine transporter inhibitor-to reduce body weight in obese rats, as well as its anorectic properties (calorie intake reduction) in rat model of excessive eating and the influence on metabolism (plasma glucose and glycerol levels). We also determined the effect of the studied compound on pica behavior in rats and its influence on blood pressure after single administration. EMD 386088 reduced body weight in obese rats fed high-fat diet and decreased calorie intake in both models applied (rat model of obesity and of excessive eating). In both models EMD 386088 regulated plasma glucose and increased plasma glycerol levels. The latter proves that the compound reduced body fat. We think that it might have increased lipolysis, but this requires further studies. The reduction in glucose levels is the first symptom of metabolic disorders compensation. EMD 386088 did not cause pica behavior in rats but increased blood pressure after single administration. We think that partial 5-HT6 agonists might have potential in the treatment of obesity. Thus, EMD 386088 requires extended studies. © 2017 Kotanska, Sniecikowska, Jastrzebska-Wiesek, Kołaczkowski and Pytka.},

abstract={Sit-and-wait ambushing and active hunting are two strategies used by predators to capture prey. In snakes, hunting strategy is conserved phylogenetically; most species employ only one strategy. Active hunters encounter and capture more prey but invest more energy in hunting and have higher risks of being predated. This trade-off is important to small predators. The small Cerastes vipera employs both modes of hunting, which is unlike most viperids which use only sit-and wait ambushing. This species hibernates in October and emerges in April. Energy intake should be high prior to hibernation to overcome the non-feeding hibernation period and for reproduction on their emergence. We predicted that more individuals would hunt actively towards hibernation and an abiotic factor would trigger this response. Furthermore, since more energy is required for active hunting, we predicted that snakes in good body condition would use active hunting to a greater extent than snakes in poor body condition. To test our predictions, we tracked free-living snakes year round and determined their hunting strategy, estimated their body condition index (BCI), and calculated circannual parameters of day length as environmental cues known to affect animal behaviour. Two novel findings emerged in this study, namely, hunting strategy was affected significantly by 1) the circannual change in day length and 2) by BCI. The proportion of active hunters increased from 5% in April to over 30% in October and BCI of active foragers was higher than that of sit-and-wait foragers and, therefore, our predictions were supported. The entrainment between the proportion of active hunting and the abiotic factor is indicative of an adaptive function for choosing a hunting strategy. A trend was evident among life stages. When all life stages were present (September–October), the proportion of active foragers increased with age: 0.0% among neonates, 18.2% among juveniles and 31.4% among adults. We concluded that vulnerable small neonates used sit-and-wait ambush not only as a hunting strategy but also as a hiding technique. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Wildfires can completely obliterate above-ground vegetation, yet some small terrestrial mammals survive during and after fires. As knowledge about the physiological and behavioural adaptations that are crucial for post-wildfire survival is scant, we investigated the thermal biology of a small insectivorous marsupial (Antechinus flavipes) after a severe forest fire. Some populations of antechinus survived the fire in situ probably by hiding deep in rocky crevices, the only fire-proof sites near where they were trapped. We hypothesised that survival in the post-fire landscape was achieved by decreasing daytime activity and using torpor frequently to save energy. Indeed, daytime activity was less common and torpor expression was substantially higher (≥2-fold) at the post-fire site than observed in an unburnt control site and also in comparison to a laboratory study, both when food was provided ad libitum and withheld. Basking in the post-fire site was also recorded, which was likely used to further reduce energy expenditure. Our data suggest that torpor and basking are used by this terrestrial mammal to reduce energy and foraging requirements, which is important in a landscape where food and shelter are limited and predation pressure typically is increased. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={How energetic cost of locomotion affects foraging decisions, and its metabolic consequences are poorly understood. In several groups of animals, including hermit crabs, exploratory walking enhances the efficiency of foraging by increasing the probability of finding more and better food items; however, the net gain of energy will only be enhanced if the costs of walking are lower than the benefits of enhanced food acquisition. In hermit crabs, the cost of walking increases with the mass of the shell type occupied. Thus, we expected that hermit crabs should adjust their foraging strategy to the cost of movement in different shells. We assessed the foraging, the quantity and quality of food intake, and the energetic cost of maintenance of hermit crabs paying different costs of foraging in the wild. The exploratory walking negatively correlated with shell mass, showing that hermit crabs use different foraging strategies in response to the expenditure required to move. Hermit crabs deal with high energetic costs of foraging in heavy shells by reduces their exploratory walking and overall metabolic rate, as a strategy to maximize the net energy intake. This study integrates behavioral and metabolic compensations as a response to foraging at different costs in natural conditions. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Background Youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a disease that is newly emerging and behavioral strategies for its prevention are limited. Interventions that target the lifestyle behaviors of adolescents, to improve poor dietary quality and reduce excessive sedentariness, promise to reduce the risk of developing T2D. Health coaching is effective for promoting healthy behaviors in patients who have chronic disease, but few experimental studies are in adolescents. This randomized controlled trial, in adolescents with prediabetes, will determine the effectiveness of a health coaching intervention to facilitate adoption of healthy diet and activity behaviors that delay or prevent development of T2D. Methods/design The Dietary Intervention for Glucose Tolerance In Teens (DIG IT) trial will involve an evaluation of a health coaching intervention in adolescents with prediabetes. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive 6 months of health coaching or a single dietary consultation that is standard-of-care. The primary outcome will be 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test concentration. Secondary outcomes will include measures of glycemia and insulin action as well as dietary, physical activity and sedentary behaviors measured using an electronic food record, and by inclinometer. Data will be collected before and after the intervention (at 6 months) and at 12 months (to assess sustainability). Discussion This trial will determine whether a health coaching intervention, a personalized and low-cost approach to modify dietary and activity behaviors, is effective and sustainable for prevention of youth-onset T2D, relative to standard-of-care. Health coaching has the potential to be widely implemented in clinical or community settings. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={We tested the two main evolutionary hypotheses for an association between immunity and personality. The risk-of-parasitism hypothesis predicts that more proactive (bold, exploratory, risk-taking) individuals have more vigorous immune defenses because of increased risk of parasite exposure. In contrast, the pace-of-life hypothesis argues that proactive behavioral styles are associated with shorter lifespans and reduced investment in immune function. Mechanistically, associations between immunity and personality can arise because personality differences are often associated with differences in condition and stress responsiveness, both of which are intricately linked with immunity. Here we investigate the association between personality (measured as proactive exploration of a novel environment) and three indices of innate immune function (the non-specific first line of defense against parasites) in wild superb fairy-wrens Malurus cyaneus. We also quantified body condition, hemoparasites (none detected), chronic stress (heterophil:lymphocyte ratio) and circulating corticosterone levels at the end of the behavioral test (CORT, in a subset of birds). We found that fast explorers had lower titers of natural antibodies. This result is consistent with the pace-of-life hypothesis, and with the previously documented higher mortality of fast explorers in this species. There was no interactive effect of exploration score and duration in captivity on immune indices. This suggests that personality-related differences in stress responsiveness did not underlie differences in immunity, even though behavioral style did modulate the effect of captivity on CORT. Taken together these results suggest reduced constitutive investment in innate immune function in more proactive individuals. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The rodent tasks with food rewards are useful methods to evaluate memory functions, including hole-board and corridor tests. The AMBITUS system (a square corridor with several food rewards), as a combination of these tests, was developed for the investigation of a variety of parameters associated with exploration and cognitive performance in rodents. Experiments were performed to characterize these behaviors in healthy rats and a new “schizophrenia-like” rat substrain with impaired learning ability to reveal the reliability in tests related to these functions. A square corridor was constructed with equally spaced sites along each wall (4 inside and 4 outside) resulting in 16 side-boxes for food rewards. Photocells at each box recorded the visits into the side-boxes (as exploratory activity), while the eating parameters were obtained from video records. The animals were exposed to two types of tasks repeatedly in two series: all (16) or only the inside (8) boxes (Task 1 or Task 2, respectively) were baited. Most of the rats acquired Task 1, and their performance improved by repetition, but the new substrain showed decreased exploration and learning capacity. The introduction of Task 2 caused prompt preference of the baited inner side-boxes, and gradually improved working and reference memory during the trials. The manual and automated scoring of the visits into the side-boxes showed significant (r = 0.97) correlation. The results proved that healthy animals could perform the simple tasks in the square corridor after a few repetitions. The semi-automated AMBITUS system might be appropriate to detect cognitive flexibility after different manipulations, and it provides immediate, online assessment of exploratory behavior of a large number of animals within a short period of time, and it reduces the possibility of experimenter bias. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The molecular and functional conservation of oxytocin-related neuropeptides in behavior is striking. In animals separated by at least 600 million years of evolution, from roundworms to humans, oxytocin homologs play critical roles in the modulation of reproductive behavior and other biological functions. Here, we review the roles of oxytocin in invertebrate behavior from an evolutionary perspective. We begin by tracing the evolution of oxytocin through the invertebrate animal lineages, and then describe common themes in invertebrate behaviors that are mediated by oxytocin-related peptides, including reproductive behavior, learning and memory, food arousal, and predator/prey relationships. Finally, we discuss interesting future directions that have recently become experimentally tractable. Studying oxytocin in invertebrates offers precise insights into the activity of neuropeptides on well-defined neural circuits; the principles that emerge may also be represented in the more complex vertebrate brain. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract={Agonist-replacement therapies have been successfully used for treatment of opiate and nicotine addiction, but not for cocaine addiction. One of the major obstacles is the cocaine-like addictive potential of the agonists themselves. We report here an atypical dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) inhibitor, CTDP-32476, that may have translational potential for treating cocaine addiction. In vitro ligand-binding assays suggest that CTDP-32476 is a potent and selective DAT inhibitor and a competitive inhibitor of cocaine binding to the DAT. Systemic administration of CTDP-32476 alone produced a slow-onset, long-lasting increase in extracellular nucleus accumbens DA, locomotion, and brain-stimulation reward. Drug-naive rats did not self-Administer CTDP-32476. In a substitution test, cocaine self-Administration rats displayed a progressive reduction in CTDP-32476 self-Administration with an extinction pattern of drug-Taking behavior, suggesting significantly lower addictive potential than cocaine. Pretreatment with CTDP-32476 inhibited cocaine self-Administration, cocaine-Associated cue-induced relapse to drug seeking, and cocaine-enhanced extracellular DA in the nucleus accumbens. These findings suggest that CTDP-32476 is a unique DAT inhibitor that not only could satisfy 'drug hunger' through its slow-onset long-lasting DAT inhibitor action, but also render subsequent administration of cocaine ineffectual-thus constituting a novel and unique compound with translational potential as an agonist therapy for treatment of cocaine addiction. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Human presence in natural environments is often a source of stress that is perceived by large ungulates as an increased risk of predation. Alternatively, disturbance induced by hikers creates a relatively predator-free space that may serve as a refuge. We measured the behavioral responses of female caribou to disturbance associated with the presence of hikers during summer in the Gaspésie National Park. We used those data to determine whether caribou responded negatively to human activity (i.e., the predation risk hypothesis) or whether human activity resulted in a decrease in the magnitude of perceived risk (i.e., the refuge hypothesis). Female caribou with a calf spent nearly half of their time feeding, regardless of the presence of a trail or the number of hikers. They also decreased their vigilance near trails when the number of hikers increased. Conversely, lone females fed less frequently and almost doubled the time invested in vigilance under the same circumstances. However, both groups of females moved away from trails during the day, especially in the presence of hikers. We demonstrated that risk avoidance was specific to the maternal state of the individual. Lactating females accommodated the presence of hikers to increase time spent foraging and nutritional intake, providing support for the refuge hypothesis. Alternatively, lone females with lower energetic requirements and no maternal investment in a vulnerable calf appeared less tolerant to risk, consistent with the predation risk hypothesis. Synthesis and applications: Hikers influenced the vigilance–feeding trade-off in caribou, underlining the importance of appropriate management of linear structures and human activities, especially across the critical habitat of endangered species. Even if some individuals seemed to benefit from human presence, this behavioral adaptation was not sufficient to reduce annual calf mortality associated with predation. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Variation in diet can influence the timing of major life-history events and can drive population diversification and ultimately speciation. Proximate responses of life histories to diet have been well studied. However, there are scant experimental data on how organisms adapt to divergent diets over the longer term. We focused on this omission by testing the responses of a global pest, the Mediterranean fruitfly, to divergent selection on larval diets of different nutritional profiles. Tests conducted before and after 30 generations of nutritional selection revealed a complex interplay between the effects of novel larval dietary conditions on both plastic and evolved responses. There were proximate-only responses to the larval diet in adult male courtship and the frequency of copulation. Males on higher calorie larval diets consistently engaged in more bouts of energetic courtship. In contrast, following selection, larval development time, and egg to adult survival showed evidence of evolved divergence between diet regimes. Adult body size showed evidence for adaptation, with flies being significantly heavier when reared on their “own” diet. The results show the multifaceted responses of individuals to dietary selection and are important in understanding the extreme generalism exhibited by the medfly. © 2016 The Author(s).

abstract={Green water is a technique commonly used in aquaculture, that consists of adding live algae in the water culture and its benefits have been shown for several species. Several hypotheses exist to explain the benefits of green water: increase in nutritional value; action as a probiotic; increase in contrast to reveal preys for larvae; or increase in predator behaviour of larvae. Green water produced with a mix of strains Isochrysis galbana and Chaetoceros muelleri (50:50, cells:cells) applied in four different ways was tested. The survival and the growth of American lobster (Homarus americanus) between stage I and stage IV post-larvae were not affected by the addition of live algae. The lipid classes were not affected by the addition of algae and limited variation was observed in the fatty acids and bacterial profiles. Furthermore, the green water techniques had a limited effect on the behaviour of post-larvae stage IV lobster at releasing. Behaviour was mostly affected by the age of post-larvae. The bacteria Lewinella sp., Leucothrix sp. and Thiothrix sp. appeared to represent a common and core component of Stage IV lobster post-larvae microflora. The results show that the algae do not increase either nutritional value or feed intake of the lobster larvae. Probiotic effect may be more important when larvae are raised in a close system where potential bacterial pathogens could have more chances to colonize the culture. Also, the dark green colour of the larval tank used in this study may have mimicked the effect of green water in the control group. Biochemical results suggest that dietary supplementation with phospholipids and DHA is needed in a lobster hatchery using frozen Artemia and our open formula Dry mix. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={The understanding of consistent individual differences in behavior, often termed "personality," for adapting and coping with threats and novel environmental conditions has advanced considerably during the last decade. However, advancements are almost exclusively associated with higher-order animals, whereas studies focusing on smaller aquatic organisms are still rare. Here, we show individual differences in the swimming behavior of Daphnia magna, a clonal freshwater invertebrate, before, during, and after being exposed to a lethal threat, ultraviolet radiation (UVR). We show consistency in swimming velocity among both mothers and daughters of D. magna in a neutral environment, whereas this pattern breaks down when exposed to UVR. Our study also, for the first time, illustrates how the ontogenetic development in swimming and refuge-seeking behavior of young individuals eventually approaches that of adults. Overall, we show that aquatic invertebrates are far from being identical robots, but instead they show considerable individual differences in behavior that can be attributed to both ontogenetic development and individual consistency. Our study also demonstrates, for the first time, that behavioral consistency and repeatability, that is, something resembling "personality," is context and state dependent in this zooplankter taxa. © 2017 Heuschele et al.},

abstract={In many species, environmental complexity is known to affect cognitive development, yet it is common to house dairy calves individually in restrictive environments. The hypothesis of this study was that providing calves with simple nutritional enrichments would improve their success in a cognitive task and reduce reactivity to novel stimuli. Individually-housed Holstein heifer calves were assigned at birth to conventional management (C; n = 10), with access to milk (6 L/d) via bucket and grain concentrate, or enriched feeding (E; n = 10), with access to milk via teat to allow natural suckling, and chopped hay alongside concentrate. At week 5 of age, calves were tested in a T-maze with a reward (0.2 L milk; provided according to familiar delivery method) placed in one arm to assess initial spatial learning, reversal learning where the reward location was changed to the opposite arm, and response to an intramaze change (novel object, a colored ball, was placed in the maze between the start position and reward). Calves received 5 sessions/d for 5 days or until criteria (moving directly to correct side in 3 consecutive sessions) was reached for initial and reversal learning. Time to complete the test, movement in maze, kicks, and non-nutritive licking/sniffing were recorded from video. In the initial learning stage, the number of sessions required to meet the learning criteria was similar between calves (P = 0.12). However, E calves took longer to complete the task in early sessions (treatment by session interaction; P = 0.02), due to increased time spent on the correct side of maze before obtaining the reward (26.72 vs. 7.48 s; SE = 3.4; P = 0.005). In the reversal learning stage, there was no overall difference in the number of sessions to meet the learning criteria (P = 0.20), but E calves completed the task faster (19.84 vs 27.22 s; SE = 2.10; P = 0.03), and C calves spent 1.5 x longer on the incorrect side of the maze than E calves (P = 0.04), suggesting that C calves struggled to relearn the task. In both initial and reversal learning, C calves kicked more frequently (P < 0.04). During the novel object session, E calves found the reward faster (6.11 vs 20.6 s; SE = 4.06; P = 0.01), whereas C calves spent longer in the middle of the maze where the novel object was located (2.08 vs 13.4s; SE = 5.33; P = 0.04). These results suggest that providing simple feeding enrichments during the milk feeding stage may alter calf cognition and influence responses to environmental changes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: As a group, bottle-fed infants are at higher risk for rapid weight gain compared with breast-fed infants. However, little is known about individual differences in feeding behaviors of bottle-feeding infants, as well as maternal and infant characteristics associated with bottle-feeding outcomes. Methods: We conducted a 2-day, within-subject study of 21 formula-feeding dyads; the within-subject factor was feeding condition: mother-led (ML; mothers were given the instruction to feed their infants as they typically would) vs. infant-led (IL; the experimenter ensured feeding began when infants signaled hunger and ended when they rejected the bottle on three consecutive occasions). Intake was determined by bottle weight; feedings were video-recorded and later analyzed to determine feeding duration and types of satiation behaviors displayed. Percent difference scores were calculated for each outcome as [((ML - IL)/IL) × 100] to standardize differences among dyads. Mothers completed questionnaires of feeding styles and infant temperament. Results: On average, infants consumed ∼42% more formula during the ML- than IL-condition (p = 0.03). However, notable variation existed in difference scores for intake (range = -52.8% to 268.9%; higher scores reflect greater intake during ML than IL). Stepwise regression illustrated that greater intakes during the ML-condition were predicted by the combination of: (1) higher infant age; (2) lower levels of infant rhythmicity and adaptability; (3) higher levels of infant positive mood; and (4) lower levels of maternal restrictive and responsive feeding styles. Conclusions: This objective, experimental approach illustrated that variation in bottle-feeding outcomes is associated with characteristics of both members of the dyad. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={Human activity alters natural habitats for many species. Understanding variation in animals’ behavioural responses to these changing environments is critical.We showhowsignal detection theory can be used within awider framework of state-dependent modelling to predict behavioural responses to a major environmental change: novel, exotic species. We allow thresholds for action to be a function of reserves, and demonstrate how optimal thresholds can be calculated.We term this framework ‘state-dependent detection theory’ (SDDT). We focus on behavioural and fitness outcomes when animals continue to use formerly adaptive thresholds following environmental change. In a simple example, we show that exposure to novel animals which appear dangerous—but are actually safe— (e.g. ecotourists) can have catastrophic consequences for ‘prey’ (organisms that respond as if the new organisms are predators), significantly increasing mortality even when the novel species is not predatory. SDDT also reveals that the effect on reproduction can be greater than the effect on lifespan. We investigate factors that influence the effect of novel organisms, and address the potential for behavioural adjustments (via evolution or learning) to recover otherwise reduced fitness. Although effects of environmental change are often difficult to predict, we suggest that SDDT provides a useful route ahead. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Background: Epidemiological studies suggest that hyponutrition during the fetal period increases the risk of mental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism-spectrum disorder, which has been experimentally supported using animal models. However, previous experimental hyponutrition or protein-restricted (PR) diets affected stages other than the fetal stage, such as formation of the egg before insemination, milk composition during lactation, and maternal nursing behavior. Results: We conducted in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer in mice and allowed PR diet and folic acid-supplemented PR diet to affect only fetal environments. Comprehensive phenotyping of PR and control-diet progenies showed moderate differences in fear/anxiety-like, novelty-seeking, and prosocial behaviors, irrespective of folic-acid supplementation. Changes were also detected in gene expression and genomic methylation in the brain. Conclusions: These results suggest that epigenetic factors in the embryo/fetus influence behavioral and epigenetic phenotypes of progenies. Significant epigenetic alterations in the brains of the progenies induced by the maternal-protein restriction were observed in the present study. To our knowledge, this is first study to evaluate the effect of maternal hyponutrition on behavioral phenotypes using reproductive technology. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={Neurotrimin (Ntm) belongs to the IgLON family of cell adhesion molecules with Lsamp, Obcam and kilon that regulate the outgrowth of neurites mostly by forming heterodimers. IgLONs have been associated with psychiatric disorders, intelligence, body weight, heart disease and tumours. This study provides an initial behavioural and pharmacological characterization of the phenotype of Ntm-deficient mice. We expected to see at least some overlap with the phenotype of Lsamp-deficient mice as Ntm and Lsamp are the main interaction partners in the IgLON family and are colocalized in some brain regions. However, Ntm-deficient mice displayed none of the deviations in behaviour that we have previously shown in Lsamp-deficient mice, but differently from Lsamp-deficient mice, had a deficit in emotional learning in the active avoidance task. The only overlap was decreased sensitivity to the locomotor stimulating effect of amphetamine in both knockout models. Thus, despite being interaction partners, on the behavioural level Lsamp seems to play a much more central role than Ntm and the roles of these two proteins seem to be complementary rather than overlapping. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Older adults living in long term care (LTC) homes are nutritionally vulnerable, often consuming insufficient energy, macro- and micronutrients to sustain their health and function. Multiple factors are proposed to influence food intake, yet our understanding of these diverse factors and their interactions are limited. The purpose of this paper is to fully describe the protocol used to examine determinants of food and fluid intake among older adults participating in the Making the Most of Mealtimes (M3) study. Methods: A conceptual framework that considers multi-level influences on mealtime experience, meal quality and meal access was used to design this multi-site cross-sectional study. Data were collected from 639 participants residing in 32 LTC homes in four Canadian provinces by trained researchers. Food intake was assessed with three-days of weighed food intake (main plate items), as well as estimations of side dishes, beverages and snacks and compared to the Dietary Reference Intake. Resident-level measures included: nutritional status, nutritional risk; disease conditions, medication, and diet prescriptions; oral health exam, signs of swallowing difficulty and olfactory ability; observed eating behaviours, type and number of staff assisting with eating; and food and foodservice satisfaction. Function, cognition, depression and pain were assessed using interRAI LTCF with selected items completed by researchers with care staff. Care staff completed a standardized person-directed care questionnaire. Researchers assessed dining rooms for physical and psychosocial aspects that could influence food intake. Management from each site completed a questionnaire that described the home, menu development, food production, out-sourcing of food, staffing levels, and staff training. Hierarchical regression models, accounting for clustering within province, home and dining room will be used to determine factors independently associated with energy and protein intake, as proxies for intake. Proportions of residents at risk of inadequate diets will also be determined. Discussion: This rigorous and comprehensive data collection in a large and diverse sample will provide, for the first time, the opportunity to consider important modifiable factors associated with poor food intake of residents in LTC. Identification of factors that are independently associated with food intake will help to develop effective interventions that support food intake.

abstract={Background: Behavioural phenotypes vary within and among individuals. While early-life experiences have repeatedly been proposed to underpin interactions between these two hierarchical levels, the environmental factors causing such effects remain under-studied. We tested whether an individual's diet affected both its body composition, average behaviour (thereby causing among-individual variation or 'personality') and within-individual variability in behaviour and body weight (thereby causing among-individual differences in residual within-individual variance or 'stability'), using the Southern field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus as a model. We further asked whether effects of diet on the expression of these variance components were sex-specific. Methods: Manipulating both juvenile and adult diet in a full factorial design, individuals were put, in each life-stage, on a diet that was either relatively high in carbohydrates or relatively high in protein. We subsequently measured the expression of multiple behavioural (exploration, aggression and mating activity) and morphological traits (body weight and lipid mass) during adulthood. Results: Dietary history affected both average phenotype and level of within-individual variability: males raised as juveniles on high-protein diets were heavier, more aggressive, more active during mating, and behaviourally less stable, than conspecifics raised on high-carbohydrate diets. Females preferred more protein in their diet compared to males, and dietary history affected average phenotype and within-individual variability in a sex-specific manner: individuals raised on high-protein diets were behaviourally less stable in their aggressiveness but this effect was only present in males. Diet also influenced individual differences in male body weight, but within-individual variance in female body weight. Discussion: This study thereby provides experimental evidence that dietary history explains both heterogeneous residual within-individual variance (i.e., individual variation in 'behavioural stability') and individual differences in average behaviour (i.e., 'personality'), though dietary effects were notably trait-specific. These findings call for future studies integrating proximate and ultimate perspectives on the role of diet in the evolution of repeatedly expressed traits, such as behaviour and body weight. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={An understanding of the mechanisms that allow ecologically similar species to coexist is critical in making effective conservation and restoration decisions. This understanding is especially important when considering species that play critical roles in forest regeneration. Small mammals influence Neotropical forest regeneration following disturbance through their actions as seed dispersers and seed predators. In Panama, the Central American spiny rat (Proechimys semispinosus) and the armored rat (Hoplomys gymnurus) persist sympatrically despite a similar diet and seasonal food resource limitation. To study the relationship between these species, we conducted behavioral arena trials to analyze interspecific and intraspecific interactions. Our goal was to determine whether behavioral dominance between H. gymnurus and P. semispinosus exists, potentially reducing the intensity of aggressive competition and allowing the two species to coexist sympatrically. Aggression data were analyzed using a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model showing that species pairing was a significant predictor of aggression, supporting the existence of behavioral dominance by P. semispinosus over H. gymnurus. Investigative behavior data were analyzed using the Kruskal–Wallis test and showed a significantly higher level of investigative behavior for P. semispinosus towards H. gymnurus during the dry season when resources are scarce compared to the wet season when resources are plentiful. © 2015 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.},

abstract={Movement of organisms is an important activity that has ecological and evolutionary implications, including individual reproductive success and survival, population growth and persistence, local adaptation, and gene flow. Expression of movement behavior has traditionally been termed dispersal and measured relative to home ranges. This simplistic approach belies the complexity of the process. Movement of freshwater stream fish has been at times viewed as predominantly restricted in nature, but recent research challenges this paradigm since some distribution of movement exists in every population. A better research approach is to understand the drivers that promote or limit movement. Drivers of movement can be categorized as extrinsic ecological factors (context dependent), e.g., habitat quality, habitat variability, and the presence of predators, and intrinsic traits of the fish (condition dependent), such as body size and condition. One intrinsic trait that has received relatively little attention is the inherent personality to be sedentary or mobile, and how this interacts with the suite of traits and behaviors to drive movement. Future movement behavior research should focus on the interaction of extrinsic and intrinsic drivers to better understand the evolutionary and ecological implications of movement. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Interference behaviour (aggression and cannibalism) can be influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as animal physiology, size, or motivation, and extrinsic factors, such as presence of competitors, predators, or prey. Our experiment examined the effects of differences in diet quality of focal salamanders and their opponents, and levels of handling on biting by pairs of larval ringed salamanders, Ambystoma annulatum, before and after presentation of prey. Diet quality and handling affect the intrinsic qualities of body size/condition and stress, respectively. Presence of prey and diet quality of opponents are extrinsic factors. Unstressed larvae on high-quality diets bit their high-condition opponents more frequently than those that had been on low-quality diets in both the presence and absence of food. Stressed larvae (all on high quality diets) showed low levels of biting when food was absent. However, when food was present, the level of biting depended on the diet quality of their opponents: stressed larvae bit opponents on low-quality diets more than opponents on high-quality diets. Overall, both intrinsic and extrinsic factors influenced interference behaviour, with larvae on high-quality diets exhibiting relatively high levels of biting unless they had experienced handling stress, and the effect of handling stress depending on the condition of the opponent in paired interactions. © 2017 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.},

abstract={Despite recent progress in elucidating the genetic basis for behavioral variation, the effects of the developmental environment on the maintenance and generation of behavioral variation across multiple traits remain poorly resolved. We investigated how nutritional status during development affected behavioral variation and covariance between activity in an open field test and response to cues of predator presence in the house cricket (Acheta domesticus). We provided 98 juvenile crickets with either a high or low quality diet during development, throughout which we measured body mass, activity in a modified open-field, and response to predator excreta twice every week for 3 weeks. Diet quality affected growth rate but not average activity or response to cues of predator presence, nor the correlation between the 2. However, repeatability (τ) in response to cues of predator presence was reduced by 0.24 in individuals exposed to the high quality diet versus the low quality diet. Larger individuals also increased their response to predator cues when reared on a high quality diet, suggesting negative feedbacks between growth rate and antipredator behaviors. Our results also indicate that changes in the developmental environment are not sufficient to collapse behavioral syndromes, suggesting a genetic link between activity and predator cue response in house crickets, and that nutritional stress early in life can lead to more consistent behavioral responses when individuals faced predatory threats. Our results demonstrate that subtle differences in the quality of the environment experienced early in life can influence how individuals negotiate behavioral and life-history trade-offs later in life. © The Author 2016.},

abstract={EM66 is a peptide derived from the chromogranin, secretogranin II (SG-II). Recent findings in mice indicate that EM66 is a novel anorexigenic neuropeptide that regulates hypothalamic feeding behavior, at least in part, by activating the POMC neurons of the arcuate nucleus. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism of action of EM66 in the control of feeding behavior and, more specifically, its potential interactions with the NPY and POMC systems in rat. We analyzed by Q-PCR the gene expression of the EM66 precursor, SG-II, in hypothalamic extracts following 2, 3, or 4 days of food deprivation and compared it with the expression levels of the two major neuropeptidergic systems, that is, POMC and NPY, modulating feeding behavior. Our results show that fasting for 2 and 3 days has no effect on SG-II mRNA levels. However, 4 days of food deprivation induced a significant alteration in the expression levels of the three genes studied, with a significant increase in SG-II and NPY mRNAs, and conversely, a significant decrease in POMC mRNA. These data indicate that the EM66 gene expression is modulated by a negative energy status and suggest interactions between EM66 and NPY to regulate food intake through the POMC system. © 2017 The Author(s).

abstract={Failure to participate in a cognitive test may result in sampling biases when measuring inter-individual variation in cognitive performances in both captive and wild populations. This would be problematic if particular classes of individuals consistently fail to participate, skewing data and making generalisations or comparisons difficult. We presented 144 pheasant chicks, raised under standardised conditions, with a battery of cognitive tests to investigate whether sex, body condition or personality traits, measured by differences in latencies to explore a novel object, novel environment or unknown conspecific, predicted individual variation in voluntary participation across 37 test sessions. In general, participation increased across testing sessions, yet patterns of participation differed with sex and body condition. Males with a high body condition were more likely to participate in early test sessions compared to males with a low body condition or females. While participation among males in high body condition was consistent across sessions, males with a low body condition and females, regardless of body condition, were more likely to participate in later, rather than earlier sessions. Individuals also showed repeatable behaviours across time and different contexts, revealing not only that the exploration of novelty, but also that the order that subjects entered the testing arena and their latencies to acquire a freely available meal-worm reward may be considered valid proxies for different personality traits. During each test session, those individuals that were among the first to voluntarily enter the testing arena were more likely to participate in subsequent trials. Moreover, when isolated in the testing arena, individuals that rapidly acquired a freely available meal-worm, positioned on the testing apparatus, were also more likely to participate in a cognitive test. Our findings therefore reveal that sex, body condition and personality traits, along with habituation to the testing paradigms, all play important roles in determining whether or not particular individuals participate in cognitive tests. Sampling biases may therefore misrepresent our understanding of variation in cognitive performance in wild and captive populations, making individual differences in cognition difficult to interpret. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of the food availability period on body weight, self-selection of macronutrients, adiposity, lipoprotein, and serum glucose profiles without changing energy intake. Young male rats were divided into 2 groups according to the availability of food during the light and dark phases of the cycle, forming 2 groups: control group (CG) and group with inverted feeding pattern (IFPG). Before inversion of food availability on the 80th day, circadian food intake was measured every 4 h over 24 h during 3 days. The glycemic curve, an oral test for glucose tolerance, and self-selection of macronutrients were evaluated. Blood samples were collected for analysis of fasting glucose, triglycerides, and total cholesterol fractions. The IFPG showed an increase in fasting glucose in the dark phase of the cycle, changes in the glycemic curve, and oral glucose tolerance test. It also showed increased abdominal and liver fat and distinct choice of macronutrients compared with the CG. A change in the availability of food according to the phase of the circadian cycle produces changes in glucose and feeding circadian rhythm culminating in increased abdominal and hepatic fat. These effects can increase the risk of metabolic disorders and installation of chronic diseases. © 2017, Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: The functional foods constitute the important segment of the food market. Among factors that determine the intentions to eat functional foods, the psychological factors play very important roles. Motives, attitudes and personality are key factors. The relationships between socio-demographic characteristics, attitudes and willingness to purchase functional foods were not fully confirmed. Consumers’ beliefs about health benefits from eaten foods seem to be a strong determinant of a choice of functional foods.
Objective: The objective of this study was to determine relations between familiarity, attitudes, and beliefs in benefits and risks about functional foods and develop some conceptual models of willingness to eat.
Material and methods: The sample of Polish consumers counted 1002 subjects at age 15+. The foods enriched with vitamins or minerals, and cholesterol-lowering margarine or drinks were considered. The questionnaire focused on familiarity with foods, attitudes, beliefs about benefits and risks of their consumption was constructed. The Pearson’s correlations and linear regression equations were calculated.
Results: The strongest relations appeared between attitudes, high health value and high benefits, (r = 0.722 and 0.712 for enriched foods, and 0.664 and 0.693 for cholesterol-lowering foods), and between high health value and high benefits (0.814 for enriched foods and 0.758 for cholesterol-lowering foods). The conceptual models based on linear regression of relations between attitudes and all other variables, considering or not the familiarity with the foods, were developed.
Conclusions: The positive attitudes and declared consumption are more important for enriched foods. The beliefs on high health value and high benefits play the most important role in the purchase. The interrelations between different variables may be described by new linear regression models, with the beliefs in high benefits, positive attitudes and familiarity being most significant predictors. Health expectations and trust to functional foods are the key factors in their choice.},

abstract={Abstract: Invasive species must respond appropriately to novel habitats as they expand their ranges. The degree of habitat novelty is likely to be the highest immediately following human-mediated range-expansion, which can move an individual very large distances beyond its home range within a short space of time. How does translocation affect those critically important initial colonists? We collected cane toads (Rhinella marina) in eastern Australia in heath and woodland habitats, simulated either short-distance or long-distance transport (level of transport stress) and then either returned toads to their exact collection point or reciprocally translocated them to a novel site. Following release, we radio-tracked toads for 5 days and recorded their shelter types and microhabitat use daily. We also examined the thermal and hydric conditions experienced by toads and tested if prey intake, stomach mass and body condition of translocated toads differed from those of resident conspecifics. Translocated toads used different types of diurnal shelters, were more exposed by day and experienced higher diurnal temperatures (but not more desiccating conditions). Analysis of stomach contents indicated that translocation per se did not reduce feeding rates, nor reduce body condition. However, toads exposed to higher transport stress (simulating long-distance displacement) exhibited changes to body condition and hydric balance. Shifts in toad shelter site use induced by translocation may increase the toads’ visibility to diurnal predators, thereby reducing toad survival but also exacerbating the ecological impact of toads during the initial phase of post-translocation dispersal. Significance statement: Each stage of the invasion process poses unique challenges for invading taxa, and very few species possess the full suite of behavioural, physiological or morphological traits required to pass through all stages of the invasion pathway. Although the study of invasion biology has grown exponentially, most research has focused on the determinants of invasion success during the later stages of establishment and spread, neglecting the earlier stages of transport and introduction. Understanding how species respond to all stages of the invasion process can clarify the non-random traits that allow certain species to become successful invaders. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={We studied parental care in the Jacky Winter Microeca fascinans at Gluepot Reserve, South Australia, for one breeding season from 16 August to 9 November 2001, supplemented by observations on breeding and social behaviour in September 2012. We monitored ten nests in 2001, nine of which were attended by pairs and one by three adults, and watched three nests for a total of c. 117 hours. Female incubation constancy was 69%, duration of incubation sessions averaged 4.58 minutes and absences from the nest 2.07 minutes. Mean number of nest visits per hour by two pairs during the incubation period was 10.6 and for a group of three adults (two males, one female) was 15.8. Female care included brooding, feeding of nestlings, and nest-hygiene. Male care included delivering food to the sitting female, feeding the nestlings, nest-hygiene, nest-defence, and territoriality. Mean female brooding constancy was 55%. Mean number of feeding trips per hour by male and female combined for the entire nestling period was 14.6. Older young, 12, 13 and 14 days of age, received 21, 20, and 29 feeds/h respectively or one feed about every 2 minutes. Mean number of visits per hour by male and female combined to a nest with two young was 16.5 for Days 1-10 and 20.4 for Days 11-18 of the nestling period. High nest-predation is discussed in relation to nest placement and concealment, high nest visitation during incubation and nestling stages, anti-predator behaviour, nest-defence and types of predators, and re-nesting capacity, and compared with other Australasian robins and northern temperate and tropical songbirds. The small nest, small clutch-size, high nest failure, and anti-predator posture and mottled plumage of nestlings suggest that nest-predation is a strong selective pressure in the Jacky Winter. However, the moderately long nestling period, brood-size reduction, high rates of feeding young and nest visits by both male and female, and short and frequent incubation and brooding bouts on and off the nest relative to other robins are not consistent with nest-predation theory, and suggest behavioural responses to food availability and an ultimate response to food limitation. Incubation behaviour on and off the nest, parental care of young, nest visitation and other life-history traits that influence reproductive effort are discussed to elucidate the breeding strategy compared with other Australasian robins.},

abstract={Prey animals must balance antipredatory behaviour with foraging behaviour. According to the risk allocation hypothesis, prey increase antipredatory behaviour and reduce foraging activity during pulses of high risk, but with continuous risk, other activities must continue and antipredatory behaviour decreases despite the risk. We studied the impact of lynx presence on the vigilance behaviour of wild roe deer under conditions of (i) a pulsed elevated risk by experimentally spreading lynx urine as an olfactory cue, and (ii) continuous risk by comparing an area where lynx was eradicated 160 years ago to an area where lynx has been re-introduced 30 years ago. Roe deer were extremely vigilant in response to the predator olfactory cue; however, roe deer vigilance did not differ measurably among areas with or without potential lynx presence. Deer were more vigilant before sunset than during the night at both study areas, probably due to long-term adaptation of roe deer to human hunting during daytime. Vigilance decreased from August to September even though activity of lynx increases in autumn, which may be a result either of increased foraging due to decrease in food quality in autumn, or of changes in social organization of the deer. Our results suggested that the degree of vigilance depends on environmental cues. We found that roe deer respond to lynx urine despite a long absence of lynx in the ecosystem. Our results support the risk allocation hypothesis for responses to pulses of high risk but not for responses to continuous elevated levels of risk. © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Natal dispersal outcomes are an interplay between environmental conditions and individual phenotypes. Peripheral, isolated populations may experience altered environmental conditions and natal dispersal patterns that differ from populations in contiguous landscapes. We document nonphilopatric, sex-biased natal dispersal in an endangered small mammal, the Mt. Graham red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis), restricted to a single mountain. Other North American red squirrel populations are shown to have sex-unbiased, philopatric natal dispersal. We ask what environmental and intrinsic factors may be driving this atypical natal dispersal pattern. We test for the influence of proximate factors and ultimate drivers of natal dispersal: habitat fragmentation, local population density, individual behavior traits, inbreeding avoidance, competition for mates, and competition for resources, allowing us to better understand altered natal dispersal patterns at the periphery of a species’ range. A juvenile squirrel's body condition and its mother's mass in spring (a reflection of her intrinsic quality and territory quality) contribute to individual behavioral tendencies for movement and exploration. Resources, behavior, and body condition have the strongest influence on natal dispersal distance, but affect males and females differently. Male natal dispersal distance is positively influenced by its mother's spring body mass and individual tendency for movement; female natal dispersal distance is negatively influenced by its mother's spring body mass and positively influenced by individual tendency for movement. An apparent feedback between environmental variables and subsequent juvenile behavioral state contributes to an altered natal dispersal pattern in a peripheral population, highlighting the importance of studying ecological processes at the both range center and periphery of species’ distributions. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Long-term studies on rodents have been conducted for longer periods (up to 70 years) and more generations (up to 88 generations) than for most other mammalian taxa. These studies have been instrumental in furthering our understanding of ecophysiology, social systems, and population and community processes. Studies on African striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) revealed that basal blood glucose levels span a far greater homeostatic range than previously thought. Studies on American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) demonstrated how endocrine pathways underlying phenotypic plasticity allow individuals to respond to different environments. Long-term studies on African striped mice, marmots (Marmota), tuco-tucos (Ctenomys sociabilis), and degus (Octodon degus) revealed that ecological constraints on dispersal are drivers of group formation in some species but not others. Social flexibility, when the social system of an entire population can change due to individuals changing their social tactics, has been demonstrated in striped mice. Long-term studies on prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) found that males and females often live in pairs, leading to subsequent studies of the neural mechanisms underlying social monogamy. Long-term studies on other arvicoline rodents contributed more to our understanding of the factors influencing population dynamics than studies on any other mammalian order. While food availability and predation have been identified as factors influencing population dynamics, no single factor alone drives population dynamics in any species. We encourage researchers to incorporate manipulative experiments into long-term studies and to take integrative approaches to inform cross-disciplinary theory. © 2017 American Society of Mammalogists.},

abstract={Abstract: It has been proposed recently that labile state variables (e.g. energy reserves) can have a key role in the development and maintenance of consistent between-individual behavioural variation (i.e. animal personality) within population. In male Carpetan rock lizards (Iberolacerta cyreni), the provitamin D3 component of femoral gland secretion acts as an honest signal in sexual communication. Further, vitamin D3 has many important metabolic functions in reptiles. Therefore, by employing a factorial experiment with food (high vs. low) and vitamin D3 (supplemented vs. control) treatments in wild-caught reproductive male I. cyreni, we tested whether changing labile components of individual state affected (i) behavioural consistency (the degree of between-individual difference) and (ii) behavioural type (mean behaviour). Animal personality in activity was present in all treatments; however, personality was present only in the high food × vitamin D3 supplementation treatment in shelter use and it was present in all but the low food × placebo treatment in risk taking. Lizards (i) decreased activity in the high food treatment, (ii) increased shelter use in the vitamin D3 supplementation treatment and (iii) increased risk taking in the low food × vitamin D3 supplementation treatment. We conclude that short-term changes in individual state affect both behavioural consistency and behavioural type of reproductive male I. cyreni. Unfavourable conditions resulted in decreased behavioural consistency, while high-state individuals became less active in general. Individuals with high specific (vitamin D3) but low general (energy reserves) state took higher risk. We discuss several evolutionary explanations for the reported patterns. Significance statement: The evolutionary and developmental mechanisms resulting in consistent between-individual behavioural differences across time and situations (i.e. animal personality) are of high scientific interest. It has been recently proposed that links between individual state (e.g. how well-fed the individual is) and behaviour can maintain such between-individual differences even on an evolutionarily timescale. However, whether short-term state changes are able to affect animal personality in adults is an open question. In a manipulative experiment, we found that the amount of food and vitamin D3 (known to increase physiological quality and attractiveness of male Carpetan rock lizards, I. cyreni) affected the expression of animal personality and the actual behavioural types of reproductive male Carpetan rock lizards. Therefore, we provide evidence that short-term environmental variation does induce or suppress animal personality, and it also affects individual behaviour. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Animals show consistent individual differences in behaviour across time and/or contexts. Recently, it has been suggested that proactive personality types might also exhibit fast cognitive styles. The speed with which individuals sample environmental cues is one way in which correlations between personality and cognition might arise. Here, we measured a collection of behavioural traits (competitiveness, neophobia, neophilia, task-directed motivation and exploration) in common mynas (Acridotheres tristis) and measured their relationship with problem solving. We predicted that fast solving mynas would interact with (i.e. sample) the problem solving task at higher rates, but also be more competitive, less neophobic, more neophilic, and more exploratory. Mynas that were faster to solve a novel foraging problem were no more competitive around food and no more inclined to take risks. Unexpectedly, these fast-solving mynas had higher rates of interactions with the task, but also displayed lower levels of exploration. It is possible that a negative relation between problem solving and spatial exploration arose as a consequence of how inter-individual variation in exploration was quantified. We discuss the need for greater consensus on how to measure exploratory behaviour before we can advance our understanding of relationships between cognition and personality more effectively. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Predation danger is pervasive for small mammals and is expected to select strongly for behavioural tactics that reduce the risk. In particular, since it may be considered a cost of reproduction, predation danger is expected to affect the level of reproductive effort. We test this hypothesis in a population of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus (Ord, 1815)) under seminatural conditions in field enclosures. We manipulated the voles’ perception of predation danger by adjusting the available cover and measured giving up density (GUD) in food patches to verify that the perception of danger differed between high- and low-cover treatments. Treatments did not differ in actual predation rate, in vole density, or in the quantity or quality of food. During the experiments, we measured indices of vole reproductive effort including activity (electronic detectors), foraging intensity (fecal plates), and the number of young produced (livetrapping). Voles in the high-cover (lower danger) treatments were more active, foraged more, and produced 85% more young per female per trap period than voles in the low-cover (higher danger) treatment. We briefly discuss the population consequences of this adaptive behavioural flexibility. © 2017, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Deficits in the domains of attention and response inhibition are central to many psychiatric disorders. As such, animal models of disorders purporting to replicate these behavioral deficits first require tests that can accurately assess the behaviors with high fidelity. The gold-standard clinical test of attention and response inhibition is the continuous performance test (CPT). Although there are a number of CPTs, all share the premise of responding to target stimuli and inhibiting from responding to non-target stimuli. The recently developed rodent five-choice CPT (5C-CPT) requires similar behavioral responses, enabling signal detection parameter calculations. With demonstrable feasibility for rodent testing, the 5C-CPT permits/facilitates: (1) delineation of neural mechanisms underlying these behaviors; (2) multifactorial analyses of the complex interplay between genetic and environmental manipulations relevant to psychiatric disorders; and hence (3) development of novel targeted treatments. All data to date indicate that the rodent 5C-CPT described here has direct translatability to clinical CPTs, producing equivalent measures of behavior in experimental animals to those assessed in humans. The 5C-CPT task provides an important tool toward delineating thesemechanisms and developing treatments. However, it is also complex, with long training times and nuances requiring a thorough understanding before utilization. This unit will enable researchers to avoid potential missteps, greatly increasing the likelihood of success. © 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

abstract={Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly used medications for mood and anxiety disorders, and adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus has been shown to be involved in the behavioral effects of SSRIs in mice. Studies have shown the varied effects of chronic treatment with SSRIs on adult neurogenesis. One such effect is the acceleration of neuronal maturation, which affects the functional integration of new neurons into existing neuronal circuitry. In this study, we labeled new neurons by using GFP-expressing retroviral vectors in mice and investigated the effect of an SSRI, fluoxetine, on these neurons at different time points after neuronal birth. Chronic treatment with fluoxetine accelerated the dendritic development of the newborn neurons and shifted the timing of the expression of the maturational marker proteins, doublecortin and calbindin. This accelerated maturation was observed even after sub-chronic treatment, only when fluoxetine was administered during the second week of neuronal birth. These results suggest the existence of a ‘critical period’ for the fluoxetine-induced maturation of new neurons. We propose that the modified functional integration of new neurons in the critical period may underlie the behavioral effects of fluoxetine by regulating anxiety-related decision-making processes. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Personality exists in non-human animals and can impact fitness. There is, however, a shortage of empirical studies in certain areas within the field, and fundamental evolutionary theory on personality remains largely untested. For example, little is known on how variation in personality is maintained over evolutionary time. Theory suggests that fluctuating selection pressures due to spatiotemporal variation in conditions, e.g. food availability, is a possible mechanism and a few studies have shown that the success of different personality types varies with spatiotemporal conditions. However, it remains unknown whether different mechanisms can maintain personality within a species. Here we use a reintroduction programme for the critically endangered European mink (Mustela lutreola) to test whether multiple personality trait domains (boldness, exploration and sociability) affected survival in two different years and islands. This was done through pre-release personality tests and post-release radio-tracking monitoring. Survival was positively correlated with boldness, whereas the relationship with exploration was either negative or positive depending on year/island. The results show a complex relationship between personality and survival and suggest that exploration can be maintained over evolutionary time via spatiotemporal variation in conditions. However, in contrast to exploration, boldness did not vary spatiotemporally and sociability had no impact on survival. This indicates that different personality trait domains might be maintained by different mechanisms. To date, personality has been studied primarily within behavioural sciences, but through empirical findings we highlight the importance of personality also in ecology and conservation biology. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={Context Long-term viability of wildlife populations may be influenced by the adaptive or maladaptive nature of behavioural shifts. Yet, in the short term, implications of novel behaviour are often uncertain, as they were for a newly formed urban nesting colony of pied imperial-pigeons (PIPs) on the mainland coast of north-eastern Australia. It represented unprecedented behaviour, as most of PIPs, also known as Torresian imperial-pigeons, Ducula bicolor/spilorrhoa, breed colonially on remote small islands. Aims The present study would (1) determine whether aggregated mainland nesting continued, (2) evaluate reproductive success, (3) evaluate spatial distribution of nests and (4) explore possible association of reproductive success with predator presence and broad indicators of food availability. Methods With assistance from volunteers, we found mainland PIP nests and revisited them intermittently to monitor progress. We calculated quantitative estimates of nest survival by the Mayfield method and evaluated reproductive output in relation to environmental data from independent sources. Key results During the 2012, 2013 and 2014 breeding seasons, we recorded 436, 387 and 417 PIP nest events at the new mainland colony. Daily nest-survival rates declined progressively and estimated fledgling output decreased over successive seasons from 0.66 to 0.44 per nest event. The highest mainland output was below that estimated for an island PIP colony (0.78) on the basis of sparse prior data. Across potential foraging grounds, there was no negative change in land use and no widespread adverse weather to account for diminishing success. We identified important causes of nest failure among mainland nesting PIPs to be predation, predominantly by birds, and anthropogenic hazards, including tree pruning and collisions with vehicles and windows of buildings. Conclusions With ongoing exposure to these hazards, mainland nesting PIPs cannot be expected to increase productivity; hence, the new colony may be a short-term phenomenon. We infer that the historic success of PIP populations in Queensland stems from their selection of breeding sites on remote islands that are largely free of relevant predators and anthropogenic activity. Implications Future conservation of extant PIP abundance will depend crucially on protection of island breeding sites, because multiple hazards of mainland nesting make it an unfavourable alternative strategy. © 2017 CSIRO.},

In this study, we investigated Eurasian siskin (Carduelis spinus) dominant individuals for neophobia and influence of social context on foraging. In our experiments, a subject (observer) was presented with three novel and familiar food in each of three contexts: asocial, first social context (conspecifics without food) and second social context (conspecifics with food). The results showed that individuals preferred to consume novel food only in social context comparing to asocial. Furthermore, individuals consumed significantly greater amount of familiar food in social context than asocial.

abstract={Binge eating (BE) and drug seeking share similar behavioral features, including loss of control over consumption and compulsive seeking of the craved substance. Previous studies in animal models have demonstrated a complex interaction between ‘state’ BE, produced by intermittent access to a palatable diet, and ‘trait’ BE, a phenotypical proneness towards overeating. In the present study, we examined the relationship between state and trait BE and cocaine seeking. We used Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty rats, a genetic model for obesity that demonstrates BE-like behavior, and Long Evans Tokushima Otsuka controls. They received a schedule of limited access to a palatable diet (3 days/week or 5 days/week access to Ensure for a month). Next, they underwent cocaine self-administration training (1 mg/kg, 1 hour/day for 10 days) followed by extinction sessions (7 days). We found that the degree of BE-like behavior and the state and trait BE combination predicted cocaine craving patterns. Lower levels of dopamine D2 receptors in the prefrontal cortex were correlated with increased drug craving. Moreover, restricted access to an attractive diet was found to be a risk factor for heightened cocaine craving, particularly in trait binge eaters, as rats on the 3 days/week access schedule persistently failed to cease cocaine seeking throughout extinction. Hence, we postulate a joint role of state and trait BE as risk factors for heightened cocaine craving. © 2015 Society for the Study of Addiction},

abstract={Plovers (subfamily: Charadriinae) are visual foragers that rely on ambient light for detection of invertebrates, as demonstrated by their foot-stirring behaviour used to stimulate a flight response in prey. At night, although ambient light is minimal, predation pressure from diurnal raptors is reduced and invertebrate prey availability increases, thus creating fitness benefits to nocturnal foraging by invertivores. The Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus) is a widespread yet understudied Plover that primarily inhabits agricultural fields throughout North America during the winter. Because nocturnal ambient light is directly dependent upon the lunar cycle, I hypothesized that Killdeer exploit nights with greater lunar illumination to be able to forage when predation risk is low and prey availability is enhanced. I predicted that nocturnal activities by Killdeer would be reflected in their diurnal behaviour the subsequent day, with decreased diurnal foraging following lighter nights. I also considered the additive effect of lower ambient temperatures and precipitation. I used an information-theoretic framework to compare these hypotheses and found the model with greatest support revealed a clear negative relationship between diurnal foraging and the amount of lunar illumination the preceding night. Interestingly, I found the opposite trend in diurnal roosting behaviour, suggesting that if nocturnal light levels suffice, Killdeer forage at night and roost during the day. I propose that this behaviour is driven by differential predation risk and food availability perceived by Killdeer at night vs. day. I also discuss the potential functional importance of energetic demands. Taken together, these results highlight the potential for avian diurnal behaviour to be closely tied to natural variation in nocturnal light availability, a finding with potential relevance to the increasing threat of artificial light pollution in our era of industrialization. © 2016, Dt.

abstract={Chronic stress and depression are challenging conditions to treat, owing to their complexity and lack of clinically available and effective therapeutic agents. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism by which berberine acts, by examining alterations to gastrointestinal tract histopathology and flora profle in a rat model, following the induction of stress. Research associating gastrointestinal flora and depression has increased, thus, the present study hypothesized that stress induces depression and changes in the gastrointestinal system. The chronic mild stress rat model was previously established based on a set of 10 chronic unpredictable stress methods. In the present study, the measurements of body weight, behavior, gastrointestinal tract histopathology and gastrointestinal flora profle were collected in order to elucidate understanding of chronic stress and depression in this region. In the present study, induced stress and the resulting depression was demonstrated to signifcantly decrease the body weight and sucrose preference of rats, as well as signifcantly increasing traverse time, vertical movement time, grooming time and motionless time in an open-feld test. Following modeling and subsequent treatment with low or high doses of berberine, the measurements were significantly different when compared with unstressed rats. Berberine appears to reverse the physical damage brought about by stress within the gastric mucosa and intestinal microvilli of the stomach, ileum, cecum and colon. Using enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence-based polymerase chain reaction analysis, several distinctive bands disappeared following modeling; however, novel distinctive bands appeared in response to the graded berberine treatment. In conclusion, the present study identifed that high concentrations of berberine markedly protects rats from various symptoms of chronic stress and depression, with the potential of facilitating treatment within clinical practice.},

abstract={Eating disorders, anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, are the third most common chronic diseases occurring in adolescents that result from various combined factors (personality disorders, emotional disturbances, family pressure, possible genetic or biological predisposition, and culture) and are most common mental disorders associated with physical complications involving risk of death. The aim of the paper is to present the relations and attitudes of adolescents based on their way of life - their eating habits and body image. The survey was conducted on 118 Medical School students from Croatia with their School Board and parents’ prior consent. It consists of two groups of questions: questions related to eating habits typical of the restrictive diet (counting calories, reducing food, and skipping meals), and those related to appearance and satisfaction with one’s own body. The results obtained were analyzed using statistical data analysis software. Analysis of the food-related responses indicates that the participants do not show significant concern regarding the subject: 94 respondents do not avoid food that contains fat, do not eat food that has less calories, and do not have smaller portions of food; 8 respondents avoid eating between meals; and 7 respondents skip meals (to avoid weight gain). 34 do not care about gaining weight, 54 of them do, and 88 think their body is not fit enough (they believe they must exercise); 35 use laxatives to control their body weight; 18 participants express satisfaction with their body. Only one male and 60 female respondents want to reduce weight, while 15 males and 24 females want to increase weight. The small number of participants satisfied with their body weight and the number of people at this age using laxatives to control body weight are cause for concern. They represent the population prone to developing eating disorders. The key factor in the treatment of eating disorders is a highly educated, therapeutic, interdisciplinary team. © 2017, Consulting and Training Center - KEY. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Mature excitatory synapses are composed of more than 1500 proteins postsynaptically and hundreds more that operate presynaptically. Among them, drebrin is an F-actin-binding protein that increases noticeably during juvenile synaptogenesis. Electron microscopic analysis reveals that drebrin is highly enriched specifically on the postsynaptic side of excitatory synapses. Since dendritic spines are structures specialized for excitatory synaptic transmission, the function of drebrin was probed by analyzing the ultrastructural characteristics of dendritic spines of animals with genetic deletion of drebrin A (DAKO), the adult isoform of drebrin. Electron microscopic analyses revealed that these brains are surprisingly intact, in that axo-spinous synaptic junctions are well-formed and not significantly altered in number. This normal ultrastructure may be because drebrin E, the alternate embryonic isoform, compensates for the genetic deletion of drebrin A. However, DAKO results in the loss of homeostatic plasticity of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). The NMDAR activation-dependent trafficking of the NR2A subunit-containing NMDARs from dendritic shafts into spine head cytoplasm is greatly diminished within brains of DAKO. Conversely, within brains of wild-type rodents, spines respond to NMDAR blockade with influx of F-actin, drebrin A, and NR2A subunits of NMDARs. These observations indicate that drebrin A facilitates the trafficking of NMDAR cargos in an F-actin-dependent manner to mediate homeostatic plasticity. Analysis of the brains of transgenic mice used as models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) reveals that the loss of drebrin from dendritic spines predates the emergence of synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment, suggesting that this form of homeostatic plasticity contributes toward cognition. Two studies suggest that the nature of drebrin’s interaction with NMDARs is dependent on the receptor’s subunit composition. Drebrin A can be found co-clustering with NR2B-containing NMDARs at the plasma membrane, while NR2A-containing NMDARs co-traffic into the spine cytoplasm but do not co-cluster at the plasma membrane. Most recently, we encountered a physiological condition that supports this idea. When adolescent female rats are reared under a condition of restricted food access and ad libitum wheel access, they paradoxically become excessive runners, choosing to run, even during the limited hours of food availability. This behavioral pattern is termed activity-based anorexia (ABA) and has served as an animal model for anorexia nervosa. Those animals that exhibit the greatest ABA vulnerability, in that they lose the most amount of body weight and run with greatest exuberance to the point of risking their lives, exhibit the highest levels of NR2B-NMDARs and drebrin at the postsynaptic membrane of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Those animals that exhibit the greatest resilience to ABA, in that they run minimally under such condition, thereby losing minimal amount of weight, exhibit the highest level of NR2A-NMDARs in the spine cytoplasm and lowest levels of drebrin at the postsynaptic membrane. This pattern suggests that drebrin has dual roles: retention of NR2A-NMDARs in the reserve pool and trafficking of NR2B-NMDARs to the postsynaptic membrane, ultimately contributing to an individual’s reactivity to stress. Altogether, these observations indicate that drebrin is a protein that is important for synaptic plasticity and deserves the attention of neuroscientists studying the neurobiological basis of cognition and stress reactivity. © 2017, Springer Japan KK.},

abstract={Offspring of murine dams chronically fed a protein-restricted diet have an increased risk for metabolic and neurobehavioral disorders. Previously we showed that adult offspring, developmentally exposed to a chronic maternal low-protein (MLP) diet, had lower body and hindleg muscle weights and decreased liver enzyme serum levels. We conducted energy expenditure, neurobehavioral and circadian rhythm assays in male offspring to examine mechanisms for the body-weight phenotype and assess neurodevelopmental implications of MLP exposure. C57BL/6J dams were fed a protein restricted (8%protein, MLP) or a control protein (20% protein, C) diet from four weeks before mating until weaning of offspring. Male offspring were weaned to standard rodent diet (20% protein) and single-housed until 8-12 weeks of age. We examined body composition, food intake, energy expenditure, spontaneous rearing activity and sleep patterns and performed behavioral assays for anxiety (open field activity, elevated plus maze [EPM], light/dark exploration), depression (tail suspension and forced swim test), sociability (three-chamber), repetitive (marble burying), learning and memory (fear conditioning), and circadian behavior (wheel-running activity during light-dark and constant dark cycles). We also measured circadian gene expression in hypothalamus and liver at different Zeitgeber times (ZT). Male offspring from separate MLP exposed dams had significantly greater body fat (P = 0.03), less energy expenditure (P = 0.004), less rearing activity (P = 0.04) and a greater number of night-time rest/sleep bouts (P = 0.03) compared to control. MLP offspring displayed greater anxiety-like behavior in the EPM (P<0.01) but had no learning and memory deficit in fear-conditioning assay (P = 0.02). There was an effect of time on Per1, Per 2 and Clock circadian gene expression in the hypothalamus but not on circadian behavior. Thus, transplacental and early developmental exposure of dams to chronic MLP reduces food intake and energy expenditure, increases anxiety like behavior and disturbs sleep patterns but not circadian rhythm in adult male offspring.

abstract={There are three important manatee areas in Mexico: the coasts of the State of Quintana Roo; the freshwater systems within the lower basin of the Grijalva-Usumacinta rivers, which host the largest manatee population; and the rivers of central and southern Veracruz. The Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus) is a threatened species throughout its range. In the Grijalva-Usumacinta region, two of the current threats to manatees are the effects of extremely dry periods and geographical isolation. The objective of the study was to evaluate the behavior and habitat use of the landlocked manatee population inhabiting Laguna de las Ilusiones, Villahermosa, Tabasco, under fortuitous dry conditions, to conduct an evaluation and implement a monitoring plan for landlocked manatees. In this work, we gathered information on the differential use of the lake, and on whether this use is related to the known habitat characteristics that govern the distribution of manatees. Using VHF tags, we followed the activities of four manatees (three females and one male) to characterize and quantify four behaviors, namely feeding, resting, exploring, and traveling, between April and August 2007. We built Kernel polygons for the 25, 50, 75, and 95 % of the utilization distribution (UD). We modeled the habitat using a binary logistic regression and explored the association between the tagged manatees using Cole's simple coefficient of association. Manatees were concentrated mainly to the northeast of the lake. The best feeding logistic model included depth, distance to the the shore, tree cover, and wind speed (Table 1), and yielded differences between periods (H = 9.85, P = 0.007, Figure 5). The logistic models fit poorly for resting, exploring, and traveling (Table 1). The resting model included distance to the the shore, tree cover, and company, and yielded differences between periods (H = 6.68, P = 0.035). Traveling included depth, cloud cover, and human activities, and yielded differences between periods (H = 7.55, P = 0.023). Exploration included depth and company, and did not differ between periods (H = 1.55, P = 0.461). We had the opportunity to assess these behaviors under dry conditions, and our findings are not necessarily applicable to the rainy season. The northern portion of the lake is an embayment connected to the central zone by a 50 m-wide shallow channel, which limited the movement of manatees. Higher food availability and stress avoidance might make manatees choose this area. Feeding was better modeled by the habitat characteristics included in the study. Feeding increased slightly in the evenings. Exploring and traveling were the behavior types observed most frequently in manatees; maybe they were moving across food patches or known areas. Manatee social encounters are reported as short-term and sporadic, but in this study manatees were observed in groups during nearly half of the observation time. When the availability of grasses and aquatic plants is low, manatees increase their consumption of other food items like mango fruits. Based on the findings reported here and under dry conditions, habitat enrichment will be helpful for this landlocked manatee population and those in other areas where seasonal contrasts is observed. © 2016 Asociación Mexicana de Mastozoología.},

abstract={Solid epidemiological evidence indicates that part of the risk of obesity in adulthood could be programmed during prenatal development by the quality of maternal nutrition. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms involved are mostly unknown, which hinders our capacity to develop effective intervention policies. Here, we discuss the hypothesis that mechanisms underlying prenatal programming of adult risk are epigenetic and sensitive to environmental cues such as nutrition. While the information encoded in DNA is essentially stable, regulatory epigenetic mechanisms include reversible, covalent modifications of DNA and chromatin, such as methylation, acetylation etc. It is known that dietary availability of methyl donors has an impact on the patterns of gene expression by affecting DNA methylation at regulatory regions, a likely basis for reprogramming developmental plasticity. The Agouti and Axin-fused genes, as well as the embryonic growth factor IGF2/H19 locus are examples of diet-induced modulation of phenotypic traits by affecting methylation of gene-regulatory regions. Recent work has evidenced an unsuspected role for chromatin as metabolic sensor. Chromatin is susceptible to a number of post-translational modifications that modulate gene expression, among them the GlcNAcylation of histone proteins and other epigenetic regulators. Intracellular levels of the precursor molecule UDP-GlcNAc, and hence the degree of global chromatin GlcNAcylation, depend on the energetic state of the cell, making GlcNAcylation a functional link between nutrition and regulation of gene expression. Dietary interference with these regulatory mechanisms could effectively counteract the early-life programming of adult risk. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Food web structure is shaped by interactions within and across trophic levels. As such, understanding how the presence and absence of predators, prey, and competitors affect species foraging patterns is important for predicting the consequences of changes in species abundances, distributions, and behaviors. Here, we used plasma δ13C and δ15N values from juvenile blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and juvenile sicklefin lemon sharks (Negaprion acutidens) to investigate how species co-occurrence affects their trophic interactions in littoral waters of Moorea, French Polynesia. Co-occurrence led to isotopic niche partitioning among sharks within nurseries, with significant increases in δ15N values among sicklefin lemon sharks, and significant decreases in δ15N among blacktip reef sharks. Niche segregation likely promotes coexistence of these two predators during early years of growth and development, but data do not suggest coexistence affects life history traits, such as body size, body condition, and ontogenetic niche shifts. Plasticity in trophic niches among juvenile blacktip reef sharks and sicklefin lemon sharks also suggests these predators are able to account for changes in community structure, resource availability, and intra-guild competition, and may fill similar functional roles in the absence of the other species, which is important as environmental change and human impacts persist in coral reef ecosystems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a sudden unexpected death due to a demise of the myocardium. SCD also includes an acute precipitating trigger that lies in the brain and a chronic electrical instability of the myocardium. Most SCDs in absolute terms occur in subjects with no known pre-existing heart disease. The incidence of SCD may be about 20% per year in patients with heart failure and those with markers of arrhythmias, compared with about 1-2% in the general population, i.e., subjects with no “known” pre-existing heart disease. Some early symptoms of SCD include fatigue, fainting, blackouts and dizziness due to blood stopping to flow to the brain and other organs of the body. SCD is responsible for a sizable portion of the over 19 million deaths globally each year from CVDs. Acute anxiety, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history, arrhythmias, diabetes mellitus, prediabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity are risk factors to precipitate SCD. In addition, other behavioral risk factors including type A personality, physical inactivity, smoking, male gender, women after menopause, unhealthy diet and modern lifestyle, such as regularly eating fast foods or foods rich in saturated fats, and late-night sleep; excess sugar, alcohol and salt intake can also predispose to SCD. Deficiency in some cations and vitamins, especially magnesium, potassium, flavonoids and trace elements, and thiamine, have been associated with SCD. One or a combination of these risk factors can lead to pathological conditions and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) that predispose to SCD. The most common physio-pathological event is the rupture of the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque with athero-thrombosis, observed in the majority of the patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) and SCD. In an animal experiment, it has been reported that neutrophil-depleted animals had worsened cardiac function, increased fibrosis, and progressively developed heart failure, indicating that high neutrophil counts are considered a predictor of adverse clinical outcomes and mortality in patients with ACS. These cells may have a detrimental effect in the acute inflammatory phase after infarction. ACSs in patients with type 2 diabetes double the risk of SCD, and the risk is greater with higher blood glucose. ACS patients with STEMI and NSTEMI have increased risk of SCD, with several gender differences in presentation to emergency care. Recent advances in cardiac imaging techniques as CMR (Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging) can help in the preclinical detection of patients at risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias and SCD.

abstract={Knowledge on how functional responses (a measurement of feeding interaction strength) are affected by patch size and habitat complexity (represented by refuge availability) is crucial for understanding food-web stability and subsequently biodiversity. Due to their laborious character, it is almost impossible to carry out systematic empirical experiments on functional responses across wide gradients of patch sizes and refuge availabilities. Here we overcame this issue by using an individual-based model (IBM) to simulate feeding experiments. The model is based on empirically measured traits such as body-mass dependent speed and capture success. We simulated these experiments in patches ranging from sizes of petri dishes to natural patches in the field. Moreover, we varied the refuge availability within the patch independently of patch size, allowing for independent analyses of both variables. The maximum feeding rate (the maximum number of prey a predator can consume in a given time frame) is independent of patch size and refuge availability, as it is the physiological upper limit of feeding rates. Moreover, the results of these simulations revealed that a type III functional response, which is known to have a stabilizing effect on population dynamics, fitted the data best. The half saturation density (the prey density where a predator consumes half of its maximum feeding rate) increased with refuge availability but was only marginally influenced by patch size. Subsequently, we investigated how patch size and refuge availability influenced stability and coexistence of predator-prey systems. Following common practice, we used an allometric scaled Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model based on results from our in silico IBM experiments. The results suggested that densities of both populations are nearly constant across the range of patch sizes simulated, resulting from the constant interaction strength across the patch sizes. However, constant densities with decreasing patch sizes mean a decrease of absolute number of individuals, consequently leading to extinction of predators in the smallest patches. Moreover, increasing refuge availabilities also allowed predator and prey to coexist by decreased interaction strengths. Our results underline the need for protecting large patches with high habitat complexity to sustain biodiversity. © 2017 Li et al.},

abstract={Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a sudden unexpected death due to a demise of the myocardium. SCD also includes an acute precipitating trigger that lies in the brain and a chronic electrical instability of the myocardium. Most SCDs in absolute terms occur in subjects with no known pre-existing heart disease. The incidence of SCD may be about 20% per year in patients with heart failure and those with markers of arrhythmias, compared with about 1-2% in the general population, i.e., subjects with no “known” pre-existing heart disease. Some early symptoms of SCD include fatigue, fainting, blackouts and dizziness due to blood stopping to flow to the brain and other organs of the body. SCD is responsible for a sizable portion of the over 19 million deaths globally each year from CVDs. Acute anxiety, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history, arrhythmias, diabetes mellitus, prediabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity are risk factors to precipitate SCD. Other behavioral risk factors, including type A personality, physical inactivity, smoking, male gender, women after menopause, unhealthy diet and modern lifestyle, such as regularly eating fast foods or foods rich in saturated fats, and late-night sleep; excess sugar, alcohol and salt intake can also predispose to SCD. Deficiency in some cations and vitamins, especially magnesium, potassium, flavonoids and trace elements, and thiamine, has been associated with SCD. One or a combination of these risk factors can lead to pathological conditions and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) that predispose to SCD. The most common physio-pathological event is the rupture of the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque with athero-thrombosis, observed in the majority of the patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) and SCD. In an animal experiment, it has been reported that neutrophil-depleted animals had worsened cardiac function, increased fibrosis, and progressively developed heart failure, indicating that high neutrophil counts are considered a predictor of adverse clinical outcomes and mortality in patients with ACS. These cells may have a detrimental effect in the acute inflammatory phase after infarction. ACSs in patients with type-2 diabetes double the risk of SCD, and the risk is greater with higher blood glucose. ACS patients with STEMI and NSTEMI have increased risk of SCD, with several gender differences in presentation to emergency care. Recent advances in cardiac imaging techniques as CMR (Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging) can help in the preclinical detection of patients at risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias and SCD. Lately gadolinium has been used to identify areas of myocardial fibrosis, which is arrhythmogenic in cardiomyopathy, right ventricular dysplasia and some cases of mitral valve prolapsed syndrome as well. Speckle tracking echocardiography is recently used as an important tool in the diagnosis of non STEMI in critical care departments, which can add greatly to the triage of diagnosis of ACS. Finally, tissue Doppler imaging and deformation imaging is crucial for the early detection of patients at risk for SCD in certain patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the preclinical phase.

abstract={The interest for the study of the influence of malnutrition on the development and function of the central nervous system (CNS) dates back to the mid-1960s when a large proportion of children all over the world were undernourished. These early investigations were essentially focused on the study of the consequences on learning and other cognitive functions of early nutrient deficiency and the analysis of the hippocampus as anatomical substrate. Economic development followed by the implementation of appropriate public health policy allowed a gradual reduction of the incidence of childhood malnutrition in most countries such that the studies 158about the impact of in utero or neonatal undernutrition on brain function became marginal by the 1980s. The thrifty phenotype hypothesis proposed by Hales and Barker in 1992 linking perinatal malnutrition to metabolic disease risk (Hales and Barker 1992) has led to a resurgence of interest for this topic and placed the hypothalamus in the focus of the investigations aimed at determining the effects of maternal nutrient deficiency on the offspring’s CNS development and function. This interest is justified by the central role played by the hypothalamus in the regulation of feeding behavior and metabolic homeostasis. The “thrifty phenotype” hypothesis eventually evolved into the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis, also called metabolic or nutritional programming, to include the fact that over- and high-calorie nutrition during early life also predisposes to the development of the metabolic syndrome in adulthood (Barker 2004). This, and the fact that obesity is currently a health problem of pandemic proportion worldwide, has also stimulated the analysis of the impact of maternal obesity and overnutrition on the structural and functional properties of the hypothalamus of the offspring. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis and of our actual knowledge about the impact of early malnutrition (under- or overnutrition) on the morphological and functional characteristics of the hypothalamic neuronal circuits regulating food intake and energy homeostasis. This overview will be essentially limited to the description and discussion of data generated in rodents as is in these species where the mechanisms underlying the metabolic programming of the hypothalamus are best understood. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The decisions animals make to adjust their antipredator behavior to rapidly changing conditions have been well studied. Inducible defenses in plants are an antipredator behavior that acts on a longer time scale, but sensitive plants, Mimosa pudica, have a much more rapid antipredator response; they temporarily close their leaves when touched. The time they remain closed is defined as hiding time. We studied hiding time in sensitive plants and found that individual plants differed significantly in their hiding times. We then showed that the effect of individual explained substantial variation in hiding time on a short time scale. Finally, on a longer time scale, individuality persisted but the amount of variation attributed to individual decreased. We hypothesized that variation in plant condition might explain this change. We therefore manipulated sunlight availability and quantified hiding time. When deprived of light for 6 h, sensitive plants significantly shortened their hiding times. But when only half a plant was deprived of light, hiding times on the deprived half and light exposed half were not significantly different. This suggests that overall condition best explains variation in sensitive plant antipredator behavior. Just like in animals, sensitive plant antipredator behavior is condition dependent, and, just like in animals, a substantial amount of the remaining variation is explained by individual differences between plants. Thus, models designed to predict plasticity in animal behavior may be successfully applied to understand behavior in other organisms, including plants. © 2017 Reed-Guy et al.},

abstract={We described a new model of risk behavior in rats that allows selection of animals predisposed to risk behavior in the absence of other biological motivations. Phenazepam administration did not change the intensity of risk behavior in “risky” animals, but stimulated risk behavior in rats that were not predisposed to it. Nicotine inhibited risk behavior in “risky” animals and strengthened it in “cautious” rats. In the intermediate group, the drugs did not induce significant changes. A similar effect of the drugs was observed in the previous models. More complex effect of nicotine on the risk behavior may be explained by the absence of severe food motivation typical for the early models. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The embodied mammalian brain evolved to adapt to an only partially known and knowable world. The adaptive labeling of the world is critically dependent on the neocortex which in turn is modulated by a range of subcortical systems such as the thalamus, ventral striatum and the amygdala. A particular case in point is the learning paradigm of classical conditioning where acquired representations of states of the world such as sounds and visual features are associated with predefined discrete behavioral responses such as eye blinks and freezing. Learning progresses in a very specific order, where the animal first identifies the features of the task that are predictive of a motivational state and then forms the association of the current sensory state with a particular action and shapes this action to the specific contingency. This adaptive feature selection has both attentional and memory components, i.e. a behaviorally relevant state must be detected while its representation must be stabilized to allow its interfacing to output systems. Here we present a computational model of the neocortical systems that underlie this feature detection process and its state dependent modulation mediated by the amygdala and its downstream target, the nucleus basalis of Meynert. Specifically, we analyze how amygdala driven cholinergic modulation switches between two perceptual modes [1], one for exploitation of learned representations and prototypes and another one for the exploration of new representations that provoked these change in the motivational state, presenting a framework for rapid learning of behaviorally relevant perceptual representations. Beyond reward-driven learning that is mostly based on exploitation, this paper presents a complementary mechanism for quick exploratory perception and learning grounded on the understanding of fear and surprise. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Optimal nutrition early in life is critical to ensure proper structural and functional development of infant organ systems. Although pediatric nutrition historically has emphasized research on the relation between nutrition, growth rates, and gastrointestinal maturation, efforts increasingly have focused on how nutrition influences neurodevelopment. The provision of human milk is considered the gold standard in pediatric nutrition; thus, there is interest in understanding how functional nutrients and bioactive components in milk may modulate developmental processes. The piglet has emerged as an important translational model for studying neurodevelopmental outcomes influenced by pediatric nutrition. Given the comparable nutritional requirements and strikingly similar brain developmental patterns between young pigs and humans, the piglet is being used increasingly in developmental nutritional neuroscience studies. The piglet primarily has been used to assess the effects of dietary fatty acids and their accretion in the brain throughout neurodevelopment. However, recent research indicates that other dietary components, including choline, iron, cholesterol, gangliosides, and sialic acid, among other compounds, also affect neurodevelopment in the pig model. Moreover, novel analytical techniques, including but not limited to MRI, behavioral assessments, and molecular quantification, allow for a more holistic understanding of how nutrition affects neurodevelopmental patterns. By combining early-life nutritional interventions with innovative analytical approaches, opportunities abound to quantify factors affecting neurodevelopmental trajectories in the neonate. This review discusses research using the translational pig model with primary emphasis on early-life nutrition interventions assessing neurodevelopment outcomes, while also discussing nutritionally-sensitive methods to characterize brain maturation. © 2017 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by progressive loss of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that constitute direct and indirect pathways: the indirect pathway MSNs is more vulnerable than the direct pathway MSNs. Impairment of cAMP/cGMP signaling by mutant huntingtin is hypothesized as the molecular mechanismunderlying degeneration ofMSNs. Phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) is selectively expressed in MSNs and degrades both cAMP and cGMP; thus, PDE10A inhibition can restore impaired cAMP/cGMP signaling. Compared with other PDE10A inhibitors, a novel PDE10A inhibitor 1-[2-fluoro-4-(1H-pyrazol-1- yl)phenyl]-5-methoxy-3-(1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)pyridazin-4(1H)- one (TAK-063) showed comparable activation of the indirect pathway MSNs, whereas it produced partial activation of the direct pathway MSNs by its faster off-rate property. In this study, we report the effects of TAK-063 on striatal neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits in the R6/2 mouse model of HD. TAK-063 at 0.5 or 5 mg/kg/day was orally administrated from 4.5-5 to12weeks of age, and the effects of TAK-063 were characterized over this period. Repeated treatment with TAK-063 suppressed the reduction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, prevented striatal neurodegeneration, and suppressed increase in seizure frequency, but did not prevent the suppression of body weight gain. As for motor deficits, TAK-063 suppressed the development of clasping behavior and motor dysfunctions, including decreased motor activity in the open field, but did not improve the impairment inmotor coordination on the rotarod. Regarding cognitive functions, TAK-063 improved deficits in procedural learning, but was ineffective for deficits in contextual memory. These results suggest that TAK-063 reduces striatal neurodegeneration and ameliorates behavioral deficits in R6/2 mice. © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.},

abstract={Flavonoids have been demonstrated to possess an anti-depressant effect and less adverse effects than tricyclic anti-depressants. For this reason, flavonoids in natural products have attracted growing attention. Rutin is a glycoside flavonoid which belongs to an important class of flavonoids, abundantly found in plants, such as buckwheat seeds, asparagus, red pepper, apples, citrus fruits and leaves of many herbs such as rosemary, dandelion or sage, and black and green tea. It is a vital nutritional component of food stuff. This study aimed at investigating the antidepressant potential of the rutin supplement on Swiss albino mice. For assessment of antidepressant activity, Open Space Forced Swim Test (OSFST), Tail Suspension Test (TST), Open-Field Test (OFT) and Novel Object Recognition Test (NORT) were used. Twenty-five Swiss albino mice were used for the study and divided into five groups. Group I received 10 mg/kg distilled water, group II received fluoxetine 20 mg/kg while group III, IV and V received rutin (30 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg and 120 mg/kg respectively) for sixteen days. The administration of the rutin supplement for sixteen days produced a reduction of immobility time in the TST (at 30 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg and 120 mg/kg), p < 0.05. Likewise, a statistically significant difference was observed in line crossing in OFT, p < 0.05. However, no significant effect was observed in percentage novel object preference in NORT. This study revealed that oral administration of rutin has an antidepressant potential in a dose dependent manner in OSFST mouse model of depression. © Physiological Society of Nigeria.},

abstract={The primary goal of advancement in clinical services is to provide a health care system that enhances an individual's quality of life. Incidence of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and associated dementia coupled with the advancing age of the population, have led to an increase in the worldwide challenge to the healthcare system. In order to overcome these challenges, prior knowledge of common, reliable risk factors and their effectors is essential. Oral health constitutes one such relatively unexplored but indispensable risk factor for aforementioned co-morbidities, in the form of poor oral hygiene and tooth loss during aging. Behavioral traits such as low education, smoking, poor diet, neglect of oral health, lack of exercise, and hypertension are few of the risk factors that are shared commonly among these conditions. In addition, common genetic susceptibility traits such as the apolipoprotein E gene, together with an individual's lifestyle can also influence the development of co-morbidities such as periodontitis, atherosclerosis/stroke, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. This review specifically addresses the susceptibility of apolipoprotein E gene allele 4 as the plausible commonality for the etiology of co-morbidities that eventually result from periodontal diseases and ultimately progress to dementia. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.

abstract={Background Methylmercury (MeHg) is a known developmental neurotoxicant present in fish, yet the impact of childhood exposure is uncertain, especially in children with poor nutrition. Objectives To evaluate associations of MeHg exposure with cognitive abilities and behavior in children from a poor rural area in Bangladesh. Methods The MeHg exposure was assessed in 1434 ten-year-old children by measuring mercury concentrations in hair (hair-Hg), using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Cognitive abilities were assessed with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (4th edition), and behavior by the parent-report Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Results Children's median hair-Hg was 674 μg/kg (range 70–17,561 μg/kg). Concentrations did not differ by distance from scalp, indicating a similar exposure over time. No multivariable-adjusted associations were observed between the children's hair-Hg and their cognitive abilities. However, children in the highest tertile of hair-Hg had a lower prevalence of hyperactivity (OR0.61, 95% CI0.45–0.83) and peer relationship problems (OR0.58, 95% CI0.44–0.76), compared to children in the lowest tertile. The corresponding ORs were slightly stronger in children from families with lower socioeconomic status (OR0.56, 95% CI0.34–0.90 and OR0.48, 95% CI0.30–0.74) than in children from families with higher socioeconomic status (OR0.73, 95% CI0.49–1.08 and OR0.72, 95% CI0.51–1.02). Similar stronger ORs were observed in underweight children. Conclusion MeHg exposure was not associated with cognitive function, but inversely associated with certain adverse behavior. More studies are needed concerning the risk-benefit of different fish consumption in rural Bangladesh. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Paternal care is less common than maternal care because male fitness usually depends on the number of mating opportunities with distinct females. Yet, males also invest in parental care when offspring survival depends on paternal contribution for protection and/or brood nutrition and mating opportunities with new females are scarce. Although the second condition is common in spiders, male contribution to the survival of spiderlings is very rare. However, males of Manogea porracea build their webs above female webs, where they capture prey throughout the reproductive period. In addition, both sexes may have contact with eggsacs and attack predators that approach them. This unusual extended period of co-occurrence between males and their offspring may favour the establishment of paternal care. Here, we investigated (1) the mortality factors influencing offspring survival, (2) how the presence of parents affects offspring survival, (3) how males affect web integrity and protect eggs against predation and (4) variations in operational sex ratio (OSR) during the reproductive season, along with the proportion of eggsacs in webs occupied by males alone before the dispersal of spiderlings. We found that (1) four kleptoparasitic/araneophagic spider species invaded webs and attacked eggsacs, (2) parental care significantly improved offspring survival, (3) males maintained web integrity and protected offspring against the attacks of two araneophagic species and (4) the OSR became quickly biased towards males, and that these remaining males assumed exclusive care of 68% of the eggsacs produced during the season. The ability of males to protect the offspring and the reduced availability of receptive females at the end of the reproductive season might represent the possible causes of male care in M. porracea. We propose that web building by males and their rapid access to the eggsacs create unique conditions that may favour the evolution of paternal care in Cyrtophorinae. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Objectives: This study aimed to determine regional differences and the factors that affect unmet medical needs. Methods: Data from the 6th Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2015) were used, and 4,946 health survey participants who provided responses on medical utilization and health behavior were included in the study. Results: A statistically significant difference was observed in the incidence rate of unmet medical needs in terms of region. The independent variables that affected unmet medical needs were sex, age, education, region, household income, insurance type, smoking status, self-reported health status, and stress awareness. Gender (female), lower education level, rural residents, lowest household income, poor self-reported health status, and stress awareness increased the probability of unmet medical needs. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that different policies and approaches should be considered for each population that is at risk to address the primary cause of the unmet medical needs. Further studies that include medical expenses and the relevant variables of an area should be conducted in the future. © 2017 Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.},

We measured foraging aggressiveness as the number of prey killed per 2-hour period. Boldness/shyness was assessed as a latency of initiating exploration in a novel environment. We found the presence of the behavioral syndrome in P. albidus, as bold individuals were also more aggressive than were shy individuals. The syndrome was consistent through time within the population but not consistent for individuals.

abstract={Obesity is a major health concern in modern societies. Although decreased physical activity and enhanced intake of high-caloric foods are important risk factors for developing obesity, human behavior during eating also plays a role. Previous studies have shown that distraction while eating increases food intake and leads to impaired processing of food stimuli. As olfaction is the most important sense involved in flavor perception, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques to investigate the influence of cognitive memory load on olfactory perception and processing. Low- and high-caloric food odors were presented in combination with either low or high cognitive loads utilizing a memory task. The efficacy of the memory task was verified by a decrease in participant recall accuracy and an increase in skin conductance response during high cognitive load. Our behavioral data reveal a diminished perceived intensity for low- but not highcaloric food odors during high cognitive load. For low-caloric food odors, bilateral orbitofrontal (OFC) and piriform cortices (pirC) showed significantly lower activity during high compared with low cognitive load. For high-caloric food odors, a similar effect was established in pirC, but not in OFC. Insula activity correlates with higher intensity ratings found during the low cognitive load condition. We conclude lower activity in pirC and OFC to be responsible for diminished intensity perception, comparable to results in olfactory impaired patients and elderly. Further studies should investigate the influence of olfactory/gustatory intensities on food choices under distraction with special regards to low-caloric food. © The Author 2017.

abstract={Young adults in Western countries are gaining weight faster than their parents and are more likely to gain weight than any other age cohort. Despite this, investigation into the complex young adults' food choice motives, which enable and prevent healthy eating, has not been widely investigated. A scoping review was conducted involving an extensive literature search of four major electronic databases: Medline, Embase, PsychInfo and CINAHL. Data were collected from 34 articles: study descriptions numerically analysed and key findings thematically analysed. The key barriers found included: male apathy towards diet; unhealthy diet of friends and family; expected consumption of unhealthy foods in certain situations; relative low cost of unhealthy foods; lack of time to plan, shop, prepare and cook healthy foods; lack of facilities to prepare, cook and store healthy foods; widespread presence of unhealthy foods; lack of knowledge and skills to plan, shop, prepare and cook healthy foods; lack of motivation to eat healthily (including risk-taking behaviour). The key enablers found included: female interest in a healthy diet; healthy diet of friends and family; support/encouragement of friends and family to eat healthy; desire for improved health; desire for weight management; desire for improved self-esteem; desire for attractiveness to potential partners and others; possessing autonomous motivation to eat healthy and existence and use of self-regulatory skills. This research provides evidence that can be used to tailor interventions for healthy eating and overweight and obesity in this population. However, government intervention in addressing food access, affordability, marketing and taxation remains essential to any significant change. © 2016 World Obesity Federation},

abstract={Synopsis Seasonality creates a template for many natural processes and evolutionary adaptations. Organisms are often faced with an annual cycle consisting of a productive (favorable) and unproductive period. This yearly cycle along with other seasonal variations in abiotic factors and associated biotic interactions form strong selection pressures shaping the scheduling of annual activities and the developmental stages and modes of life through the year. Annual decisions impact trade-offs that involve both current and future reproductive value (RV), and life history theory provides the foundation to understand these linkages between phenology and an organism’s full life. Annual routine models further allow for multiple annual decisions to be optimized and predicted with respect to lifetime consequences. Studies of life history adaptations to seasonality are concerned with questions such as: within the productive season, should growth come first, followed by reproduction, or the other way around? What is the best time to diapause or migrate, and how will this timing impact other life history traits? Should energy reserves be built, to transfer resources from 1 year to the next, and allow for the spatial and temporal freedom of capital breeding? If offspring value is low during parts of the productive season, what is then the best alternative to reproduction: accumulate stores, grow, or wait in safety? To help answer these and other questions, I provide an overview of key theoretical concepts and some of the main life schedules, annual routines, and trade-offs involved. Adaptations to the unproductive period include diapause (dormancy), embryonic resting stages (eggs, seeds), energy reserves, and seasonal migrations. Adaptations to the productive window include rapid growth, high reproductive effort, capital breeding, and reproduction entrained to the annual cycle and with precise timing. Distinct annual routines, large body size, energy storage capacities, and parental care are also adaptations to seasonality. Phenotypic plasticity and state-dependence are important parts of these traits and are adaptations in their own. I give particular attention to timing of breeding and the associated birth-time dependent contributions to fitness. Seasonality in offspring value impacts the scheduling of growth, storage, and reproduction and may create parent–offspring conflicts over breeding timing. A combined offspring and parent value perspective should be adopted more broadly, also because of the management implications. I further argue for strategic but careful use of latitudinal (and altitudinal) gradients, and more attention to the role of seasonally varying predation risk as a selective force. © The Author 2017.},

Evolutionarily, as a facilitator it might contribute to phenotypic novelty and diversification.

Here, we summarize recent work on the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, which exhibits afeeding plasticity allowing predatory or bacteriovorous feeding. We show feeding plasticity to be controlled by developmental switch genes that are themselves under epigenetic control.

abstract={Substantial variation in adult body size between human populations is widely assumed in part to represent adaptation to local ecological conditions. Developmental plasticity contributes to such variability; however, there is debate regarding how this early-life process can produce adaptation when environments change within the life span. We developed a simple mathematical simulation model, testing how human fetuses could tailor their growth to ecological conditions without being oversensitive and hence prone to extremes of growth. Data on Indian rainfall (1871-2004) were used as an index of ecological conditions. The simulation model allowed the comparison of different strategies for processing these time-series data regarding (a) the toleration of short-term ecological variability and (b) the prediction of conditions in adulthood. We showed that ecological information processing is favored in environments prone to long-term ecological trends. Once this strategy is adopted, resistance to shortterm ecological perturbations can be achieved either by lengthening the duration of developmental plasticity or by accumulating multigenerational influences. A multigenerational strategy successfully dampens the transmission of the effects of ecological shocks to future generations, but it does not predict or enable offspring to respond to longer-term conditions. However, this strategy does allow fetal growth to be tailored to the likely supply of nutrition from the mother in the period after birth, during when extrinsic mortality risk is high. Our model has implications for public health policies aimed at addressing chronic malnutrition. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2017.},

abstract={Glucose is considered the primary energy source for all cells, and some cancers are addicted to glucose. Here, we investigated the functional consequences of chronic glucose deprivation in serous ovarian cancer cells. We found that cells resistant to glucose starvation (glucose-restricted cells) demonstrated increased metabolic plasticity that was dependent on NNMT (Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase) expression. We further show that ZEB1 induced NNMT, rendered cells resistant to glucose deprivation and recapitulated metabolic adaptations and mesenchymal gene expression observed in glucose-restricted cells. NNMT depletion reversed metabolic plasticity in glucoserestricted cells and prevented de novo formation of glucose-restricted colonies. In addition to its role in glucose independence, we found that NNMT was required for other ZEB1-induced phenotypes, such as increased migration. NNMT protein levels were also elevated in metastatic and recurrent tumors compared to matched primary carcinomas, while normal ovary and fallopian tube tissue had no detectable NNMT expression. Our studies define a novel ZEB1/NNMT signaling axis, which elicits mesenchymal gene expression, as well as phenotypic and metabolic plasticity in ovarian cancer cells upon chronic glucose starvation. Understanding the causes of cancer cell plasticity is crucial for the development of therapeutic strategies to counter intratumoral heterogeneity, acquired drug resistance and recurrence in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC).},

abstract={Patterns of fetal growth predict non-communicable disease risk in adult life, but fetal growth variability appears to have a relatively weak association with maternal nutritional dynamics during pregnancy. This challenges the interpretation of fetal growth variability as 'adaptation'. We hypothesized that associations of maternal size and nutritional status with neonatal size are mediated by the dimensions of the maternal pelvis. We analysed data on maternal height, body mass index (BMI) and pelvic dimensions (conjugate, inter-spinous and inter-cristal diameters) and neonatal gestational age, weight, length, thorax girth and head girth (n = 224). Multiple regression analysis was used to identify independent maternal predictors of neonatal size, and the mediating role of neonatal head girth in these associations. Pelvic dimensions displaced maternal BMI as a predictor of birth weight, explaining 11.6% of the variance. Maternal conjugate and inter-spinous diameters predicted neonatal length, thorax girth and head girth, whereas inter-cristal diameter only predicted neonatal length. Associations of pelvic dimensions with birth length, but not birth weight, were mediated by neonatal head girth. Pelvic dimensions predicted neonatal size better than maternal BMI, and these associations were mostly independent of maternal height. Sensitivity of fetal growth to pelvic dimensions reduces the risk of cephalo-pelvic disproportion, potentially a strong selective pressure during secular trends in height. Selection on fetal adaptation to relatively inflexible components of maternal phenotype, rather than directly to external ecological conditions, may help explain high levels of growth plasticity during late fetal life and early infancy. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Purpose: The number of researches that evaluate how behavioural and personality issues affect consumers’ acceptance and perception of food is increasing. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of nutritional information and health claims related to soya and cashew nut beverages over consumers’ acceptance and perception regarding nutritional value and healthiness and to verify whether behavioural and personality issues affect such evaluation. Design/methodology/approach: The samples were evaluated in two phases, with (blind phase) and without information (informed phase) about their composition, nutritional characteristics and functional claims related to some of their ingredients. The sensory evaluation data were analysed by means of the analysis of variance for repeated measures, applying 2 (information) × 2 (beverage) and generalised linear model to evaluate the effect of information over the acceptance averages, as well as over the perception of healthy food and nutritional value. Findings: Information on composition, nutritional characteristics and functional claims related to the cashew nut and soya beverages did not influence flavour acceptance (p-value = 0.250) and overall impression (p-value = 0.316), but had a positive impact on consumers’ perception regarding healthiness (p-value < 0.001) and nutritious value (p-value < 0.001) of both beverages, the cashew nut beverage being perceived as more nutritious and healthier than the soya beverage. Consumers’ different characteristics with respect to their interest in healthy eating (high and low) and food neophobia (neophiliacs and neophobics) did not have any influence on the beverages’ acceptance, as well as on the perception of healthy food and nutritious value. Originality/value: This work compares consumers’ acceptance and perception regarding nutritional value and healthiness with relation a totally unique product in the Brazilian market, and in the world, a new functional beverage made from cashew nuts, with a soya-milk beverage. Until this moment, there are no studies comparing consumer acceptance and perception of products based on hydrosoluble extract-base added with fruit juice which evaluate the influence of behavioural and personality characteristics of consumers in their perception and acceptance towards these products. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Guided by a bridging model of pathways leading to low-income boys’ early starting and persistent trajectories of antisocial behavior, the current article reviews evidence supporting the model from early childhood through early adulthood. Using primarily a cohort of 310 low-income boys of families recruited from Women, Infants, and Children Nutrition Supplement centers in a large metropolitan area followed from infancy to early adulthood and a smaller cohort of boys and girls followed through early childhood, we provide evidence supporting the critical role of parenting, maternal depression, and other proximal family risk factors in early childhood that are prospectively linked to trajectories of parent-reported conduct problems in early and middle childhood, youth-reported antisocial behavior during adolescence and early adulthood, and court-reported violent offending in adolescence. The findings are discussed in terms of the need to identify at-risk boys in early childhood and methods and platforms for engaging families in healthcare settings not previously used to implement preventive mental health services. © 2016 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health},

abstract={Background: Second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are associated with metabolic disturbances. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a rare, but potentially fatal sign of acute glucose metabolism dysregulation linked to the use of SGAs. The aims of this article are to present patients with a history of psychotic disorders and of severe metabolic diabetic ketoacidosis, possibly associated with the use of antipsychotics, and to review the current literature on the topic of antipsychotic-induced DKA. Method: PubMed/Medline and EBSCO databases were searched using the keywords: diabetic ketoacidosis, antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics, second generation antipsychotics, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole, paliperidone, amisulpride and haloperidol. Case reports, case series and reviews of case series were included in the review. Results: The majority of patients who developed DKA following treatment with antipsychotics were treated with olanzapine and clozapine in monotherapy or in combination with other antipsychotics. DKA mostly occurred in the first six months of antipsychotic treatment. Other risk factors included insulin resistance prior to antipsychotic treatment, male gender and middle age. Conclusion: Clinicians should consider the risk of DKA when starting treatment with SGAs. Preventive measures for patients with psychotic disorders using antipsychotics should include regular assessment of risk factors and screening for diabetes before and after administering antipsychotics, especially in the first months of treatment. Whenever possible, polypharmacy should be avoided. © Medicinska naklada - Zagreb, Croatia.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how French senior consumers deal with duality between perceived risk and perceived value associated with functional foods (FFs) and to analyze whether the risk-value trade-off may help to derive different consumer profiles. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 220 senior consumers (50-70). A two-step clustering analysis was carried out on factor scores of perceived value and perceived risk. Discriminant analysis was then employed to verify the classification reliability, and analysis of variance was performed to profile the clusters on the basis of additional variables. Findings: Four distinctive profiles of FF senior consumers were identified. Significant differences were found to be attributed to personality traits. Interestingly, the “Trustful enthusiasts” and the “Ambivalents” consumers do not differ in their repurchase intention, despite a significant discrepancy in risk perception. Practical implications: The study is an opportunity to offer a segmentation of this attractive growing target of health-enhancing products. The typology can help the practitioners to find out a new valuable scope of messages to better communicate to elderly market. Originality/value: The research seeks to contribute to the existing knowledge on seniors’ nutrition-related behavior, by proposing a segmentation still lacking in research works. Since FF perceived value appears to be multidimensional and not only utilitarian, the study provides a new insight into the experiential approach of health-enhancing eating. Also, it shows how the differences between FF consumers could be attributed to certain personal variables. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Introduction: The clinical evidence shows that the onset of eating disorders is increasing in the prepubescent phase or even in childhood. Already starting from the prepubescence the certainties related to the body start to unwind and the individual is encouraged to build new ones, based both on the anatomic transformation of his/her own body and on the social expectation according to the identity. The onset of a Eating Disorders is normally between 13 and 25 years, but in the last years we recorded a lowering in the onset threshold to an age between 11 and 13 years, with some earlier cases at 7 years (Franzoni et al. 2012). Many theories consider body dissatisfaction as the immediate antecedent to the development of this eating disorder. Different studies have confirmed that a strong concern for physical appearance could sometimes precede an eating disorder (Cuzzolaro 2004). The alteration of the body image is the major predictive factor for the relapse, the patients themselves refer that it is one of the major obstacles for the realization of a lasting recovering. In the following study one hundred kids between 10 and 15 years old, without any Eating Disorders diagnosis, have been tested to evaluate whether if already from this age there is a concern about body image starting at this age, the fear of gaining weight and the desire to be slimmer. It is known, indeed, that these factors, if significantly present in a subject, can turn into predictive factors of a psychopathology. We need to build our body image over time; changing our percertion of reality can change also what we see, in particular the body image we strive for changes (Bianchini 2008). Method: 100 teenagers split in 53 females and 47 males aged between 10 and 14 years, randomly picked in the secondary school. Results: The results of the study show that in the age between 10 and 15 years the concern for the body shape is already present, without difference between the genders. Although 45% of the sample is underweight, the Figure Raiting Scale test both males and females want to be of lesser weight. 91 subjects reached a BSQ test score of over 34, so most of the sample has a strong concern for their physical appearance. The results obtained by administering the BUT test also highlighted concern about the body with moderate gravity. Discussion: Body dissatisfaction, as so many studies have confirmed, can be considered a precursor of psychopathology. Concerns concern both female gender and male gender. It is also necessary to pay close attention to the pressure exerted by family members, friends and the media towards a difficult to reach thinness ideal. That is why we need to focus on strengthening protective factors in adolescents with prevention and awareness campaigns which are properly targeted. Conclusion: The work resulted a useful reflection on the building of the body image as an early risk factor for the onset of pathologies linked to this concept. We need to commit to an educative practice of support for adolescent, recognition and sharing, which does not avoid the presence of the adults, but in fact it is enriched. It would be appreciated if we could introduce in the school, in the program of different subjects, the discussion regarding different aspects of a healthy nutrition and the formation of a solid self-esteem in order, for the students, to have a critical interpretation of the media message on food, body and beauty. It is desirable to promote the emancipation of the adolescents from a condition of dependence to discover their own place in the world. The educative action can help developing the research of the meaning of the own personality. © 2017 Medicinska naklada - Zagreb, Croatia.},
