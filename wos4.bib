Abstract = {{When sexual cannibalism presents a sexual conflict, one expects to find
   male traits that reduce the risk of cannibalism. In sexually
   cannibalistic species, selection is thought to have favored the
   evolution of male approach behaviors that reduce the probability that
   the female will kill the male. We tested the hypothesis that male
   mantids change their approach behavior in response to wind to reduce the
   risk of being noticed by females. Time between detection of the female
   by the male and mating was shorter under windy than windless conditions.
   Sexual approach behavior was observed more frequently under windy than
   windless conditions. Moreover, this behavior was observed more
   frequently when the female was walking than when the female was not
   walking under windy conditions. The detection rate of male mantids by
   females was significantly lower on swaying leaves than on fixed leaves.
   Our results thus indicate that male mantids were more active in response
   to wind. Therefore, we suggest that the male's quick approach strategy
   toward females when the wind is blowing at short range is adaptive in
   reducing the risk of detection by females.}},

Abstract = {{Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been shown to cause adverse
   effects on a number of biomarkers of health in birds. POPs may impair
   immune function and alter the stress response, defined as a suite of
   behavioral and physiological responses to environmental perturbations.
   Recent studies have also proposed that POPs can induce oxidative stress.
   Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies simultaneously assessing the
   potential damaging effects of POPs on the latter biomarkers. In this
   study, we examined the contribution of legacy (organochlorines; (OCs))
   and emerging (flame retardants; PBDEs) POPs to individual variations in
   stress levels (feather corticosterone), humoral immunity (plasma
   immunoglobulin Y levels) and oxidative stress occurring in three
   breeding colonies of a top predator seabird, the Great skua
   (Stercorarius skua), distributed from temperate regions to the high
   Arctic: Shetland (60 degrees N), Iceland (63 degrees N) and Bjernoya (74
   degrees N). Our results demonstrated that plasma concentrations of OCs
   in Great skuas from Bjornoya are among the highest in North Atlantic
   seabirds, with up to 7900 mu g/kg (ww) Sigma Cs. Yet, a latitudinal
   gradient in POP levels was observed with all compounds being
   significantly higher in Bjornoya than in Iceland and Shetland (on
   average 4-7 fold higher for OCs and 2.5-4.5 for PBDEs, respectively).
   Contrary to our predictions, skuas breeding at the least contaminated
   site (i.e., Shetland) experienced the poorest physiological condition;
   i.e., the highest levels of stress hormones (25\% higher) and oxidative
   stress (50\% higher) and the lowest immunoglobulin levels (15\% lower)
   compared to the two other colonies. Finally, our results failed to point
   out consistent within-colony relationships between biomarkers of health
   and POPs. Overall, it is suggested that other ecological factors such as
   food availability could constrain physiological indicators more than
   anthropogenic contaminants.(c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Adolescent offspring of females exposed during pregnancy to 0.06 mg/ml
   nicotine solution as the only source of water and of a group of pair-fed
   females, used as a control for anorexic effects of nicotine, were
   evaluated in a battery of tests, including locomotor activity, the

   consumption, the five-choice serial reaction time test (5-CSRTT) and a
   delay-discounting test. All tests were conducted between postnatal day
   (PND) 25 and PND 50.
   Nicotine-exposed animals expressed hyperactivity, increased number of
   open arms entries in the elevated plus maze and increased numbers of
   anticipatory responses in the 5-CSRTT. Decreased aversion for nicotine
   solution in the free-choice test and decreased numbers of omission
   errors in the 5-CSRTT were observed both in nicotine-exposed and

   effect on impulsive choice in a delay-discounting test.
   Our study confirms deleterious effects of prenatal nicotine exposure on
   important aspects of behaviour and inhibitory control in adolescent rats

Abstract = {{Predation may drive differential selection among personality types, but
   the mechanism linking personality with predation risk is poorly
   understood. One such mechanism may be provided by stress hormones
   (corticosterone in birds), which are linked to boldness towards
   predators. However, because of feedbacks between boldness and future
   fitness expectations, the relationship between boldness and stress
   physiology may be modulated by individual quality. We investigated
   flight initiation distances (FIDs) of incubating eider, Somateria
   mollissima, females in relation to handling-induced corticosterone
   concentrations and individual quality (female breeding experience, body
   condition). We investigated whether FIDs were repeatable, and whether
   stress responsiveness and individual quality attributes, either
   independently or interactively, affected FIDs. We also analysed whether
   incubation duration, a period of peak predation pressure on females,
   would depend on female boldness towards predators (FID), controlling for
   individual quality. FIDs were repeatable within and between seasons, and
   females with higher handling-induced corticosterone concentrations
   generally had longer FIDs. However, this relationship was modulated by
   interactions between stress responsiveness and individual quality. High
   stress responsiveness was associated with longer FIDs in younger
   females, while the opposite was found for the oldest females.
   Furthermore, the FIDs of females in good body condition increased less
   strongly with increasing stress-induced circulating corticosterone. Shy
   females (long FIDs) and those in poor body condition had shorter
   incubation periods. Boldness is thus linked to stress responsiveness,
   helping to explain why stress responses may be correlated with survival.
   However, physiological stress effects on boldness cannot be understood
   in isolation from effects of individual quality. (C) 2012 The

Abstract = {{Divergent diet menus could cause sympatric divergence of risk

   species of tits (family Paridae): varied tits, Poecile varius, marsh
   tits, Poecile palustris, and great tits, Parus major, which form
   mixed-species foraging flocks in Japan. Binary choice tests, offering
   rewards of differing amount and probability, were conducted in the

Abstract = {{The escape of fish from aquaculture is a persistent economic problem for
   farmers as well as an environmental problem that threatens wild fish
   population as a consequence of potential negative ecological and genetic
   interactions. Farmed Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) cause significant
   damage by biting the net and creating holes through which they escape.
   We determined the role of food, cage enrichment, net damage, and
   individual temperament on net biting behavior. During four separate
   trials, net interactions by fish were observed in relation to
   combinations of the above treatments. Fish with no access to food and in
   plain (not enriched) cages interacted the most with the net wall, with
   7.5 and 12.6 more interactions per h, respectively, than fish with food
   that were in enriched cages (food P = 0.01; enrichment P < 0.01). Of the
   stimulating objects used to enrich cages, 97\% of interactions were with
   the tubes that provided refuge (P < 0.01). Cod were attracted to damaged
   areas of net, interacting 0.12 more times per h than at undamaged areas
   (P < 0.01). Individuals showed consistent behavior over time, but there
   was no relationship between temperament and net interactions (P = 0.17).
   The results indicate that appropriate feeding levels and cage enrichment

Abstract = {{Considerable epidemiological, experimental and clinical data have

   relative hypoor hyperleptinemia during this window of development will
   induce some of the metabolic adaptations which underlie developmental

Abstract = {{Food is important to any animal, and a large part of the behavioral
   repertoire is concerned with ensuring adequate nutrition. Two main
   nutritional sensations, hunger and satiety, produce opposite behaviors.
   Hungry animals seek food, increase exploratory behavior and continue
   feeding once they encounter food. Satiated animals decrease exploratory
   behavior, take rest, and stop feeding. The signals of hunger or satiety
   and their effects on physiology and behavior will depend not only on the
   animal's current nutritional status, but also on its experience and the
   environment in which the animal evolved. In our novel, nutritionally
   rich environment, improper control of appetite contributes to diseases
   from anorexia to the current epidemic of obesity. Despite extraordinary
   recent advances, genetic contribution to appetite control is still
   poorly understood partly due to lack of simple genetic model systems. In
   this review, we will discuss current understanding of molecular and
   cellular mechanisms by which animals regulate food intake depending on
   their nutritional status. Then, focusing on relatively less known
   muscarinic and cGMP signals, we will discuss how the molecular and

Abstract = {{Adult neurogenesis has been implicated in affective disorders and the
   action of antidepressants (ADs) although the functional significance of
   this association is still unclear. The use of animal models closely
   mimicking human comorbid affective and anxiety disorders seen in the
   majority of patients should provide relevant novel information. Here, we
   used a unique genetic mouse model displaying higher trait anxiety (HAB)
   and comorbid depression-like behavior. We demonstrate that HABs have a
   lower rate of hippocampal neurogenesis and impaired functional
   integration of newly born neurons as compared with their normal
   anxiety/depression-like behavior (NAB) controls. In HABs, chronic
   treatment with the AD fluoxetine alleviated their higher depression-like
   behavior and protected them from relapse for 3 but not 7 weeks after
   discontinuation of the treatment without affecting neurogenesis. Similar
   to what has been observed in depressed patients, fluoxetine treatment
   induced anxiogenic-like effects during the early treatment phase in NABs
   along with a reduction in neurogenesis. On the other hand, treatment
   with AD drugs with a particularly strong anxiolytic component, namely
   the neurokinin-1-receptorant-agonist L-822 429 or tianeptine, increased
   the reduced rate of neurogenesis in HABs up to NAB levels. In addition,
   challenge-induced hypoactivation of dentate gyrus (DG) neurons in HABs
   was normalized by all three drugs. Overall, these data suggest that
   AD-like effects in a psychopathological mouse model are commonly
   associated with modulation of DG hypoactivity but not neurogenesis,
   suggesting normalization of hippocampal hypoactivity as a
   neurobiological marker indicating successful remission. Finally, rather
   than to higher depression-related behavior, neurogenesis seems to be
   linked to pathological anxiety. Translational Psychiatry (2012) 2, e171;

Abstract = {{Introduction: The impact of health behaviors on the leading causes of
   death across the USA has been well demonstrated. However, limited focus
   has been placed on the leading health risk behaviors of rural
   Federally-Qualified Health Center (FQHC) patients, a particularly
   underserved group. The current study was undertaken to examine the most
   common risk-taking behaviors of rural FQHC patients and to examine if
   risk-taking behaviors vary between insured and uninsured patients.
   Methods: A convenience sample of 199 patients was recruited at an FQHC
   in the rural US South. Participants completed a battery of demographic
   and health risk behavior assessments.
   Results: The most common risk behaviors were eating fried foods, not
   eating five servings of vegetables per day, not eating three servings of
   fruit per day, drinking caloric beverages, not exercising regularly, not
   wearing a seatbelt, having sex without a condom and smoking. Uninsured
   patients were more likely to talk on their cell phones while driving
   (p<0.001), more likely to text while driving (p=0.007), more likely to
   have unprotected sex (p=0.004), more likely to drink alcohol (p=0.043)
   and more likely to not seek medical care when needed (p=0.005).
   Conclusions: Rural FQHC patients demonstrated high levels of behavioral
   and health risk-taking, including dietary-, exercise- and
   traffic-related risks, in a context where traditional prevention methods
   have failed to penetrate. Differences exist between insured and
   uninsured patients, indicating that the reasons behind behavioral
   risk-taking may be context-specific and need to be explored further to
   help identify intervention targets that are culturally and situationally
   appropriate for diverse rural groups.}},

Abstract = {{Physiological and nutritional state can modify sensory ability and
   perception through hormone signaling. Obesity and related metabolic
   disorders present a chronic imbalance in hormonal signaling that could
   impact sensory systems. In the olfactory system, external chemical cues
   are transduced into electrical signals to encode information. It is
   becoming evident that this system can also detect internal chemical cues
   in the form of molecules of energy homeostasis and endocrine hormones,
   whereby neurons of the olfactory system are modulated to change animal
   behavior towards olfactory cues. We hypothesized that chronic imbalance
   in hormonal signaling and energy homeostasis due to obesity would
   thereby disrupt olfactory behaviors in mice. To test this idea, we
   utilized three mouse models of varying body weight, metabolic hormones,
   and visceral adiposity - 1) C57BL6/J mice maintained on a condensed-milk
   based, moderately high-fat diet (MHF) of 32\% fat for 6 months as the
   diet-induced obesity model, 2) an obesity-resistant, lean line of mice
   due to a gene-targeted deletion of a voltage-dependent potassium channel
   (Kv1.3-null), and 3) a genetic model of obesity as a result of a
   gene-targeted deletion of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R-null).
   Diet-induced obese (DIO) mice failed to find a fatty-scented hidden
   peanut butter cracker, based solely on olfactory cues, any faster than
   an unscented hidden marble, initially suggesting general anosmia.
   However, when these DIO mice were challenged to find a sweet-scented
   hidden chocolate candy, they had no difficulty. Furthermore, DIO mice
   were able to discriminate between fatty acids that differ by a single
   double bond and are components of the MHF diet (linoleic and oleic acid)
   in a habituation-dishabituation paradigm. Obesity-resistant, Kv1.3-null
   mice exhibited no change in scented object retrieval when placed on the
   MHF-diet, nor did they perform differently than wild-type mice in
   parallel habituation-dishabituation paradigms of fatty food-related odor
   components. Genetically obese, MC4R-null mice successfully found hidden
   scented objects, but did so more slowly than lean, wild-type mice, in an
   object-dependent fashion. In habituation-dishabituation trials of
   general odorants, MC4R-null mice failed to discriminate a novel odor,
   but were able to distinguish two fatty acids. Object memory recognition
   tests for short- and long-term memory retention demonstrated that
   maintenance on the MHF diet did not modify the ability to perform these
   tasks independent of whether mice became obese or were resistant to
   weight gain (Kv1.3-null), however, the genetically predisposed obese
   mice (MC4R-null) failed the long-term object memory recognition
   performed at 24 h. These results demonstrate that even though both the
   DIO mice and genetically predisposed obese mice are obese, they vary in
   the degree to which they exhibit behavioral deficits in odor detection,
   odor discrimination, and long-term memory. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc: All

   with rover and sitter allelic variants of foraging (for) to affect adult
   exploratory behavior, a phenotype that is critical for foraging, and
   reproductive fitness. Chronic nutritional adversity during adulthood did
   not affect rover or sitter adult exploratory behavior; however, early
   nutritional adversity in the larval period increased sitter but not
   rover adult exploratory behavior. Increasing for gene expression in the
   mushroom bodies, an important center of integration in the fly brain,
   changed the amount of exploratory behavior exhibited by sitter adults
   when they did not experience early nutritional adversity but had no
   effect in sitters that experienced early nutritional adversity.
   Manipulation of the larval nutritional environment also affected adult
   reproductive output of sitters but not rovers, indicating GEIs on
   fitness itself. The natural for variants are an excellent model to
   examine how GEIs underlie the biological embedding of early experience.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral flexibility that requires behavioral inhibition has important
   fitness consequences. One task commonly used to assess behavioral
   inhibition is the reverse-reward task in which the subject is rewarded
   by the non selected items. Lemurs were tested for their ability to solve
   the qualitative version of the reverse-reward task with the choice
   between identical quantities of different food items instead of
   different quantities of the same food. Two of four subjects mastered the
   task without a correction procedure and were able to generalize the
   acquired rule to novel combinations of food. One of the two subjects
   competent on the quality version of the task could transfer this ability
   to different quantities of the same food. Our results are compared to
   lemurs' performances when tested under the quantitative version in a
   previous study and those of capuchin monkeys tested under a similar
   paradigm. The whole results suggest that the qualitative version of the
   reverse-reward task may be easier to master than its quantitative
   counterpart and that lemurs perform better than capuchin monkeys as they
   were able to later transfer the learning rule to the quantitative

Abstract = {{Taxonomic investigations of the Delias mysis (Fabricius, 1775) complex
   from northern Australia indicate two additional species in the
   Australian fauna: Delias aestiva Butler, 1897 stat. rev. and Delias lara
   (Boisduval, 1836). The latter species, which is illustrated from
   Australia for the first time, was until recently known under the name
   Delias mysis onca Fruhstorfer, 1910. Evidence from adult morphology
   (male genitalia), colour pattern of the adult and immature stages,
   behaviour, and ecology indicates substantial phenotypic divergence
   between D.?aestiva and D.?mysis. Within Australian limits, all three
   taxa are allopatric: D aestiva is endemic to the Top End, Northen
   Territory, D.?mysis mysis is restricted to northern and north-eastern
   Queensland, whereas Delias?lara lara is known only from three specimens
   from the Torres Strait islands, Queensland. Delias aestiva is perhaps
   the most remarkable member of the complex and indeed the genus, breeding
   in tropical mangrove habitats in coastal estuarine areas where the
   larvae specialize on mature foliage of the tree Excoecaria ovalis Endl.
   (Euphorbiaceae). This host preference is novel given the general
   tendency of Delias to feed on hemiparasitic plants in the order
   Santalales (Loranthaceae, Santalaceae and Viscaceae). Under laboratory
   conditions, however, larvae successfully completed development on the
   mistletoe genera Amyema, Dendrophthoe and Decaisnina (all Loranthaceae)
   with no significant reduction in larval survival. These findings,
   together with phylogenetic hypotheses of the Aporiina and Delias,
   indicate a recent evolutionary host shift from Loranthaceae to
   Euphorbiaceae. The foliage of Excoecaria produces toxic latex, which is
   composed of a variety of secondary plant compounds, including
   diterpenoids, triterpenoids, alkaloids and phorbol esters. The mechanism
   of detoxification has not been established, although the larvae of
   D.?aestiva are gregarious, regurgitate fluid as part of their chemical
   defence, and the adults are highly aposematic. Adults are seasonal,
   being chiefly on the wing during the cooler dry season; during the wet
   season, the larval food plant is seasonally deciduous and it is
   suspected that the butterfly undergoes pupal diapause. The cryptically
   coloured green pupa and tendency to pupate singly in concealed
   situations of D.?aestiva are highly unusual traits among Delias and are
   hypothesized to be adaptive responses associated with pupal diapause
   during the wet season. The unique habitat association, novel food plant
   specialization, and restricted distribution of D.?aestiva emphasizess
   the biogeographical peculiarities of northern Australia, especially
   patterns of historical (vicariant) differentiation between the Top End
   and Cape York Peninsula within the Australian Monsoon Tropics. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Elk (Cervus elaphus) are known to shift habitat use in response to
   environmental modifications, including those associated with various
   forms of energy development. The specific behavioral responses
   underlying these trends, however, have not been effectively studied. To
   investigate such effects, we examined elk response to habitat alteration
   near natural gas wells in Las Animas County, Colorado, USA in 2008-2010.
   We created 10 1-ha openings in forests adjacent to 10 operating natural
   gas wells by removing standing timber in 2008, with concomitant
   establishment of 10 1-ha control sites adjacent to the same wells. On
   each site, we estimated elk use, indexed by pellet density, before and
   after timber removal. Concurrently, we measured plant production and
   cover, nutritional quality, species composition and biomass removed by
   elk and other large herbivores. Species richness and diversity,
   graminoid and forb cover, and graminoid and forb biomass increased on
   cut sites following tree removal. Differences were greater in 2010 than
   in 2009, and elk and deer removed more plant biomass in 2010 than 2009.
   Elk use of cut sites was 37 \% lower than control sites in 2009, but 46
   \% higher in 2010. The initially lower use of cut sites may be
   attributable to lack of winter forage on these sites caused by timber
   removal and associated surface modification. The increased use of cut
   sites in 2010 suggested that elk possessed the behavioral capacity, over
   time, to exploit enhanced forage resources in the proximity of habitat
   modifications and human activity associated with maintenance of
   operating natural gas wells.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that the establishment of invasive-fish populations
   depends on the ability of introduced individuals to adapt to
   environmental conditions in the invaded ecosystem, including the ability
   to feed on diverse, locally available prey resources. Furthermore, the
   current invasive-biology paradigm postulates that having a
   generalist-food habit is key to the successful invasion of a novel
   community by exotic species. This study investigated how the invasive
   pike killifish, Belonesox belizanus, has succeeded in establishing
   exotic populations in Florida, USA despite having a feeding apparatus
   that is characteristic of a specialized piscivore (i.e., fish-eating
   fish). Pike killifish collected from their point of introduction in
   south Florida were (1) filmed using high speed video while feeding on
   live fish-and shrimp-prey to determine whether prey type affects
   prey-capture kinematics and then (2) subjected to a prey-selectivity
   experiment to determine which prey type (live fish or shrimp) the
   invasive pike killifish eats when both prey are available in the
   environment. Results indicated that (1) prey-capture kinematics were not
   affected by prey type, indicating that consumption of fish and shrimp
   prey was accomplished using a stereotypical feeding repertoire, and (2)
   pike killifish consumed fish and shrimp when both prey were available in
   the feeding environment. It is concluded that the invasive pike
   killifish has the ability to feed on alternative, locally available prey
   using its piscivorous feeding functional morphology and prey-capture
   kinematics. This study contributes a new perspective to our
   understanding of the mechanisms that underlie success of exotic fishes
   in invaded communities. That is, the ability of a
   functional-morphological specialist to utilize stereotypical
   prey-capture kinematics (= behavior) in consuming alternative, locally
   available prey types (= dietary flexibility) contributes to the
   establishment of invasive populations. It is evident that these
   functional specialists are not constrained in their diet, thus, enabling
   them dietary flexibility and enhancing their invasive potential.}},

Abstract = {{Dropping off is considered an anti-predator behavior for aphids since
   previous studies have shown that it reduces the risk of predation.
   However, little attention is paid to dropping behavior triggered by
   other external stresses such as daytime high temperatures which are
   predicted to become more frequent in the context of climate warming.
   Here we defined a new parameter, drop-off temperature (DOT), to describe
   the critical temperature at which an aphid drops off its host plant when
   the ambient temperature increases gradually and slowly. Detailed studies
   were conducted to reveal effects of short-term acclimation (temperature,
   exposure time at high-temperature and starvation) on DOT of an aphid
   species. Sitobion avenae. Our objectives were to test if the aphids
   dropped off host plant to avoid high temperatures and how short-term
   acclimation affected the aphids' dropping behavior in response to heat
   stress. We suggest that dropping is a behavioral thermoregulation to
   avoid heat stress, since aphids started to move before they dropped off
   and the dropped aphids were still able to control their muscles prior to
   knockdown. The adults starved for 12 h had higher DOT values than those
   that were unstarved or starved for 6 h, and there was a trade-off
   between behavioral thermoregulation and energy acquisition. Higher
   temperatures and longer exposure times at high temperatures
   significantly lowered the aphids' DOT, suggested that the aphids avoid
   heat stress by dropping when exposed to high temperatures. Climate
   warming may therefore increase the aphids' dropping probabilities and
   consequently affect the aphids' individual development and population
   growth. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Reversible changes in how readily animals fight can be explained in

   number of questions, including why animals are consistent with respect

   taking, and why aggressive and nonaggressive animals often coexist
   within a population. In fish, different levels of aggressiveness bring
   several direct fitness-related consequences, such as when aggressive
   individuals monopolize a limited food supply and grow fast. They also
   bring indirect consequences, such as when aggressive fish are more
   susceptible to predation and when they require a larger respiratory
   surface to service a higher metabolic rate. Fitness consequences of
   aggressiveness are often context dependent, with aggressive fish tending
   to do well in simple, predictable conditions but not in complex, less
   predictable conditions. The diverse, context-dependent consequences of
   aggression mean that aggressive and nonaggressive fish flourish in
   different conditions and explain in general terms why these behavioral

Abstract = {{The influence of ecology on the development of behavioral traditions in
   animals is controversial, particularly for chimpanzees (Pan
   troglodytes), for which it is difficult to rule out environmental
   influences as a cause of widely observed community-specific behavioral
   differences. Here, we investigated 3 potential scenarios that could
   explain the natural variation in a key extractive tool behavior,
   ``fluid-dip,{''} among several communities of chimpanzees of the Pan
   troglodytes schweinfurthii subspecies in Uganda. We compared data from
   previous behavioral ecological studies, field experiments, and long-term
   records of chimpanzee tool-using behavior. We focused on the quality of
   the available food, dietary preferences, and tool sets of 5 different
   communities, and carried out a standardized field experiment to test
   systematically for the presence of fluid-dip in 4 of these communities.
   Our results revealed major differences in habitat, available diet, and
   tool use behavior between geographically close communities. However,
   these differences in ecology and feeding behavior failed to explain the
   differences in tool use across communities. We conclude that ecological
   variables may lead both to innovation and loss of behavioral traditions,
   while contributing little to their transmission within the community.
   Instead, as soon as a behavioral tradition is established,
   sociocognitive factors likely play a key maintenance role as long as the

Abstract = {{During foraging, animals have to balance the risk of predation with the
   energy gain. The amount of risk animals take for a given resource
   depends on their energy budget but is expected also to vary between
   individuals of different personality types. We tested whether
   individuals of free-ranging grey mouse lemurs, Microcebus murinus,
   forage risk-sensitively and are consistent in their risk-taking
   behaviour. Furthermore, we tested whether boldness towards a novel
   object predicts risk taking in a foraging task. In a field experiment,
   we simulated low and high predation risk at artificial feeding sites.
   During focal platform observations, we quantified behaviours related to
   exploration and feeding for 36 individuals. Furthermore, we used a novel
   object test to quantify variation in boldness for 22 of these
   individuals. As predicted, grey mouse lemurs foraged risk-sensitively
   indicated by longer latencies to enter a feeding platform and to start
   feeding as well as by relatively longer feeding time compared to
   nonfeeding in high-risk situations. Individual differences in risk
   taking were repeatable and repeatability increased with increasing risk.
   Individual plasticity was higher for low-risk individuals providing
   field evidence for coping styles. There was no relationship between
   individual body condition and risk-taking behaviour. Finally, boldness
   measured in a novel object test was correlated with risk taking in a
   foraging task, providing a rare ecological validation for this
   personality trait. These results suggest that intrinsic individual

Abstract = {{Decision making is vital to the fitness of all animals, with many social

   Chemical signals are the most important tools for many animals, and are
   used notably by social insects in a wide variety of contexts, from
   foraging for food to recognition of nestmates. However, chemical cues
   may be biosynthetically limited and costly to produce, making their use
   in multiple contexts potentially beneficial. In this study we examined
   the role of foraging pheromones during nest migrations in the Pharaoh's
   ant, Monomorium pharaonis. Using a Y-shaped bridge apparatus, we tested
   whether ants would prefer migrating to a novel nest site along branches
   coated with attractive foraging pheromones rather than to a nest site

   nest sites reached via branches with attractive foraging pheromones, and
   that there were more queens and workers in those nests at the end of the
   migration than in nests at the end of control branches. The results show
   that attractive foraging pheromones are utilized during nest migrations

Abstract = {{Mercury in the Arctic is an important environmental and human health

   processes which regulate mercury levels in marine food webs and
   ultimately the exposure of human populations to this contaminant. While
   many knowledge gaps exist limiting our ability to make strong
   conclusions, it appears that the long-range transport of mercury from
   Asian emissions is an important source of atmospheric Hg to the Arctic
   and that mercury methylation resulting in monomethylmercury production
   (an organic form of mercury which is both toxic and bioaccumulated) in
   Arctic marine waters is the principal source of mercury incorporated
   into food webs. Mercury concentrations in biological organisms have
   increased since the onset of the industrial age and are controlled by a
   combination of abiotic factors (e.g., monomethylmercury supply), food
   web dynamics and structure, and animal behavior (e.g., habitat selection
   and feeding behavior). Finally, although some Northern Peoples have high

Title = {{Early life opportunities for prevention of diabetes in low and middle
   income countries}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: The global burden of diabetes and other non-communicable
   diseases is rising dramatically worldwide and is causing a double poor
   health burden in low-and middle-income countries. Early life influences
   play an important part in this scenario because maternal lifestyle and
   conditions such as gestational diabetes and obesity affect the risk of
   diabetes in the next generation. This indicates important periods during
   the lifecourse when interventions could have powerful affects in
   reducing incidence of non-communicable diseases. However, interventions
   to promote diet and lifestyle in prospective parents before conception
   have not received sufficient attention, especially in low-and
   middle-income countries undergoing socio-economic transition.
   Discussion: Interventions to produce weight loss in adults or to reduce
   weight gain in pregnancy have had limited success and might be too late
   to produce the largest effects on the health of the child and his/her
   later risk of non-communicable diseases. A very important factor in the
   prevention of the developmental component of diabetes risk is the
   physiological state in which the parents enter pregnancy. We argue that
   the most promising strategy to improve prospective parents' body
   composition and lifestyle is the promotion of health literacy in
   adolescents. Multiple but integrated forms of community-based
   interventions that focus on nutrition, physical activity, family
   planning, breastfeeding and infant feeding practices are needed. They
   need to address the wider social economic context in which adolescents
   live and to be linked with existing public health programmes in sexual
   and reproductive health and maternal and child health initiatives.
   Summary: Interventions aimed at ensuring a healthy body composition,
   diet and lifestyle before pregnancy offer a most effective solution in
   many settings, especially in low-and middle-income countries undergoing
   socio-economic transition. Preparing a mother, her partner and her
   future child for ``the 1000 days{''}, whether from planned or unplanned
   conception would break the cycle of risk and demonstrate benefit in the
   shortest possible time. Such interventions will be particularly
   important in adolescents and young women in disadvantaged groups and can
   improve the physiological status of the fetus as well as reduce the
   prevalence of pregnancy conditions such as gestational diabetes mellitus
   which both predispose to non-communicables diseases in both the mother
   and her child. Pre-conception interventions require equipping
   prospective parents with the necessary knowledge and skills to make
   healthy lifestyle choices for themselves and their children. Addressing
   the promotion of such health literacy in parents-to-be in low-and
   middle-income countries requires a wider social perspective. It requires
   a range of multisectoral agencies to work together and could be linked
   to the issues of women's empowerment, to reproductive health, to
   communicable disease prevention and to the Millennium Development Goals

Title = {{Enhancing self-regulation as a strategy for obesity prevention in Head
   Start preschoolers: the growing healthy study}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Nearly one in five 4-year-old children in the United States
   are obese, with low-income children almost twice as likely to be obese
   as their middle/upper-income peers. Few obesity prevention programs for
   low-income preschoolers and their parents have been rigorously tested,
   and effects are modest. We are testing a novel obesity prevention
   program for low-income preschoolers built on the premise that children
   who are better able to self-regulate in the face of psychosocial
   stressors may be less likely to eat impulsively in response to stress.
   Enhancing behavioral self-regulation skills in low-income children may
   be a unique and important intervention approach to prevent childhood
   obesity.
   Methods/design: The Growing Healthy study is a randomized controlled
   trial evaluating two obesity prevention interventions in 600 low-income
   preschoolers attending Head Start, a federally-funded preschool program
   for low-income children. Interventions are delivered by community-based,
   nutrition-education staff partnering with Head Start. The first
   intervention (n = 200), Preschool Obesity Prevention Series (POPS),
   addresses evidence-based obesity prevention behaviors for preschool-aged
   children and their parents. The second intervention (n = 200) comprises
   POPS in combination with the Incredible Years Series (IYS), an
   evidence-based approach to improving self-regulation among
   preschool-aged children. The comparison condition (n = 200) is Usual
   Head Start Exposure. We hypothesize that POPS will yield positive
   effects compared to Usual Head Start, and that the combined intervention
   (POPS + IYS) addressing behaviors well-known to be associated with
   obesity risk, as well as self-regulatory capacity, will be most
   effective in preventing excessive increases in child adiposity indices
   (body mass index, skinfold thickness). We will evaluate additional child
   outcomes using parent and teacher reports and direct assessments of
   food-related self-regulation. We will also gather process data on
   intervention implementation, including fidelity, attendance, engagement,
   and satisfaction.
   Discussion: The Growing Healthy study will shed light on associations
   between self-regulation skills and obesity risk in low-income
   preschoolers. If the project is effective in preventing obesity, results
   can also provide critical insights into how best to deliver obesity
   prevention programming to parents and children in a community-based
   setting like Head Start in order to promote better health among at-risk
   children.}},

Abstract = {{1. The vertical distribution of zooplankton results from active habitat
   choice aiming to optimise fitness gain in a system of trade-offs. 2.
   Using large, controlled indoor mesocosms (Plon Plankton Towers), we
   monitored the behavioural response of Daphnia pulicaria to vertical
   gradients of temperature, food, oxygen and light, in the presence and
   absence of fish predation. 3. In the absence of fish, Daphnia
   distributed as predicted by an ideal free distribution with costs. If
   the food was distributed homogeneously, they stayed in the warm
   epilimnion, while they balanced their time dwelling in epi- and
   hypolimnion if the food was concentrated in a deep-water maximum. 4.
   However, oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion, representing an additional
   cost, prevented Daphnia from completely exploiting the hypolimnetic food
   maximum. Consequently, the proportion dwelling in the hypolimnion was
   larger if oxygen was not limiting. 5. Fish predation had an overwhelming
   effect, driving Daphnia into the hypolimnion under all experimental
   conditions. If permitted by oxygen availability, Daphnia used the whole
   hypolimnion, but oxygen depletion reduced their possible habitat to the
   upper hypolimnion with oxygen concentrations above c. 0.7 mg L-1. As
   fish were less tolerant of low oxygen, the layer below the thermocline
   formed a predation refuge for Daphnia.}},

Pages = {{956-965}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Agonistic behavior may influence the dispersal of species and spatial
   distribution of individuals within a population. The Mediterranean gecko
   Hemidactylus turcicus was used to test 2 hypotheses: 1) adult behavior
   differs in responses to conspecifics and resource limitations; and 2)
   juvenile behavior is affected by visual, chemical, and tactile adult
   male cues. I quantified behavioral responses of males to different
   levels of food quality, availability of retreat sites, and the presence
   of a resident male. Aggression was significantly more prevalent in the
   presence of a conspecific male regardless of resource availability. To
   test the 2nd hypothesis, I observed juvenile responses to chemosensory
   cues of either a confined or non-confined adult male. Both visual and
   chemosensory cues combined, rather than chemical cues alone influenced
   juvenile responses. Juveniles also exhibited sensory behavior
   (tongue-flicking) upon entering a novel environment, indicating that
   chemical mediation may be sufficient to impact behavior. Results of
   these contests illustrate the importance of chemical communication in
   providing information which influences behavioral responses and suggests
   a role for self and mutual assessments during intraspecific encounters.
   The outcome of competitive encounters may heavily rely on information
   collected via chemical cues and may ultimately regulate aggression by
   informing individuals about whether or not to fight and thus adhere to
   the confines of social dominance within the species.}},

Abstract = {{A species may modify its relative habitat use with changing
   availability, generating functional responses in habitat selection.
   Functional responses in habitat selection are expected to occur when
   animals experience trade-offs influencing their habitat selection, but
   only a few studies to date have explicitly linked functional responses
   to the underlying trade-offs faced by the animals. We used data from 39
   female moose fitted with GPS telemetry collars in two nearby study areas
   in Canada to investigate if moose (1) were faced with a food/cover
   trade-off in habitat selection, as typically acknowledged in the
   literature, and (2) showed a functional response in their use of
   food/cover-rich habitats. We also examined how habitat selection
   patterns varied seasonally, and between study areas. The occurrence of
   functional responses varied strongly between study areas, and could not
   always be related to a measurable food/cover trade-off. Functional
   responses were observed more often in the study area where the
   environmental conditions were more severe (colder temperatures, higher
   precipitations, and lower food availability). Selection coefficients
   were also less variable among individuals in that study area, suggesting
   that severe environmental conditions may constrain individuals to a few
   selection tactics and promote the development of functional responses.
   Moose reacted to the availability of different habitat types in
   different seasons, reflecting the changing trade-offs faced by the
   animals. We found considerable behavioral differences between
   individuals from two adjacent study areas, and therefore recommend
   caution when extrapolating habitat selection results. We advocate for
   the wider use of functional responses to identify critical habitats for
   a species from a management or conservation perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental differences among populations are expected to lead to
   local adaptation, while spatial or temporal environmental variation
   within a population will favour evolution of phenotypic plasticity. As
   plasticity itself can be under selection, locally adapted populations
   can vary in levels of plasticity. Nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius
   pungitius) originating from isolated ponds (low piscine predation risk,
   high competition) vs. lake and marine populations (high piscine
   predation risk, low competition) are known to be morphologically adapted
   to their respective environments. However, nothing is known about their
   ability to express phenotypic plasticity in morphology in response to
   perceived predation risk or food availability/competition. We studied
   predator-induced phenotypic plasticity in body shape and armour of
   marine and pond nine-spined stickleback in a factorial common garden
   experiment with two predator treatments (present vs. absent) and two
   feeding regimes (low vs. high). The predation treatment did not induce
   any morphological shifts in fish from either habitat or food regime.
   However, strong habitat-dependent differences between populations as
   well as strong sexual dimorphism in both body shape and armour were
   found. The lack of predator-induced plasticity in development of the
   defence traits (viz. body armour and body depth) suggests that
   morphological anti-predator traits in nine-spined stickleback are
   strictly constitutive, rather than inducible. (C) 2012 The Linnean

   receptor neurones (GRNs) is tested in the carabid beetle Anchomenus
   dorsalis (Pontoppidan, 1763) (Coleoptera, Carabidae). Maltose, sucrose,
   glucose and raffinose are the most stimulating sugars for the
   sugar-sensitive neurone (SuN), evoking 6.718.6 spikes s-1 in fed
   insects, whereas the others had little or no effect. The firing rate of
   the antennal GRNs is not affected by any of the tested sugar alcohols,
   dulcitol, inositol and sorbitol. Additionally, concentration/response
   curves for sucrose and maltose are obtained in the range 0.01100 mm. The
   responses of beetles starved for 96 h to this range of sucrose are two-
   to three-fold higher compared with those of fed beetles. The presence of
   a terminal a-glucose unit is an important feature of the molecular
   structure determining the stimulating properties of the two
   disaccharides, maltose and sucrose, as well as glucose. The other
   monosaccharide unit of the molecule is also of great importance in

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of foraging animals at a given time
   simultaneously depends on (1) exogenous environmental variables such as
   resource availability and abiotic habitat characteristics, and (2) the
   endogenous variable social aggregation made up of the opposing
   mechanisms of conspecific attraction and repulsion. We developed an
   exogenous environment-social aggregation model to analyse the spatial
   distributions of six abundant shorebird species in the Dutch Wadden Sea
   at resolutions of 150 x 150, 200 x 200 and 250 x 250 m. We used these
   resolutions to check the robustness of the estimates to the modifiable
   areal unit problem. We estimated the model parameters by spatial
   autoregression. This approach enables, among others, estimation of the
   direct and indirect effects of an exogenous environmental variable on
   animal density. The former is given by the regression coefficient and
   the latter, which is due to the amplification of the direct effect by
   social aggregation, by the spatial multiplier. At all resolution levels

Abstract = {{Social learning, whereby animals learn from others, mediates the spread

   particular categories of individuals. Such model biases are well
   documented, but few, if any, experimental studies have addressed
   potential developmental causes of this variation. We therefore tested
   whether and how the postnatal environment affected social-learning
   preferences in a known social learner the zebra finch, Taeniopygia
   guttata. Birds from experimentally manipulated brood sizes, a treatment
   known to affect adult phenotypic quality in this species, were tested in

Abstract = {{The unrelenting rise in global rates of non-communicable disease has
   necessitated a thorough re-evaluation of the current use of adult- and
   lifestyle-based strategies to curb the growing epidemic. There is a
   rapidly emerging set of epidemiological, experimental and clinical data
   suggesting that developmental factors play a considerable role in
   determining individual disease risk later in life. This phenomenon is
   known as the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD).
   Developmental factors, such as maternal and paternal nutrition,
   gestational diabetes mellitus, and even the normative range of
   developmental experiences, may evoke the processes of developmental
   plasticity which enable an organism to change its developmental
   trajectory in response to environmental cues. However in the event of a
   mismatch between the early and mature environment, such anticipatory
   responses may become maladaptive and lead to elevated risk of disease.
   The evo-devo and eco-evo-devo framework for DOHaD has more recently been
   supported by mechanistic insights enabled by rapid advances in
   epigenetic research. Increasing evidence suggests that developmental
   plasticity may be effected by epigenetically mediated modulation of the
   expression of specific genes. These mechanisms include DNA methylation,
   histone modifications and noncoding RNA activity. A growing number of
   animal studies also point towards the transgenerational inheritance of
   epigenetic marks, which may have implications for the perpetuation of
   ill-health. However early-life epigenotyping may find utility as a
   prognostic marker of metabolic dysfunction for identification and

Abstract = {{Individuals of the same species differ consistently in risky actions.
   Such `animal personality' variation is intriguing because behavioural
   flexibility is often assumed to be the norm. Recent theory predicts that
   between-individual differences in propensity to take risks should evolve
   if individuals differ in future fitness expectations: individuals with
   high long-term fitness expectations (i.e. that have much to lose) should
   behave consistently more cautious than individuals with lower
   expectations. Consequently, any manipulation of future fitness
   expectations should result in within-individual changes in risky
   behaviour in the direction predicted by this adaptive theory. We tested
   this prediction and confirmed experimentally that individuals indeed
   adjust their `exploration behaviour', a proxy for risk-taking behaviour,
   to their future fitness expectations. We show for wild great tits (Parus
   major) that individuals with experimentally decreased survival
   probability become faster explorers (i.e. increase risk-taking
   behaviour) compared to individuals with increased survival probability.
   We also show, using quantitative genetics approaches, that non-genetic
   effects (i.e. permanent environment effects) underpin adaptive
   personality variation in this species. This study thereby confirms a key
   prediction of adaptive personality theory based on life-history
   trade-offs, and implies that selection may indeed favour the evolution
   of personalities in situations where individuals differ in future
   fitness expectations.}},

   only does it potently increase intake of freely-available food, but it
   also shifts food preference toward diets rich in fat, enhances operant
   responding for food rewards, and induces conditioned place preference
   for food rewards. Here, we postulated that ghrelin also enables
   cue-potentiated feeding, in which eating is enhanced upon presentation
   of a food-conditioned stimulus. To test this hypothesis, a novel
   cue-potentiated feeding protocol adapted for use in mice was designed
   and validated, and then the effects of pharmacologic ghrelin receptor
   (GHSR) antagonism and GHSR transcriptional blockade (as occurs in
   GHSR-null mice) were assessed. Sated C57BL/6J mice indeed demonstrated
   cue-potentiated intake of grain-based pellets specifically upon
   presentation of a positive conditioned stimulus (CS+) but not a negative
   conditioned stimulus (CS). Treatment with a GHSR antagonist blocked
   potentiated feeding in sated C57BL/6J mice in response to the CS+. In
   contrast, while GHSR-null mice also lacked a potentiation of feeding
   specifically in response to the CS+, they displayed an enhanced intake
   of pellets in response to both the positive and negative conditioned
   stimuli. The pattern of immediate early gene expression within the
   basolateral amygdala - a brain region previously linked to
   cue-potentiated feeding - paralleled the observed behavior of these
   mice, suggesting uncharacteristic activation of the amygdala in response
   to negative conditioned stimuli in GHSR-null mice as compared to
   wild-type littermates. Thus, although the observed disruptions in
   cue-potentiated feeding are different depending upon whether GHSR
   activity or GHSR expression is blocked, a key role for GHSRs in
   establishing a specific positive cue-food association has now been
   established. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Only little is known about behaviour and stress responses in horses with
   gastric ulceration, despite the high prevalence of this condition. Our
   objectives in the present study was to (i) describe the severity of
   gastric ulceration in horses, housed under relatively standardised
   conditions, and (ii) to investigate whether horses with severe glandular
   gastric ulceration have increased baseline and response concentration of
   stress hormones and behave differently than control horses. We
   investigated stomachs of 96 horses at one stud, and compared an ulcer
   group (n = 30; with severe lesions in the glandular mucosa) to paired
   controls (n = 30; free from gastric ulcers). Baseline and response
   concentrations of faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM), heart rate and
   behaviour were measured in a novel object test (NOT, Day 1) and
   behaviour during postponed feeding (PF, Day 2). Glandular lesions
   occurred in 55.2\% and non-glandular lesions in 40.6\% of the horses.
   The amount of starch in the feed (P=0.006) and paternal stallion
   (P=0.031) influenced ulceration in the non-glandular region only; it
   should be noted that our study does not allow for separating hereditary
   from environmental influences, as offspring may be e.g. trained
   differently dependent on breeding line. Ulcer horses pawed more (P <
   0.001) and ate quicker (P=0.050) during PF. Although displayed by ulcers
   horses only during PF, we failed to demonstrate a significant
   association between glandular gastric ulceration and
   crib-biting/weaving; the total number of horses with these types of
   abnormal behaviour was low (n = 5). Behaviour and heart rate did not
   differ between groups in the NOT. Baseline concentration of FCM was
   similar (P=0.79), however, ulcer horses responded stronger to novelty
   than controls (26\% higher FCM; P=0.018). We conclude that the
   prevalence of gastric ulcers was high, and our results suggest different
   factors affecting ulceration in the glandular versus the non-glandular
   region of the horse stomach. Obvious external signs (e.g. poor body
   condition) identifying ulcer horses were absent. Horses with severe
   glandular ulcers had a higher stress hormone response to novelty, thus
   they were more stress sensitive. Consequently, management evoking stress
   in horses should be reduced to dampen the development of glandular
   ulceration, or to protect horses with this condition. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{Plasticity of collective behavior in a nomadic early spring folivore}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Collective behavior in the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria)
   meets the thermal constraints of being an early spring folivore, but
   introduces other constraints in food choice. These are minimized by
   state-dependent, inter-individual, and ontogenetic variations in
   responses to social cues. Forest tent caterpillars use pheromone trails
   and tactile communication among colony members to stay together during
   foraging. At the group level, these rules lead to cohesive synchronized
   collective nomadic foraging, in which the colony travels en masse
   between feeding and resting sites. This paper proposes that synchronized
   collective locomotion prevents individuals from becoming separated from
   the colony and hence permits them to reap the advantages of group
   living, notably collective basking to increase their body temperature
   above ambient and collective defense against natural enemies. However,
   this cohesive behavior also implies conservative foraging, and colonies
   can become trapped on poor food sources. High fidelity to pheromone
   trails leads to strong amplification of an initial choice, such that
   colonies seldom abandon the first food source contacted, even if a
   better one is nearby. The risk of this trapping is modulated both by
   consistent inter-individual variations in exploratory behavior and by
   inner state. Colonies consisting of active-phenotype or protein-deprived
   individuals that explore more-off trails exhibit greater collective
   flexibility in foraging. An ontogenetic shift toward more independent
   movement occurs as caterpillars grow. This leads to colony break-up as
   the season advances. Selection pressures facing older caterpillars favor
   solitary living more than in the earlier instars. Caterpillars respond
   to this predictably changing environment by altering their behavioral
   rules as they grow.}},

Abstract = {{The modern way of living is characterized by high participation in
   sedentary activities such as computing, watching television and playing
   video games. The practice of sedentary activities has been shown to have
   a negative influence on various indicators of health. Furthermore, the
   increase in energy intake observed while practicing sedentary activities
   is not related to increases in appetite or hunger sensations. As opposed
   to other sedentary activities, sleep may help facilitate the control of
   appetite and promote the maintenance of a healthy body weight. A
   U-shaped relationship has been noted between sleep duration and
   adiposity indicators, suggesting that both short- and long-duration
   sleepers are more likely to gain weight over time. Recent evidence shows
   that short-duration sleepers having a high disinhibition eating behavior
   trait are more at risk of gaining weight over time compared to
   short-duration sleepers having a low disinhibition eating behavior
   trait. In summary, it is important to make the distinction between
   `sleep' and `sedentary activities' when assessing their effects on
   health-related indicators. While most sedentary activities promote a
   positive energy balance, which may ultimately lead to weight gain over
   time, adequate sleep is rather associated with body weight stability and
   overall health.}},

Abstract = {{The life history of tropical birds differs from that of their temperate
   counterparts by late start of reproduction, small clutch sizes, and high
   rates of adult survival. Thus, tropical species should have greater
   residual reproductive value than temperate species. Therefore, tropical
   birds can be predicted to take smaller risks than closely related
   temperate birds in order not to jeopardize their prospects of survival,
   which is the single most important component of fitness, and which is
   greater in tropical than in temperate species. We estimated flight
   distances as a measure of risk-taking behavior of common species of
   birds for populations living in tropical areas in China (mainly Haitian)
   and in temperate Europe (mainly Denmark and France), predicting that
   flight distances should be longer in tropical than in temperate
   populations, and that the difference in flight distance between these 2
   environments should be positively correlated with the difference in
   clutch size. Mean flight distance was more than twice as large in
   tropical compared with temperate populations for 25 pairs of taxa. The
   difference in flight distance between tropical and temperate taxa
   decreased with the difference in clutch size between the 2 environments.
   These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that tropical birds
   take smaller risks than closely related temperate taxa to minimize the
   risk of early death due to predation.}},

Abstract = {{A stronger focus on natural mortality may be required to better
   understand contemporary changes in fish life histories and behaviour and
   their responses to anthropogenic drivers. Firstly, natural mortality is
   the selection under which fish evolved in the first place, so a
   theoretical understanding of effects of natural mortality alone is
   needed. Secondly, due to trade-offs, most organismal functions can only
   be achieved at some cost in terms of survival. Several trade-offs might
   need to be analysed simultaneously with effects on natural mortality
   being a common currency. Thirdly, there is scattered evidence that
   natural mortality has been increasing, some would say dramatically, in
   some fished stocks, which begs explanations. Fourthly, natural mortality
   most often implies transfer of mass and energy from one species to
   another, and therefore has foodweb and ecosystem consequences. We
   therefore analyse a model for evolution of fish life histories and
   behaviour, where state-dependent energy-allocation and growth strategies
   are found by optimization. Natural mortality is split into five
   different components, each specified as the outcome of individual traits
   and ecological tradeoffs: a fixed baseline mortality; size-dependent
   predation; risk-dependent growth strategy; a fixed mortality when
   sexually mature; and mortality increasing with reproductive investment.
   The analysis is repeated with and without fishing. Each component of
   natural mortality has consequences for optimal life history strategies.
   Beyond earlier models, we show i) how the two types of reproductive
   mortality sometimes have similar and sometimes contrasting effects on
   life history evolution, ii) how ecosystem properties such as food
   availability and predation levels have stronger effects on optimal
   strategies than changing other mortality components, and iii) how
   expected changes in risk-dependent growth strategies are highly variable
   depending on the type of mortality changed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Antipredator behaviour is an important fitness component in most
   animals. A co-evolutionary history between predator and prey is
   important for prey to respond adaptively to predation threats. When
   non-native predator species invade new areas, native prey may not
   recognise them or may lack effective antipredator defences. However,
   responses to novel predators can be facilitated by chemical cues from
   the predators' diet. The red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii is a
   widespread invasive predator in the Southwest of the Iberian Peninsula,
   where it preys upon native anuran tadpoles. In a laboratory experiment
   we studied behavioural antipredator defences (alterations in activity
   level and spatial avoidance of predator) of nine anurans in response to
   P. clarkii chemical cues, and compared them with the defences towards a
   native predator, the larval dragonfly Aeshna sp. To investigate how
   chemical cues from consumed conspecifics shape the responses, we raised
   tadpoles with either a tadpole-fed or starved crayfish, or dragonfly
   larva, or in the absence of a predator. Five species significantly
   altered their behaviour in the presence of crayfish, and this was
   largely mediated by chemical cues from consumed conspecifics. In the
   presence of dragonflies, most species exhibited behavioural defences and
   often these did not require the presence of cues from predation events.
   Responding to cues from consumed conspecifics seems to be a critical
   factor in facilitating certain behavioural responses to novel exotic
   predators. This finding can be useful for predicting antipredator
   responses to invasive predators and help directing conservation efforts
   to the species at highest risk.}},

   However, although the speed and accuracy of foraging increased
   significantly during training, the first fish to move was not always the

   between the number of guppies entering areas of varying food quality,
   supporting the hypothesis that these fish learn foraging locations by
   following and suggesting that leaders forage without considering the
   reduced personal reward arising from sharing a low-quality patch with

Abstract = {{Trade-offs are inherent to alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs), and
   identifying the costs and benefits of tactics is essential to
   understanding their evolution and maintenance within a population. Male
   horseshoe crabs exhibit two condition-dependent ARTs: males that are in
   better condition arrive on spawning beaches attached to a female, while
   males in poorer condition join spawning pairs as satellites and engage
   in sperm competition. Previous research has identified several benefits
   to the attached tactic, but the costs are less well understood. We
   examined a previously uninvestigated potential cost to the attached male
   tactic: nutritional stress caused by a restricted ability to feed. We
   found that field-caught attached males produced 57\% less faeces in a 12
   h period than satellite males, and had 2.5 times emptier digestive
   tracts than satellite males. We further examined this cost using stable
   isotopes because nutritionally stressed animals are predicted to have
   higher delta N-15 levels. We found that field-caught attached males had
   higher delta N-15 values than satellite males. However, higher delta
   N-15 values could result from nutritional stress or from feeding on
   higher trophic levels. We tested this experimentally and found that
   starved animals had higher post-treatment delta N-15 values compared to
   animals that were fed. Furthermore, the digestive tracts of field-caught
   attached males contained three times more sea grass (lower tropic levels
   have lower delta N-15 values) than satellite males. These findings mean
   that the higher delta N-15 values of field-caught attached males likely
   result from fasting rather than differences in diet. Taken together, our
   results indicate that a period of nutritional stress caused by reduced
   food consumption is a novel cost of the attached tactic. This study
   provides a key piece of information to explain why ARTs in horseshoe
   crabs take the form they do and provides a novel method for studying
   costs associated with ARTs in other species. (C) 2012 The Association

Abstract = {{Low birthweight, a marker of an adverse in utero environment, is
   associated with cardiometabolic disease and brain disorders in
   adulthood. The adaptive changes made by the fetus in response to the
   intra-uterine environment result in permanent changes in physiology,
   structure and metabolism, a phenomenon termed early life programming.
   One of the key hypotheses to explain programming, namely over exposure
   of the developing fetus to glucocorticoids, was proposed nearly two
   decades ago, following the observation that the fetus was protected from
   high glucocorticoid levels in the mother by the actions of the placental
   barrier enzyme, 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which converts
   active glucocorticoids into inactive products. Numerous mechanistic
   studies in animal models have been carried out to test this hypothesis
   using manipulations to increase maternal glucocorticoids. Overall, these
   have resulted in offspring of lower birthweight, with an activated
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and an adverse metabolic
   profile and behavioural phenotype in adulthood.
   Altered glucocorticoid activity or action is a good candidate mechanism
   in humans to link low birthweight with cardiometabolic and brain
   disorders. We have carried out detailed studies in men and women showing
   that high levels of endogenous glucocorticoids, or treatment with
   exogenous glucocorticoids, is associated with an adverse metabolic
   profile, increased cardiovascular disease and altered mood and cognitive
   decline. Our laboratory carried out the first translational studies in
   humans to test the glucocorticoid hypothesis, firstly demonstrating in
   studies of adult men and women, that low birthweight was associated with
   high fasting cortisol levels. We went on to dissect the mechanisms
   underlying the high fasting cortisol, demonstrating activation of the
   HPA axis, with increased cortisol responses to stimulation with
   exogenous adrenocorticotrophin hormone, lack of habituation to the
   stress of venepuncture, and increased cortisol responses to psychosocial
   stress. We have developed new dynamic tests to dissect the mechanisms
   regulating HPA axis central negative feedback sensitivity in humans, and
   demonstrated that this may be altered in obesity, one component of the
   metabolic syndrome.
   There are now studies in humans demonstrating that high circulating
   levels of maternal cortisol during pregnancy correlate negatively with
   birthweight, suggesting that excess glucocorticoids can by-pass the
   placental barrier. Deficiencies in the barrier enzyme, potentially
   increasing fetal glucocorticoid exposure, can also arise in association
   with maternal stress, malnutrition and disease, and can be inhibited by
   consumption of liquorice, which contains glycyrrhizin, an HSD inhibitor.
   Importantly, studies in humans have now demonstrated that high maternal
   cortisol in pregnancy and/or inhibition of HSD2 are associated with
   programmed outcomes in childhood including higher blood pressure,
   behavioural disorders as well as altered brain structure. We are
   investigating this further, using novel magnetic resonance imaging
   techniques to study the developing fetal brain in utero.
   The translational studies in support of the glucocorticoid hypothesis,
   and demonstrating that glucocorticoids are both mediators and targets of
   programming, are exciting and raise the question of whether this
   information can be used to identify those individuals most at risk of
   later life disease. In a recent study we showed that alterations in DNA
   rnethylation at genes important in regulating cortisol levels, tissue
   glucocorticoid action, blood pressure and fetal growth, are present in
   adulthood in association with both early life parameters and
   cardiometabolic risk factors. These preliminary data add to the limited
   literature in humans indicating a persisting epigenetic link between
   early life events and subsequent disease risk. Such findings open novel
   avenues for further exploration of the contribution of glucocorticoids
   to later life disease. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Competition can greatly affect the food hoarding strategies of rodents
   and the fate of seeds hoarded. In order to understand the influence of
   interspecific competition on food caching behavior of sympatric rodents,
   we investigated food hoarding patterns of two sympatric rodent species,
   buff-breasted rat (Rattus flavipectus) and Chinese white-bellied rat
   (Niviventor confucianus), and compared their responses and adjustment in
   hoarding behavior under interspecific competition. The results showed
   that: (1) the buff-breasted rat larder hoarded seeds only, while Chinese
   white-bellied rat hoarded seeds in both larder and scatter forms: (2)
   two species of rodents both larder hoarded more seeds when competitors
   were present: and (3) the Chinese white-bellied rats adjusted their seed
   hoarding from scatter to larder when competitors were introduced, which
   reduced the seed availability. Therefore, we concluded that rodents
   would adjust their food hoarding strategy when interspecific competitors
   were present, and this may produce a different effect on the fate of
   seeds and the recruitment of plants.

Abstract = {{Feline interstitial cystitis (FIC) is a chronic pain syndrome of
   domestic cats. Cats with FIC have chronic, recurrent lower urinary tract
   signs (LUTS) and other comorbid disorders that are exacerbated by
   stressors. The aim of this study was to evaluate behavioral and
   physiological responses of healthy cats and cats diagnosed with FIC
   after exposure to a five day stressor. Ten healthy cats and 18 cats with
   FIC were housed at The Ohio State University Veterinary Medical Center
   (OSUVMC) vivarium. All cats were housed in enriched cages for at least
   one year prior to the experiment. Cats had daily play time and
   socialization outside of the cage, food treats and auditory enrichment.
   The daily husbandry schedule was maintained at a consistent time of day
   and cats were cared for by two familiar caretakers. During the test
   days, cats were exposed to multiple unpredictable stressors which
   included exposure to multiple unfamiliar caretakers, an inconsistent
   husbandry schedule, and discontinuation of play time, socialization,
   food treats, and auditory enrichment. Sickness behaviors (SB), including
   vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia or decreased food and water intake, fever,
   lethargy, somnolence, enhanced pain-like behaviors, decreased general
   activity, body care activities (grooming), and social interactions, were
   recorded daily. Blood samples were collected in the morning, before and
   after the stress period, for measurement of serum cortisol
   concentration, leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils,
   neutrophil:lymphocyte (N:L) ratio and mRNA for the cytokines
   interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Overall, the short term stressors led to a
   significant increase in SB in both healthy cats and cats with FIC,
   whereas lymphopenia and N:L changes occurred only in FIC cats. Daily
   monitoring of cats for SB may be a noninvasive and reliable way to
   assess stress responses and overall welfare of cats housed in cages. (C)

   months in the wild, linking activity to aggressiveness and exploration

Abstract = {{Evolutionary and life history perspectives allow a fuller understanding
   of both patterns of growth and development and variations in disease
   risk. Evolutionary processes act to ensure successful reproduction and
   not the preservation of health and longevity, and this entails
   trade-offs both between traits and across the life course. Developmental
   plasticity adjusts the developmental trajectory so that the phenotype in
   childhood and through peak reproduction will suit predicted
   environmental conditions - a capacity that may become maladaptive should
   early-life predictions be inaccurate. Bipedalism and consequent pelvic
   narrowing in humans have led to the evolution of secondary altricialism.
   Shorter inter-birth intervals enabled by appropriate social support
   structures have allowed increased fecundity/fitness. The age at puberty
   has fallen over the past two centuries, perhaps resulting from changes
   in maternal and infant health and nutrition. The timing of puberty is
   also advanced by conditions of high extrinsic mortality in
   hunter-gatherers and is reflected in developed countries where a poor or
   disadvantaged start to life may also accelerate maturation. The
   postpubertal individual is physically and psychosexually mature, but
   neural executive function only reaches full maturity in the third decade
   of life; this mismatch may account for increased adolescent morbidity
   and mortality in those with earlier pubertal onset. Copyright (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Annual changes in the behaviour and distribution of top predators at sea
   may be linked to environmental variability. Here we report, for the
   first time to our knowledge, the inter-annual (2007-2011) foraging
   ecology during the pre-laying period of female Cory's shearwaters
   Calonectris diomedea from Berlenga (Portugal), based on biotelemetry
   data. Our aim was to examine the degree of flexibility in the at-sea
   distribution, behaviour and habitat selection of foraging birds, and
   relate this with marine environmental stochasticity. Productivity
   proxies in the closer foraging areas decreased noticeably between 2007
   and 2011 (i.e. an increase of sea surface temperature and a decrease of
   primary productivity). Female Cory's shearwaters perceived the oceanic
   changes, and shifted their distribution to an area that could have the
   food resources required for egg formation. In 2011, in order to exploit
   the productive Grand Banks and Newfoundland Shelf domains, female Cory's
   shearwaters embarked on one of the largest foraging excursions of the
   pre-laying period when compared to other seabird species (nearly 4000
   km). The option to forage on such a distant area in 2011 decreased the
   females' body condition and reduced their hatching success, which may be
   interpreted as an adaptation to local productivity during this
   energetically highly demanding period to favour their own survival.
   Long-term monitoring of the foraging behaviour of top predators such as
   Cory's shearwaters in years to come may serve as a `sensitive' proxy to
   help understand the medium-to long-term effects of environmental
   stochasticity in marine ecological systems.}},

Abstract = {{A population of dice snakes (Natrix tessellate) monitored since 2008 in

   unforeseen patterns for snakes living in temperate climates. More than

   mortality rates are elevated, suggesting a high population turnover.
   These traits evoke a tropical rather than a temperate-climate ophidian
   demographic system. The population is highly polymorphic, three colour
   morphs (dotted, grey, and black) are observed in both sexes and each
   morph is represented by large numbers of individuals. This polymorphism
   pattern was not previously documented in snakes. Data obtained for other
   life history traits (e.g. body size, size at maturity, clutch size,
   diet, predation) markedly diverged in comparison to available
   information. Overall, our results reinforce the notion that the strong

   biologically costly, even life-threatening. It appears that physical
   growth and responses to nutrient availability are domains in which
   anticipatory, epigenetically inherited adjustments occur. In addition,

Abstract = {{Depression is a multicausal disorder and has been associated with the
   risk to develop cancer, dementia, diabetes, epilepsy and stroke. As a
   metabolic disorder depression has been associated with obesity,
   diabetes, insulin sensitivity, neuropeptide Y, glucose regulation, poor
   glycemic control, glucagone-like peptide-1, cholezystokinin, ghrelin,
   leptin, the endocannabinoid system, insulin-like growth factor and
   gastrin-releasing peptide. As a cardiovascular disease a close
   relationship exists between depression and blood pressure, heart rate,
   norepinephrine, sympathetic tone, vascular resistance, blood viscosity,
   plasma volume, intima thickness and atherosclerosis. Additionally blood
   coagulation, fibrinolysis, D-dimers, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
   protein, platelet activation, VEGF, plasma nitric oxide and its synthase
   are changed in depressed patients. As an endocrinological and stress
   disorder depression has been connected with the concentration of free
   T-4, TSH, CRH, arginine vasopressin, corticotrophin, corticosteroid
   release and ACTH. Depression as an inflammatory disorder is mediated by
   pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, TNF-alpha,
   soluble interleukin-2 receptors, interferon-alpha, interleukin 8,
   interleukin-10, hs-CRP, acute phase proteins, haptoglobin, toll like
   receptor 4, interleukin-1beta, mammalian target of rapamycin pathway,
   substance P, cyclooxygenase-2, prostaglandin-E2, lipid peroxidation
   levels and acid sphingomyelinase. Nutritional factors might influence
   depression risk, i.e. the consumption of folate, omega-3 fatty acids,
   monounsaturated fatty acids, olive oil, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts,
   legumes, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12. The neurodegenerative hypothesis of
   depression explains decreased hippocampal volumes in depressed patients
   and changes of neurotrophic support by BDNF, erythropoietin, GDNF,
   FGF-2, NT3, NGF and growth hormone. In this context, a fast
   neuroprotective and antidepressant effect has also been observed by
   ketamine, which acts via the glutamatergic system. Hence, GABA, AMPA,
   EAAT, NMDA- and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 to mGluR8) have
   gained interest in depression recently. Alternative, causative or also
   easy available treatment strategies beyond serotonin and noradrenaline
   reuptake inhibition might be a major topic of future psychiatric care.
   In this review, an attempt is made to overview concepts of the disease
   and search for perspectives on antidepressant treatment strategies

Abstract = {{As top predators, striped bass Morone saxatilis and their hybrids often
   accumulate pollutants and prompt recommendations for reduced
   consumption. Economists have estimated the economic effect of fish
   consumption advisories on anglers using nonmarket valuation techniques.
   Following a brief discussion of advisories policy in the United States
   and the theoretical underpinning for estimating economic losses they may
   cause, I contrast estimates of economic loss (consumer surplus) with
   measures of economic impact. In a comprehensive review of the economic
   costs of advisories in freshwater fisheries, I found that economists
   have focused almost exclusively on only the most extreme of angler's
   responses. These were changing the sites at which an angler fishes or
   changing the number of fishing trips during the season (ignoring losses
   associated with behavioral responses, such as changing target species,
   engaging in more careful food preparation, or strictly complying with
   recommended consumption limits). For decision makers needing to conduct
   benefit-cost analysis of an advisory policy but lacking the time or
   budget needed for an original study, I outline the method of benefit
   transfer. The paper concludes with a number of research topics not yet
   considered by economists: behavioral responses to advisories besides
   adjusting the site or number of trips, heterogeneity among anglers'
   preferences, and the effect of differences in perceived risk of
   consuming contaminated fish.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the diel vertical distribution patterns of
   microcrustacean,zooplankton (Cladocera, Copepoda) in a shallow pond
   (max. depth: 70 cm) of the Oreg-turjan peatland (Ocsa, Central Hungary)
   during three 24-h periods in July (19-20th), August (17-18th) and
   September (11-12th) 2011. Environmental variables showed remarkable
   vertical stratification. Oxygen concentration was close to zero in the
   entire water column from night until sunrise, while the lower strata
   (from 20 cm below the surface) were close to anoxic during all three
   diel cycles. It proved to be the main determinant of the vertical
   distribution of microcrustaceans. Accordingly, the highest proportion of
   individuals was present in the surface layer. Chlorophyll-a
   concentration and phytoplankton biomass were inversely distributed
   compared to zooplankton. Microcrustaceans (mainly Daphnia curvirostris)
   migrated to the middle layer only in August, which could be explained by
   a trade-off between food resources, dissolved oxygen (DO) and
   competition with littoral zooplankters. The diurnal density patterns of
   microcrustaceans suggested horizontal migration into the aquatic
   macrophytes during night, which could be a strategy to avoid Chaoborus
   predation. Our results show that strong vertical gradients of abiotic
   and biotic factors occur even in such shallow waterbodies. Among them,
   DO can maintain constant vertical aggregation of zooplankters by
   limiting their occurrence to the surface layers.}},

Pages = {{332-341}},
Abstract = {{Vigilance is an essential component of antipredator behaviour and is
   also used to monitor conspecifics, but is traded off against feeding in
   herbivores. This trade-off can be influenced by variation in many
   environmental, social and individual traits. Our aim was to test the
   relationship between individual-level traits, including boldness, body
   condition and reproductive state, and vigilance, while controlling for
   environmental and social variables. Using multiple 5-min video samples
   of 30 foraging, individually recognisable, female eastern grey kangaroos
   (Macropus giganteus) at Sundown National Park in Queensland, we
   investigated individual-level variation in the duration, intensity and
   target of vigilance behaviour during foraging. On separate occasions, we
   used flight-initiation distance tests to measure boldness in our
   kangaroos. Females with longer flight-initiation distances (shyer
   females) spent more time vigilant, providing preliminary support for
   studies of animal personality that have suggested that boldness may
   covary with vigilance. Body condition did not affect the total time
   spent vigilant, but females in poorer body condition spent more of their
   vigilance time in low-intensity vigilance. Vigilance patterns were not
   related to reproductive state, but varied among months and differed
   between mornings and afternoons, and females spent more time in
   high-intensity vigilance when further from cover. Even after accounting
   for all our variables we found that 7\% of the variation in total time
   vigilant and 14\% of the variation in vigilance intensity was explained
   by individual identity. This highlights the importance of
   individual-level variation in vigilance behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{The common bed bug, Cimex lectularius, feeds on the blood of mammal and
   bird hosts, and is a pest of global importance. Semiochemicals are
   chemicals involved in animal communication that may affect behaviour
   and/or physiology. Attractive semiochemicals that play a role in
   mediating bed bug behaviour could be exploited for the development of a
   highly effective novel monitoring device. Tracking software was used to
   record the response of bed bugs to volatiles from paper previously
   exposed to conspecific bugs in a still-air olfactometer illuminated by
   infrared lights, through a variety of activity variables. The effect of
   time of day as an extrinsic factor, and sex, stage, mating status and
   nutritional status as physiological factors on the response of bed bugs
   to the volatiles was examined. Bed bugs of both sexes and all stages
   responded to the volatiles from bed bug-exposed papers, showing
   significant attraction and orientation towards the volatile source
   whether they were starved or engorged. Confirmation that the
   physiological factors examined do not affect the response of bed bugs to
   the volatiles from bed bug-exposed papers provides evidence that these
   bed bug-derived volatiles contain aggregation cues, as semiochemicals
   that promote aggregation should by definition be detected by both sexes
   and all life stages. A device baited with such semiochemicals could play
   a major role in limiting the impact of the current bed bug resurgence by
   enabling timely detection of infestations, along with quantitative
   evaluation of control and effective surveillance of the geographical
   distribution of the pest species.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological and medical researchers are investing great effort to
   determine the role of Maternally-Derived Stress (MDS) as an inducer of
   phenotypic plasticity in offspring. Many researchers have interpreted
   phenotypic responses as unavoidable negative outcomes (e.g., small birth
   weight, high anxiety); however, a biased underestimate of the adaptive
   potential of MDS-induced effects is possible if they are not viewed
   within an ecologically relevant or a life-history optimization
   framework. We review the ecological and environmental drivers of MDS,
   how MDS signals are transferred to offspring, and what responses MDS
   induces. Results from four free-living vertebrate systems reveals that
   although MDS induces seemingly negative investment trade-offs in
   offspring, these phenotypic adjustments can be adaptive if they better
   match the offspring to future environments; however, responses can prove
   maladaptive if they unreliably predict (i.e., are mismatched to) future
   environments. Furthermore, MDS-induced adjustments that may prove
   maladaptive for individual offspring can still prove adaptive to mothers
   by reducing current reproductive investment, and benefitting lifetime
   reproductive success. We suggest that to properly determine the adaptive

Abstract = {{Introduction. Although sexual behavior is an integral part of most
   adults' overall well-being, this aspect of psoriasis patients' quality
   of life is rarely explored. Aim. The aim of this study is to assess the
   relationship between psoriasis and sexual behavior in U.S. women.
   Methods. We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2003 to 2006. Our study focuses on
   responses to the dermatology and sexual behavior questionnaires of the
   NHANES. Main Outcome Measures. This study examines the association
   between psoriasis and sexual behavior in U.S. women with regard to
   sexual orientation, age of first sexual encounter, number of sexual
   partners, and frequency of unprotected sex. Results. A total of 3,462
   women provided responses to their psoriasis status: 2,753 (80\%) women
   were heterosexual and 709 (20\%) were nonheterosexual. Among them, 2.7\%
   reported a physician-given diagnosis of psoriasis. On multivariate
   analyses, psoriasis was not associated with differences in sexual
   orientation (odds ratio {[}OR] 0.90, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   0.622.01). Among nonheterosexual women, multivariate analysis revealed a
   lower number of lifetime female sexual partners in women with psoriasis
   (rate ratio {[}RR] 0.11, 95\% CI 0.040.33, P = 0.001). Among
   heterosexual women, no significant differences existed between those
   with and without psoriasis in age of first sexual encounter (weighted
   difference -0.54 years, 95\% CI -1.27 to 0.19), number of lifetime male
   sexual partners (RR 1.19, 95\% CI 0.692.06), or number of lifetime male
   oral sex partners (RR 0.72, 95\% CI 0.401.29). Heterosexual women with
   psoriasis had 1.13 times more unprotected sex (RR 1.13, 95\% CI
   1.021.24, P = 0.03) compared with those without psoriasis. Conclusion.
   Psoriasis is associated with a significantly reduced number of sexual
   partners in nonheterosexual women. Psoriasis may differentially impact

Abstract = {{Egg cannibalism is a widely observed behaviour in nature that provides
   nutritional benefits without the costs of subduing prey. However, when
   egg cannibalism involves sibling eggs, the benefits obtained must
   balance inclusive fitness losses. Neonates of the Colorado potato
   beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, readily consume other eggs within
   their natal clutch. To explore the fitness consequences of this
   behaviour, neonates were fed no, one, or two eggs upon hatching, along
   with their normal diet of potato foliage. Daily mass, the time to each
   moult, adult volume and mass, and fecundity were measured for each
   individual, along with mortality rates. Cannibals gained mass more
   quickly and reached each developmental stage 1 day earlier than
   noncannibals. No benefits at the adult stage (other than earlier
   emergence) were observed, and there were no sex differences in the
   benefits of cannibalism. Mortality was not reduced by cannibalism under
   laboratory conditions. A simulation demonstrated that when the mortality
   risk is high, decreased development time due to cannibalism can reduce
   this risk sufficiently to balance the inclusive fitness loss of eating a
   single half-sibling. Additional benefits of cannibalism, such as reduced
   competition, need to be investigated to fully explain cannibalism of

Abstract = {{Fission-fusion systems provide models for studying grouping decisions
   and social complexity in a range of taxa, as individuals act to manage
   risks and enhance reproductive success. African savannah elephants,
   Loxodonta africana africana, live in a fluid society where individual
   relationships persist over decades and affect reproductive success.
   Social structures have yet to be fully characterized for forest
   elephants, Loxodonta africana cyclotis. Aggregations at natural forest
   clearings, which are frequent in this subspecies, may offer social
   benefits in addition to nutritional resources. We examined the social
   functions of aggregations in Odzala-Kokoua National Park, Republic of
   Congo. We tested whether clearings function as `social arenas' by
   examining how social opportunities affected the timing and duration of
   visits, and how short-term grouping decisions were affected by age, sex,
   group size and number of elephants present. Aggregations reflected a
   fission-fusion society similar to that observed in savannah elephants.
   Grouping patterns were largely unaffected by the number of elephants
   present, from which we infer that elephants were not acting to minimize
   competition. Social opportunities affected visit patterns such that
   visits were longer when others were present. Social opportunities were
   maximized by joining large groups, often including older elephants, or,
   for males, parties with females. Large and dynamically changing social
   groups in clearings offer potential for information exchange and the
   maintenance of social relationships. Demonstrating that fission-fusion
   operates in forest elephant society allows future research to focus on
   cost-benefit modelling, to understand the fitness consequences of these

Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{365-369}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Adults that cannibalize juvenile conspecifics gain substantial energy
   and nutrients that are potentially limited in their normal diet, but
   they may also face the risk of filial cannibalism: the consumption of an
   individual's own offspring. However, the potential costs and benefits of
   cannibalism change with the reproductive status of an individual during
   its lifetime. Once adults become reproductively active, they suddenly
   face the potential loss of inclusive fitness associated with filial
   cannibalism, but they also have higher energy demands that could easily
   be met with cannibalism. Thus, selection should favour any behaviour
   that reduces the risk of filial cannibalism while maximizing the
   nutritional and other benefits of cannibalism. Here we take an
   experimental approach to examine the relative importance of kin
   discrimination, reproductive status and sex differences in influencing
   cannibalistic behaviour (including filial cannibalism) of adults using
   confused flour beetles, Tribolium confusum, as a model system. Using a
   series of complementary experiments, we show that the cannibalistic
   behaviour of T. confusum is driven by a combination of two factors that
   both reduce the risk of filial cannibalism. First, reproductive females
   preferred to cannibalize unrelated eggs over related eggs, indicating
   clear kin discrimination. In addition, females also showed a dramatic
   reduction in the general propensity for cannibalism after becoming
   reproductively active. Interestingly, the onset of reproduction also
   reduced cannibalism rates in males, indicating that this change in
   cannibalistic behaviour is consistent across sexes. Mating status had a
   greater influence on cannibalism rates than did sex. Together, kin
   discrimination and mating-status-dependent shifts in cannibalism rates
   reduced the risk of filial cannibalism by up to six- fold. In general,
   our findings suggest that evolution can alter the cannibalistic
   behaviour of individuals in multiple ways to reduce the risk of filial
   cannibalism while still maximizing the benefits of cannibalism. (C) 2012

Pages = {{427-434}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A profusion of theoretical and empirical studies has successfully
   explored the issue of adaptive management of body mass by small birds
   threatened with both starvation and predation. In addition to diurnal
   body mass cycles, body mass tends to increase with either poorer mean
   conditions or more variable conditions, such as those often experienced
   during winter. In many species, individual dominance status will affect
   access to food and predation risk, and is therefore predicted to
   influence patterns of optimal body mass further. We investigated body
   mass regulation via repeated measurements without capture in groups of
   Siberian jays, Perisoreus infaustus, during autumn. As predicted, body
   mass of individuals increased throughout the day and towards the winter
   and was higher during colder periods. Jay body mass was also correlated
   with wind chill conditions 23 h before. This makes sense since
   conditions 24 h earlier were a better predictor of current conditions
   than conditions either 12 or 48 h earlier. Dominant birds (i.e.

Abstract = {{Movement behaviour plays an important role in many ecological
   interactions. As animals move through the environment, they generate
   movement patterns, which are a combined result of landscape
   characteristics and species-specific behaviour. Measuring these ranging
   patterns is being facilitated by technological advances in collection
   methods, such as GPS collars, that are capturing movement on finer
   spatial and temporal scales. We propose the use of a novel
   spatiotemporal analytical framework (ST-BBD), based on the beta-binomial
   distribution (BBD) model, to measure small-scale aggregation in animal
   movement data sets, including two simulated and three collected primate
   data sets. We use this approach to distinguish different habitat uses of
   three primate species (red colobus, Procolobus rufomitratus, black
   howler, Alouatta pigra, and spider monkey, Ateles geoffroyi) and
   quantify their specific use of the landscape in space and in time, using
   a parameter of the BBD that measures the variation in sites visited on a
   landscape. We found that estimates of aggregation in habitat use were
   higher in the frugivorous spider monkey, compared to the more folivorous
   howler monkey, and that in the red colobus, aggregation in site visits
   was dependent on group size and food availability. Applications of this
   framework to animal movement data could be useful in understanding
   ecological systems where habitat use is an important factor, such as the
   relationships between hosts and parasites, or parent plants and seed
   dispersers. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Variation in somatic growth rates is of great interest to biologists
   because of the relationship between growth and other fitness-determining
   traits, and it results from both genetic and environmentally induced
   variation (i.e. plasticity). Theoretical predictions suggest that mean
   somatic growth rates and the shape of the reaction norm for growth can
   be influenced by variation in predator-induced mortality rates. Few
   studies have focused on variation in reaction norms for growth in
   response to resource availability between high-predation and
   low-predation environments. We used juvenile Brachyrhaphis rhabdophora
   from high-predation and low-predation environments to test for variation
   in mean growth rates and for variation in reaction norms for growth at
   two levels of food availability in a common-environment experiment. To
   test for variation in growth rates in the field, we compared somatic
   growth rates in juveniles in high-predation and low-predation
   environments. In the common-environment experiment, mean growth rates
   did not differ between fish from differing predation environments, but
   the interaction between predation environment and food level took the
   form of a crossing reaction norm for both growth in length and mass.
   Fish from low-predation environments exhibited no significant difference
   in growth rate between high and low food treatments. In contrast, fish
   from high-predation environments exhibited variation in growth rates
   between high and low food treatments, with higher food availability
   resulting in higher growth rates. In the field, individuals in the
   high-predation environment grow at a faster rate than those in
   low-predation environments at the smallest sizes (comparable to sizes in
   the common-environment experiment). These data provide no evidence for
   evolved differences in mean growth rates between predation environments.
   However, fish from high-predation environments exhibited greater
   plasticity in growth rates in response to resource availability
   suggesting that predation environments may exhibit increased variation
   in food availability for prey fish and consequent selection for
   plasticity.}},

   Furthermore, we found evidence that poor body condition may be a

   males depending on the level of male presence to which they were

   females); (3) moderate male presence (two males with two females); and
   (4) high male presence (three males with one female). We measured sexual

   of sexual harassment on both males and females was measured as the
   overall change in body condition after being exposed to a particular

Abstract = {{Increasing evidence has accumulated within the last decade that
   individuals of different animal species show consistent behavior both
   across various contexts and through time, that is, they do have
   personality. However, little is known in how far the environment an
   individual is facing may influence the personality of insects, whereas
   it is well established that the environment can have profound influences
   on performance parameters. The development of personality may be closely
   linked to different expectations in future fitness leading to
   contrasting life-history strategies. We investigated in how far the
   environmental food conditions experienced during lifetime influence the
   life-history and shape the personality of the mustard leaf beetle,
   Phaedon cochleariae, a pest of crucifers. Beetles reared on low-quality
   food developed slower and gained lower body masses than insects reared
   on high-quality food. By performing behavioral tests analogous to
   vertebrate assays repeatedly during adult life, we identified 3
   personality dimensions, boldness, activity, and nontargeted
   explorativeness. Comparing food-dependent differences of the personality
   dimensions with state-dependent differences of the expected future
   prospects, we found that beetles feeding low-quality food were bolder,
   thereby potentially increasing their capabilities to succeed in
   foraging. In contrast, animals feeding high-quality food were more
   active. Changes in boldness may be highly adaptive to increase future
   reproductive output, whereas activity is likely constrained by the
   energy uptake. Our results demonstrate that the environment does not
   only affect life-history traits but has also a consistent impact on an
   individual's behavior, which is likely highly adaptive.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Early malnutrition is a highly prevalent condition in
   developing countries. Different rodent models of postnatal early
   malnutrition have been used to approach the subject experimentally,
   inducing early malnutrition by maternal malnutrition, temporal maternal
   separation, manipulation of litter size or the surgical nipple ligation
   to impair lactation. Studies on the behaviour of (previously)
   malnourished animals using animal models have produced sometimes
   contradictory results regarding the effects of early postnatal
   malnutrition and have been criticized for introducing potential
   confounding factors.
   The present paper is a first report on the behavioural effects of early
   malnutrition induced by an alternative approach: mice nursed by
   alpha-casein-deficient knockout dams showed a severe growth delay during
   early development and substantial catch-up growth after weaning when
   compared with animals nursed by wild-type females.
   Methods: Established behavioural tests were used to study the
   consequences of early postnatal malnutrition on mouse pups at weaning
   and after partial weight recovery.
   Results: Despite the impaired growth, the only behavioural difference
   between malnourished and normally growing animals was found in
   exploratory behaviour during acute malnutrition at the time of weaning.
   After partial catch-up in weight early protein malnourished animals
   showed no indication of lasting effects on general activity,
   emotionality and exploration, memory, and pain reactivity.
   Discussion: These results suggest that the role of early nutrition on
   behavioural development after recovery in animal models may have been
   overestimated. Further careful examination of this animal model in terms
   of maternal care and offspring behaviour will be necessary to confirm if
   mice nursed by alpha-casein-deficient dams offer an alternative to
   existing models while eliminating potential confounding factors.}},

   feeding}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{Although stress is implicated in the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety
   disorders, not all individuals who suffer stressful life events develop
   psychopathology. Differential susceptibility to stress may be influenced
   by genetically mediated differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
   (HPA) axis activity and moderation of the stress response by the opioid
   peptide beta-endorphin (beta-E). The present study investigated genetic
   contributions to coping behavior by examining anxious behavior of
   transgenic mice with varying capacities to synthesize beta-E
   {[}B6.129S2-Pomc(tm1Low)/J; regulated by insertion of a premature stop
   codon into one or both copies of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene],
   both under normal conditions and following 3 min of forced swim (FS).
   Ten minutes after this stress exposure or a control manipulation,
   acutely food-deprived female and male transgenic mice were subjected to
   a novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) test, during which their interaction
   with an almond slice located in the center of an open field box was
   measured. There was an interaction between genotype and stress for
   latency to approach the almond and whether or not the almond was
   approached, such that mice with low or absent beta-E displayed a
   stronger aversion to novelty-feeding after stress exposure than did mice
   with normal levels. These data provide evidence for a moderating effect
   of beta-E on the behavioral response to stress. Genotypic differences in
   anxious behavior emerged when mice were stressed prior to behavioral
   assessment, suggesting that beta-E plays a role in coping behavior.
   These findings indicate that genetic variability in sensitivity of the
   beta-E system to stress may contribute, at least in part, to heritable
   differences in stress reactivity as well as vulnerability to
   stress-related psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue analysis is commonly used in ecology and agronomy to portray
   plant nutrient signatures. Nutrient concentration data, or ionomes,
   belong to the compositional data class, i.e., multivariate data that are
   proportions of some whole, hence carrying important numerical
   properties. Statistics computed across raw or ordinary log-transformed
   nutrient data are intrinsically biased, hence possibly leading to wrong
   inferences. Our objective was to present a sound and robust approach
   based on a novel nutrient balance concept to classify plant ionomes. We
   analyzed leaf N, R K, Ca, and Mg of two wild and six domesticated fruit
   species from Canada, Brazil, and New Zealand sampled during reproductive
   stages. Nutrient concentrations were (1) analyzed without
   transformation, (2) ordinary log-transformed as commonly but incorrectly
   applied in practice, (3) additive log-ratio (air) transformed as
   surrogate to stoichiometric rules, and (4) converted to isometric
   log-ratios OH arranged as sound nutrient balance variables. Raw
   concentration and ordinary log transformation both led to biased
   multivariate analysis due to redundancy between interacting nutrients.
   The air- and ilr-transformed data provided unbiased discriminant
   analyses of plant ionomes, where wild and domesticated species formed
   distinct groups and the ionomes of species and cultivars were
   differentiated without numerical bias. The ilr nutrient balance concept
   is preferable to air, because the ilr technique projects the most
   important interactions between nutrients into a convenient Euclidean
   space.This novel numerical approach allows rectifying historical biases
   and supervising phenotypic plasticity in plant nutrition studies.}},

Abstract = {{The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is commonly used to assess risky decision

   research has suggested that IGT data should be analyzed at the

   Participants were 91 undergraduate students (38 male) who completed
   measures of impulsivity and sensation seeking, behavioral activation and
   inhibition, state mood, and the computerized IGT. Results indicated that
   negative mood, drive, impulsivity, and sensation seeking were all

   with Deck D selections. No differences emerged in correlations between
   Decks A and B or Decks A and D. Results indicate that mood and
   personality characteristics differentially relate to selections from the

   assessment of decision making, as personality and fluctuations in
   state-dependent mood could mimic pathological risk-taking if analysis is

Abstract = {{Foraging birds can manage time spent vigilant for predators by forming
   groups of various sizes. However, group size alone will not always
   reliably determine the optimal level of vigilance. For example,
   variation in predation risk or food quality between patches may also be
   influential. In a field setting, we assessed how simultaneous variation
   in predation risk and intake rate affects the relationship between
   vigilance and group size in foraging Ruddy Turnstones Arenaria
   interpres. We compared vigilance, measured as the number of head-ups'
   per unit time, in habitat types that differed greatly in prey energy
   content and proximity to cover from which predators could launch
   surprise attacks. Habitats closer to predator cover provided foragers
   with much higher potential net energy intake rates than habitats further
   from cover. Foragers formed larger and denser flocks on habitats closer
   to cover. Individual vigilance of foragers in all habitats declined with
   increasing flock size and increased with flock density. However,
   vigilance by foragers on habitats closer to cover was always higher for
   a given flock size than vigilance by foragers on habitats further from
   cover, and habitat remained an important predictor of vigilance in
   models including a range of potential confounding variables. Our results
   suggest that foraging Ruddy Turnstones can simultaneously assess
   information on group size and the general likelihood of predator attack
   when determining their vigilance contribution.}},

Abstract = {{Child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) problems are common and
   serious all over the world and are linked to pre-mature deaths and
   serious dysfunction in adult life. Effective interventions have been
   developed in high income countries (HIC), but evidence from low income
   settings is scarce and scattered. The aim of this paper is to identify
   the most promising interventions in the area of global CAMH.
   A systematic review of all randomised controlled trials in CAMH in low
   and middle income countries (LAMIC) was carried out and supplemented by
   1a level evidence from HIC as well as suitable information from child
   programme evaluations and adult studies in LAMIC.
   In behavioural disorders parent training is a highly promising
   intervention, which can successfully improve children's compliance and
   bring down rates of conduct problems significantly. In young children
   cognitive, emotional and behavioural development can be enhanced through
   nutritional supplements and by stimulation through play, praise and
   reading. Trauma treatments can bring positive results even in severely
   traumatised children, who remain in unstable living conditions. In
   developmental disorders, there are successful prevention strategies as
   well as programmes that bring children out of isolation and improve
   their independence. Some classroom-based interventions for adolescents
   have reduced symptoms of common mental disorders as well as risk taking
   behaviours.
   While many results are still tentative the evidence suggests that it is
   possible to develop affordable and feasible interventions that
   significantly improve the lives of affected children, their families and
   their communities around the world.}},

Volume = {{85}},

Abstract = {{Prey often suffer foraging costs associated with antipredator behaviours
   such as vigilance. Migration is one behaviour in ungulates that can lead
   to trade-offs between forage acquisition and predator avoidance.
   However, when forage intake is limited by food-handling time rather than
   by food encounter rate, ungulates can reduce foraging costs by
   synchronizing vigilance with chewing (multitasking). In this study, we
   compared patterns of vigilance, frequency of multitasking and total
   foraging time between migrant and resident individuals in a partially
   migratory elk, Cervus canadensis, population while they were together on
   their sympatric winter range. We used these comparisons to determine
   whether one herd segment had an advantage over the other in terms of
   forage intake and predator avoidance. Using observations of focal
   individuals, we found that residents were better than migrants at
   adjusting vigilance levels to spatial variation in wolf, Canis lupus,
   predation risk associated with a human-caused predation refuge. Migrant
   elk were less vigilant than residents where wolf predation risk was
   highest. Residents probably had an advantage over migrants because they
   were better at mitigating the foraging costs of vigilance by
   synchronizing vigilance with chewing. Migrant elk did not compensate for
   higher foraging costs by altering total activity time. Our study shows
   how foraging behaviours of free-ranging ungulates might contribute to
   demographic differences that lead to the loss of migratory behaviours.

Abstract = {{It is widely assumed that in the late nineteenth century Lobesia botrana
   Den. and Schiff. shifted its food source from a wild shrub (Daphne
   gnidium L.) to vine (Vitis vinifera L.). We explored if host range
   expansion reflects an evolutionary host shift, whereby the new moth-host
   association was linked to adaptive changes. The reaction norms of larval
   survival, adult weight and development time were investigated in L.
   botrana under field conditions. Two moth strains were established from
   vine and daphne, and reciprocal infestations with neonate larvae were
   performed on both host plants over the three larval generations. All
   three traits showed phenotypic plasticity and genetic variation,
   variation for plasticity being only detected in larval survival.
   Comparisons between hosts within strains showed that (1) larval survival
   was higher on vine in 9 of 12 cases, (2) adult weight was lower on vine
   only in the first generation and (3) development time was shorter on
   vine in first generation, shorter on daphne in third generation and
   displayed a sex-related response in the second generation. Comparisons
   between strains within hosts evidenced moth-host adaptation as larval
   survival increased when strains developed on its original host. There
   was also evidence of moth-parasitoid coevolution because parasitism
   level was strain-dependent. We hypothesize that higher larval survival
   on vine, similar adult weight on both hosts in summer generations and
   lower predation risk in vineyards, might be among the fitness-related
   factors explaining evolutionary host shift to and worldwide adaptive
   success on vine of L. botrana.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous forces of selection associated with fluctuating
   environments are recognized as important factors involved in the
   maintenance of inter-individual phenotypic variance within populations.
   Consistent behavioural differences over time and across situations (e.g.
   personality) are increasingly cited as examples of individual variation
   observed within populations. However, the suggestion that heterogeneous
   selective pressures target different animal personalities remains
   largely untested in the wild. In this 5-year study, we investigated the
   dynamics of viability selection on a personality trait, exploration, in
   a population of eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) experiencing
   substantial seasonal variations in weather conditions and food
   availability associated with masting trees. Contrary to our
   expectations, we found no evidence of fluctuating selection on
   exploration. Instead, we found strong disruptive viability selection on
   adult exploration behaviour, independent of seasonal variations.
   Individuals with either low or high exploration scores were almost twice
   as likely to survive over a 6-month period compared with individuals
   with intermediate scores. We found no evidence of viability selection on
   juvenile exploration. Our results highlight that disruptive selection
   might play an important role in the maintenance of phenotypic variance

   were not exposed to predatory fish cues, but we found limited evidence

   Predator diet affected tail morphology and activity, but the latter

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Hunting live prey is risky and thought to require specialized
   adaptations. Therefore, observations of predatory cannibalism in
   otherwise non-carnivorous animals raise questions about its function,
   adaptive significance and evolutionary potential. Here we document
   predatory cannibalism on larger conspecifics in Drosophila melanogaster
   larvae and address its evolutionary significance. We found that under
   crowded laboratory conditions younger larvae regularly attack and
   consume `wandering-stage' conspecifics, forming aggregations mediated by
   chemical cues from the attacked victim. Nutrition gained this way can be
   significant: an exclusively cannibalistic diet was sufficient for normal
   development from eggs to fertile adults. Cannibalistic diet also induced
   plasticity of larval mouth parts. Finally, during 118 generations of
   experimental evolution, replicated populations maintained under larval
   malnutrition evolved enhanced propensity towards cannibalism. These
   results suggest that, at least under laboratory conditions, predation on
   conspecifics in Drosophila is a functional, adaptive behaviour, which
   can rapidly evolve in response to nutritional conditions.}},

   workplace osteoporosis prevention intervention on the dietary and

Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Background: Osteoporosis is a debilitating disease and its risk can be
   reduced through adequate calcium consumption and physical activity. This
   protocol paper describes a workplace-based intervention targeting
   behaviour change in premenopausal women working in sedentary
   occupations.
   Method/Design: A cluster-randomised design was used, comparing the
   efficacy of a tailored intervention to standard care. Workplaces were
   the clusters and units of randomisation and intervention. Sample size
   calculations incorporated the cluster design. Final number of clusters
   was determined to be 16, based on a cluster size of 20 and calcium
   intake parameters (effect size 250 mg, ICC 0.5 and standard deviation
   290 mg) as it required the highest number of clusters. Sixteen
   workplaces were recruited from a pool of 97 workplaces and randomly
   assigned to intervention and control arms (eight in each). Women meeting
   specified inclusion criteria were then recruited to participate.
   Workplaces in the intervention arm received three participatory
   workshops and organisation wide educational activities. Workplaces in
   the control/standard care arm received print resources. Intervention
   workshops were guided by self-efficacy theory and included participatory
   activities such as goal setting, problem solving, local food sampling,
   exercise trials, group discussion and behaviour feedback.
   Outcomes measures were calcium intake (milligrams/day) and physical
   activity level (duration: minutes/week), measured at baseline, four
   weeks and six months post intervention.
   Discussion: This study addresses the current lack of evidence for
   behaviour change interventions focussing on osteoporosis prevention. It
   addresses missed opportunities of using workplaces as a platform to
   target high-risk individuals with sedentary occupations. The
   intervention was designed to modify behaviour levels to bring about risk
   reduction. It is the first to address dietary and physical activity
   components each with unique intervention strategies in the context of
   osteoporosis prevention. The intervention used locally relevant
   behavioural strategies previously shown to support good outcomes in
   other countries. The combination of these elements have not been
   incorporated in similar studies in the past, supporting the study
   hypothesis that the intervention will be more efficacious than standard
   practice in osteoporosis prevention through improvements in calcium
   intake and physical activity.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial and temporal variation in resource abundance and predation risk
   can favor the evolution of phenotypic plasticity as a means of tracking
   changing environments. However, because food abundance and predation
   risk often covary in nature, few studies have separated their effects or
   tested whether different phenotypic traits respond to the same sources
   of environmental variation. We investigated patterns of parental
   investment and behavior over a 7-year period in 2 island populations of
   orange-crowned warblers (Oreothlypis celata) that showed little genetic
   divergence but experienced dramatic temporal variation in rainfall and
   spatial variation in nest predation risk. The amount of rainfall in each
   year was correlated with food abundance, and birds on both islands
   initiated breeding earlier and laid larger clutches in wetter years. In
   contrast, the rate at which parents visited their nests was not affected
   by rainfall but was negatively correlated with nest predation risk both
   within and between islands. Our results suggest that although the
   effects of food availability and nest predation have been viewed as
   mutually exclusive drivers of entire suites of life-history and
   behavioral traits, these traits can differ in their sensitivity to
   resource abundance or mortality risk, and traits that are often

Abstract = {{Sexual selection can operate both before and after mating. For males,
   selection will favor a suite of traits involved in mate acquisition
   (precopulatory) and in the competition among ejaculates to fertilize
   eggs (postcopulatory). Sperm competition theory predicts a trade-off
   between investment in pre- and postcopulatory traits, thus generating
   negative correlations between traits that function during both episodes
   of selection. However, such trade-offs can be difficult to detect
   because they are typically sensitive to the pool of resources available
   for allocation to competing functions. Although theory predicts that
   trade-offs will be more apparent when resources are limiting, there have
   been few attempts to test this prediction. In our study, we used the
   freshwater fish, Poecilia reticulata, to examine how both pre- and
   postcopulatory sexually selected traits simultaneously respond to
   manipulations of diet quantity by comparing behavioral, ornamental, and
   ejaculate traits between males assigned at random to either a ad libitum
   or a restricted food diet. We also explore how the relationships between
   traits that function during pre- and postcopulatory episodes of
   selection are affected by these treatments. Our results reveal that diet
   manipulations influenced the expression of both precopulatory (sexual
   behavior and ornamentation) and postcopulatory sexually selected traits
   (sperm viability), reinforcing the importance of resource acquisition in
   sexual selection. However, our data do not support the hypothesis that
   males trade off their allocation toward these pre- and postcopulatory
   sexually selected traits. Instead, changes in the expression of pre- and
   postcopulatory sexually selected traits appear to occur independently.}},

Abstract = {{A whole-farm, stochastic and dynamic simulation model was developed to
   predict biophysical and economic performance of grazing dairy systems.
   Several whole-farm models simulate grazing dairy systems, but most of
   them work at a herd level. This model, named e-Dairy, differs from the
   few models that work at an animal level, because it allows stochastic
   behaviour of the genetic merit of individual cows for several traits,
   namely, yields of milk, fat and protein, live weight (LW) and body
   condition score (BCS) within a whole-farm model. This model accounts for
   genetic differences between cows, is sensitive to genotype x environment
   interactions at an animal level and allows pasture growth, milk and
   supplements price to behave stochastically. The model includes an
   energy-based animal module that predicts intake at grazing, mammary
   gland functioning and body lipid change. This whole-farm model simulates
   a 365-day period for individual cows within a herd, with cow parameters
   randomly generated on the basis of the mean parameter values, defined as
   input and variance and co-variances from experimental data sets. The
   main inputs of e-Dairy are farm area, use of land, type of pasture, type
   of crops, monthly pasture growth rate, supplements offered, nutritional
   quality of feeds, herd description including herd size, age structure,
   calving pattern, BCS and LW at calving, probabilities of pregnancy,
   average genetic merit and economic values for items of income and costs.
   The model allows to set management policies to define: dry-off cows
   (ceasing of lactation), target pre- and post-grazing herbage mass and
   feed supplementation. The main outputs are herbage dry matter intake,
   annual pasture utilisation, milk yield, changes in BCS and LW, economic
   farm profit and return on assets. The model showed satisfactory accuracy
   of prediction when validated against two data sets from farmlet system
   experiments. Relative prediction errors were <10\% for all variables,
   and concordance correlation coefficients over 0.80 for annual pasture
   utilisation, yields of milk and milk solids (MS; fat plus protein), and
   of 0.69 and 0.48 for LW and BCS, respectively. A simulation of two
   contrasting dairy systems is presented to show the practical use of the
   model. The model can be used to explore the effects of feeding level and
   genetic merit and their interactions for grazing dairy systems,
   evaluating the trade-offs between profit and the associated risk.}},

Abstract = {{In both animal and human behavioral repertoires, classical expected
   utility theory is considered a fundamental element of decision making
   under conditions of uncertainty. This theory has been widely applied to
   problems of animal behavior and evolutionary game theory, as well as to
   human economic behavior. The Allais paradox hinges on the expression of
   avoidance of bankruptcy by humans, or death by starvation in animals.
   This paradox reveals that human behavioral patterns are often
   inconsistent with predictions under the classical expected utility
   theory as formulated by von Neumann and Morgenstern. None of the many
   attempts to reformulate utility theory has been entirely successful in
   resolving this paradox with rigorous logic. We present a simple, but
   novel approach to the theory of decision making, in which utility is
   dependent on current wealth, and in which losses are more heavily
   weighted than gains. Our approach resolves the Allais paradox in a
   manner that is consistent with how humans formulate decisions under
   uncertainty. Our results indicate that animals, including humans, are in
   principle risk-averse. Our restructuring of dynamic utility theory
   presents a basic optimization scheme for sequential or dynamic decisions
   in both animals and humans.}},

Volume = {{170}},

Pages = {{477-484}},

Abstract = {{Objective: In this review, based on recent advances in cognitive
   neuroscience, the author presents a formulation in which the marked
   persistence of anorexia nervosa can be usefully understood as a
   well-ingrained maladaptive habit.
   Method: The author reviewed the relevant literature on the development
   and course of anorexia nervosa and interpreted critical features in
   light of developments in cognitive neuroscience.
   Results: Anorexia nervosa is a well characterized disorder with
   remarkable persistence both across history and among affected
   individuals. Food restriction, the salient behavioral feature of the
   disorder, often begins innocently but gradually takes on a life of its
   own. Over time, it becomes highly entrenched and resistant to change
   through either psychological or pharmacological treatment. Cognitive
   neuroscience has described two related but distinct processes that
   underlie the acquisition of new patterns of behavior, namely,
   action-outcome and stimulus-response learning. It is likely that both
   processes are engaged in the development of anorexia nervosa and that
   stimulus-response learning (that is, habit formation) is critical to the
   persistence of the dieting behavior.
   Conclusions: The formulation of the dieting behavior characteristic of
   anorexia nervosa as a well-entrenched habit provides a basis for
   understanding the striking persistence of this disorder. This model,
   helps explain the resistance of anorexia nervosa to interventions that
   have established efficacy in related disorders and implies that
   addressing the dieting behavior is critical, especially early in the
   course of the illness, before it has become ingrained. (Am J Psychiatry

Abstract = {{The zooplankter Daphnia exilis was found recently in reservoirs of
   central Chile. This species has been described as being tolerant to
   osmotic stress and chemical pollution, although the available
   information about its ecological properties is limited. Motivated by
   likelihood of being witnesses to a biological invasion, in this study we
   contribute to expand the knowledge of this exotic species through
   evaluating its ability to respond phenotypically to two major ecological
   factors: predation risk and food availability. Specifically, we analysed
   shifts in life-history and morphological traits of D. exilis in response
   to fish-released infochemicals, at different food densities. Our results
   revealed that the organisms were affected in their temporal trajectories
   of body size and shape, as well as in maturation time and fertility, in
   response to both predator cues and food availability. The presence of
   fish kairomones led to a decrease of age at maturity, and an increase of
   reproduction size and fecundity, especially at lower levels of
   resources. Our analyses indicated that asymptotic body size was affected
   only by food level, but the rate of increase in body size was sensitive
   to both fish kairomones and food level. The relative length of the tail
   spine decreased during early ontogenetic states, reaching a minimum
   around the age at maturity. This pattern was significantly enhanced in
   the presence of fish kairomones. However, our results did not match
   completely the typical responses of daphnids to fish kairomones. (C)

Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1049-1059}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Early juvenile environments influence trait expression in complex and
   often nonintuitive ways. Although the breadth of these effects is well
   recognized, researchers generally focus on the effect of single
   ecological triggers (such as resource availability, latitude or predator
   presence) on traits within a single dimension (e.g. morphological,
   behavioural or physiological phenotypes). This approach has yielded a
   wealth of knowledge about environmental conditions that trigger
   different plastic allocation strategies and reaction norms of a number
   of traits. However, it tells us little about the way in which early life
   conditions influence resource allocation, yielding differentially
   integrated adult phenotypes. Here, I argue that we must begin to
   understand how complex environments shape the conditional development
   and expression of suites of traits to produce complex, adaptive
   phenotypes. I begin by examining the importance of the juvenile
   environment when attempting to understand phenotypic expression at later
   life history stages. I describe how different types of plasticity affect
   relationships between traits, and I provide four case studies that
   illustrate the influence of plasticity on trait integration, which
   strongly suggests that evolution of norms of reaction must be considered
   if we are to understand the evolution of integrated phenotypes. I next
   highlight the importance of understanding the physiological and genetic
   underpinnings of this plasticity because such poorly understood aspects
   of the phenotype regulate developmental pathways that determine
   phenotypic expression. I conclude with suggestions as to how future
   research can begin to accommodate multidimensional approaches, and in
   doing so, further our understanding of an integrated phenotype concept.

Abstract = {{The evolution of male ornamentation often reflects compromises between
   sexual and natural selection, but it may also be influenced by
   phenotypic plasticity. We investigated the developmental plasticity of
   male colour ornamentation in Trinidadian guppies in response to two
   environmental variables that covary in nature: predation risk and food
   availability. We found that exposure to chemical predator cues delayed
   the development of pigment-based colour elements, which are conspicuous
   to visual-oriented predators. Predator cues also reduced the size of
   colour elements at the time of maturity and caused adult males to be
   less colourful. To the best of our knowledge, these findings provide the
   first example of a plastic reduction in the development of a sexually
   selected male ornament in response to predator cues. The influence of
   predator cues on ornamentation probably affects individual fitness by
   reducing conspicuousness to predators, but could reduce attractiveness
   to females. Reduced food availability during development caused males to
   delay the development of colour elements and mature later, probably
   reflecting a physiological constraint, but their coloration at maturity
   and later in adulthood was largely unaffected, suggesting that variation
   in food quantity without variation in quality does not contribute to
   condition dependence of the trait.}},

Abstract = {{Group decisions on the timing of mutually exclusive activities pose a
   dilemma: monopolized decision-making by a single leader compromises the
   optimal timing of activities by the others, while independent
   decision-making by all group members undermines group coherence. Theory
   suggests that initiation of foraging should be determined by
   physiological demand in social foragers, thereby resolving the dilemma
   of group coordination. However, empirical support is scant, perhaps
   because intrinsic qualities predisposing individuals to leadership
   (social status, experience or personality), or their interactions with
   satiation level, have seldom been simultaneously considered. Here, we
   examine which females initiated foraging in eider (Somateria mollissima)
   brood-rearing coalitions, characterized by female dominance hierarchies
   and potentially large individual differences in energy requirements due
   to strenuous breeding effort. Several physiological and social factors,
   except for female breeding experience and boldness towards predators,
   explained foraging initiation. Initiators spent a larger proportion of
   time submerged during foraging bouts, had poorer body condition and
   smaller structural size, but they were also aggressive and occupied
   central positions. Initiation probability also declined with female
   group size as expected given random assignment of initiators. However,
   the relative importance of physiological predictors of leadership
   propensity (active foraging time, body condition, structural size)
   exceeded those of social predictors (aggressiveness, spatial position)
   by an order of magnitude. These results confirm recent theoretical work
   suggesting that `leading according to need' is an evolutionary viable
   strategy regardless of group heterogeneity or underlying dominance

   Invasion Success}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Chemical cues provide aquatic organisms with sensory
   information that guides behavioural responses and thus interactions
   among themselves, each other and the environment. Chemical cues are
   considered important for predator avoidance, foraging, larval settlement
   and broadcast spawning in aquatic environments. However, the
   significance of their role as drivers of direct interactions between
   heterospecifics has been largely overlooked.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: A video camera and a demarcated arena
   were used in situ to record behavioural responses of three native
   gastropod species, Assiminea cf. capensis, Melanoides tuberculata and
   Coriandria durbanensis, exposed to treatments representing chemical cues
   released by a non-native invasive gastropod, Tarebia granifera. The
   responses were measured quantitatively as displacement and orientation
   of movement at locations in St Lucia Estuary, within the iSimangaliso
   Wetland Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site on the east coast of South
   Africa. All native gastropods exhibited a negative taxis response to
   chemical cues released by T. granifera, while T. granifera individuals
   responded randomly to conspecifics. Displacement was measured relative
   to the source of the extract, the number of steps taken were determined
   with path analysis and orientation was determined from the mean (+/-
   95\% CIs) turning angles, with significant negative turning angles
   representing negative taxis. Responses to treatments corresponding to
   the environment and conspecifics were random and undirected, indicating
   kinesis.
   Conclusion/Significance: This study presents evidence for interactions
   driven by chemical cues between a non-native invasive gastropod and
   several gastropods native to South Africa. The results indicate that
   chemical cues can facilitate invasion success as the behavioural
   response of native gastropods is to move away allowing additional food
   and space resources to become available to T. granifera.}},

Abstract = {{Strong evidence has accumulated over the last several years, showing
   that low sleep quantity and/or quality plays an important role in the
   elevation of blood pressure. We hypothesized that increasing sleep
   duration serves as an effective behavioral strategy to reduce blood
   pressure in prehypertension or type 1 hypertension. Twenty-two
   participants with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension, and habitual
   sleep durations of 7h or less, participated in a 6-week intervention
   study. Subjects were randomized to a sleep extension group (48 +/-
   12years, N=13) aiming to increase bedtime by 1h daily over a 6-week
   intervention period, or to a sleep maintenance group (47 +/- 12years,
   N=9) aiming to maintain habitual bedtimes. Both groups received sleep
   hygiene instructions. Beat-to-beat blood pressure was monitored over
   24h, and 24-h urine and a fasting blood sample were collected pre- and
   post-intervention. Subjects in the sleep extension group increased their
   actigraphy-assessed daily sleep duration by 35 +/- 9min, while subjects
   in the sleep maintenance condition increased slightly by 4 +/- 9min

   not significant, it did not differ from the blood pressure reduction in
   the sleep extension group (P=0.15 for interaction effect). These changes
   were not paralleled by pre- to post-intervention changes in inflammatory
   or sympatho-adrenal markers, nor by changes in caloric intake. While
   these preliminary findings have to be interpreted with caution due to
   the small sample size, they encourage future investigations to test
   whether behavioral interventions designed to increase sleep duration

Abstract = {{The interaction between temperature and diet quality can affect the life
   history of ectotherms. The rate and ratio at which protein and
   carbohydrate are obtained from food are important aspects of diet
   quality, and insects have a well-developed capacity to adjust their
   feeding behaviour and post-ingestive physiology to regulate intake and
   allocation of these nutrients. If the supply of protein and carbohydrate
   varies with temperature (e.g. via effects on intake, digestion or
   metabolism), then herbivorous insects can use thermoregulatory behaviour
   to help achieve nutritional homeostasis. When fed the host grass
   Triticum aestivum, Locusta migratoria nymphs absorbed and allocated
   protein and carbohydrate to growth with the same efficiency at 38
   degrees C as at 32 degrees C; however, at the higher temperature, they
   ingested more food. In contrast, when feeding on Themeda triandra, the
   nymphs absorbed carbohydrate with higher efficiency at 32 degrees C, and
   protein at 38 degrees C. Using synthetic diets, we induced either a
   protein or a carbohydrate deficiency in experimental insects and showed
   that locusts placed in a thermal gradient following a meal of T.
   triandra selected 32 degrees C when deprived of carbohydrate, and 38
   degrees C when deprived of protein. This capacity to use
   thermoregulatory behaviour to redress an imposed nutritional imbalance
   improved with experience of feeding on T. triandra. As predicted,
   locusts fed T. aestivum always chose higher temperatures, irrespective
   of nutritional state. Our results have consequences for understanding

Abstract = {{Wild animals increasingly inhabit human-influenced environments such as
   forest fragments amid agricultural systems. Dietary studies provide a
   means of assessing wildlife responses to anthropogenic habitat changes.
   Chimpanzees are specialist frugivores that consume other plant parts,
   e.g., fibrous pith and leaves, in greater amounts during fruit
   shortages. I examined the plant diet and seasonal foraging strategies of
   chimpanzees inhabiting small forest fragments within a cultivated
   landscape in Uganda. I determined diet over 13 mo via systematic fecal
   analysis, supplemented by direct observation and feeding trace evidence.
   I identified important foods and examined their role as seasonal
   fallbacks. Diet composition and breadth were overall species typical.
   Chimpanzees were highly frugivorous and the fruit component of fecal
   samples exceeded that of nonfruit fiber in all months. Forest fruit
   availability fluctuated seasonally, including a 3-mo low fruiting
   season, when overall fruit intake declined. During this time chimpanzees
   pursued a mixed strategy of increasing fiber consumption and feeding
   more heavily on energy-rich cultivars, including those obtained through
   crop raiding. The data suggest that exploiting agricultural fruits
   helped chimpanzees maintain a fruit-dominated diet when forest fruit was
   scarce. No evidence suggested this disturbed forest-farm mosaic is a
   food-impoverished habitat for chimpanzees overall. Nevertheless,
   cultivar feeding creates conflict with people and the high nutritional
   quality of crops is likely offset by the inherent risk associated with
   obtaining them. This study adds to growing evidence of ecological and
   behavioral adaptability of Pan troglodytes in response to anthropogenic
   habitat alteration. Targeted conservation of key natural foods for
   wildlife -particularly fallbacks- would help reduce conflicts and

Abstract = {{Life expectancy in the last century has greatly increased although, in
   most industrialized countries, this has been paralleled by an increased
   incidence of neurodegenerative disorders, in addition to cardiovascular
   and metabolic pathologies. The p66(Shc) gene has emerged as a novel
   gerontogene affecting health throughout life and during aging. In the
   last decade, studies on p66(Shc) knock-out mice have indicated that this
   gene is a crucial regulator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and
   is involved in age-related dysfunctions. p66(Shc-/-) mice show indeed a
   healthy phenotype characterized by greater brain and behavioral
   plasticity - associated to increased central levels of the neurotrophin
   Bran-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) - in addition to reduced
   oxidative stress, fat accumulation and incidence of metabolic and
   cardiovascular pathologies. Studies performed in a semi-naturalistic
   setting, involving exposure to low temperatures and food shortage
   indicate that p66(Shc) has been conserved through evolution because of
   its role as ``thrifty gene{''} in energy metabolism. This feature, which
   allows survival in harsh natural conditions, can be deleterious when
   food is constantly available, as in westernized lifestyles, leading to
   fat accumulation and predisposing to metabolic, cardiovascular diseases
   and accelerating brain aging. Being at the crossroad of signaling
   pathways involved in both central and peripheral stress responses and in
   the regulation of energy homeostasis, p66(Shc) is a good candidate
   molecule to address the mechanisms underlying healthy aging and to be
   targeted for the development of novel pharmacological tools for the
   prevention or cure of age-related pathologies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Chronic exposure to stressors has been shown to suppress immune function
   in vertebrates, making them more susceptible to pathogens. It is less
   clear, however, whether many natural stressors are immunosuppressive.
   Moreover, whether stressors make disease more likely or more severe in
   populations is unclear because animals respond to stressors both
   behaviorally and physiologically. We tested whether chronic exposure to
   three natural stressors of wood frog tadpoles-high-densities,
   predator-cues, and low-food conditions-influence their susceptibility to
   a lethal ranavirus both individually in laboratory experiments, and
   collectively in outdoor mesocosms. Prior to virus exposure, we observed
   elevated corticosterone only in low-food treatments, although other
   treatments altered rates of growth and development as well as tadpole
   behavior. None of the treatments, however, increased susceptibility to
   ranavirus as measured by the proportion of tadpoles that became infected

   in the mesocosms was actually lower in the high-density treatment even
   though most individuals became infected, largely because of increased
   rates of metamorphosis. Overall we find no support for the hypothesis
   that chronic exposure to common, ecologically relevant challenges
   necessarily elevates corticosterone levels in a population or leads to
   more severe ranaviral disease or epidemics. Conditions may, however,
   conspire to make ranavirus infection more common in metamorphosing

Abstract = {{Socially foraging animals can search for resources themselves (produce)
   or exploit the discoveries made by others (scrounge). The extensive
   literature on producer-scrounger dynamics has mainly focused on scramble
   competition over readily accessible resources, thereby largely
   neglecting the variety of scrounging techniques individuals may use as
   well as the role of investment in food handling. Furthermore, although
   individual differences in boldness and social factors such as dominance
   have been described to influence foraging tactics, their potential
   interplay and effect in foraging contexts beyond the conventional
   producer-scrounger game remains unclear. We investigated the
   relationship between social-foraging tactic use and dominance, pair
   bonds and boldness in a foraging experiment focused on food handling and
   alternative scrounging tactics. We conducted a producer-scrounger
   experiment in a captive group of rooks in which individuals could
   produce by pulling up baited strings, or scrounge by retrieving fallen
   food items or joining a producer. There were three key findings: (1)
   dominant rooks adopted the producer tactic more often and more
   successfully than subordinates; (2) producing and scrounging by
   tolerance led to mixed benefits to paired birds; (3) bold birds
   scrounged by retrieving more often than shy birds. Importantly,
   individuals were highly consistent in their tactic use across conditions
   differing in food availability. Our study highlights the importance of
   taking both social factors and boldness (heterogeneity) into account
   when studying social-foraging dynamics and offers empirical data on food
   handling and alternative scrounging tactics that can be used to extend
   current models and experiments on social foraging. (C) 2013 The

Volume = {{85}},

Abstract = {{Predators that have learned to associate warning coloration with
   toxicity often continue to include aposematic prey in their diet in
   order to gain the nutrients and energy that they contain. As body size
   is widely reported to correlate with energetic content, we predicted
   that prey size would affect predators' decisions to eat aposematic prey.
   We used a well-established system of wild-caught European starlings,
   Sturnus vulgaris, foraging on mealworms, Tenebrio molitor, to test how
   the size of undefended (water-injected) and defended (quinine-injected)
   prey, on different coloured backgrounds, affected birds' decisions to
   eat defended prey. We found that birds ate fewer defended prey, and less
   quinine, when undefended prey were large compared with when they were
   small, but that the size of the defended prey had no effect on the
   numbers eaten. Consequently, we found no evidence that the mass of the
   defended prey or the overall mass of prey ingested affected the amount
   of toxin that a predator was willing to ingest, and instead the mass of
   undefended prey eaten was more important. This is a surprising finding,
   challenging the assumptions of state-dependent models of aposematism and
   mimicry, and highlighting the need to understand better the mechanisms
   of predator decision making. In addition, the birds did not learn to
   discriminate visually between defended and undefended prey based on
   size, but only on the basis of colour. This suggests that colour signals
   may be more salient to predators than size differences, allowing
   Batesian mimics to benefit from aposematic models even when they differ
   in size. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published on behalf of The Association

Abstract = {{Parents have limited resources and, when simultaneously rearing multiple
   offspring, are expected to favour particularly valuable offspring.
   Because offspring characteristics like sex and ornamentation influence
   future reproductive value, these traits may influence parental
   favouritism. Parents in high-quality nest environments should prefer
   sons because sons show greater variability in reproductive potential
   than daughters. Moreover, when ornamental plumage coloration is
   condition dependent, parents should favour brighter over duller sons. We
   tested parental favouritism for fledgling-aged eastern bluebirds, Sialia
   sialis, a species in which fledglings display condition-dependent
   UV-blue coloration on their wings and tails. We simultaneously
   threatened two offspring with mock predators and recorded which
   offspring the parents defended. In accordance with the predicted value
   of offspring, fathers protected brighter over duller sons and protected
   sons over daughters when mated to high-quality mates. Mothers did not
   discriminate between sons and daughters or between brighter and duller
   sons. These results suggest that ornamental plumage coloration in
   juvenile bluebirds functions as a signal in father-off-spring
   interactions. Paternal and maternal responses of eastern bluebirds to
   offspring characteristics may differ because of differences in parental
   allocation strategies or because males assess offspring quality based on
   variation in plumage coloration, a trait that also functions in
   competitive interactions among adult males. (C) 2013 The Association for

Abstract = {{Males of many species prefer females that are more fecund, novel and/or
   sexually receptive. Males assess the desirability of potential mates
   using female morphological traits, including size and sexual coloration,
   or olfactory cues. However, few studies have directly examined how
   female behaviour influences male mate choice, which is surprising
   because males often respond strongly to female behaviours. We examined
   factors influencing male preference using the eastern fence lizard,
   Sceloporus undulatus, a species with a large repertoire of behavioural
   displays. Males were presented with two tethered females in a paired
   choice test, and we measured the time that males spent associating with
   and courting (shuddering to) each female. We recorded female behaviour,
   including approach to and retreat from the male, sidle-hopping (a
   rejection behaviour) and pushups. Males associated more with females
   that (1) approached and retreated from them, (2) did not sidlehop and
   (3) had relatively higher body condition. Likewise, males shuddered more
   to females that approached and retreated from them. Approach and retreat
   behaviours may advertise a female's readiness to mate, as these
   behaviours can heighten male interest, suggesting that males may be most
   likely to invest in courtship once females indicate their willingness to
   mate. Neither the female's pushup behaviour nor her snout-vent length
   influenced a male's tendency to associate with or court her. These
   results provide evidence that female behaviour has an important
   influence on male courtship behaviour. Incorporating measures of female
   behaviour into future studies on male mate choice may be illuminating
   and provide a greater ability to predict male preference. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{How does an organism's internal state direct its actions? At one moment
   an animal forages for food with acrobatic feats such as tree climbing
   and jumping between branches. At another time, it travels along the
   ground to find water or a mate, exposing itself to predators along the
   way. These behaviors are costly in terms of energy or physical risk, and
   the likelihood of performing one set of actions relative to another is
   strongly modulated by internal state. For example, an animal in energy
   deficit searches for food and a dehydrated animal looks for water. The
   crosstalk between physiological state and motivational processes
   influences behavioral intensity and intent, but the underlying neural
   circuits are poorly understood. Molecular genetics along with
   optogenetic and pharmacogenetic tools for perturbing neuron function
   have enabled cell type-selective dissection of circuits that mediate
   behavioral responses to physiological state changes. Here, we review
   recent progress into neural circuit analysis of hunger in the mouse by
   focusing on a starvation-sensitive neuron population in the hypothalamus

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Predation, predation risk, and resource quality affect suites of prey
   traits that collectively impact individual fitness, population dynamics,
   and community structure. However, studies of multitrophic level effects
   generally focus on a single prey trait, failing to capture trade-offs
   among suites of covarying traits that govern population responses and
   emergent community patterns. We used structural equation models (SEM) to
   summarize the non-lethal and lethal effects of crayfish, Procambarus
   fallax, and phosphorus (P) addition, which affected prey food quality
   (periphyton), on the interactive effects of behavioral, morphological,
   developmental, and reproductive traits of snails, Planorbella duryi.
   Univariate and multivariate analyses suggested trade-offs between
   production (growth, reproduction) and defense (foraging behavior, shell
   shape) traits of snails in response to non-lethal crayfish and P
   addition, but few lethal effects. SEM revealed that non-lethal crayfish
   effects indirectly limited per capita offspring standing stock by
   increasing refuge use, slowing individual growth, and inducing snails to
   produce thicker, compressed shells. The negative effects of non-lethal
   crayfish on snails were strongest with P addition; snails increased
   allocation to shell defense rather than growth or reproduction. However,
   compared to ambient conditions, P addition with non-lethal crayfish
   still yielded greater per capita offspring standing stock by speeding
   individual snail growth enabling them to produce more offspring that
   also grew faster. Increased refuge use in response to non-lethal
   crayfish led to a non-lethal trophic cascade that altered the spatial
   distribution of periphyton. Independent of crayfish effects, snails
   stimulated periphyton growth through nutrient regeneration. These
   findings illustrate the importance of studying suites of traits that
   reveal costs associated with inducing different traits and how
   expressing those traits impacts population and community level
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Wildlife is exposed to natural (e.g., food availability and quality,
   parasitism) and anthropogenic stressors (e.g., habitat fragmentation,
   toxicants). Individual variables (e.g., age, gender) affect behaviour
   and physiology of animals. Together, these parameters can create both
   great inter-individual variations in health indicators and
   interpretation difficulties. We investigated the relevance of body
   condition and somatic indices (liver, kidneys) as indicators of health
   status in wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus, n= 560) captured along a metal
   pollution gradient in four landscape types (30 sampling squares 500-m
   sided). The indices were calculated using a recently proposed standard
   major axis regression instead of an ordinary least square regression.
   After considering age and gender for the body condition index, no
   landscape type influence was detected in the indices. However, important
   index variability was observed between sampling squares; this effect was
   included as a random effect in linear models. After integrating all
   individual and environmental variables that may affect the indices,
   cadmium (Cd) concentrations in both the liver and kidneys were
   negatively related to body condition and liver indices only for
   individuals from highly contaminated sites. Lead in the liver was
   negatively related to the liver index, and Cd in kidneys was positively
   linked to the kidney index, potentially suggesting metal-induced stress.
   However, interpretation of these indices as a wildlife ecotoxicology
   tool should be performed with caution due to the sensitivity of

Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{Allostatis is the process of maintaining homeostatis through behavioural
   or physiological responses to challenges, and its cumulative energetic
   cost is termed allostatic load. The allostatic load hypothesis predicts
   that hunger and the mechanisms that establish and maintain social
   dominance should have a strong impact on allostatic load. In spotted
   hyaenas, dominance between twin siblings emerges during intense early
   competition for maternal milk and involves trained winner/loser effects.
   Conflict over access to teats declines with age as behavioural dominance
   conventions are established. In young litters, the allostatic load of
   subordinates measured in terms of faecal glucocorticoid metabolite
   concentrations (fGMCs) should be higher than that of dominants. When low
   milk provisioning threatens survival, hungry subordinates are more
   assertive, particularly when competing against a dominant sister.
   Dominants challenged by assertive subordinates should have allostatic
   loads and fGMCs above those of dominants with subordinates that adhere
   to dominance conventions. We show that in young litters, subordinates
   had significantly higher fGMCs than dominants, and dominant sisters had
   significantly higher fGMCs than dominant brothers. When hungry, both
   dominants and subordinates had significantly higher fGMCs than when fed.

   Although it is impossible to include all possible natural factors in

   advocate redesigning standard testing procedures to include
   theoretically most potent interactions. We also point out a few
   potentially important factors that have not been studied enough so far.
   The available data allowed us to identify temperature and O-2 depletion
   as the most critical factors that should be included in ecotoxicity
   testing as soon as possible. Temporal limitations and fluctuations in
   food availability also appear important, but at this point more
   fundamental research in this area is necessary before making decisions
   on their inclusion in risk assessment procedures. We propose using
   specific experimental designs, such as Box-Behnken or Central Composite,

   individual and interactive effects with greater precision and without
   increasing the effort and costs of tests dramatically. Factorial design
   can lead to more powerful tests and help to extend the validity of

Abstract = {{Ontogenetic changes in antipredator behavior optimize survival of

   simulated predator either by postural and vocal threats, sometimes
   followed by biting, or alternatively by a rapid escape. The former
   ``confrontational{''} and the latter ``avoidance{''} behavior rarely
   occurs in a sequence; in fact, they represent mutually exclusive
   defensive strategies. We examined 552 individuals of a leopard gecko (E.
   macularius) of various ages, from hatching up to adulthood (31 months).
   Each experimental animal was exposed to a sequence of five
   ``water-spraying{''} and ten ``stick{''} (stick poking on base of the
   tail) stimuli, and the emitted behavior was recorded. We analyzed the
   effects of age, body size, body condition, adult-juvenile coloration,
   and sex on observed behavioral traits. The results showed that in the
   case of water-spraying stimulus, the usage of deterrent vocalization or
   escape tactic was affected by age and condition. In addition to that,
   using deterrent vocalization was influenced by the coloration of the
   animal. Stick stimulus evokes antipredator strategies that correspond
   with age and coloration (deterrent vocalization) and also with
   standardized body size (escape). Thus, leopard geckos exhibit clear
   ontogenetic change of defensive strategies, from
   threat-vocalization-bite strategy prevailing in juveniles to an escape
   strategy typical for adults. This behavioral change is accompanied by
   the ontogenetic switch of coloration from presumably warning contrasting
   light-dark banded pattern of juveniles to a cryptic spotted coloration

Abstract = {{The impact of temperature during incubation and gestation has been
   tested in various reptiles; the postnatal period has been rarely
   investigated however. Three groups of newborn aspic vipers (Vipera
   aspis) were placed under contrasted thermal regimes during 7 months: (1)
   a cool 23 degrees C constant regime, (2) a warm 28 degrees C constant
   regime, and (3) an optimal regime with free-access to a wide range of
   temperatures. Later, all the snakes were placed under hibernation
   conditions (6 degrees C) during 3 months. Finally all the snakes were
   placed in the optimal thermal regime during 2 additional months. The
   total duration of the experiment was of 12 months. Body mass and feeding
   rates were recorded weekly, body size was measured monthly. We also
   assessed locomotor performance and recorded several behavioral traits
   (e.g., defensive and predatory behaviors). As expected, snakes raised
   under cool temperatures exhibited low feeding rate, growth rate, body
   condition, and they exhibited poor locomotor performance; they also
   displayed marked defensive behaviors (e.g., high number of defensive
   bites) whilst hesitating during longer periods to bite a prey. Such
   behavioral effects were detected at the end of the experiment (i.e., 5
   months after exposure to contrasted thermal treatments {[}3 months of
   hibernation plus 2 months of optimal regime]), revealing long term
   effects. Surprisingly, growth rate and locomotor performance were not
   different between the two other groups, warm constant 28 degrees C
   versus optimal regimes (albeit several behavioral traits differed),
   suggesting that the access to a wide range of ambient temperatures was
   not a crucial factor. J. Exp. Zool. 319A:310-318, 2013. (c) 2013 (c)

Abstract = {{The balance between the costs and benefits of conspicuous animal
   communication signals ensures that signal expression relates to the
   quality of the bearer. Signal plasticity enables males to enhance
   conspicuous signals to impress mates and competitors and to reduce
   signal expression to lower energetic and predation-related signaling
   costs when competition is low. While signal plasticity may benefit the
   signaler, it can compromise the reliability of the information conveyed
   by the signals. In this paper we review the effect of signal plasticity
   on the reliability of the electrocommunication signal of the gymnotiform
   fish Brachyhypopomus gauderio. We (1) summarize the endocrine regulation
   of signal plasticity, (2) explore the regulation of signal plasticity in
   females, (3) examine the information conveyed by the signal, (4) show
   how that information changes when the signal changes, and (5) consider
   the energetic strategies used to sustain expensive signaling. The
   electric organ discharge (EOD) of B. gauderio changes in response to
   social environment on two time scales. Two hormone classes,
   melanocortins and androgens, underlie the short-term and long-term
   modulation of signal amplitude and duration observed during social
   interaction. Population density drives signal amplitude enhancement,
   unexpectedly improving the reliability with which the signal predicts
   the signaler's size. The signal's second phase elongation predicts
   androgen levels and male reproductive condition. Males sustain signal
   enhancement with dietary intake, but when food is limited, they `go for
   broke' and put extra energy into electric signals. Cortisol diminishes
   EOD parameters, but energy-limited males offset cortisol effects by
   boosting androgen levels. While physiological constraints are sufficient
   to maintain signal amplitude reliability, phenotypic integration and
   signaling costs maintain reliability of signal duration, consistent with
   theory of honest signaling.}},

Abstract = {{While the eukaryotic genome is the same throughout all somatic cells in
   an organism, there are specific structures and functions that discern
   one type of cell from another. These differences are due to the cell's
   unique gene expression patterns that are determined during cellular
   differentiation. Interestingly, these cell-specific gene expression
   patterns can be affected by an organism's environment throughout its
   lifetime leading to phenotypical changes that have the potential of
   altering risk of some diseases. Both cell-specific gene expression
   signatures and environment mediated changes in expression patterns can
   be explained by a complex network of modifications to the DNA, histone
   proteins and degree of DNA packaging called epigenetic marks. Several
   areas of research have formed to study these epigenetic modifications,
   including DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling
   and microRNA (miRNA). The original definition of epigenetics
   incorporates inheritable but reversible phenomena that affect gene
   expression without altering base pairs. Even though not all of the above
   listed epigenetic traits have demonstrated heritability, they can all
   alter gene transcription without modification to the underlying genetic
   sequence. Because these epigenetic patterns can also be affected by an
   organism's environment, they serve as an important bridge between life
   experiences and phenotypes. Epigenetic patterns may change throughout
   one's lifespan, by an early life experience, environmental exposure or
   nutritional status. Epigenetic signatures influenced by the environment
   may determine our appearance, behavior, stress response, disease
   susceptibility, and even longevity. The interaction between types of
   epigenetic modifications in response to environmental factors and how
   environmental cues affect epigenetic patterns will further elucidate how
   gene transcription can be affectively altered. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Nutritional factors play a life-long role in human health. Indeed, there
   is growing evidence that one of the mechanisms by which nutrients and
   bioactive compounds affect metabolic traits is epigenetics. Complex
   interactions among food components and histone modifications, DNA
   methylation, non-coding RNA expression and chromatin remodeling factors
   lead to a dynamic regulation of gene expression that controls the
   cellular phenotype. Although perinatal period is the time of highest
   phenotypic plasticity, contributing largely to developmental
   programming, also during adulthood there is evidence about a nutritional
   influence on epigenetic regulation. Similarly to type 2 diabetes,
   hypertension, atherosclerosis and other metabolic disorders, obesity
   predisposition and weight loss outcomes have been repeatedly associated
   to changes in epigenetic patterns. Different non-nutritional risk
   factors that usually accompany obesity seem also to be involved in these
   epigenetic modifications, especially hyperglycemia, inflammation,
   hypoxia and oxidative stress. There are currently three major objectives
   in epigenetic research in relation to obesity: to search for epigenetic
   biomarkers to predict future health problems or detect the individuals
   at most risk, to understand the obesity-related environmental factors
   that could modulate gene expression by affecting epigenetic mechanisms,
   and to study novel therapeutic strategies based on nutritional or
   pharmacological agents that can modify epigenetic marks. At this level,
   the major tasks are: development of robust epigenetic biomarkers of
   weight regulation, description of those epigenetic marks more
   susceptible to be modified by dietary exposures, identification of the
   active ingredients (and the doses) that alter the epigenome, assessment
   of the real importance of other obesity-related factors on epigenetic
   regulation, determination of the period of life in which best results
   are obtained, and understanding the importance of the inheritance of
   these epigenetic marks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Because species interactions are often context-dependent, abiotic
   factors such as temperature and biotic factors such as food quality may
   alter species interactions with potential consequences to ecosystem
   structure and function. For example, altered predator-prey interactions
   may influence the dynamics of trophic cascades, affecting net primary
   production. In a three-year field experiment, we manipulated a
   plant-grasshopper-spider food chain in mesic tallgrass prairie to
   investigate the effects of temperature and food quality on grasshopper
   performance, and to understand the direct and indirect tritrophic
   interactions that contribute to trophic cascades. Because spiders are
   active at cooler temperatures than grasshoppers in our system, we
   hypothesized that predator effects would be strongest in cooled
   treatments, and weakest in warmed treatments. Grasshopper spider
   interactions were highly context-dependent and varied significantly with
   food quality, temperature treatment and year. Spiders most often reduced
   grasshopper survival in the cooled and ambient temperature treatments,
   but had little to no effect on grasshopper survival in the warmed
   treatments, as hypothesized. In some years, plants compensated for
   grasshopper herbivory and trophic cascades were not observed despite
   significant effects of predators on grasshopper survival. However, in
   the year they were observed, trophic cascades only occurred in cooled
   treatments where predator effects on grasshoppers were strongest.
   Predicting ecosystem responses to climate change will require an
   understanding of how temperature influences species interactions. Our
   results demonstrate that changes in daily temperature regimes can alter
   predator-prey interactions among arthropods with consequences for
   ecosystem processes such as primary production and the relative
   importance of top-down and bottom-up processes.}},

Abstract = {{Animals modify their foraging strategies in response to environmental
   changes that affect foraging performance. In some species, cleptobiosis
   represents an alternative strategy for resource access. The
   environmental factors that favor the incidence or prevalence of
   cleptobiosis, however, are poorly described. The cleptobiotic
   Neotropical ant Ectatomma ruidum is characterized by a high frequency of
   thievery behavior, a specific type of intraspecific cleptobiosis, in
   which specialized thief workers insinuate themselves into nests of
   neighboring colonies and intercept food items brought into these nests.
   Here, we evaluate how colonies adjust thievery behavior in response to
   food availability. We supplemented food availability and measured how
   the incidence and intensity of thievery responded to resource
   availability. We found that the incidence and intensity of thievery
   decline in response to supplemental food, suggesting that thievery
   behavior is a response to resource limitation at the population scale.
   This finding indicates that the phenomenon of intraspecific thievery,

Abstract = {{Background Ingestion of sweet food is driven by central reward circuits
   and restrained by endocrine and neurocrine satiety signals. The specific
   influence of sucrose intake on central affective and reward circuitry
   and alterations of these mechanisms in the obese are incompletely
   understood. For this, we hypothesized that (i) similar brain regions are
   engaged by the stimulation of sweet taste receptors by sucrose and by
   non-nutrient sweeteners and (ii) during visual food-related cues, obese
   subjects show greater brain responses to sucrose compared with lean
   controls. Methods In a double-blind, crossover design, 10 obese and 10
   lean healthy females received a sucrose or a non-nutrient sweetened
   beverage prior to viewing food or neutral images. BOLD signal was
   measured using a 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner. Key Results Viewing food images
   after ingestion of either drink was associated with engagement of
   similar brain regions (amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, anterior
   insula). Obese differed from lean subjects in behavioral and brain
   responses rating both beverages as less tasteful and satisfying, yet
   demonstrating greater brain responses. Obese subjects also showed
   engagement of an additional brain network (including anterior insula,
   anterior cingulate, hippocampus, and amygdala) only after sucrose
   ingestion. Conclusions \& Inferences Obese subjects had a reduced
   behavioral hedonic response, yet a greater engagement of affective brain
   networks, particularly after sucrose ingestion, suggesting that in obese
   subjects, lingual and gut-derived signaling generate less central
   hedonic effects than food-related memories in response to visual cues,

Abstract = {{The conflict between siblings over how parental resources are divided
   has promoted the evolution of specific behaviour to outcompete each
   other. Young animals look out for parents' arrival in order to start
   begging as quickly as possible, since a rapid begging reaction increases
   the likelihood of being fed before nestmates. If the young can
   physically intercept the parents, selection might be operating on the
   offspring ability to monitor parent arrival (vigilance towards parents)
   and any sudden modifications in siblings' behaviour (vigilance towards
   siblings). To investigate the adaptive value of nestling vigilance in
   the context of family interactions, we recorded which direction barn owl
   Tyto alba siblings were facing in 89 two-chick broods before the first
   parental feeding visit of the night. Nestlings were more vigilant
   towards nest entrance than expected by chance suggesting that vigilance
   towards parents is an important component of sibling competition. When
   positioned near the nest-box entrance where parents predictably deliver
   food, the younger individual (i.e. junior) looked more towards the
   entrance than its older sibling. Thus, when the likelihood of obtaining
   a food item is relatively high, juniors are more vigilant than seniors
   to detect the incoming parent. When positioned at the back of the nest,
   the senior looked relatively more frequently towards its sibling than
   the junior did in the same situation. This suggests that when the
   likelihood of obtaining a food item is relatively low, seniors are more
   vigilant than juniors to observe their sibling. Because vigilance was
   not related to hunger level and prey obtaining, we propose the
   hypothesis that vigilance towards parents and siblings only indirectly
   influences the outcome of sibling competition.}},

Abstract = {{Immune function can be modulated by multiple physiological factors,
   including nutrition and reproductive state. Because these factors can
   vary throughout an individual's lifetime as a result of environmental
   conditions (affecting nutrition) or life-history stage (e. g. entering
   the adult reproduction stage), we must carefully examine the degree to
   which developmental versus adult conditions shape performance of the
   immune system. We investigated how variation in dietary access to
   carotenoid pigments - a class of molecules with immunostimulatory
   properties that females deposit into egg yolks - during three different
   developmental time points affected adult immunological and reproductive
   traits in female mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). In males and
   females of other avian species, carotenoid access during development
   affects carotenoid assimilation ability, adult sexual ornamentation and
   immune function, while carotenoid access during adulthood can increase
   immune response and reproductive investment (e. g. egg-laying capacity,
   biliverdin deposition in eggshells). We failed to detect effects of
   developmental carotenoid supplementation on adult immune function

   relationships between circulating carotenoid levels during adulthood and

   biliverdin concentration in bile and KLH-specific antibody production.
   These results are consistent with the view that adult physiological

Abstract = {{Acoustic noise has the potential to cause stress, to distract and to
   mask important sounds, and thus to affect behaviour. Human activities
   have added considerable noise to both terrestrial and aquatic habitats,
   and there is growing evidence that anthropogenic noise affects
   communication and movement patterns in a variety of species. However,
   there has been relatively little work considering the effect on
   behaviours that are fundamental to survival, and thus have direct
   fitness consequences. We conducted a series of controlled tank-based
   experiments to consider how playback of ship noise, the most common
   source of underwater noise, affects foraging and antipredator behaviour
   in the shore crab, Carcinus maenas. Ship noise playback was more likely
   than ambient-noise playback to disrupt feeding, although crabs
   experiencing the two sound treatments did not differ in their likelihood
   of, or speed at, finding a food source in the first place. While crabs
   exposed to ship noise playback were just as likely as ambient-noise
   controls to detect and respond to a simulated predatory attack, they
   were slower to retreat to shelter. Ship noise playback also resulted in
   crabs that had been turned on their backs righting themselves faster
   than those experiencing ambient-noise playback; remaining immobile may
   reduce the likelihood of further predatory attention. Our findings
   therefore suggest that anthropogenic noise has the potential to increase
   the risks of starvation and predation, and showcases that the behaviour
   of invertebrates, and not just vertebrates, is susceptible to the impact

Abstract = {{Social groups balance flexibility and robustness in their collective
   response to environmental changes using feedback between behavioural
   processes that operate at different timescales. Here we examine how
   behavioural processes operating at two timescales regulate the foraging
   activity of colonies of the harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus,
   allowing them to balance their response to food availability and
   predation. Previous work showed that the rate at which foragers return
   to the nest with food influences the rate at which foragers leave the
   nest. To investigate how interactions inside the nest link the rates of
   returning and outgoing foragers, we observed outgoing foragers inside
   the nest in field colonies using a novel observation method. We found
   that the interaction rate experienced by outgoing foragers inside the
   nest corresponded to forager return rate, and that the interactions of
   outgoing foragers were spatially clustered. Activation of a forager
   occurred on the timescale of seconds: a forager left the nest 3-8 s
   after a substantial increase in interactions with returning foragers.
   The availability of outgoing foragers to become activated was adjusted
   on the timescale of minutes: when forager return was interrupted for
   more than 4-5 min, available foragers waiting near the nest entrance
   went deeper into the nest. Thus, forager activation and forager
   availability both increased with the rate at which foragers returned to
   the nest. This process was checked by negative feedback between forager
   activation and forager availability. Regulation of foraging activation
   on the timescale of seconds provides flexibility in response to
   fluctuations in food abundance, whereas regulation of forager
   availability on the timescale of minutes provides robustness in response
   to sustained disturbance such as predation. (C) 2013 The Association for

Abstract = {{High mortality in rearing of domestic rabbits is not only an economic
   problem but also an animal welfare issue. Among the reasons for this
   high mortality are some common rearing practices. In this review, we
   point out several commonly used management practices, which neither
   represent adequate housing conditions according to the animals'
   behavioural requirements nor correspond to their nutritional needs.
   Sometimes, the doe has to build the nursery nest on the cage floor or in
   a box with a permanently open entrance, often not protected from the
   light. This can lead to perinatal mortality due to disturbed behaviour
   of the mother such as failure to build a proper nest, depositing the
   kits outside the nest, or infanticide. Furthermore, continuous housing
   of the doe with the kits does not conform to this species' pattern of
   unusually limited maternal care. Possibly stimulated by olfactory and
   acoustic signals emanating from the nest, the doe can disturb the
   inactivity of the kits by her frequent entries to the nest or attempts
   to close the entrance. Cooling of the kits caused by maladaptive
   maternal behaviour under such conditions can also contribute to
   increased mortality and morbidity during the nursing period. In
   addition, when the doe is left to nurse the kits longer than four weeks,
   which does not conform to the reproductive biology of the rabbit, kit
   morbidity can be increased by the following factors. Although the doe's
   milk has a high protective role against main digestive disorders,
   prolonged mother-offspring contact might increase the risk of the kits
   becoming infected with pathogens such as coccidiosis, EPEC and
   pasteurellosis persisting in the doe. Pre-disposition of the kits to
   bacterial enteropathies can be encouraged by the delayed development of
   the enzymatic system, the delayed establishment of a stable gut flora,
   as well as by consumption of the doe's feed. The increased energy
   demands of lactation as well as mastitis incidence due to prolonged
   suckling by the kits could decrease the fertility and the lifespan of
   the doe. Feed with a high content of non-fibre carbohydrates (compared
   to green forage) can promote bacterial enteropathies when given before

Title = {{A qualitative synthesis of factors influencing maintenance of lifestyle
   behaviour change in individuals with high cardiovascular risk}},
Journal = {{BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JUL 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Management of cardiovascular risk factors includes
   commitment from patients to adhere to prescribed medications and adopt
   healthy lifestyles. Unfortunately many fail to take up and maintain the
   four key healthy behaviours (not smoking, having a balanced diet,
   limiting alcohol consumption and being more active). Five factors
   (beliefs, knowledge, transport and other costs, emotions, and friends
   and family support) are known to predict uptake of lifestyle behaviour
   change. The key factors influencing maintenance of healthy lifestyles
   are not known but would be helpful to support the development of relapse
   prevention programmes for this population. Our review aimed to clarify
   the main patient perceived factors thought to influence maintenance of
   changed healthy lifestyles.
   Methods: We performed a systematic review of qualitative observational
   studies and applied the principles of content synthesis and thematic
   analysis to extract reported factors (barriers and facilitators)
   considered by individuals to be influential in maintaining changed
   healthy lifestyle behaviours. Factors were then organised into an
   existing framework of higher order categories which was followed by an
   analysis of the interrelationships between factors to identify key
   themes.
   Results: Twenty two studies met our inclusion criteria. Participants
   reported barriers and facilitators within 13 categories, the majority of
   which were facilitators. The most commonly reported influences were
   those relating to social support (whether provided formally or
   informally), beliefs (about the self or the causes and management of
   poor health, and the value of maintaining lifestyle behaviours), and
   other psychological factors (including attitude, thinking and coping
   styles, and problem solving skills). Physical activity was the most
   commonly investigated behaviour in four categories, but overall, the
   main barriers and facilitators were related to a range of behaviours.
   Through analysis of the interrelationships between factors within
   categories, `social support', `education and knowledge', and `beliefs
   and emotions' were all considered key themes.
   Conclusions: Our review suggests that for the most part, factors that
   influence lifestyle change are also important for maintaining healthy
   behaviours. This indicates that addressing these barriers and
   facilitators within lifestyle support programmes would also be of value
   in the longer-term.}},

Abstract = {{Body size at metamorphosis is a key trait in species (such as many
   anurans) with biphasic life-histories. Experimental studies have shown
   that metamorph size is highly plastic, depending upon larval density and
   environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, food supply, water quality,
   chemical cues from conspecifics, predators and competitors). To test the
   hypothesis that this developmental plasticity is adaptive, or to
   determine if inducing plasticity can be used to control an invasive
   species, we need to know whether or not a metamorphosing anuran's body
   size influences its subsequent viability. For logistical reasons, there
   are few data on this topic under field conditions. We studied cane toads
   (Rhinella marina) within their invasive Australian range. Metamorph body
   size is highly plastic in this species, and our laboratory studies
   showed that larger metamorphs had better locomotor performance (both on
   land and in the water), and were more adept at catching and consuming
   prey. In mark-recapture trials in outdoor enclosures, larger body size
   enhanced metamorph survival and growth rate under some seasonal
   conditions. Larger metamorphs maintained their size advantage over
   smaller siblings for at least a month. Our data support the critical but
   rarely-tested assumption that all else being equal, larger body size at
   metamorphosis is likely to enhance an individual's long term viability.
   Thus, manipulations to reduce body size at metamorphosis in cane toads
   may help to reduce the ecological impact of this invasive species.}},

Abstract = {{We performed a common garden experiment to assess the existence of
   genetic differences on growth and body size between two populations of
   Poecilia vivipara inhabiting extremes of an environmental gradient
   caused by water salinity in lagoons of Northern Rio de Janeiro State,
   Brazil: the Campelo lagoon (freshwater) and A double dagger u lagoon
   (brackish/saltwater). The two populations show extreme differences in
   average phenotypes for body size, shape and life history (freshwater
   populations with smaller body size, lower fecundity and larger
   reproductive allotment). Pregnant females were brought to the lab and
   the offspring from both groups were kept in a common recirculating
   system with freshwater. Standard length and survival were measured
   weekly over a period of 200 days and growth models were fitted and
   selected with information criteria. The offspring originally from the
   brackish water lagoon presented larger asymptotic length, higher maximum
   growth rate but lower survival than the offspring originally from the
   freshwater lagoon. Potential confounding variables such as density
   differences due to mortality and maternal effects (offspring size) were
   included as covariates in comparisons of growth rates between groups.
   The results are consistent with phenotypic differences among populations
   having some genetic basis, and with the existence of a trade-off between
   growth and maintenance due to the high growth/low survival observed in
   the group that changed from salt to freshwater. Comparisons of captive
   and natural populations suggest that the influence of environmental
   factors, such as salinity, food availability, fish density and predation
   should also be considered relevant to explain phenotypic variation in
   this system.}},

Abstract = {{Foraging behaviour (grazing time, diet selection) and overlap in
   vegetation use between five beef cows, five mares, 32 ewes and 32 does,
   suckling their offspring born in late winter-early spring, was compared
   across the grazing season (May-December). Animals were managed in mixed
   grazing on heather-gorse vegetation communities with an adjacent area
   (24\%) of ryegrass-clover improved pasture. Equines spent more daily
   time grazing than the other species in all seasons, averaging 610
   min/day compared to 530, 481 and 496 min/day spent by cattle, sheep and
   goats, respectively. Seasonal changes in both grazing behaviour and diet
   selection were observed. Generally, cows, mares and ewes spent most of
   their grazing time on the improved pasture (0.77, 0.73 and 0.59,
   respectively), whereas goats spent more time grazing on shrublands
   (0.70). All species concentrated their diurnal grazing activity in the
   morning and late afternoon, whilst resting occurred mainly in the middle
   of the day. Herbaceous species were the main component in the diets of
   cattle, equines and sheep across the whole grazing season, whereas for
   goats this predominance was only observed during the spring. Cattle,
   sheep and equines turned to browse only when pasture availability
   decreased. Cattle and sheep tended to select heather in moderate amounts
   whereas they avoided gorse across the grazing season. By contrast,
   horses seemed to be able to deal with the gorse spiny shoots and
   consumed it in the autumn (averaging 0.29). The goats' diet at the end
   of the grazing season was mainly composed of heather species, reaching
   0.81 in November. Degree of grazing overlap between livestock species
   was influenced by the animal species and also varied across the grazing
   season. The greatest similarity indexes (KSI) based on grazing time and
   diet composition data were found between cattle and equines (0.86) and
   between cattle and sheep (0.94), whereas the combination of goats with
   the other animal species resulted in lower KSI values. Dietary overlap
   decreased as the improved pasture availability decreased during the
   grazing season. Results suggest that the success of management
   strategies (type and composition of the flock, mixed or sequential,
   continuous or seasonal) in these heterogeneous vegetation conditions
   will depend on plant species characteristics and its proportions.
   Grazing management options should be based on production (animal
   performance) or environmental goals (biodiversity, control of shrub
   encroachment, reduction of fire risk, etc.) previously defined. Goats
   proved to be the best complement to the other animal species for an
   efficient use of natural vegetation. Nevertheless, studies should be
   carried out to assess the interactions between grazing behaviour and
   animal performance in these particular vegetation conditions. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Control operations for invasive ship rats, Rattus rattus, in New Zealand
   forests are often followed by increased house mouse, Mus musculus,
   detections suggesting rats suppress mice. A potential mechanism is
   intraguild predation, either by interference competition or as simple
   predatory behaviour. If aggression by rats towards mice is mainly
   competitive, it should include threat and display features associated
   with, for example, intraspecific fighting. If predatory, it should lack
   these features and be associated with feeding. In the first of two
   captive experiments we observed interactions between paired, live
   rodents, either side of a wire-mesh screen, and found that most rats
   were aggressive to mice. This aggression lacked threat and display
   characteristics typical of encounters with conspecifics and was rarely
   reciprocated by mice. In a second experiment, euthanized mice were drawn
   by a line through cages occupied by rats fed either a restricted or
   unrestricted diet. Rats of both groups attacked and restrained the
   euthanized mice, and all rats that interacted with the mice ate at least
   part of them, although food-restricted rats tended to eat more. As the
   aggressive response of ship rats towards mice lacked threat and display
   features and was related to feeding, we conclude that it resembles
   predatory behaviour. Our findings provide a better understanding of the
   interactions between ship rats and house mice, which hinder their
   management where they coexist as damaging invaders. However, further
   research is required to determine whether the results of our captive
   experiments are consistent with wild rat behaviour. (C) 2013 The

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{86}},

Pages = {{375-382}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Predators often show strong plasticity of optimal foraging strategies. A
   major difference in foraging strategies occurs between sit-and-wait and
   active predators. Models predict that the efficiency of these strategies
   is affected by environmental conditions, active predators being favoured
   when prey are scarce and their detection difficult. The shift between
   the two strategies may occur through both phenotypic plasticity and
   local adaptations. Larvae of the fire salamander, Salamandra salamandra,
   are typically stream-dwelling sit-and-wait predators, but some
   populations breed in caves. We evaluated whether local adaptations or
   phenotypic plasticity determine shifts in foraging strategy between
   stream and cave populations. The foraging behaviour of salamander larvae
   was evaluated under all combinations of three test conditions during
   trials: light versus darkness, prey presence versus absence and food
   deprived versus fed; larvae originated from caves and streams and were
   reared in epigeous photoperiod or in darkness. Observations and video
   tracking showed that salamander larvae modified their behaviour in
   response to environmental conditions. In the darkness, larvae showed
   higher average velocity and moved longer distances. Movements were
   higher in food-deprived larvae and in the presence of prey compared to
   fed larvae and prey absent conditions. Furthermore, larvae from cave
   populations showed higher behavioural plasticity than stream larvae, and
   better exploited the available space in test environments. Variation in
   foraging behaviour was strong, and involved complex interactions between
   plasticity and local adaptations. Larvae from cave populations showed
   higher behavioural plasticity, supporting the hypothesis that this trait
   may be important for the exploitation of novel environments, such as
   caves. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{It is well established that early-life nutritional alterations lead to
   increased risk of obesity and metabolic disorders in adult life.
   Although it is clear that obesity gives rise to chronic low-grade
   inflammation, there is little evidence regarding the role of
   inflammation in the adipose tissue of undernourished (UN) offspring. GH
   reduces fat mass and has antiinflammatory properties. The present study
   examined the effect of maternal UN on adipose inflammation in adult
   offspring and whether GH treatment during a critical period of
   developmental plasticity could ameliorate metabolic dysfunction
   associated with a poor start to life. Sprague Dawley rats were assigned
   to chow (C) or UN (50\% ad libitum; UN) diet throughout gestation. Male
   C and UN pups received saline (control saline {[}CS]/UN) or GH (2.5 mu
   g/g/d; control growth hormone {[}CGH]/undernourished growth hormone
   {[}UNGH]) from days 3-21. Postweaning males were further randomized and
   fed either chow or high-fat diet until day 160. An ex vivo glucose
   uptake assay demonstrated adipose tissue from UN offspring displayed
   attenuated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake compared with CS, CGH, and
   UNGH. This was associated with increased insulin receptor, glucose
   transporter 4, and insulin receptor substrate 1 gene expression.
   Furthermore, UN demonstrated enhanced TNF alpha and IL-1 beta secretion
   from adipose explants and stromal vascular fraction cultures accompanied
   by increased adipose tissue gene expression of several key
   proinflammatory genes and markers of macrophage infiltration. Overall,
   UN offspring displayed a more potent immunophenotype, which correlated
   with decreased insulin sensitivity. Preweaning GH treatment negates
   these detrimental effects, indicating the potential for reversing
   metabolic dysfunction in UN adult offspring.}},

Abstract = {{Prolonged exposure to stress during development can have long-term
   detrimental effects on health and wellbeing. However, the environmental
   matching hypothesis proposes that developmental stress programs
   physiology and behaviour in an adaptive way that can enhance fitness if
   early environments match those experienced later in life. Most research
   has focused on the harmful effects that stress during a single period in
   early life may exert in adulthood. In this study, we tested the
   potential additive and beneficial effects that stress experienced during
   both pre- and post-hatching development may have on adult physiology and
   behaviour. Japanese quail experienced different stress-related
   treatments across two developmental life stages: pre-hatching
   corticosterone (CORT) injection, post-hatching unpredictable food
   availability, both pre- and post-hatching treatments, or control. In
   adulthood, we determined quails' acute stress response, neophobia and
   novel environment exploration. The pre-hatching CORT treatment resulted
   in attenuated physiological responses to an acute stressor, increased
   activity levels and exploration in a novel environment. Post-hatching
   unpredictable food availability decreased adults' latency to feed.
   Furthermore, there were cumulative effects of these treatments across
   the two developmental stages: quail subjected to both pre- and
   post-hatching treatments were the most explorative and risk-taking of
   all treatment groups. Such responses to novel environments could enhance
   survival in unpredictable environments in later life. Our data also
   suggest that these behavioural responses may have been mediated by
   long-term physiological programming of the adrenocortical stress
   response, creating phenotypes that could exhibit fitness-enhancing
   behaviours in a changing environment. (c) 2013 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{How foragers balance risks during foraging is a central focus of optimal
   foraging studies. While diverse theoretical and empirical work has
   revealed how foragers should and do manage food and safety from
   predators, little attention has been given to the risks posed by
   dangerous prey. This is a potentially important oversight because risk
   of injury can give rise to foraging costs similar to those arising from
   the risk of predation, and with similar consequences. Here, we
   synthesize the literature on how foragers manage risks associated with
   dangerous prey and adapt previous theory to make the first steps towards
   a framework for future studies. Though rarely documented, it appears
   that in some systems predators are frequently injured while hunting and
   risk of injury can be an important foraging cost. Fitness costs of
   foraging injuries, which can be fatal, likely vary widely but have
   rarely been studied and should be the subject of future research. Like
   other types of risk-taking behaviour, it appears that there is
   individual variation in the willingness to take risks, which can be
   driven by social factors, experience and foraging abilities, or
   differences in body condition. Because of ongoing modifications to
   natural communities, including changes in prey availability and relative
   abundance as well as the introduction of potentially dangerous prey to
   numerous ecosystems, understanding the prevalence and consequences of
   hunting dangerous prey should be a priority for behavioural ecologists.}},

   naloxone, a mu receptor antagonist at 025 and 0.5 mu g/mouse, SCH23390,
   a D-1 dopamine receptor antagonist or sulpiride, as a D-2 dopamine
   receptor antagonist, 5 min before testing, reversed the
   cholestasis-induced anxiolytic-like behaviors seven days after bile duct
   ligation (BDL). Unlike the higher dose of SCH23390 (0.5 mu g/mouse)
   which induced anxiogenic-like behaviors, other doses of the above drugs
   did not alter the exploratory behaviors in examined mice. Based on our
   findings, co-administration of the subthreshold dose of naloxone (0.125
   mu g/mouse), SCH23390 or sulpiride, and SCH23390 with sulpiride, neither
   altered exploratory behaviors in animals nor reversed the
   cholestasis-induced anxiolytic-like behaviors, seven days post BDL.
   Current results demonstrated firstly, the anxiolytic-like behaviors are
   evident in cholestatic mice seven days post BDL; secondly, there are
   plausible mechanisms governing the involvement of the CA(3) opioidergic
   and dopaminergic systems in this phenomenon and thirdly, there seem to
   be no interaction between these systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The incidence of diseases increases rapidly with age, accompanied by
   progressive deteriorations of physiological functions in organisms.
   Aging-associated diseases are sporadic but mostly inevitable
   complications arising from senescence. Senescence is often considered
   the antithesis of early development, but yet there may be factors and
   mechanisms in common between these two phenomena over the dynamic
   process of aging. The association between early development and
   late-onset disease with advancing age is thought to come from a
   consequence of developmental plasticity, the phenomenon by which one
   genotype can give rise to a range of physiologically and/or
   morphologically adaptive states in response to different environmental
   or genetic perturbations. On the one hand, we hypothesized that the
   future aging process can be predictive based on adaptivity during the
   early developmental period. Modulating the thresholds of adaptive
   plasticity by chemical genetic approaches, we have been investigating
   whether any relationship exists between the regulatory mechanisms that
   function in early development and in senescence using the zebrafish
   (Danio redo), a small freshwater fish and a useful model animal for
   genetic studies. We have successfully conducted experiments to isolate
   zebrafish mutants expressing apparently altered senescence phenotypes
   during embryogenesis ({''}embryonic senescence{''}), subsequently
   showing shortened lifespan in adulthoods. We anticipate that previously
   uncharacterized developmental genes may mediate the aging process and
   play a pivotal role in senescence. On the other hand, unexpected
   senescence-related genes might also be involved in the early
   developmental process and regulation. The ease of manipulation using the
   zebrafish system allows us to conduct an exhaustive exploration of novel
   genes and small molecular compounds that can be linked to the senescence
   phenotype, and thereby facilitates searching for the evolutionary and
   developmental origins of aging invertebrates. This article is part of a

Abstract = {{Hosteparasite interactions are a key determinant of the population
   dynamics of wild animals, and behaviours that reduce parasite
   transmission and infection may be important for improving host fitness.
   While antiparasite behaviours have been demonstrated in laboratory
   animals and domesticated ungulates, whether these behaviours operate in
   the wild is poorly understood. Therefore, examining antiparasite
   behaviours in natural populations is crucial for understanding their
   ecological significance. In this study, we examined whether two wild
   rodents (white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, and deer mice,
   Peromyscus maniculatus), selectively foraged away from conspecific
   faeces or avoided faeces altogether, and whether faecal gastrointestinal
   parasite status affected their behaviour. We also tested whether wild
   mice, when nesting, avoided using material that had previously been used
   by healthy or parasite-infected conspecifics. Our results, in contrast
   to laboratory mouse studies, suggest that wild mice do not demonstrate
   faecal avoidance, selective foraging or selective use of nesting
   material; they preferred being near faeces and did not differentiate
   between faeces from parasitized and uninfected conspecifics. Behavioural
   avoidance to reduce parasite infection may still represent an important
   strategy; however, mice in our study population appeared to favour the
   opportunity to feed and nest over the risks of coming into contact with
   faecal-transmitted parasites. Furthermore, the presence of conspecific
   faeces may actually provide a positive cue of a good foraging or nesting
   location. Ultimately, balancing the trade-off of performing antiparasite
   behaviours to reduce infection with missing an important feeding or
   nesting opportunity may be very different for animals in the wild facing
   complex and stochastic environments. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published on

Abstract = {{Animals depend on reliable sensory information for accurate behavioural
   decisions. For herbivorous insects it is crucial to find host plants for
   feeding and reproduction, and these insects must be able to
   differentiate suitable from unsuitable plants. Volatiles are important
   cues for insect herbivores to assess host plant quality. It has
   previously been shown that female moths of the Egyptian cotton leafworm,
   Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), avoid oviposition on
   damaged cotton Gossypium hirsutum, which may mediated by
   herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Among the HIPVs, some
   volatiles are released following any type of damage while others are
   synthesized de novo and released by the plants only in response to
   herbivore damage. In behavioural experiments we here show that
   oviposition by S. littoralis on undamaged cotton plants was reduced by
   adding volatiles collected from plants with ongoing herbivory. Gas
   chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) recordings
   revealed that antennae of mated S. littoralis females responded to 18
   compounds from a collection of headspace volatiles of damaged cotton
   plants. Among these compounds, a blend of the seven de novo synthesized
   volatile compounds was found to reduce oviposition in S. littoralis on
   undamaged plants under both laboratory and ambient (field) conditions in
   Egypt. Volatile compounds that are not produced de novo by the plants
   did not affect oviposition. Our results show that ovipositing females
   respond specifically to the de novo synthesized volatiles released from
   plants under herbivore attack. We suggest that these volatiles provide
   reliable cues for ovipositing females to detect plants that could
   provide reduced quality food for their offspring and an increased risk
   of competition and predation.}},

   White. We established a field experiment with various treatments: 1)
   control without predators, 2) free-roaming A. wakefieldi (with one,

   (empty cage without predators, with one, three, or nine A. wakefieldi in
   each cage, and 4) A. wakefieldi cues (with cues concentrations of one,

   these four experimental treatments and reared in two different
   laboratory conditions: 1) in clean water without any traces of

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To describe parental vaccine decision making behaviors and
   characterize trust in physician advice among parents with varying
   childhood vaccination behaviors.
   METHODS: Between 2008 and 2011, a mixed methods study was conducted with
   parents of children aged < 4 years who were members of Kaiser Permanente
   Colorado health plan. Seven focus groups were conducted with
   vaccine-hesitant parents. On the basis of findings from the focus
   groups, a survey was developed, pilot tested, and mailed to a stratified
   sample of 854 parents who accepted (n = 500), delayed (n = 227), or
   refused (n = 127) vaccinations for one of their children. Survey results
   were analyzed by chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression.
   RESULTS: Several themes emerged from the focus groups, including: 1) the
   vaccine decision-making process begins prenatally, 2) vaccine decision
   making is an evolving process, and 3) there is overall trust in the
   pediatrician but a lack of trust in the information they provided about
   vaccines. The survey response rate was 52\% (n = 443). Parents who
   refused or delayed vaccines were 2 times more likely to report that they
   began thinking about vaccines before their child was born and 8 times
   more likely to report that they constantly reevaluate their vaccine
   decisions than parents who accepted all vaccines. Although parents
   tended to report trusting their pediatrician's advice on nutrition,
   behavior, and the physical examination, they did not believe their
   pediatrician provided ``balanced{''} information on both the benefits
   and risks of vaccination.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results have implications for future interventions to
   address parental vaccination concerns. Such interventions may be more
   effective if they are applied early (during pregnancy) and often
   (pregnancy through infancy), and cover both the risks and benefits of
   vaccination.}},

Abstract = {{The neuroendocrinology of ingestive behavior is a topic central to human
   health, particularly in light of the prevalence of obesity, eating
   disorders, and diabetes. The study of food intake in laboratory rats and
   mice has yielded some useful hypotheses, but there are still many gaps
   in our knowledge. Ingestive behavior is more complex than the
   consummatory act of eating, and decisions about when and how much to eat
   usually take place in the context of potential mating partners,
   competitors, predators, and environmental fluctuations that are not
   present in the laboratory. We emphasize appetitive behaviors, actions
   that bring animals in contact with a goal object, precede consummatory
   behaviors, and provide a window into motivation. Appetitive ingestive
   behaviors are under the control of neural circuits and neuropeptide
   systems that control appetitive sex behaviors and differ from those that
   control consummatory ingestive behaviors. Decreases in the availability
   of oxidizable metabolic fuels enhance the stimulatory effects of
   peripheral hormones on appetitive ingestive behavior and the inhibitory
   effects on appetitive sex behavior, putting a new twist on the notion of
   leptin, insulin, and ghrelin ``resistance.{''} The ratio of hormone
   concentrations to the availability of oxidizable metabolic fuels may
   generate a critical signal that schedules conflicting behaviors, e.g.,
   mate searching vs. foraging, food hoarding vs. courtship, and fat
   accumulation vs. parental care. In species representing every vertebrate
   taxa and even in some invertebrates, many putative ``satiety{''} or
   ``hunger{''} hormones function to schedule ingestive behavior in order
   to optimize reproductive success in environments where energy
   availability fluctuates. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective. Dual-process theories of behaviour have been used to suggest

   Design. Comparison between persons with at least one lifetime episode of
   major depressive disorder (lifetime MDD) and those without this
   diagnosis, controlling for symptoms of alcohol use (a potential
   externalizing confound) and current symptoms of depression (a potential
   state-dependent confound).
   Methods. Undergraduates (N = 120) completed a clinical interview to
   diagnose lifetime MDD and a series of self-reports bearing on diverse
   aspects of self-control, including reactivity to emotion. Thirty-four
   people were diagnosed with lifetime MDD; 86 did not meet criteria for
   MDD. The groups were then compared on three factors underlying the
   scales assessing self-control.
   Results. The MDD group had higher scores than controls on the two
   factors that reflect impulsive reactivity to diverse emotions, including
   emotions that are positive in valence. These effects were not explained

Abstract = {{Consumers of organic food name health motives as an important driver of
   their choice. Interestingly, triggering health motives in food choice is
   exactly the reason why nutrition and health claims have been developed
   for the communication of functional food. Thus, both product concepts
   have similar consumer purchase motives in common. Organic food and
   functional food are, however, often described as contradictory rather
   than complementary in amongst others the concept of health. Functional
   food tends to be perceived as `unnatural' by consumers. So far, it has
   not been researched how consumers react to a combination of both product
   concepts. A realistically designed purchase simulation was conducted
   with 210 organic consumers in Germany. Five organic products in three
   different categories were offered, unobtrusively altered so that they
   showed a nutrition, health or risk reduction claim on two products in
   each choice set. The results show that products with a claim were not
   significantly preferred nor rejected. Occasional organic buyers,
   however, were significantly more likely to choose products with a claim.
   Choice of a product with a claim was determined by whether respondents
   had read the claim and thought it indicated equal or better health
   performance. Among those for which the latter was the case, respondents
   choosing a product with a claim were characterised by being occasional
   organic food buyers and being less sceptical about health-related
   information on products. It can be concluded that nutrition and health
   claims can be beneficial in the marketing of organic products,
   especially when addressing occasional organic consumers. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{The giving-up density (GUD) framework provides a powerful experimental
   approach with a strong theoretical underpinning to quantify foraging
   outcomes in heterogeneous landscapes. Since its inception, the GUD
   approach has been applied successfully to a vast range of foraging
   species and foraging scenarios. However, its application is not simple,
   as anyone who has tried to use it for the first time might attest.
   Limitations of the technique were noted at its conception, yet only the
   artificiality of the patches, the appropriateness of the food resource,
   and the possibility of multiple visiting foragers were identified. Here
   we show the current uses of GUD and outline the practical benefits as
   well as the often overlooked limitations of the technique. We define
   seven major points that need to be addressed when applying this
   methodology: (1) the curvilinearity between harvest rate and energy, (2)
   the energetic state of the forager, (3) the effect of group foraging,
   (4) food quality and substrate properties, (5) the predictability of the
   patch, (6) behavioral traits of the forager, and (7) nontarget species.
   We also suggest how GUD experiments can be enhanced by incorporating
   complementary methods (such as cameras) to better understand the
   foraging processes involved in the GUD itself. We conclude that the
   benefits of using GUD outweigh the costs, but that its limitations
   should not be ignored. Incorporating new methods when using GUD can
   potentially offer novel and important insights into the study of
   foraging behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Aposematic prey warn predators of their toxicity using conspicuous
   signals. However, predators regularly include aposematic prey in their
   diets, particularly when they are in a poor energetic state and in need
   of nutrients. We investigated whether or not an environmental factor,
   ambient temperature, could change the energetic state of predators and
   lead to an increased intake of prey that they know to contain toxins. We
   found that European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, increased their
   consumption of mealworm, Tenebrio molitor, prey containing quinine (a
   mild toxin) when the ambient temperature was reduced below their
   thermoneutral zone from 20 degrees C to 6 degrees C. The birds differed
   in their sensitivity to changes in ambient temperature, with heavier
   birds increasing the number of toxic prey they ate more rapidly with
   decreasing temperature compared to birds with lower body mass. This
   could have been the result of their requiring more nutrients at lower
   temperatures or being better able to detoxify quinine. Taken together,
   our results suggest that conspicuous coloration may be more costly at
   lower temperatures, and that aposematic prey may need to invest more in
   chemical defences as temperatures decline. Our study also provides novel
   insights into what factors affect birds' decisions to eat toxic prey,
   and demonstrates that selection pressures acting on prey defences can
   vary with changing temperature across days, seasons, climes, and
   potentially in response to climate change. (C) 2013 The Authors.

   impact for primary prevention; thus, early childhood and school-based
   interventions should integrate behavioral and environmental approaches
   that focus on dietary intake and physical activity using a systems-level
   approach targeting the multilevel structure of the socioecological model
   as well as interactions and relationships between levels. Secondary
   prevention and tertiary prevention/treatment should emphasize sustained
   family-based, developmentally appropriate approaches that include
   nutrition education, dietary counseling, parenting skills, behavioral
   strategies, and physical-activity promotion. For obese youth with
   concomitant serious comorbidities, structured dietary approaches and
   pharmacologic agents should be considered, and weight-loss surgery can
   be considered for severely obese adolescents. Policy and environmental
   interventions are recommended as feasible and sustainable ways to
   support healthful lifestyles for children and families. The Academy
   supports commitment of resources for interventions, policies, and

   use did not differ between types of social groups but differed between
   seasons. Guanacos used less productive and less steep areas during the
   breeding season, irrespective of juvenile:adult ratios in the family
   groups, and larger groups occupied flatter areas. Overall, guanaco
   habitat selection prioritizes reducing predation risk to the extent that

Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{76-83}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Acute and chronic states of food deprivation result in increased
   sensitivity to a variety of natural reinforcers as well as to drugs of
   abuse. Food deprived animals show increased locomotor activity during
   periods of food deprivation, as well as increased locomotor stimulant
   responses to drugs of abuse, including cocaine, amphetamine, morphine,
   and ethanol, implying that drugs of abuse act in part on neural systems
   that underlie responses towards food. To determine whether this effect
   extends to an invertebrate, highly genetically tractable animal, the
   locomotor stimulant effects of low dose ethanol were assessed under a
   variety of feeding conditions in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.
   Food deprivation resulted in strain specific increases in
   ethanol-stimulated locomotor activity in most strains tested, although
   elevated baseline activity confounded interpretation in some strains.
   Experiments conducted with Canton S flies found that the effects of food
   deprivation on the locomotor stimulant response to ethanol increased
   with the duration of deprivation, and could be blocked by refeeding the
   flies with standard food or sucrose, but not yeast, immediately prior to
   the ethanol exposure. Life-span extending dietary depletion procedures
   or previous periods of food deprivation did not affect the response to
   ethanol, indicating that only animals in an acutely food deprived state
   are more sensitive to the stimulant effects of ethanol. These results
   suggest that increased sensitivity to the stimulant effects of some
   drugs of abuse might reflect an evolutionarily conserved neural
   mechanism that underlies behavioral responses to natural reinforcers and
   drugs of abuse. The identification of this mechanism, and the genes that
   underlie its development and function, will constitute a novel approach
   towards the study of alcohol abuse and dependence. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Parasites influence colorful ornaments and their behavioral display in

Abstract = {{This paper investigates notable examples of sustainable lifestyles in
   relation to food systems. It explores the surprisingly neglected case of
   widely practised and environmentally sustainable food self-provisioning
   in post-socialist Central and Eastern Europe. Our argument is rooted in
   qualitative and quantitative data gathered over a seven-year period
   (2005-2011). The research considers the extent of and motivations for
   these practices in Poland and Czechia. The very high rates compared to
   Western Europe and North America have generally been explained in terms
   of an `urban peasantry' meeting essential needs. After reviewing and
   rejecting those accounts we present evidence for these as socially and
   environmentally beneficial practices, and explore how the motivations
   derive from a range of feelings about food, quality, capability and
   family and/or friendship. Rather than relate these practices to temporal
   signals of quality and sustainability in food ('slow' and `fast'), or
   presenting them as `alternative food networks' we suggest that they
   represent `quiet sustainability'. This novel concept summarises
   widespread practices that result in beneficial environmental or social
   outcomes and that do not relate directly or indirectly to market
   transactions, but are not represented by their practitioners as relating
   directly to environmental or sustainability goals. These practices
   represent exuberant, appealing and socially inclusive, but also
   unforced, forms of sustainability. This case further demonstrates the
   severe limitations of decision makers' focus on economics and behaviour
   change, and their neglect of other dimensions of social life and change

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{56-61}},
Month = {{OCT 2}},
Abstract = {{The core defining features of bulimia nervosa (BN) are repeated binge
   eating episodes and inappropriate compensatory (e.g., purging) behavior.
   Previous studies suggest an abnormal post-prandial response in the
   satiety-signaling peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) in persons with BN. It
   is unknown whether this altered response persists following remission or
   if it may be a potential target for the development of clinical
   treatment strategies. To examine the nature of this altered response,
   this study assessed whether CCK normalizes following remission from BN
   (RBN). This study prospectively evaluated the plasma CCK response and
   corresponding eating behavior-related ratings (e.g., satiety, fullness,
   hunger, urge to binge and vomit) in individuals with BN-purging subtype
   (n = 10), RBN-purging subtype (n = 14), and healthy controls (CON, n =
   13) at baseline, +15, +30, and +60 min following the ingestion of a
   standardized liquid test meal.
   Subject groups did not significantly differ in CCK response to the test
   meal. A significant relationship between CCK response and satiety
   ratings was observed in the RBN group (r = .59, p < .05 two-tailed). A
   new and unanticipated finding in the BN group was a significant
   relationship between CCK response and ratings of ``urge to vomit{''} (r
   = .86, p < .01, two-tailed).
   Unlike previous investigations, CCK response did not differ in BN and
   CON groups. Thus the role of symptom severity remains an area of further
   investigation. Additionally, findings suggest that in this sample, CCK
   functioning following remission from BN-purging subtype is not different
   from controls. It remains unknown whether or not CCK functioning may be
   a protective or liability factor in the stabilization and recovery
   process. Replication studies utilizing a larger sample size are needed
   to further elucidate the role of CCK in recovery from BN and its
   potential target of related novel treatment strategies. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Size variance among similarly aged individuals within populations is a
   pattern common to many organisms that is a result of interactions
   between intrinsic and extrinsic traits of individuals. While genetic and
   maternal effects, as well as physiological and behavioral traits have
   been shown to contribute to size variation in animal populations,
   teasing apart the influence of such factors on individual growth rates
   remain a challenge. Furthermore, tracing the effects of these
   interactions across life stages and in shaping adult phenotypes also
   requires further exploration. In this study we investigated the
   relationship between genetics, hatching patterns, behaviors,
   neuroendocrine stress axis activity and variance in growth and
   metamorphosis among same-aged larval amphibians. Through parallel
   experiments we found that in the absence of conspecific interactions,
   hatch time and to a lesser extent egg clutch identity (i.e. genetics and
   maternal effects) influenced the propensity for growth and development
   in individual tadpoles and determined metamorphic traits. Within
   experimental groups we found that variance in growth rates was
   associated with size-dependent foraging behaviors and responses to food
   restriction. We also found an inverse relationship between
   glucocorticoid (GC) hormone levels and body mass and developmental stage
   among group-reared tadpoles, which suggests that GC expression plays a
   role in regulating differing within-population growth trajectories in
   response to density-dependent conditions. Taken together these findings
   suggest that factors that influence hatching conditions can have
   long-term effects on growth and development. These results also raise
   compelling questions regarding the extent to which maternal and genetic
   factors influence physiological and behavioral profiles in amphibians.}},

Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Obesity is mainly attributed to environmental factors. In
   developed countries, the time spent on physical activity tasks is
   decreasing, whereas sedentary behaviour patterns are increasing. The
   purpose of the intervention is to evaluate the effectiveness of an
   intensive family-based behavioural multicomponent intervention (Nereu
   programme) and compared it to counselling intervention such as a health
   centre intervention programme for the management of children's obesity.
   Methods/Design: The study design is a randomized controlled multicenter
   clinical trial using two types of interventions: Nereu and Counselling.
   The Nereu programme is an 8-month intensive family-based multi-component
   behavioural intervention. This programme is based on a multidisciplinary
   intervention consisting of 4 components: physical activity sessions for
   children, family theoretical and practical sessions for parents,
   behaviour strategy sessions involving both, parents and children, and
   lastly, weekend extra activities for all. Counselling is offered to the
   family in the form of a monthly physical health and eating habits
   session. Participants will be recruited according the following
   criteria: 6 to 12 year-old-children, referred from their paediatricians
   due to overweight or obesity according the International Obesity Task
   Force criteria and with a sedentary profile (less than 2 hours per week
   of physical activity), they must live in or near the municipality of
   Lleida (Spain) and their healthcare paediatric unit must have previously
   accepted to cooperate with this study. The following variables will be
   evaluated: a) cardiovascular risk factors (anthropometric parameters,
   blood test and blood pressure), b) sedentary and physical activity
   behaviour and dietary intake, c) psychological aspects d) health related
   quality of life (HRQOL), e) cost-effectiveness of the intervention in
   relation to HRQOL. These variables will be then be evaluated 4 times
   longitudinally: at baseline, at the end of the intervention (8 months
   later), 6 and 12 months after the intervention. We have considered
   necessary to recruit 100 children and divide them in 2 groups of 50 to
   detect the differences between the groups.
   Discussion: This trial will provide new evidence for the long-term
   effects of childhood obesity management, as well as help to know the
   impact of the present intervention as a health intervention tool for
   healthcare centres.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural strategies to reduce predation risk can incur costs, which
   are often referred to as risk effects. A common strategy to avoid
   predation is spatio-temporal avoidance of predators, in which prey
   typically trade optimal resources for safety. Analogous with
   predator-prey theory, risk effects should also arise in species with
   sexually selected infanticide (SSI), in which females with dependent
   offspring avoid infanticidal males. SSI can be common in brown bear
   (Ursus arctos) populations and explains spatio-temporal segregation
   among reproductive classes. Here, we show that in a population with SSI,
   females with cubs-of-the-year had lower quality diets than conspecifics
   during the SSI high-risk period, the mating season. After the mating
   season, their diets were of similar quality to diets of their
   conspecifics. Our results suggest a nutritive risk effect of SSI, in
   which females with cubs-of-the-year alter their resource selection and
   trade optimal resources for offspring safety. Such risk effects can add

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: In chicken, oils in the maternal diet confer a specific
   scent to the yolk. Embryos are known to perceive and memorize
   chemosensory signals of the surrounding environment; however, the
   potential impact of the maternal diet has not previously been
   investigated. In the present study, we hypothesized that chicken embryos
   memorize the chemical signals of the maternal diet and that this
   perceptual learning may orient subsequent feeding behavior of the
   hatchlings.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Laying hens were fed standard food
   enriched with 2\% menhaden oil (MH group) or 2\% soybean oil (controls).
   The scent of menhaden was significantly more detected in MH egg yolks
   than in control yolks by a human panel. We analyzed the development and
   behavior of offspring towards different types of food, bearing or not
   bearing the menhaden scent. When chicks were exposed to a 3-min choice
   test between the familiar food bearing the menhaden scent and the
   familiar food without menhaden, no effect of treatment was observed. In
   a 3-min choice test with unfamiliar food (mashed cereals) MH chicks
   showed a clear positive orientation toward the unfamiliar food bearing
   the menhaden scent. By contrast, control chicks showed a preference for
   the non-odorized unfamiliar food. MH chicks expressed higher emotional
   reactivity level than control chicks as expressed by food neophobia and
   longer immobility in a restraint test.
   Conclusion/Significance: Chicks exposed in ovo to menhaden oil via the
   maternal diet preferentially oriented their feeding behavior towards
   food containing menhaden oil, but only when the food was unfamiliar. We
   propose that oil in the maternal diet engenders maternal effects and
   contributes to the development of behavioral phenotype in the offspring.
   In ovo chemosensory learning may have evolved to prepare precocial
   offspring for their environment. This suggests a common principle of
   embryonic chemosensory learning across vertebrate taxa.}},

   of sampling and insurance under starvation risk. Our analysis reveals
   nonlinear effects of MRs on diurnal patterns of sampling and insurance.
   Individuals with low MRs accrue reserves quickly, because they invest in
   sampling and are able to exploit profitable options when they arise.
   Individuals with intermediate MRs initially lose reserves, because
   sampling, while optimal, is relatively expensive; however, they later
   build reserves due to efficient exploitation of alternative foraging
   options. Sampling rarely pays for individuals with the highest MRs,
   which show relatively constant levels of energy reserves throughout the
   foraging period. Thus, individual variation in MRs on the scale observed
   in natural populations can lead to important differences in investment
   in sampling and insurance and may underpin consistent individual
   differences in suites of other behavioral traits, including individual
   differences in behavioral responsiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Injuries are common in animals of diverse taxa and are usually
   attributed to encounters with predators. Although often non-lethal,
   injuries nevertheless represent effects of predators that can have
   negative consequences for demography and fitness (e.g. reproductive
   costs). However, encounters with predators also represent experience
   through which animals can learn and positively adapt their future
   behaviour, potentially mitigating, at least partly, the negative effects
   of prior exposure to predators. I predicted that injured grass snakes
   (Natrix natrix), which presumably had been handled previously by a
   predator, would be more likely to move before capture than uninjured
   snakes. This prediction was borne out. Snakes with injuries also had
   lower body condition than uninjured snakes, although the effect was
   non-significant. Snakes that had been previously captured also were
   significantly more likely to move before capture than snakes that had
   never been caught before. These results provide strong evidence for the

Abstract = {{Winter ice conditions in boreal streams are highly variable, and
   behavioural responses by fish to river ice may affect overwinter

   endothermic predators, we predicted that metabolic costs associated with
   vigilance would be lower under surface ice than in areas lacking surface
   ice. This potentially favourable effect of ice cover was tested by
   observing ventilation rates of juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) in a
   laboratory stream at dawn, during the day and at night in the presence
   and absence of real, light-permeable surface ice. Further, we offered
   trout drifting prey during daylight to test whether ice cover increased
   daytime foraging activity. Ice cover reduced ventilation rates during
   the day, but not at night or dawn. Moreover, fish made more daytime
   foraging attempts in the presence of ice cover than in its absence. We

   The nocturnal A. cahirinus leaves intact seeds when consuming O.

   diurnal A. russatus consumes the whole fruit and digests the seeds and
   thus, acts mainly as a seed predator. Acomys russatus is subjected to
   the toxic products of the glucosinolates-myrosinase system found in O.

Abstract = {{Understanding how animals allocate their foraging time is a central
   question in behavioural ecology. Intrinsic factors, such as body mass
   and size differences between sexes or species, influence animals'
   foraging behaviour, but studies investigating the effects of individual
   differences in body mass and size within the same sex are scarce. We
   investigated this in chick-rearing masked boobies Sula dactylatra, a
   species with reversed sexual dimorphism, through the simultaneous
   deployment of GPS and depth-acceleration loggers to obtain information
   on foraging movements and activity patterns. Heavier females performed
   shorter trips closer to the colony than lighter females. During these
   shorter trips, heavier females spent higher proportions of their flight
   time flapping and less time resting on the water than lighter females
   did during longer trips. In contrast, body mass did not affect trip
   duration of males, however heavier males spent less time flapping and
   more time resting on the water than lighter males. This may occur as a
   result of higher flight costs associated with body mass and allow
   conservation of energy during locomotion. Body size (i.e. wing length)
   had no effect on any of the foraging parameters. Dive depths and dive
   rates (dives h(-1)) were not affected by body mass, but females dived
   significantly deeper than males, suggesting that other factors are
   important. Other studies demonstrated that females are the parent in
   charge of provisioning the chick, and maintain a flexible investment
   under regulation of their own body mass. Variation in trip length
   therefore seems to be triggered by body condition in females, but not in
   males. Consequently, shorter trips are presumably used to provision the
   chick, while longer trips are for self-maintenance. Our findings
   underline the importance of accounting for the effects of body mass
   differences within the same sex, if sex-specific foraging parameters in
   dimorphic species are being investigated.}},

   Host Behaviour and Immunity}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Parasitic helminths present one of the most pervasive challenges to
   grazing herbivores. Many macro-parasite transmission models focus on
   host physiological defence strategies, omitting more complex
   interactions between hosts and their environments. This work represents
   the first model that integrates both the behavioural and physiological
   elements of gastro-intestinal nematode transmission dynamics in a
   managed grazing system. A spatially explicit, individual-based,
   stochastic model is developed, that incorporates both the hosts'
   immunological responses to parasitism, and key grazing behaviours
   including faecal avoidance. The results demonstrate that grazing
   behaviour affects both the timing and intensity of parasite outbreaks,
   through generating spatial heterogeneity in parasite risk and
   nutritional resources, and changing the timing of exposure to the
   parasites' free-living stages. The influence of grazing behaviour varies
   with the host-parasite combination, dependent on the development times
   of different parasite species and variations in host immune response.
   Our outputs include the counterintuitive finding that under certain
   conditions perceived parasite avoidance behaviours (faecal avoidance)
   can increase parasite risk, for certain host-parasite combinations.
   Through incorporating the two-way interaction between infection dynamics
   and grazing behaviour, the potential benefits of parasite-induced
   anorexia are also demonstrated. Hosts with phenotypic plasticity in
   grazing behaviour, that make grazing decisions dependent on current
   parasite burden, can reduce infection with minimal loss of intake over
   the grazing season. This paper explores how both host behaviours and
   immunity influence macro-parasite transmission in a spatially and
   temporally heterogeneous environment. The magnitude and timing of
   parasite outbreaks is influenced by host immunity and behaviour, and the
   interactions between them; the incorporation of both regulatory
   processes is required to fully understand transmission dynamics.
   Understanding of both physiological and behavioural defence strategies
   will aid the development of novel approaches for control.}},

Title = {{Perplexities of treatment resistence in eating disorders}},
Journal = {{BMC PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Treatment resistance is an omnipresent frustration in eating
   disorders. Attempts to identify the features of this resistance and
   subsequently develop novel treatments have had modest effects. This
   selective review examines treatment resistant features expressed in core
   eating disorder psychopathology, comorbidities and biological features.
   Novel treatments addressing resistance are discussed.
   Description: The core eating disorder psychopathology of anorexia
   nervosa becomes a coping mechanism likely via vulnerable neurobiological
   features and conditioned learning to deal with life events. Thus it is
   reinforcing and ego syntonic resulting in resistance to treatment. The
   severity of core features such as preoccupations with body image,
   weight, eating and exercising predicts greater resistance to treatment.
   Bulimia nervosa patients are less resistant to treatment with treatment
   failure related to greater body image concerns, impulsivity, depression,
   severe diet restriction and poor social adjustment. For those with binge
   eating disorder overweight in childhood and high emotional eating
   predicts treatment resistance. There is suggestive data that a diagnosis
   of an anxiety disorder and severe perfectionism may confer treatment
   resistance in anorexia nervosa and substance use disorders or
   personality disorders with impulse control problems may produce
   resistance to treatment in bulimia nervosa. Traits such as
   perfectionism, cognitive inflexibility and negative affect with likely
   genetic influences may also affect treatment resistance. Pharmacotherapy
   and novel therapies have been developed to address treatment resistance.
   Atypical antipsychotic drugs have shown some effect in treatment
   resistant anorexia nervosa and topiramate and high doses of SSRIs are
   helpful for treatment of resistant binge eating disorder patients. There
   are insufficient randomized controlled trials to evaluate the novel
   psychotherapies which are primarily based on the core psychopathological
   features of the eating disorders.
   Conclusion: Treatment resistance in eating disorders is usually
   predicted by the severity of the core eating disorder psychopathology
   which develops from an interaction between environmental risk factors
   with genetic traits and a vulnerable neurobiology. Future investigations
   of the biological features and neurocircuitry of the core eating
   disorders psychopathology and behaviors may provide information for more
   successful treatment interventions.}},

   by Food Limitation Early in Life in Mites}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Food limitation early in life may be compensated for by
   developmental plasticity resulting in accelerated development enhancing
   survival at the expense of small adult body size. However and especially
   for females in non-matching maternal and offspring environments, being
   smaller than the standard may incur considerable intra-and
   transgenerational costs.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we evaluated the costs of small
   female body size induced by food limitation early in life in the
   sexually size-dimorphic predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis. Females
   are larger than males. These predators are adapted to exploit ephemeral
   spider mite prey patches. The intra- and trans-generational effects of
   small maternal body size manifested in lower maternal survival
   probabilities, decreased attractiveness for males, and a reduced number
   and size of eggs compared to standard-sized females. The
   trans-generational effects of small maternal body size were sex-specific
   with small mothers producing small daughters but standard-sized sons.
   Conclusions/Significance: Small female body size apparently intensified
   the well-known costs of sexual activity because mortality of small but
   not standard-sized females mainly occurred shortly after mating. The
   disadvantages of small females in mating and egg production may be
   generally explained by size-associated morphological and physiological
   constraints. Additionally, size-assortative mate preferences of
   standard-sized mates may have rendered small females disproportionally
   unattractive mating partners. We argue that the sex-specific
   trans-generational effects were due to sexual size dimorphism females
   are the larger sex and thus more strongly affected by maternal stress
   than the smaller males - and to sexually selected lower plasticity of
   male body size.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Short lived, iteroparous animals in seasonal environments
   experience variable social and environmental conditions over their
   lifetime. Animals can be divided into those with a
   ``young-of-the-year{''} life history (YY, reproducing and dying in the
   summer of birth) and an ``overwinter{''} life history (OW, overwintering
   in a subadult state before reproducing next spring).
   We investigated how behavioural patterns across the population were
   affected by season and sex, and whether variation in behaviour reflects
   the variation in life history patterns of each season. Applications of
   pace-of-life (POL) theory would suggest that long-lived OW animals are
   shyer in order to increase survival, and YY are bolder in order to
   increase reproduction. Therefore, we expected that in winter and spring
   samples, when only OW can be sampled, the animals should be shyer than
   in summer and autumn, when both OW and YY animals can be sampled. We
   studied common vole (Microtus arvalis) populations, which express
   typical, intra-annual density fluctuation. We captured a total of 492
   voles at different months over 3 years and examined boldness and
   activity level with two standardised behavioural experiments.
   Results: Behavioural variables of the two tests were correlated with
   each other. Boldness, measured as short latencies in both tests, was
   extremely high in spring compared to other seasons. Activity level was
   highest in spring and summer, and higher in males than in females.
   Conclusion: Being bold in laboratory tests may translate into higher
   risk-taking in nature by being more mobile while seeking out partners or
   valuable territories. Possible explanations include asset-protection,
   with OW animals being rather old with low residual reproductive value in
   spring. Therefore, OW may take higher risks during this season.
   Offspring born in spring encounter a lower population density and may
   have higher reproductive value than offspring of later cohorts. A
   constant connection between life history and animal personality, as
   suggested by the POL theory, however, was not found. Nevertheless,
   correlations of traits suggest the existence of animal personalities. In
   conclusion, complex patterns of population dynamics, seasonal variation
   in life histories, and variability of behaviour due to asset-protection
   may cause complex seasonal behavioural dynamics in a population.}},

Abstract = {{Cane toads (Rhinella marina) have wrought considerable ecological damage
   during their invasion of tropical Australia, spurring the search for
   novel ways to reduce toad numbers. Previous laboratory and field studies
   have shown that the tadpoles of native frogs, which often co-occur with
   toad tadpoles in temporary waterbodies, compete with the invaders and
   can suppress their survival, growth and development. Understanding the
   mechanisms responsible for that competitive suppression might suggest
   new ways to control toads: for example, a chemical produced by native
   tadpoles that disrupts toad development. Our laboratory experiments
   confirm that toad tadpoles are negatively affected by the presence of
   tadpoles of three native hylid frogs (Litoria caerulea, Litoria longipes
   and Litoria splendida) and identify direct exploitative competition for
   food as the primary mechanism. Manipulations of chemical cues and visual
   cues in the water had no significant effects on the viability of toads,
   whereas manipulations of direct physical contact and food supply
   relative to tadpole density had strong effects. The lack of chemically
   mediated interference competition may reflect the very short timescale
   of sympatry between the invader and native taxa, restricting
   opportunities for the evolution of such mechanisms. Re-introducing
   native anurans to anthropogenically degraded sites (especially those
   where local frogs previously occurred, but have been lost) may provide a
   simple and effective way to reduce the recruitment rate of invasive cane
   toads.}},

Abstract = {{In social mammals, within-group competition for food can drive variation
   in female fitness. Frugivores may face particularly strong competition
   because they use patchily distributed usurpable resources. Dominance
   rank and group size influence how a female experiences within-group
   competition. Both are predicted to affect access to food and, thus,
   reproductive success. We used 15 years of behavioral, demographic, and
   reproductive data from wild frugivorous blue monkeys to examine effects
   of rank and group size on the probability that a female conceived. We
   used generalized linear mixed models, controlling for potentially
   confounding maternal and environmental factors. Blue monkey females
   compete aggressively and disproportionately for fruits and exhibit
   linear dominance hierarchies, but neither rank index we tested
   significantly predicted the probability of conception. Although earlier
   studies found that group size effects on activity budgets were minimal,
   we found that group size had a quadratic relationship with the
   probability of conception, which peaked at around 31 members. The lack
   of a rank effect may reflect behavioral strategies (e.g., switching
   resources, spreading out during feeding, using cheek pouches) that
   minimize the strength of within-group competition, thus facilitating
   group-level cooperation in between-group contests. The significant
   quadratic effect of group size on reproduction may occur if individuals
   in small groups do not obtain the full benefits of group living (e.g.,
   predator avoidance, increased foraging success, communal care for
   offspring) and those in large groups experience a lower quality diet or
   constrained feeding time. Ultimately, measures of reproduction are
   preferable to behavioral proxies for accurately assessing within-group
   competition.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{230}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{333-343}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Molecular imaging studies with positron emission tomography have
   revealed that the availability of serotonin transporter (5-HTT) in the
   human brain fluctuates over the course of the year. This effect is most
   pronounced in carriers of the short allele of the 5-HTT promoter region
   (5-HTTLPR), which has in several previous studies been linked to an
   increased risk to develop mood disorders. We argue that long-lasting
   fluctuations in the cerebral serotonin transmission, which is regulated
   via the 5-HTT, are responsible for mediating responses to environmental
   changes based on an assessment of the expected ``safety{''} of the
   environment; this response is obtained in part through serotonergic
   modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. We posit
   that the intermediate phenotype of the s-allele may properly be
   understood as mediating a trade-off, wherein increased responsiveness of
   cerebral serotonin transmission to seasonal and other forms of
   environmental change imparts greater behavioral flexibility, at the
   expense of increased vulnerability to stress. This model may explain the
   somewhat higher prevalence of the s-allele in some human populations
   dwelling at geographic latitudes with pronounced seasonal climatic
   changes, while this hypothesis does not rule out that genetic drift
   plays an additional or even exclusive role. We argue that s-allele
   manifests as an intermediate phenotype in terms of an increased
   responsiveness of the 5-HTT expression to number of daylight hours,
   which may serve as a stable surrogate marker of other environmental
   factors, such as availability of food and safety of the environment in
   populations that live closer to the geographic poles.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to adverse environmental conditions during early development
   can shape life-history traits and have lasting effects on physiological
   function in later life. Although findings within the biomedical
   literature have shown that environmentally induced elevations in
   glucocorticoids (GCs) during critical developmental windows can cause
   persistent carry-over effects (i.e., developmental programming), little
   is known about whether such effects of GCs can be generalized to
   wildlife species. Using wood frogs as a study species, we conducted an
   experiment with a split-plot design to assess the short-term and the
   long-term physiological consequences of availability of food,
   hydroperiod length (i.e., pond drying), and the interaction between
   these two environmental conditions. In outdoor experimental ponds, we
   reared tadpoles in chronically high or low-food conditions, and tadpoles
   from each pond experienced either high water until metamorphosis or a
   reduction in water volume during late developmental stages (after Gosner
   stage 38). After metamorphosis, animals were housed individually and fed
   ad libitum for 10 weeks, and growth rate, fat content, and resting and
   acute stress-induced GC levels were measured. We found that tadpoles
   experiencing low availability of food and reduced water volume had
   elevated GC levels, reduced mass, and body condition as they approached
   metamorphosis. At 10 weeks after metamorphosis, we found that these two
   conditions also had persistent interactive effects on post-metamorphic
   allocation of resources to growth, energy storage, and responsiveness of
   GCs to a novel stressor. Of individuals that experienced reduced water
   volume, only those that experienced high food as tadpoles were able to
   catch up to individuals that did not experience reduced water volume in
   terms of body mass, femur length, and body condition, and they allocated
   more resources to fat storage. By contrast, 10-week old frogs with
   low-food and that experienced low water volume and low-food levels as
   tadpoles allocated fewer resources to mass-specific growth, stored less
   fat, and exhibited blunted GC response to a novel stressor relative to
   those that did not experience water-reduction. Our findings demonstrate
   that environmental conditions experienced prior to and during important
   developmental transitions shape resource allocation and the ability to
   physiologically respond to future stressors in juvenile and potentially
   adult animals. These results suggest that chronic and acute
   environmental stressors experienced during early life stages can have
   cumulative and interactive effects that need to be considered when
   modeling the ecological and evolutionary consequences of environmental
   change on populations.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide (CO2) thermal lasers have previously been validated for
   the assessment of nociception in cats. This experiment sought to assess
   the potential impact of factors associated with age, sex, body weight
   and sterilisation upon nociceptive threshold as measured by latency to
   display a behavioural response. Cats (N= 113) were exposed to a CO2
   thermal laser three times during a 45-60 min test period depending upon
   the interval between tests. A minimum of 15 min elapsed between
   consecutive tests on any one individual. Time to display either a skin
   twitch or withdrawal was measured. Intra-class correlations showed the
   three measurements to be repeatable across tests for any given cat (ICC
   = 0.482; P < 0.001). Males had a significantly longer mean latency to
   respond than females (14.83 s and 12.59 s respectively; P = 0.028).
   Analyses of co-variance established that the body weight of females
   significantly affected response threshold (P=0.013) but for males this
   effect was marginal (P = 0.058). All other factors included in the
   analyses were non-significant. A post hoc t-test for males and females
   with overlapping body weights found no significant differences between
   the sexes (P = 0.721). The precise reason for the effect of body weight
   on latency to respond is unknown and further exploration is needed
   particularly as it relates to subcutaneous fat deposition and skin
   temperature. It is concluded that, for cats, the body weight of the
   subject should be standardised or included in any analyses for
   assessment of nociception. Inclusion of body weight data in analyses may
   also prove useful when using a CO2 laser protocol in other species. (C)

Abstract = {{Stable isotopes are commonly used to examine various aspects of animal
   ecology. The use of stable isotopes generally proceeds under the
   implicit assumption that resource use is the only factor driving
   variation in stable isotope levels; however, a wealth of studies
   demonstrate that a range of common ecological factors can affect the
   behavior of stable isotopes in animal tissues and potentially confound
   inferences. For example, studies of some invertebrates and endothermic
   vertebrates show that animals fasted for ecologically realistic time
   periods have higher nitrogen (delta N-15) or lower carbon (delta C-13).
   We examined whether realistic fasting would influence the stable isotope
   composition of one of the most metabolically efficient ectothermic
   vertebrates, the Eastern Red-backed Salamander, Plethodon cinereus. We
   fasted salamanders for 7, 14, 21, 28, or 35-day intervals and examined
   whether delta N-15 or delta C-13 levels of tissues changed between
   fasted and fed animals. We investigated whether body condition (body
   mass to length and C:N {[}an index of lipid levels]) declined in fasted
   animals and whether there was a relationship between C:N and delta N-15
   or delta C-13. Body mass to length index and C:N, delta C-13, and delta
   N-15 of tail and liver tissues did not differ between fasted and fed
   animals between 7 and 35 days. Because of their extreme metabolic
   efficiency, vertebrate ectotherms such as lungless salamanders
   (Plethodontidae) may not show the effects of fasting on stable isotopes
   observed in endothermic vertebrates and some invertebrates. This
   difference should lead to simpler interpretation of stable isotope
   results from field studies of these animals.}},

Abstract = {{Many arthropod species have adopted vertebrate blood as their main food
   source. Blood is rich in nutrients and, except for the presence of
   parasites, sterile. However, this food source is not freely available,

   underneath the skin of mobile hosts that are able to defend themselves
   and even predate the insects that try to feed on them. Thus, the
   haematophagous lifestyle is associated with major morphological,
   physiological and behavioural adaptations that have accumulated
   throughout the evolutionary history of the various lineages of
   blood-sucking arthropods. These adaptations have significant
   consequences for the evolution of parasites as well as for the
   epidemiology of vector-transmitted diseases. In this review article, we
   analyse various aspects of the behaviour of triatomine bugs to
   illustrate how each behavioural trait represents a particular adaptation
   to their close association with their hosts, which may easily turn into

Abstract = {{1. The mechanistic basis for and adaptive significance of variation in
   female sperm storage organs are important for a range of questions
   concerning sexual selection and speciation, as such variation influences
   the evolutionary trajectories of male fertilization related traits and
   may facilitate speciation through its effects on gamete recognition.
   2. Female yellow dung flies (Scathophaga stercoraria) usually develop
   three sperm storage compartments, and this subdivision may be an
   adaptation for sorting sperm during postcopulatory choice.
   3. Using lines artificially selected to express four spermathecae (4s),
   we explored the fitness consequences of the novel phenotype relative to
   the naturally prevalent three-spermatheca (3s) phenotype by manipulating
   the opportunity for postcopulatory sexual selection (females mated
   either with three or only one male prior to oviposition). In addition,
   we examined the developmental plasticity of spermathecal number in
   response to different larval food environments and estimated its genetic
   correlation with growth rate.
   4. Mating treatments with and without the opportunity for postcopulatory
   sexual selection revealed no significant fitness differences between
   alternative spermathecal phenotypes within selection lines despite
   overall benefits associated with multiple mating, and moderate
   egg-to-adult survival costs in response to artificial selection for 4s.
   Manipulations of the larval food environment revealed that the
   expression of 4s is highly plastic and tightly linked to environmental
   conditions promoting fast somatic growth and development. Likewise,
   siblings with fast intrinsic (genetic) growth were more likely to
   express 4s within and across food environments.
   5. The present results highlight a great potential for rapid
   evolutionary change in female sperm storage morphology through indirect
   selection on life-history traits, and further suggest genetic
   assimilation as a potential mechanism facilitating phylogenetic
   transitions in spermatheca number as frequently observed within the
   Dipterans.}},

Abstract = {{Prey can invest in a variety of defensive traits when balancing risk of
   predation against that of starvation. What remains unknown is the
   relative costs of different defensive traits and how prey reconcile
   investment into these traits when energetically limited. We tested the
   simple allocation model of prey defense, which predicts an additive
   effect of increasing predation risk and resource availability, resulting
   in the full deployment of defensive traits under conditions of high risk
   and resource saturation. We collected morphometric, developmental, and
   behavioural data in an experiment using dragonfly larvae (predator) and
   Northern leopard frog tadpoles (prey) subject to variable levels of food
   availability and predation risk. Larvae exposed to food restriction
   showed limited response to predation risk; larvae at food saturation
   altered behaviour, development, and growth in response to predation
   risk. Responses to risk varied through time, suggesting ontogeny may
   affect the deployment of particular defensive traits. The observed
   negative correlation between body size and activity level for
   food-restricted prey - and the absence of a similar response among
   adequately-fed prey - suggests that a trade-off exists between
   behavioural and growth responses when energy budgets are limited. Our
   research is the first to demonstrate how investment into these defensive
   traits is mediated along gradients of both predation risk and resource
   availability over time. The interactions we demonstrate between resource
   availability and risk level on deployment of inducible defenses provide
   evidence that both internal condition and extrinsic risk factors play a
   critical role in the production of inducible defenses over time.}},

   cod (Gadus morhua)}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Climate change influences the marine environment, with ocean warming
   being the foremost driving factor governing changes in the physiology
   and ecology of fish. At the individual level, increasing temperature
   influences bioenergetics and numerous physiological and life-history
   processes, which have consequences for the population level and beyond.
   We provide a state-dependent energy allocation model that predicts
   temperature-induced adaptations for life histories and behaviour for the
   North-East Arctic stock (NEA) of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in response
   to climate warming. The key constraint is temperature-dependent
   respiratory physiology, and the model includes a number of trade-offs
   that reflect key physiological and ecological processes. Dynamic
   programming is used to find an evolutionarily optimal strategy of
   foraging and energy allocation that maximizes expected lifetime
   reproductive output given constraints from physiology and ecology. The
   optimal strategy is then simulated in a population, where survival,
   foraging behaviour, growth, maturation and reproduction emerge. Using
   current forcing, the model reproduces patterns of growth, size-at-age,
   maturation, gonad production and natural mortality for NEA cod. The
   predicted climate responses are positive for this stock; under a 2
   degrees C warming, the model predicted increased growth rates and a
   larger asymptotic size. Maturation age was unaffected, but gonad weight
   was predicted to more than double. Predictions for a wider range of
   temperatures, from 2 to 7 degrees C, show that temperature responses
   were gradual; fish were predicted to grow faster and increase
   reproductive investment at higher temperatures. An emergent pattern of
   higher risk acceptance and increased foraging behaviour was also
   predicted. Our results provide important insight into the effects of
   climate warming on NEA cod by revealing the underlying mechanisms and
   drivers of change. We show how temperature-induced adaptations of
   behaviour and several life-history traits are not only mediated by
   physiology but also by trade-offs with survival, which has consequences
   for conservation physiology.}},

Abstract = {{Nest-site selection involves trade-offs between the probability of nest
   discovery by egg predators, danger to the incubating parent from
   predators and provision of an appropriate microclimate for incubation,
   and all three components are potentially influenced by nest concealment
   and distance to habitat edge. Personality traits also affect habitat
   choice, and the trade-off hypothesis suggests that variable
   stress-coping strategies may evolve because individuals prioritize
   either productivity (proactive coping) or survival (reactive coping),
   both of which cannot be simultaneously maximized. Applying this
   hypothesis to understand nest-site selection by female eider ducks
   (Somateria mollissima), we predicted that bold individuals with
   attenuated stress responsiveness should select concealed nests further
   away from the shore, thereby promoting clutch survival at the potential
   expense of reduced escape opportunities for themselves. In testing this
   prediction, we controlled for individual quality (female body condition
   and breeding experience) and verified that individual stress responses
   and nest-site preferences were consistent by analysing their
   repeatability. Finally, we analysed how the viable proportion of the
   clutch was related to nest-site and female characteristics. Our
   prediction was supported: bold females {[}short flight initiation
   distance (FID)] and those with lower handling-induced body temperature
   were found in concealed nests, and bold females and those with lower
   handling-induced corticosterone concentrations occupied nests farther
   from the shore. The viable proportion of the clutch peaked at
   intermediate proportional nest-cover and increased linearly with
   increasing nest distance from the shore. Stress coping styles may thus
   be related to nest-site selection, but their fitness consequences may be
   manifested indirectly through the nest-site characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{A growing body of research over the past decade indicates that
   interindividual variation in behavior can result from a variety of
   factors. Two important sources of this variation are behavioral
   plasticity (adaptive variation in behavior) and behavioral type (i.e.,
   an individual with consistent behavioral differences across one or more
   situations). Although oviposition-site selection (OS) is widespread and
   affects both parents and offspring, it has been overlooked in the
   context of the behavioral type. Thus, we used the Texas field cricket
   (Gryllus texensis) to determine if OS could be integrated into the
   behavioral type paradigm and if a relevant environmental variable (food
   limitation) influences behavioral type. We found that behavioral type
   was consistent across contexts because individuals exhibiting riskier
   (bolder) behavior in a novel environment also exhibited riskier behavior
   during oviposition. Also, individuals traded off safety with food
   availability during ovipositionuthat is, fasted crickets were more
   likely to choose food over safety (shelter) when making an oviposition
   decision. Last, relative to fed crickets, those that were fasted
   oviposited fewer eggs during overnight trials in which food was
   available. By integrating a behavior tightly linked to multigenerational
   fitness with an established behavioral assay (behavior to novel

Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{45-51}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The effect of sexual selection on nonsexual fitness is a major
   unanswered question in evolutionary biology that may have important
   implications for adaptation, diversification and the evolution of mate
   preferences. If reproductive success is condition dependent, the
   resulting sexual selection will tend to align with natural selection,
   promoting adaptation. One prediction under such a scenario is that
   adaptation to a novel environment should increase male mating success
   and hence sexual fitness. Environmentally induced plasticity in mate
   preferences could also contribute to an alignment of natural and sexual
   selection if the changes cause females to prefer locally adapted males
   as mates. We tested for both forms of alignment using a set of 10
   independent populations of Drosophila melanogaster that were adapted to
   one of two environments. Competitive mating trials were performed
   between pairs of populations adapted to these two environments, with the
   trials designed to separate the effects of local adaptation on male
   mating success from plasticity of female mate preferences in response to
   these environments. Contrary to expectations under an alignment of
   natural and sexual selection, males did not have higher mating success
   when competing in the environment to which they were adapted.
   Furthermore, there was no evidence that females altered their mate
   choice based on their rearing environment, indicating the absence of any
   adaptive plasticity in mate preferences. Overall, despite previous
   evidence of reciprocal adaptation to these different environments,
   increased nonsexual fitness did not translate into higher mating
   success, indicating a lack of any alignment with natural selection of
   this component of male sexual fitness. (C) 2013 The Association for the

Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{137-146}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Natal dispersal contributes to population dynamics and genetic
   structure. Individuals differ in whether or not they disperse and in the
   distance they travel from their natal site before settling to breed.
   Differences in natal dispersal are often associated with variation in
   other traits. These associations may arise because suites of
   morphological and behavioural traits are ultimately controlled by the
   same set of genes. The genes that control melanogenesis in vertebrates
   pleiotropically influence physiology and behaviour, including boldness
   and exploration. Because these personality traits predict dispersal, we
   tested the hypothesis that in the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica, melanic
   coloration predicts natal dispersal, using a solid matched case-control
   sampling design and a large sample. We found that males but not females
   with colour traits that reflect relatively more pheomelanic feather
   pigmentation were more likely to disperse, consistently with
   observations on the only other species for which dispersal in relation
   to plumage melanic coloration has so far been studied. To control for
   any confounding effects, we also analysed the association of dispersal
   with morphological traits and parasite infestation. Philopatric
   individuals were larger than dispersers, whereas dispersal strategy did
   not differ according to tail length, which is a sexually selected trait.
   Finally, philopatric females had a smaller infestation of a
   haematophagous louse fly. The present findings corroborate previous
   evidence that melanic coloration covaries with a suite of traits. In
   particular, they show that melanin-based plumage coloration predicts
   natal dispersal, independently of other factors also influencing
   dispersal. In addition, our results show that philopatric individuals
   were larger than dispersers possibly because individuals return to a
   benign natal place or because large body size confers an advantage in
   competitive interactions. Finally, they are compatible with the idea of
   host adaptation to local strains of a parasite with presumably small
   population size and low dispersing capacity. (C) 2013 The Association

Abstract = {{Beyond the biological risk factors of early childhood caries (ECC) is
   child temperament. This study aimed to investigate the relationship of
   ECC to different traits of child temperament, directly and indirectly
   through the nutritional and oral hygiene habits. Through a multi-stage
   sampling, 373 kindergarten children aged 18-36 months participated in
   this study. The primary caregivers filled in the Early Childhood
   Behaviour Questionnaire (ECBQ) and a checklist containing demographic
   data and the dietary and oral hygiene habits of the children. Children
   were examined for dental caries. The frequency of ECC was 41.14\%. With
   18 aspects of a child's temperament under consideration, attentional
   shifting, fear, frustration, low-intensity pleasure, sadness and shyness
   were significantly higher in the ECC group. Cuddliness, perceptual
   sensitivity, positive anticipation and soothability were significantly
   higher in caries-free children. Attentional shifting (p = 0.02),
   frustration (p = 0.02) and shyness (p = 0.03) were risk factors and
   cuddliness (p < 0.001) was a protecting factor for ECC. In the multiple
   regression model regarding nutritional and oral hygiene habits, easily
   soothable children were 0.69 times less likely to use sweetened liquids
   frequently {[}odds ratio (OR) 0.69,95\% confidence interval (Cl)
   0.49-0.97, p = 0.03], while sad children were 0.58 times less likely to
   brush (OR 0.58, 95\% Cl 0.36-0.94, p = 0.02). Considering temperament
   traits along with socioeconomic status, positive anticipation was the
   most significant determinant of ECC (OR 1.57,95\% CI 1.13-2.19, p =
   0.007). However, considering temperament, socioeconomic measures and
   child habits among ECC risk factors, the most significant was the
   initiation of brushing habits (OR 5.41,95\% CI 2.81-12.98, p = 0.002).

Abstract = {{Background: Swallowing problems following stroke may result in increased
   risk of aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, and dehydration.
   Objective/hypothesis: Our hypothesis was that three neurostimulation
   techniques would produce beneficial effects on chronic dysphagia
   following stroke through a common brain mechanism that would predict
   behavioral response.
   Methods: In 18 dysphagic stroke patients (mean age: 66 +/- 3 years, 3
   female, time-post-stroke: 63 +/- 15 weeks {[}+/- SD]), pharyngeal
   electromyographic responses were recorded after single-pulse
   transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the pharyngeal motor
   cortex, to measure corticobulbar excitability before, immediately, and
   30 min, after real and sham applications of neurostimulation. Patients
   were randomized to a single session of either: pharyngeal electrical
   stimulation (PES), paired associative stimulation (PAS) or repetitive
   TMS (rTMS). Penetration-aspiration scores and bolus transfer timings
   were assessed before and after both real and sham interventions using
   videofluoroscopy.
   Results: Corticobulbar excitability of pharyngeal motor cortex was
   beneficially modulated by PES, PAS and to a lesser extent by rTMS, with
   functionally relevant changes in the unaffected hemisphere. Following
   combining the results of real neurostimulation, an overall increase in
   corticobulbar excitability in the unaffected hemisphere (P = .005,
   F-1,F-17 = 10.6, ANOVA) with an associated 15\% reduction in aspiration
   (P = .005, z = -2.79) was observed compared to sham.
   Conclusions: In this mechanistic study, an increase in corticobulbar
   excitability the unaffected projection was correlated with the
   improvement in swallowing safety (P = .001, rho = -.732), but
   modality-specific differences were observed. Paradigms providing
   peripheral input favored change in neurophysiological and behavioral
   outcome measures in chronic dysphagia patients. Further larger cohort
   studies of neurostimulation in chronic dysphagic stroke are imperative.

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{During breeding, long-lived species face important time and energy
   constraints that can lead to breeding failure when food becomes scarce.
   Despite the potential implications of intra-season dynamics in breeding
   failure for individual behavior, carry-over effects, dispersal decisions
   and population dynamics, little information is currently available on
   these dynamics at fine temporal scales. Here, we monitored the foraging
   behavior and the proportion of successful black-legged kittiwake pairs
   from nest construction to chick fledging in a colony of the southern
   Barents Sea, to relate foraging effort to the dynamics of breeding
   failure over an entire breeding season, and to infer the environmental
   conditions leading to this failure. Specifically, we tracked kittiwakes
   with GPS and satellite tags during incubation and early chick-rearing to
   document nest attendance, foraging range, time budgets and daily energy
   expenditures (DEE). We also monitored diet changes over time. We
   predicted that breeding failure would follow a non-linear trend
   characterized by a break point after which breeding success would drop
   abruptly and would be related to a substantial increase in foraging
   effort. Kittiwakes showed contrasting foraging patterns between
   incubation and chick-rearing: they extended their foraging range from 20
   km during incubation to more than 450 km during chick-rearing and
   switched diet. They also increased their DEE and readjusted their time
   budgets by increasing time spent at sea. These changes corresponded to a
   break point in breeding dynamics beyond which the proportion of
   successful pairs abruptly dropped. At the end of the season, less than
   10\% of kittiwake pairs raised chicks in the monitored plots. This
   integrative study confirms that breeding failure is a non-linear process
   characterized by a threshold beyond which individuals face an energetic
   trade-off and cannot simultaneously sustain high reproductive and
   self-maintenance efforts. In this way, the occurrence of sudden
   environmental changes complicates our ability to predict population
   dynamics and poses conservation challenges.}},

Title = {{Benefits of migration in relation to nutritional condition and predation
   risk in a partially migratory moose population}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{225-237}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The costs and benefits of alternative migratory strategies are often
   framed in the context of top-down and bottom-up effects on individual
   fitness. This occurs because migration is considered a costly behavioral
   strategy that presumably confers explicit benefits to migrants in the
   form of either decreased predation risk (predation risk avoidance
   hypothesis) or increased nutrition (forage maturation hypothesis). To
   test these hypotheses, we studied a partially migratory moose (Alces
   alces) population and contrasted explicit measures of predation risk
   (i.e., offspring survival) and nutrition (i.e., accumulation of
   endogenous energy reserves) between resident and migratory
   subpopulations. We relied on data collected from migratory and
   nonmigratory radio-marked moose (n = 67) that inhabited a novel study
   system located in coastal Alaska between 2004 and 2010. In this area,
   30\% of the population resides year-round on a coastal foreland area,
   while 48\% migrate to either a small island archipelago or a subalpine
   ridge system (the remainder exhibited one of six different
   low-occurrence strategies). Overall, we determined that accumulation of
   body fat during the growing season did not differ between migratory or
   resident modalities. However, calf survival was 2.6-2.9 times higher for
   individuals that migrated (survival, islands = 0.49 +/- 0.16 {[}mean +/-
   SE], n = 35; ridge = 0.52 +/- 0.16, n = 33) than those that did not
   (survival, resident = 0.19 +/- 0.08, n = 57). Our results support the
   predation risk avoidance hypotheses, and suggest that migration is a
   behavioral strategy that principally operates to reduce the risk of calf
   predation and does not confer explicit nutritional benefits. We did not
   directly detect trade-offs between predation risk and nutrition for
   migratory individuals. Yet we identify an indirect life history
   mechanism that may mildly dampen the apparent fitness benefits of
   migration. The proximate factors accounting for differences in
   migration-specific neonate survival are likely linked to accessibility
   of refugial habitats for moose at local and landscape scales, landscape
   factors that affect hunting efficacy of large carnivores, and
   interactions with rural human communities. Conservation of ungulate
   populations can be aided by integrating knowledge about migratory
   behavior, life history strategies, and factors that alter ungulate
   vulnerability, particularly those induced by human activity.}},

Abstract = {{The Look AHEAD trial, evaluating the effects of weight loss on
   cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in overweight/obese people
   with type 2 diabetes (T2D), was interrupted after a median 9.5-year
   follow-up because the incidence of CV events was not different between
   the Intensive Lifestyle Intervention (ILI) and the control groups, and
   unlikely to statistically change thereafter. This made health providers
   and patients wondering about clinical value of diet and physical
   exercise in diabetic patients. Many factors may have made difficult to
   ascertain benefits of lifestyle intervention, besides the lower than
   predicted CV event rates. Among others, LDL-cholesterol was lowered
   more, with a higher use of statins, in the control group. Anyhow, ILI
   significantly improved numerous health conditions, including quality of
   life, CV risk factors and blood glucose control, with more diabetes
   remissions and less use of insulin.
   The intervention aimed at weight loss by reducing fat calories, and
   using meal replacements and, eventually, orlistat, likely
   underemphasizing dietary composition. There is suggestive evidence, in
   fact, that qualitative changes in dietary composition aiming at higher
   consumption of foods rich in fiber and with a high vegetable/animal fat
   ratio favorably influence CV risk in T2D patients.
   In conclusion, the Look AHEAD showed substantial health benefits of
   lifestyle modifications. Prevention of CV events may need higher
   attention to dietary composition, contributing to stricter control of CV
   risk factors. As a better health-related quality of life in people with
   diabetes is an important driver of our clinical decisions, efforts on
   early implementation of behavioral changes through a multifactorial
   approach are strongly justified. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Parental care promotes offspring survival and, for livestock species,
   this care is provided solely by the mother. Maternal behaviour in the
   sheep has been exceptionally well-studied compared with other species
   and many of the underpinning biological processes leading to the
   expression of maternal care are known. In this review the current state
   of play with regard to the biology of maternal care will be reviewed,
   and its application to provide practical solutions to reduce lamb
   mortality considered. For maternal care to be elicited at birth the ewe
   requires elevated circulating oestradiol in late gestation, which
   stimulates the expression of oxytocin receptors in both peripheral and
   central areas (particularly the hypothalamic and limbic areas of the
   brain). At birth stretching of the vaginocervical canal elicits a spinal
   reflex which triggers the release of oxytocin primarily from neurones
   within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Oxytocin release
   causes an increase in the neurotransmitters noradrenaline,
   acetylcholine, glutamate and -aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the olfactory
   bulb, and other brain regions important for maternal behaviour. Finally,
   sensory cues provided by the lamb, in particular the amniotic fluids
   surrounding it, lead to the expression of maternal behaviours (licking,
   low-pitched bleats, acceptance of the lamb at the udder and suckling).
   This allows the expression of the two facets of maternal behaviour in
   the ewe: nurturance of the young and maternal selectivity, whereby a
   specific olfactory memory for the ewes own lamb is formed and the
   expression of maternal care is restricted to this lamb. Variation in the
   expression of maternal care has been demonstrated in primiparous ewes
   compared with multiparous, in different sheep genotypes, with
   undernutrition, stress in pregnancy, following a difficult delivery, and
   may occur with variation in ewe temperament. An understanding of the
   importance of the timing of various events in late pregnancy and during
   parturition, as well as the factors that can disrupt these events, can
   help to design management activities to minimise risks to the successful
   onset of maternal behaviour. Management practices that work with the
   biology of the ewe will be the most successful in ensuring that maternal
   care is expressed, so improving the welfare of the ewe and lamb, and the
   profitability of the farm.}},

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{498}},
Pages = {{161-U519}},
Abstract = {{Terrestrial insect predators and parasitoids commonly use volatile plant
   compounds released during grazing to find living herbivorous prey (i. e.
   tritrophic signaling). Because few studies have tested for tritrophic
   signaling in marine organisms, it is unclear if marine predators
   commonly use these fluid-borne cues to find living herbivore prey,
   especially under realistic settings. Such interactions might occur in
   the ocean because marine predators often use chemo sensory- based
   foraging, and herbivore-induced production of defensive chemistry is
   common in some algal taxa. To examine the ability of predators to find
   live herbivores using waterborne chemical cues from grazed algae, we
   tested the responses of marine predators to several baits using in situ
   trapping and video experiments. We tested the attractiveness of chemical
   cues released by (1) Macrocystis pyrifera and Ulva sp. actively grazed
   by herbivores for short-or longterm periods, (2) crushed herbivores, (3)
   positive controls containing fish carrion, or (4) negative controls.
   Most predators trapped and filmed were spiny lobsters Panulirus
   interruptus. Under realistic field conditions, chemical cues from
   actively grazed algae with live herbivores failed to attract predators,
   but chemical cues from crushed herbivores and fish carrion were highly
   attractive. Thus, while marine predators like lobsters may utilize
   fluid-borne chemical cues to find dead or injured prey, such cues appear
   less important for finding live herbivore prey. Our literature review of
   142 terrestrial studies revealed that tritrophic cues were unrelated to
   diet breadth of predators or herbivores and that most examples of
   terrestrial tritrophic signaling contained parasitoid predators. We
   additionally found that similar field studies in natural,
   non-agricultural settings such as ours are lacking even in
   better-studied terrestrial food webs, where they represent only 3\% of
   manipulative experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Seabirds of tropical oceanic waters have to cope with an extremely
   oligotrophic habitat, but little is known about their foraging behaviour
   and flexibility which enables them to catch sufficient prey for
   themselves and their chicks. In a 7 yr study encompassing contrasting
   oceanographic conditions, the foraging behaviour of chick-rearing
   Abbott's boobies Papasula abbotti, seabirds endemic to Christmas Island,
   Indian Ocean, was investigated using GPS- and diveloggers to examine (1)
   if the species exhibits foraging strategies that indicate specific
   adaptations to unproductive tropical oceanic waters, and (2) if (or how)
   the birds adjust their foraging behaviour to inter-annually varying
   marine conditions. Abbott's boobies displayed a number of distinct
   characteristics in their foraging behaviour: flight velocities were
   slower and diving activity lower than in other booby species. Foraging
   efficiency was enhanced by distinct temporal tuning of diving activity
   and trip timing, peaking in the morning and again in the afternoon. The
   birds exhibited some flexibility in foraging behaviour: when conditions
   deteriorated (i.e. when waters became warmer and less productive), their
   diet composition changed, they increased their trip durations, trip
   range and maximum dive depth, although other parameters such as diving
   activity and sinuosity did not change. Remarkably, the time spent on the
   water increased simultaneously with trip length. By those adaptations,
   Abbott's boobies were able to keep their body condition (as well as that
   of their chicks) stable even under poor marine conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Post-bariatric surgery patients are overrepresented in substance abuse

   This investigation assessed factors associated with post-RYGB substance
   misuse. Post-RYGB patients (N = 141; at least 24 months postsurgery)
   completed an online survey assessing variables hypothesized to
   contribute to post-RYGB SUDs. Fourteen percent of participants met
   criteria for postoperative substance misuse. Those with a lower percent

   Family history of substance misuse was strongly associated with
   postoperative substance misuse. Eating-related variables including
   presurgical food addiction and postsurgical nocturnal eating, subjective
   hunger, and environmental responsiveness to food cues were also
   associated with a probable postoperative SUD. These findings have
   clinical utility in that family history of substance misuse can be
   easily assessed, and at-risk patients can be advised accordingly. In

   spring-spawning herring. There were consistent trends across years in
   the school characteristics demonstrating state-dependent schooling

Series = {{Methods in Molecular Biology}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Memory is a high-level brain function that enables organisms to adapt
   their behavioral responses to the environment, hence increasing their
   probability of survival. The Ras-ERK pathway is a key molecular
   intracellular signalling cascade for memory consolidation. In this
   chapter we will describe two main one-trial behavioral tests commonly
   used in the field of memory research in order to assess the role of
   Ras-ERK signalling in long-term memory: passive avoidance and object
   recognition.
   Passive avoidance (PA) is a fear-motivated instrumental learning task,
   designed by Jarvik and Essman in 1960, in which animals learn to refrain
   from emitting a behavioral response that has previously been associated
   with a punishment. We will describe here the detailed protocol and show
   some examples of how PA can reveal impairments or enhancements in memory
   consolidation following loss or gain of function genetic manipulations
   of the Ras-ERK pathway. The phenotypes of global mutants as Ras-GRF1 KO,
   GENA53, and ERK1 KO mice, as well as of conditional region-specific
   mutants (striatal K-CREB mice), will be illustrated as examples. Novel
   object recognition (NOR), developed by Ennaceur and Delacour in 1988, is
   instead a more recent and highly ecological test, which relies on the
   natural tendency of rodents to spontaneously approach and explore novel
   objects, representing hence a useful non-stressful tool for the study of

   be described. In addition to the classical discrimination index (DI)
   that measures the ability of an animal to discriminate between two
   different objects which are presented at the same time, we will describe
   the formula of a new index that we present here for the first time, the

Abstract = {{The system of Circadian Rhythms is a mechanism that, in the forms of
   animal life, has evolved in order to synchronize the behavior and
   physiological responses to environmental periodical stimuli, so as to
   allow faster response and better adaptation to environmental changes.
   These stimuli (light, food availability, presence of predators,
   availability of a partner for reproduction) in turn depend on the
   rotation of the earth on its axis and around the sun.
   In mammals, there is a central hypothalamic clock, said Master Clock,
   directly regulated by light in its periodicity, which therefore plays
   the role of primary synchronizer, and several peripheral clocks, Slave
   Clock, synchronized with each other and constantly reset the MC.
   Between external stinzuli food plays a fundamental role, as capable of
   take the place of the light in certain conditions.
   In recent years there has emerged a direct correlation between
   alteration of Circadian Rhythm, variously induced, and the development
   of multifactorial diseases such as obesity and diabetes. The biological
   clock is involved in the maintenance of energy homeostasis and thus in
   search of food and in the regulation of body weight.
   The recent concept of chrono-nutrition, expressed perfectly the
   influence of food, through times of intake but also by its specific
   composition, is able to exert on the expression of regulatory genes of
   circadian rhythms, and therefore the maintenance or alteration of energy
   homeostasis of the organism.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity pervades organismal development and physiology
   where it facilitates an enormous range of adaptive responses to novel or
   stressful environments. Plasticity also impacts evolutionary processes,
   reducing the probability of population extinction in the face of
   environmental changes and sometimes increasing speciation rates in
   developmentally plastic lineages. Despite the adaptive significance of
   plasticity, organisms are not infinitely plastic; rather they are
   constrained in the kinds and ranges of environmental changes to which
   their body parts, organs, and tissues can respond. Understanding the
   nature, costs, and limits of developmental plasticity requires insight
   into (i) the developmental-genetic and genomic mechanisms underlying
   plastic responses as well as (ii) their interplay with ecological and
   social conditions. In this chapter we review and summarize recent
   progress in the development of horned beetles as a study system with
   which to explore the interactions between changing ecological conditions
   and plastic, genome-wide responses in gene expression and developmental
   function. In particular, we focus on plastic responses to nutritional
   variation, which in horned beetles differ widely as a function of body
   region, sex, and species. We begin by introducing the study system and
   summarize the developmental-genetic and genomic tool set currently
   available for horned beetles. We then present recently developed
   statistical approaches that can be used to guide the design of
   multi-factorial genome-wide transcriptional comparisons when
   circumstances prohibit a fully balanced design. We present an example of
   such an approach in the horned beetle Onthophagus taurus and end by
   highlighting the growing opportunities for future ecological-genomic
   studies in horned beetles.}},

Abstract = {{Background:The aims of the present study were to explore whether
   symptoms in different anxiety disorders are associated with Cloninger's
   model temperament dimensions novelty seeking (NS), harm avoidance (HA),
   reward dependence and persistence compared with control subjects in
   clinical samples of adults or late adolescents. Method: Literature
   search in the following databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed (Medline),
   Web of Science, Psycinfo and PsycArticles. Systematic review, grading
   the level of evidence and meta-analysis for each disorder by comparing
   the temperament dimension scores between patient and control samples in
   single studies. Results: A total of 40 papers fulfilled the inclusion
   criteria. Meta-analyses were conducted on a total of 24 studies focusing
   on panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder (SAD) and
   obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The primary finding was a constant
   and clinically marked positive association between the HA temperament
   dimension and symptoms of PD, SAD and OCD, with a most marked effect in
   SAD, and a moderate effect in OCD and PD. Second, less marked and
   clinically marginal associations between NS score and SAD and OCD
   (negative associations), but no associations with PD were observed. The
   meta-analyses revealed heterogeneity between the results of individual
   studies, especially in the analyses including SAD and OCD. Conclusions:
   PD, SAD and OCD share a marked and state-dependent avoidant behavioral
   pattern, which is common for all anxiety disorders. However, PD showed a
   different pattern of arousal to novel stimuli from that of SAD and OCD.
   The findings are state dependent and based on cross-sectional studies.

Title = {{Qualitative behavioural assessment of the motivation for feed in sheep
   in response to altered body condition score}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{922-929}},
Abstract = {{Qualitative behavioural assessment (QBA) has been used to quantify the
   expressive behaviour of animals, and operant tests have been used to
   quantify measures of behavioural need. In this study we compared
   measures of behavioural expression and behaviour in operant tests. We
   examined the behavioural expression of pregnant ewes of body condition
   score (BCS) 2 and 3. The ewes were exposed to a feed motivation test in
   which they received a food reward. Pregnant ewes (48-70 days gestation)
   were assessed during a food motivation test after they had been
   maintained at BCS 3 (n = 7) or given a decreasing plane of nutrition
   that resulted in slow loss of 1 BCS unit (over 10-12 weeks; n = 7) or a
   fast loss of 1 BCS unit (over 4-6 weeks; n = 7). The feed motivation
   test involved ewes having the opportunity to approach a food reward and
   then being moved a given distance away from the reward by an automatic
   gate; they could then subsequently return to the feeder. Continuous
   video footage of each ewe during one cycle of the gate (approaching and
   returning from the food reward) was shown in random order to 11
   observers who used their own descriptive terms (free-choice profiling
   methodology; FCP) to score the animals using QBA. Data of the assessment
   were analysed with generalised Procrustes analysis (GPA), a multivariate
   statistical technique associated with FCP. The research group also
   quantified the feeding behaviour of sheep in the same clips. These
   behaviours included how sheep approached the feeder, behaviours
   exhibited at the feeder, and how sheep returned from the feeder. There
   was consensus amongst observers in terms of their assessment of
   behavioural expression of the sheep (P < 0.001). The GPA found three
   main dimensions of assessed behavioural expression in the sheep, which
   together explained 44\% of the variation observed. GPA dimension 1
   differed between the three treatment groups (P < 0.05): ewes maintained
   at BCS 3 scored low on GPA dimension 1 (i.e. were described as more
   calm/bored/comfortable) compared with ewes that had a slow declining BCS
   (described as more interested/anxious/excited). GPA dimension 2 scores
   were not significantly different between treatment groups. However,
   quantitative behaviours exhibited by sheep during the clips were
   correlated with qualitative behavioural assessments made by the
   observers. Animals that spent more time `sniffing and looking for more
   feed' were attributed lower GPA 2 scores (described as more
   hungry/searching/excited) (P < 0.05), and animals that `did not walk
   directly to the food reward (but stopped along the way)' were attributed
   significantly higher GPA 2 scores (more curious/intimidated/uneasy) (P <
   0.01). GPA dimension 3 scores also did not differ between the treatment
   groups; however, sheep that had a higher number of feeding events during
   the entire 23-h feed motivation test were attributed lower GPA dimension
   3 scores (they were described as more hungry/bold/interested) (P <
   0.05), and sheep that consumed a larger amount of the feed reward were
   attributed higher GPA dimension 3 scores (more
   curious/concerned/reserved) (P < 0.05). We conclude that QBA is a
   valuable method of assessing sheep behavioural expression under the
   conditions tested, in that it provided an integrative characterisation
   of sheep behavioural expression that was in agreement with quantitative
   behavioural measures of feeding.}},

Abstract = {{Fetal growth restriction (FGR) can emerge as a complication of placental

   patients with and ED patients without a history of attempted suicide.
   Results: A history of attempted suicide was found in 11.8\% of the ED

   Multivariate analyses showed that a history of attempted suicide was
   associated with higher scores on depression, purging symptomatology,

Journal = {{URSUS}},

Volume = {{25}},

Pages = {{121-138}},
Abstract = {{Foraging decisions and movement strategies by animals often involve a
   trade-off between meeting nutritional demands and minimizing risk of
   predation. We evaluated the influence of space use and movement patterns
   of maternal female grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) on cub (defined as first
   year of life) survival in eastern Interior Alaska, USA, during
   2008-2012. We monitored 9 GPS radiocollared females that produced 28
   cubs in 12 litters ((x) over bar litter size = 2.3, range = 2-3). The
   estimated annual cub survival rate was 0.39 (95\% CI = 0.20-0.57). In
   all cases the entire litter survived or died prior to den entrance. All
   cubs in a litter died either concurrently or within 14 days in 5 of 7
   litters lost. Sixty-nine percent of cub mortality occurred between 31
   May and 16 June. We did not document cub mortality before 31 May.
   Females with surviving cubs remained within 1 km of the den for a longer
   period following emergence than those that lost cubs. Between den
   emergence and the onset of vegetation green-up, females with surviving
   cubs used fewer habitat patches and remained in individual habitat
   patches longer than females that lost their cubs later in the summer.
   Females with surviving cubs exhibited different activity patterns
   compared with females that lost their cubs, particularly by moving less
   between midnight and mid-morning during 15 May-16 June. Once vegetation
   green-up occurred, movement rates of all maternal females were similar
   except that females with surviving cubs continued to move less during
   the morning hours (0000-1200 hr). We did not find evidence that the body
   size of the mother was a factor explaining cub survival nor was there
   evidence that cub survival was directly influenced by human causes. The
   most successful behavioral strategies used by maternal females to
   maximize cub survival appeared to be a combination of limiting movements
   to a few habitat patches between den emergence and vegetation green-up
   and limiting activity between midnight and mid-morning. We suggest that
   the ability to find and exploit suitable habitat patches during this
   period of limited resources may have allowed females to alter movements
   temporally and spatially and provision themselves and their cubs more
   effectively. This strategy was likely effective for both minimizing
   exposure to infanticidal adult bears and allowing cubs to maximize
   energy efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Food and beverage intake is the only behavior that animals, including
   human beings, must continually repeat in order to provide energy and
   chemical materials to the body. Recent epidemiological findings are
   poised to usher the science of nutrition into in a new era in which the
   consumption of specific whole foods, now called functional foods, is
   strongly associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases, including
   cancer and cardiovascular diseases. These findings have led to the
   hypothesis that specific food components, in particular phenolic
   compounds, interact with the human organism at the organ, cellular, and
   molecular levels to trigger a preventive action against chronic
   diseases. Numerous bioactive compounds have been identified and isolated
   from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and are now present in all
   drugstores as dietary supplements to the usual intake of amino acids,
   vitamin, botanical compounds, and so on, although much basic information
   about their action in humans remains limited. For example, no
   stratification by sex has been performed in studies of their effects.
   Although human beings are mainly made up of men and women, in recent
   years it has become accepted that both biological sex and gender are
   prominent players in health and medicine. Until the last decade of the
   20th century, research on women was neglected and results obtained in
   men were directly translated to women, both in medicine and in
   nutrition. Different strategies have been developed in order to maintain
   male and female body homeostasis, implying that there are important
   differences in the bioavailability, metabolism, distribution, and
   elimination of bioactive compounds in males and in females. This article
   will review some of these differences underlying the possibility that
   plant-derived phenolic compounds can differently influence the health of
   male and female individuals.}},

Abstract = {{By any of several measures, the health of the American population has
   been worsening over the last two decades. Obesity, type 2 diabetes and
   heart failure have risen dramatically. All the while, the average
   birthweight at all gestational ages has declined. The relationship
   between robust growth in the womb and lifelong health is now well
   established. Likewise, babies born at the low end of the birthweight
   scale are known to have highly elevated risks for ischemic heart
   disease, hypertension, stroke and metabolic disease. The biological
   mechanisms by which developmental plasticity becomes a risk for
   cardiovascular disease are only now being understood. Translating from
   animal and human studies, low birthweight babies are likely to have
   endothelial dysfunction, fewer nephrons, fewer pancreatic beta cells,
   less vascular elastin, fewer cardiomyocytes, increased sympathetic tone
   and liver-derived dyslipidemias. Only in the past few years, however,
   has it become known that maternal and placenta phenotypes are associated
   with adult onset cardiovascular disease. Helsinki Birth Cohort studies
   have been especially important in the discovery of these relationships.
   Sudden cardiac death is associated with a thin placenta and heart
   failure is associated with a small placenta in short mothers. Coronary
   heart disease is associated with three combinations of
   maternal-placental phenotypes. Because the diet is important in
   providing nutrients for the development of the female body before
   pregnancy and for providing nutrients during pregnancy, there is
   increasing evidence that the western diet is an underlying cause for the
   increase in metabolic disease in the American population. A large
   segment of the American population suffers from high calorie
   malnutrition. Scientists in this field now have a responsibility to
   educate the public on the topic of nutrition and health. This chapter
   honors Lawrence Longo for decades of work in bringing health to pregnant
   women and their babies.}},

Abstract = {{Alexandru George defined himself as a complex Romanian personality,
   though not really openly accepted, due to the diversity of his writings.
   A scholar indeed, quite intriguing through the vast culture and multiple
   literary ways of documentation, a master of disimulation and diplomacy,
   he possessed the rare gift of choosing the best moment of writing, so
   that to create an undeniable charisma. Thus, among 1970-1980, he mostly
   published critics, translations and short prose; the most difficult
   decade, politically talking, since 1980 to 1989, was devoted mainly to
   novels - the real expression of his talent; nevertheless, after the
   Revolution, until 2012, the year he had passed away, he profoundly
   switched the manner we got used to and finally turned into a political
   observer, hinting to great culture representatives, more or less
   involved in country's leadership, as well. Pro Libertate is a bunch of
   essays published in 1999, having as strategy the comparison of the past
   with the very present, aiming to important data exposing history and
   politics. However, what is supposed to be a type of analyse and distant
   observation keeps on changing into a subjective point of view, an inner
   display of lives and destinies devoted to the rise of a country, as seen
   by Alexandru George himself. The reader might experience the controversy
   to believe a writer who was probably a favourite of some communists,
   showing an intelectual hunger for spotless freedom, so far, or to simply
   allow to be informed, for the sake of being able to compare George,
   sometimes, to any other ``suitor{''}. Here are a few of the titles to
   remember: Ahead, ahead, again; A crucial moment; The failure of marxism;
   My teachers' betrayal; Where the monster came from.
   The wish to change has become an endless request for any Romanian and
   might be regarded as another misunderstanding for the term evolution.

   Feedbacks in a Subsidized Model Food Web}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 21}},
Abstract = {{Resource subsidies increase the productivity of recipient food webs and
   can affect ecosystem dynamics. Subsidies of prey often support elevated
   predator biomass which may intensify top-down control and reduce the
   flow of reciprocal subsidies into adjacent ecosystems. However, top-down
   control in subsidized food webs may be limited if primary consumers
   posses morphological or behavioral traits that limit vulnerability to
   predation. In forested streams, terrestrial prey support high predator
   biomass creating the potential for strong top-down control, however
   armored primary consumers often dominate the invertebrate assemblage.
   Using empirically based simulation models, we tested the response of
   stream food webs to variations in subsidy magnitude, prey vulnerability,
   and the presence of two top predators. While terrestrial prey inputs
   increased predator biomass (+12\%), the presence of armored primary
   consumers inhibited top-down control, and diverted most aquatic energy
   (similar to 75\%) into the riparian forest through aquatic insect
   emergence. Food webs without armored invertebrates experienced strong
   trophic cascades, resulting in higher algal (similar to 50\%) and
   detrital (similar to 1600\%) biomass, and reduced insect emergence
   (-90\%). These results suggest prey vulnerability can mediate food web
   responses to subsidies, and that top-down control can be arrested even
   when predator-invulnerable consumers are uncommon (20\%) regardless of
   the level of subsidy.}},

   Cardiovascular Risk}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 29}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Recent research suggests that diet quality influences
   depression risk; however, a lack of experimental evidence leaves open
   the possibility that residual confounding explains the observed
   relationships. The aim of this study was to document the cross-sectional
   and longitudinal associations between dietary patterns and symptoms of
   depression and to undertake a detailed examination of potential
   explanatory factors, particularly socioeconomic circumstances, in the
   diet-depression relationship.
   Methods: Data were drawn from the Personality and Total Health (PATH)
   Through Life Study, a longitudinal community study following three age
   cohorts (20+; 40+; 60+ yrs) from south-eastern Australia over three
   assessment periods (n = 3663). Regression analyses evaluated the
   cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between dietary patterns,
   depressive symptoms, age, detailed measures of socioeconomic
   circumstances, other health behaviours, and cardiovascular risk factors.
   Results: The lowest tertile of prudent (healthy) dietary pattern and the
   highest tertile of western (unhealthy) dietary pattern were associated
   with an increased likelihood of depressive symptoms. However, these
   contemporaneous associations were explained by adjustment for detailed
   measures of socioeconomic circumstances and physical activity. In
   prospective analyses, lower scores on the healthy dietary pattern and
   higher scores on the unhealthy dietary pattern independently predicted
   increased depressive symptoms across time, before and after adjustment
   for potential confounders and baseline depressive symptoms, but only for
   those in the oldest cohort. Dietary patterns did not explain the
   relationship between socioeconomic position and depressive symptoms.
   Conclusion: The results of this study confirm that the relationship
   between habitual dietary intake and depressive symptoms is somewhat
   explained by socioeconomic circumstances and other health behaviours,
   but suggest that long term exposure to unhealthy dietary habits
   independently predisposes to depression over the lifecourse.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Studies in adults show associations between the
   hypofunctional seven-repeat allele (7R) of the dopamine-4 receptor gene
   (DRD4), increased eating behaviour and/or obesity, particularly in
   females. We examined whether 7R is associated with total caloric intake
   and/or food choices in pre-schoolers. Methods: 150 four-year-old
   children taking part in a birth cohort study in Canada were administered
   a snack test meal in a laboratory setting. Mothers also filled out a
   food frequency questionnaire to address childrens' habitual food
   consumption. Total caloric and individual macronutrient intakes during
   the snack meal and specific types of foods as reported in the food
   diaries were compared across 7R allele carriers vs. non-carriers, using
   current BMI as a co-variate. Results: We found significant sex by
   genotype interactions for fat and protein intake during the snack test.
   Post hoc testing revealed that in girls, but not boys, 7R carriers ate
   more fat and protein than did non-carriers. Based on the food diaries,
   across both sexes, 7R carriers consumed more portions of ice cream and
   less vegetables, eggs, nuts and whole bread, suggesting a less healthy
   pattern of habitual food consumption. Conclusion: The 7R allele of DRD4
   influences macronutrient intakes and specific food choices as early as
   four years of age. The specific pattern of results further suggests that
   prior associations between the 7R allele and adult overeating/obesity
   may originate in food choices observable in the preschool years.
   Longitudinal follow-up of these children will help establish the
   relevance of these findings for obesity risk and prevention. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Food choice and consumption behaviour are influenced by many interacting

   Starting from the analysis of consumer preferences for some of the most

   (enriched drinks and yogurt) and ready-to-eat frozen food, our study
   investigates the role of traditional demographic variables vs attitudes

   technologies were collected by means of the Food Technology Neophobia

   towards processed foods which are the end-result of mature technologies.
   The four FTNS components, once measured and used independently, help

   fertility control}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{259-269}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Anthropogenic stress on natural systems, particularly the fragmentation
   of landscapes and the extirpation of predators from food webs, has
   intensified the need to regulate abundance of wildlife populations with
   management. Controlling population growth using fertility control has
   been considered for almost four decades, but nearly all research has
   focused on understanding effects of fertility control agents on
   individual animals. Questions about the efficacy of fertility control as
   a way to control populations remain largely unanswered. Collateral
   consequences of contraception can produce unexpected changes in birth
   rates, survival, immigration and emigration that may reduce the
   effectiveness of regulating animal abundance. The magnitude and
   frequency of such effects vary with species-specific social and
   reproductive systems, as well as connectivity of populations. Developing
   models that incorporate static demographic parameters from populations
   not controlled by contraception may bias predictions of fertility
   control efficacy. Many population-level studies demonstrate that changes
   in survival and immigration induced by fertility control can compensate
   for the reduction in births caused by contraception. The most successful
   cases of regulating populations using fertility control come from
   applications of contraceptives to small, closed populations of
   gregarious and easily accessed species. Fertility control can result in
   artificial selection pressures on the population and may lead to
   long-term unintentional genetic consequences. The magnitude of such
   selection is dependent on individual heritability and behavioural
   traits, as well as environmental variation.Synthesis and applications.
   Understanding species' life-history strategies, biology, behavioural
   ecology and ecological context is critical to developing realistic
   expectations of regulating populations using fertility control. Before
   time, effort and funding are invested in wildlife contraception,
   managers may need to consider the possibility that many species and
   populations can compensate for reduction in fecundity, and this could
   minimize any reduction in population growth rate.
   Upland land use is associated with curlew declines, with predation a
   likely mechanism, and this may apply to other breeding waders. The
   removal of isolated woodland plantations from otherwise unafforested
   landscapes may help reduce predation pressure across a range of systems
   including moorland. However, direct predator control may also be
   important to conserve ground-nesting birds in these landscapes, for
   example, where moorland management and forestry coexist as major land
   uses. Predator control may also mitigate climate change effects by
   enhancing wader productivity, particularly where climate effects
   coincide with changing land use. Emerging land uses in open landscapes,
   including native woodland restoration and wind farms, require careful
   siting to minimize further impacts on open-area breeding birds.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{94-100}},

Abstract = {{1. Stressful or stochastic environments may have significant selective
   effects, leading to increased plasticity or stress resistance.
   Starvation is a type of stress commonly encountered among organisms
   inhabiting stochastic environments. Indeed, starvation endurance is an
   important trait, especially in sit-and-wait predators, which experience
   frequent fluctuations in prey arrivals because of their limited
   mobility. Differences in starvation endurance between antlions
   originating from Mediterranean (benign and predictable) and desert
   (harsher and stochastic) regions were investigated by exposing them to
   starvation in a fully factorial experiment using climate chambers
   simulating Mediterranean or desert climatic conditions. A trade-off
   between growth rate and starvation endurance was also investigated by
   feeding the antlions at two different frequencies pre-starvation.
   Additionally, the existence of growth compensation was tested for by
   measuring relative growth rate when feeding was resumed post-starvation.
   Population of origin did not significantly affect rates of body mass
   loss during starvation or relative growth rates when feeding was
   resumed. Antlions that were fed less frequently during the feeding phase
   lost mass faster during the starvation phase, but grew faster during the
   compensation phase. This study emphasises the importance of testing
   responses to stress when investigating life-history trade-offs. Some
   phenotypic differences between populations might be apparent only when
   exposing the experimental organisms to external stress. Conversely,
   phenotypic differences apparent under stress-free conditions might be
   masked by the effects of the stress factor. Adopting such an integrative
   approach allows elucidation of the level of plasticity in response to
   stress in different populations.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{13-19}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Owing to the trade-off between time for searching for and exploiting
   resources, choosing a profitable food resource is key for an animal's
   survival and reproductive success. Although the optimal diet model (ODM)
   from optimal foraging theory (OFT) has demonstrated this point
   successfully by modelling the global maximization of energy intake rate
   for foraging, the behavioural mechanisms by which animals achieve
   optimization, especially when facing a novel environment, have yet to be
   understood. Here we propose a recent experience-driven (RED)
   decision-making rule of foraging that relies only on short-term memory
   of recent feeding experience and hunger aversion. This contrasts with
   the ODM, which assumes both global information access to the forager and
   its apparent ability to reach optimal choices. Despite relying only on
   limited past experience and hunger aversion, this behavioural rule not
   only accounts for nearly the same energy intake rate as predicted by the
   ODM but also can flexibly respond to changing environments by rapidly
   reaching new optimization. The RED behaviour also predicts a more
   realistic partial preference for diet choice, contrasting with the
   zero-one rule of OFT which allows for no partial preference within the
   forager's diet. The partial preference simply emerges from the RED
   strategy, as opposed to decision-making errors imposed from behavioural
   and physiological constraints. The RED rule further elucidates three
   potential traits that natural selection can act upon for optimizing
   foraging: (1) short-term memory of recent feeding experience, (2)
   ability to recognize encountered resources, and (3) basic neural set-up
   for alternative responses to environmental cues. This simple and
   flexible RED rule thus provides a behavioural mechanism for optimal
   foraging, and can be further applied to decision-making theory in
   psychology and economics. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of

Title = {{Food acquisition and predator avoidance in a Neotropical rodent}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{41-48}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Foraging activity in animals reflects a compromise between acquiring
   food and avoiding predation. The risk allocation hypothesis predicts
   that prey animals optimize this balance by concentrating their foraging
   activity at times of relatively low predation risk, as much as their
   energy status permits, but empirical evidence is scarce. We used a
   unique combination of automated telemetry, manual radiotelemetry and
   camera trapping to test whether activity at high risk times declined
   with food availability as predicted in a Neotropical forest rodent, the
   Central American agouti, Dasyprocta punctata. We found that the relative
   risk of predation by the main predator, the ocelot, Leopardus pardalis,
   estimated as the ratio of ocelot to agouti activity on camera trap
   photographs, was up to four orders of magnitude higher between sunset
   and sunrise than during the rest of the day. Kills of radiotracked
   agoutis by ocelots during this high-risk period far exceeded
   expectations given agouti activity. Both telemetric monitoring of
   radio-tagged agoutis and camera monitoring of burrow entrances indicated
   that agoutis exited their burrows later at dawn, entered their burrows
   earlier at dusk and had lower overall activity levels when they lived in
   areas with higher food abundance. Thus, agoutis avoided activity during
   the high-risk period more strongly when access to food was higher. Our
   study provides quantitative empirical evidence of prey animals
   concentrating their activity at times of relatively low predation risk.

Abstract = {{The acquisition of information such as the location and quality of food,
   mates or shelter is a key survival requirement for animals. Individuals
   can acquire information through personal experience (private
   information) or through observing and interacting with others (social
   information). Environmental spatial and temporal heterogeneity can mean
   that sometimes social information conflicts with private knowledge. We
   tested how personality affected the importance placed on public versus
   private information in wild female guppies when these two information
   sources came into conflict. We found that boldness and sociality
   affected decisions to use conflicting social and private information.
   Bolder females used social information to avoid competition and/or
   potential patch depletion, whereas highly social individuals preferred
   the presence of conspecifics over rich foraging opportunities. There was
   no evidence of a speed -accuracy trade-off in a spatial associative
   learning task; rather, bold female guppies learned both more quickly and
   more accurately than shy females. We found no evidence of a behavioural
   syndrome between boldness and sociality which is consistent with
   previous studies on this population. (C) 2013 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Can we reset, reprogram, rejuvenate, or reverse the organismal aging
   process? Certain genetic manipulations could at least reset and
   reprogram epigenetic dynamics beyond phenotypic plasticity and
   elasticity in cells, which can be manipulated further into organisms.
   However, in a whole complex aging organism, how can we rejuvenate
   intrinsic resources and infrastructures in an intact and noninvasive
   manner? The incidence of diseases increases exponentially with age,
   accompanied by progressive deteriorations of physiological functions in
   organisms. Aging-associated diseases are sporadic but essentially
   inevitable complications arising from senescence. Senescence is often
   considered the antithesis of early development, but yet there may be
   factors and mechanisms in common between these 2 phenomena to rejuvenate
   over the dynamic process of aging. The association between early
   development and late-onset disease with advancing age is thought to come
   from a consequence of developmental plasticity, the phenomenon by which
   one genotype can give rise to a range of physiologically and/or
   morphologically adaptive states based on diverse epigenotypes in
   response to intrinsic or extrinsic environmental cues and genetic
   perturbations. We hypothesized that the future aging process can be
   predictive based on adaptivity during the early developmental period.
   Modulating the thresholds and windows of plasticity and its robustness
   by molecular genetic and chemical epigenetic approaches, we have
   successfully conducted experiments to isolate zebrafish mutants
   expressing apparently altered senescence phenotypes during their
   embryonic and/or larval stages ({''}embryonic/larval senescence{''}).
   Subsequently, at least some of these mutant animals were found to show a
   shortened life span, whereas others would be expected to live longer
   into adulthood. We anticipate that previously uncharacterized
   developmental genes may mediate the aging process and play a pivotal
   role in senescence. On the other hand, unexpected senescence-related
   genes might also be involved in the early developmental process and its
   regulation. The ease of manipulation using the zebrafish system allows
   us to conduct an exhaustive exploration of novel genes, genotypes, and
   epigenotypes that can be linked to the senescence phenotype, which
   facilitates searching for the evolutionary and developmental origins of
   aging in vertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal undernutrition increases the risk of adult arterial
   hypertension. The present study investigated the short- and long-term
   effects of a maternal low-protein diet on respiratory rhythm, O-2/CO2
   chemosensitivity and arterial blood pressure (ABP) of the offspring.
   Male Wistar rats were divided into two groups according to their
   mothers' diets during gestation and lactation: control (NP, 17\% of
   casein) and low-protein (LP, 8\% of casein) groups. Direct measurements
   of ABP, respiratory frequency (RF), tidal volume (V-T) and ventilation
   (VE), as well as hypercapnia (7\% CO2) and hypoxia (7\% O-2) evoked
   respiratory responses were recorded from the awake male offspring at the
   30th and 90th days of life. Blood samples were collected for the
   analyses of protein, creatinine and urea concentrations. The LP
   offspring had impaired body weight and length throughout the experiment.
   At 30d of age, the LP rats showed a reduction in the concentrations of
   total serum protein (approximately 24\%). ABP in the LP rats was similar
   to that in the NP rats at 30d of age, but it was 20\% higher at 90d of
   age. With respect to ventilatory parameters, the LP rats showed enhanced
   RF (approximately 34\%) and VE (approximately 34\%) at 30d of age, which
   was associated with increased ventilatory responses to hypercapnia
   (approximately 21\% in VE) and hypoxia (approximately 82\% in VE). At
   90d of age, the VE values and CO2/O-2 chemosensitivity of the LP rats
   were restored to the control range, but the RF values remained elevated.
   The present data show that a perinatal LP diet alters respiratory rhythm
   and O-2/CO2 chemosensitivity at early ages, which may be a predisposing
   factor for increased ABP at adulthood.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personalities (e.g. consistent across-context behavioural
   differences between individuals) can lead to differences in mate choice.
   However, evidence for this link remains limited. Pre-mating sexual
   cannibalism can be a behavioural syndrome (i.e. a suboptimal
   personality) in which adaptive female aggression towards heterospecific
   prey spills over on non-adaptive aggression towards courting males,
   independently of the female mating or feeding status (i.e. the
   aggressive spillover hypothesis', ASH). On the other hand, sexual
   cannibalism can also be a form of mate choice by which females
   selectively kill or mate with males depending on the male phenotype. We
   introduce the hypothesis that the most aggressive females in the
   population will not only attack males more frequently, but will be less
   likely to impose sexual selection on males through sexual cannibalism.
   Assuming that in a field common garden experiment in which females were
   fed ad libitum the rate of weight gain by a female may reflect her
   voracity or aggressiveness, we show that in the cannibalistic burrowing
   wolf spider Lycosa hispanica (formerly L.tarantula), voracity towards
   heterospecific prey predicts a female's tendency towards sexual
   cannibalism. Unmated females with higher weight gains were more
   cannibalistic and attacked males regardless of the male phenotype. On
   the other hand, females that were less voracious tended to be less
   cannibalistic, and when they did kill a male, they were selective,
   killing males in poorer condition and mating with those in better
   condition. Our results demonstrate that females with different
   phenotypes (growth rates) differently imposed selection on male
   condition, tentatively supporting the hypothesis that female aggression
   levels can spill over on sexual selection through sexual cannibalism.}},

Abstract = {{Organisms experience competing selective pressures, which can obscure
   the mechanisms driving evolution. Daphnia ambigua is found in lakes
   where a predator, the alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) either does
   (anadromous) or does not (landlocked) migrate between marine and
   freshwater. We previously reported an association between alewife
   variation and life history evolution in Daphnia. However, differences in
   alewife migration indirectly influence phytoplankton composition for
   Daphnia. In `anadromous lakes', Daphnia are present in the spring and
   experience abundant high-quality green algae. Intense predation by
   young-of-the-year anadromous alewife quickly eliminates these Daphnia
   populations by early summer. Daphnia from `landlocked lakes' and lakes
   without alewife ('no alewife lakes') are present during the spring and
   summer and are more likely to experience high concentrations of
   sub-optimal cyanobacteria during the summer. To explore links between
   predation, resources, and prey evolution, we reared third-generation
   laboratory-born Daphnia from all lake types on increasing cyanobacteria
   concentrations. We observed several significant `lake type x resource'
   interactions whereby the differences among lake types depended upon
   cyanobacteria concentrations. Daphnia from anadromous lakes developed
   faster, were larger at maturation, produced more offspring, and had
   higher intrinsic rates of increase in the absence of cyanobacteria. Such
   trends disappeared or reversed as cyanobacteria concentration was
   increased because Daphnia from anadromous lakes were more strongly

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{93-97}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Prey animals often need to learn the identity of unknown predators, and
   not surprisingly, nearby conspecifics provide a rich source of
   information about both the identity and risk level posed by unknown
   predators. Individuals that learn from watching conspecifics that show a
   weak response to a predator often learn that the predator is a mild
   threat, while those that observe conspecifics that show a strong
   response to the predator, learn that the predator is a high-level
   threat. This means that any factor that influences the intensity of the
   antipredator response of the tutor can potentially influence the
   efficacy of information transfer to the observer. We know that food
   resources influence the activity levels of prey, making them more or
   less conspicuous to nearby conspecifics. We also know that prey often
   ignore risk if they have restricted access to food resources. This means
   that food resources have the potential to dramatically change social
   learning dynamics. In the present study, we found that tadpoles fed
   restricted diets had much higher activity levels than those fed ad
   libitum food resources. Their high activity made them more conspicuous
   to nearby conspecifics, causing them to be much more efficient as
   tutors. Our work highlights the dynamic nature of social learning, as
   information transfer is likely to change considerably from place to
   place and year to year as resources change through space and time. (C)

   via different mechanisms}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{191-198}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Effective foraging behaviour is essential for animals to survive and
   reproduce, and depends on many intrinsic and environmental factors.
   There is increasing evidence that man-made (anthropogenic) factors can
   affect the behaviour of a wide range of taxa. However, few experimental
   studies have investigated how foraging behaviour is affected by exposure
   to increased noise levels, an issue of growing global concern. In our
   laboratory study, we examined how exposure to playback of noise
   originally recorded from ships, a prevalent source of human-generated
   underwater noise, affects the feeding behaviour of two sympatric fish
   species: the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and the
   European minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus. Both species consumed significantly
   fewer live Daphnia magna, and showed startle responses significantly
   more often during playback of additional noise than during control
   conditions. However, whereas minnows showed a qualitative shift in
   activity away from foraging behaviour (greater inactivity, more social
   behaviour) under increased noise conditions, consistent with a classic
   stress-or fear-related defence cascade, sticklebacks maintained foraging
   effort but made more mistakes, which may result from an impact of noise
   on cognition. These findings indicate that additional noise in the
   environment can lead to reduced food consumption, but that the effects
   of elevated noise are species specific. It remains to be tested whether
   these interspecific differences translate into different ultimate
   impacts, but differential disruptions to foraging may have potential
   consequences for relative individual fitness and community structure.

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{199-204}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Risk assessment in ectotherms is strongly affected by an organism's
   energy expenditure and acquisition because these will alter the
   motivation to feed, which is balanced against antipredator behaviours.
   Temperature and food availability are known to affect the physiological
   condition of ectotherms, but how interactions between these variables
   may influence predator-prey dynamics is still poorly understood. This
   study examined the interactive effects of food availability and
   temperature on the trade-offs between predator avoidance behaviour and
   foraging in juveniles of a marine damselfish, Pomacentrus chrysurus.
   Predator avoidance behaviour was tested by exposing fish to chemical
   alarm cues obtained from skin extract of conspecifics. When detected,
   these cues elicit an antipredator response in fish, typically
   characterized by decreased foraging. Fish maintained under high food
   ration displayed distinct antipredator responses to chemical alarm cues,
   regardless of temperature. However, fish maintained in conditions of low
   food ration and 3 degrees C above ambient temperature did not display an
   antipredator response when exposed to chemical alarm cues, whereas those
   in ambient temperature did. These results suggest that individuals in
   low physiological condition because of limited food availability are
   more susceptible to increased temperature and may therefore take greater
   risks under predation threats to satisfy their energetic requirements.

Abstract = {{Mammalian embryos have evolved to adjust their organ and tissue
   development in response to an atypical environment. This adaptation,
   called phenotypic plasticity, allows the organism to thrive in the
   anticipated environment in which the fetus will emerge. Barker and
   colleagues proposed that if the environment in which the fetus emerges
   differs from that in which it develops, phenotypic plasticity may
   provide an underlying mechanism for disease. Epidemiological studies
   have shown that humans born small- or large-for-gestational-age, have a
   higher likelihood of developing obesity as adults. The amount and
   quality of food that the mother consumes during gestation influences
   birth weight, and therefore susceptibility of progeny to disease in
   later life. Studies in experimental animals support these observations,
   and find that obesity occurs as a result of maternal
   nutrient-restriction during gestation, followed by rapid compensatory
   growth associated with ad libitum food consumption. Therefore, obesity
   associated with maternal nutritional restriction has a developmental
   origin. Based on this phenomenon, one might predict that gestational
   exposure to a westernized diet would protect against future obesity in
   offspring. However, evidence from experimental models indicates that
   like maternal dietary restriction, maternal consumption of a westernized
   diet during gestation and lactation interacts with an adult obesogenic
   diet to induce further obesity. Mechanistically, restriction of
   nutrients or consumption of a high fat diet during gestation may promote
   obesity in progeny by altering hypothalamic neuropeptide production and
   thereby increasing hyperphagia in offspring. In addition to changes in
   food intake these animals may also direct energy from muscle toward
   storage in adipose tissue. Surprisingly, generational inheritance
   studies in rodents have further indicated that effects on body length,
   body weight, and glucose tolerance appear to be propagated to subsequent
   generations. Together, the findings discussed herein highlight the
   concept that maternal nutrition contributes to a legacy of obesity.
   Thus, ensuring adequate supplies of a complete and balanced diet during
   and after pregnancy should be a priority for public health worldwide.

Abstract = {{The persistence of behavioral types in situ and the drivers of
   persistence are central to predicting the ecological effects of
   intraspecific behavioral variation. We surveyed individual refuge use of
   mud crabs (Panopeus herbstii), a behavior related to the strength of a
   trait-mediated trophic cascade in oyster reefs, in the absence and
   presence of toadfish (Opsanus tau) predation threat. We then released
   these crabs into the field and using mark-recapture, measured the
   repeatability of this behavior in the absence and presence of threat,
   and how behavioral change was affected by time in the field (a month on
   average, up to 81 days), crab size, and sex. Because crabs exhibited
   some evidence of a circatidal rhythm in refuge use, we also tested how
   tidal height during observation influenced behavioral change. Predation
   threat increased refuge use, and small crabs used the refuge more than
   large crabs, particularly under threat. In recaptured crabs, refuge use
   was more repeatable under threat. Neither time in the field, crab size,
   crab sex, nor tidal height had any effect on behavioral change. Our
   results support the non-mutually exclusive hypotheses that (1) prey
   organisms in the presence, rather than absence, of predation threat
   should exhibit less behavioral variability because the fear of dying (a
   severe fitness consequence) should take precedence over less immediately
   important influences on behavior (e. g., hunger) and that (2) individual
   behaviors tied to fixed traits (e.g., the body size dependence of refuge
   use under threat in this study), rather than variable traits, should be
   more repeatable over time.}},

Abstract = {{Early developmental stress can have long-term physiological and
   behavioral effects on an animal. Developmental stress and early
   corticosterone (Cort) exposure affect song quality in many songbirds.
   Early housing condition can act as a stressor and affect the growth of
   nestlings and adult song, and improvements in housing condition can
   reverse adverse effects of early stress exposure in rodents. However,
   little is known about this effect in songbirds. Therefore, we took a
   novel approach to investigate if housing condition can modify the
   effects of early Cort exposure on adult song in male zebra finches. We
   manipulated early housing conditions to include breeding in large
   communal flight cages (FC; standard housing condition; with mixed-sex
   and mix-aged birds) versus individual breeding cages (IBC, one
   male-female pair with small, IBC-S, or large clutches, IBC-L) in
   post-hatch Cort treated male birds. We found that Cort treated birds
   from IBC-S have higher overall song learning scores (between tutor and
   pupil) than from FC but there is no difference between these groups in
   the No-Cort treated birds. When examining the effects of Cort within
   each housing condition, overall song learning scores decreased in Cort
   treated birds from flight cages but increased in birds from IBC-S
   compared to controls. Likewise, the total number of syllables and
   syllable types increased significantly in Cort treated birds from IBC-S,
   but decreased in FC-reared birds though this effect was not
   statistically significant. These findings suggest that the effects of
   early Cort treatment on learned features of song depend on housing
   condition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Suboptimal choice by pigeons: An analog of human gambling behavior}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{156-164}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Human gambling often involves the choice of a low probability but high
   valued outcome over a high probability (certain) low valued outcome (not
   gambling) that is economically more optimal. We have developed an analog
   of gambling in which pigeons prefer a suboptimal alternative that
   infrequently provides a signal for a high probability (or high
   magnitude) of reinforcement over an optimal alternative that always
   provides a signal for a lower probability (or lower magnitude) of
   reinforcement. We have identified two mechanisms that may be responsible
   for this suboptimal behavior. First, the effect of nonreinforcement
   results in considerably less inhibition of choice than ideally it
   should. Second, the frequency of the occurrence of the signal for a high
   probability or high magnitude of reinforcement is less important than
   ideally it should. Also analogous to human gambling is the finding that
   pigeons that are normally food restricted choose suboptimally, whereas
   those that are minimally food restricted choose optimally. In addition,
   pigeons that are singly housed choose suboptimally, whereas those that
   are exposed to a more enriched environment choose less suboptimally. We
   believe that these findings have implications for the understanding and
   treatment of problem gambling behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Sexual signaling under predation: attractive moths take the greater

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Calling a mate can be dangerous for insects, but that does not stop
   attractive wax moths from singing even when they hear a bat call.
   Theoretically, unattractive males should take higher risks because they
   have less to lose, instead they behave more cautiously. A reason for
   this difference in behavior could be that attractive moths exhaust
   themselves quickly and try to find a mate while they still can.
   Unattractive moths can afford to wait.Individuals often have to balance
   the costs of risky behavior against the potential benefits they may gain
   from it. This trade-off is especially obvious in the interplay between
   natural and sexual selection because traits for mate attraction may
   attract predators as well. In the lesser wax moth Achroia grisella,
   ultrasonic sexual signaling comes with such a risk because calling for
   mates also attracts predatory bats. Attractive males should behave more
   cautiously than unattractive males under such circumstances, as they can
   expect more future mating opportunities and therefore have more to lose
   (the so-called asset protection principle). Contrary to these
   predictions, we found that pulse pair rate and peak amplitude, 2 song
   components attractive to females, correlated negatively with the
   duration of a silence response which is displayed when courtship song is
   experimentally overlayed with the search signal of a predator, the
   greater horseshoe bat. More attractive males thus recommence singing
   sooner than less attractive males. Although this is not in line with the
   asset protection principle, we discuss 3 different ways in which these
   distinct behavioral differences might be explained: 1) attractive males
   are in better condition and thus can more easily evade predators, 2)
   attractive signals are costly in terms of reduced life expectancy, and
   3) risk-taking may in itself be a sexually selected trait and as such
   act as an honest signal of male quality.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural flexibility is thought to be a major factor in evolution. It
   may facilitate the discovery and exploitation of new resources, which in
   turn may expose populations to novel selective forces and facilitate
   adaptive radiation. Darwin's finches are a textbook example of adaptive
   radiation. They are fast learners and show a range of unusual foraging
   techniques, probably as a result of their flexibility. In this study we
   aimed to test whether variability of the environment is correlated with
   flexibility. We compared woodpecker finches from a dry area (hereafter,
   Arid Zone), where food availability is variable, with individuals from a
   cloud forest (hereafter, Scalesia zone) where food abundance is stable.
   As parameters for flexibility, we measured neophilia and neophobia,
   which are two aspects of reaction to novelty, reversal learning and
   problem-solving. We found no differences in performance on a
   problem-solving task but, in line with our prediction, individuals from
   the Arid Zone were significantly faster reversal learners and more
   neophilic than their conspecifics from the Scalesia zone. The latter
   result supports the notion that environmental variability drives
   flexibility. In contrast to our prediction, Arid Zone birds were even
   more neophobic than birds from the Scalesia Zone. The latter result
   could be the consequence of differences in predation pressure between
   the two vegetation zones.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although the association between depression and body
   composition has been widely discussed, the effects of depression on lean
   body mass (LBM) are unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the
   association of depression with LBM.
   Methods: The study included 2406 participants aged 18-69 years. The sex
   and body mass index (BMI) stratified analysis of covariance was
   performed to compare total LBM and percentage LBM (\%LBM) in subjects
   with different depression score levels. Multiple linear regression
   analysis was conducted to estimate the association between depression
   score and serum albumin level.
   Results: An analysis of covariance stratified by sex showed that
   participants with moderate-to-severe depression had significantly
   decreased total LBM and total and regional \%LBM in men, except for
   total LBM and percentage gynoid LBM, which was observed in women. In the
   BMI stratified analysis of covariance, depression was significantly
   associated with decreased total and regional \%LBM and with increased
   total and regional percentage fat body mass. In people with BMI >= 25
   kg/m(2), the associations between depression or depressive syndrome and
   LBM, and total and regional \%LBM are stronger compared to those with
   BMI <25 kg/m(2). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that
   depression score was significantly negatively associated with serum
   albumin level.
   Limitations: This is a cross-sectional study based on a general
   population, some information about clinical diagnosis and medication use
   is not available.
   Conclusions: Depression had a significant negative association with LBM

Abstract = {{A wide variety of organisms show morphologically plastic responses to
   environmental stressors but in general these changes are not reversible.
   Though less common, reversible morphological structures are shown by a
   range of species in response to changes in predators, competitors or
   food. Theoretical analysis indicates that reversible plasticity
   increases fitness if organisms are long-lived relative to the frequency
   of changes in the stressor and morphological changes are rapid. Many sea
   urchin species show differences in the sizes of jaws (demi-pyramids) of
   the feeding apparatus, Aristotle's lantern, relative to overall body
   size, and these differences have been correlated with available food.
   The question addressed here is whether reversible changes of relative
   jaw size occur in the field as available food changes with season.
   Monthly samples of the North American Pacific coast sea urchin
   Strongylocentrotus purpuratus were collected from Gregory Point on the
   Oregon (USA) coast and showed an annual cycle of relative jaw size
   together with a linear trend from 2007 to 2009. Strongylocentrotus
   purpuratus is a long-lived species and under field conditions
   individuals experience multiple episodes of changes in food resources
   both seasonally and from year to year. Their rapid and reversible jaw
   plasticity fits well with theoretical expectations.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{Scatter hoarders must allocate time to assess items for caching, and to
   carry and bury each cache. Such decisions should be driven by economic
   variables, such as the value of the individual food items, the scarcity
   of these items, competition for food items and risk of pilferage by
   conspecifics. The fox squirrel, an obligate scatter-hoarder, assesses
   cacheable food items using two overt movements, head flicks and paw
   manipulations. These behaviors allow an examination of squirrel decision
   processes when storing food for winter survival. We measured wild
   squirrels' time allocations and frequencies of assessment and investment
   behaviors during periods of food scarcity (summer) and abundance (fall),
   giving the squirrels a series of 15 items (alternating five hazelnuts
   and five peanuts). Assessment and investment per cache increased when
   resource value was higher (hazelnuts) or resources were scarcer
   (summer), but decreased as scarcity declined (end of sessions). This is
   the first study to show that assessment behaviors change in response to
   factors that indicate daily and seasonal resource abundance, and that
   these factors may interact in complex ways to affect food storing
   decisions. Food-storing tree squirrels may be a useful and important

Pages = {{8-12}},
Month = {{MAR 29}},
Abstract = {{Food hoarding is an evolutionary adaptation whereby animals store food
   for later consumption when food is limited or when predation risk while
   foraging is high. It also occurs as part of normal appetitive behavior
   by humans and non-human animals when they are hungry. Contrary to
   popular belief, humans do not overeat after food restriction/fasting,
   rather they increase food hoarding, as do hamster species, but not in
   laboratory rats or mice. Thus, this aspect of human appetitive behavior
   is better modeled by hamsters than laboratory rats and mice. Here we
   tested whether male Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) modify their
   daily food hoard size under ad libitum-feeding and after food
   deprivation when we artificially increased or removed their food hoard.
   When the food hoard was completely removed, hamsters hoarded more food
   the next day than did animals where the hoard was surreptitiously
   increased. Hamsters that had alternating daily hoard increases/decreases
   rapidly adjusted their food hoarding inversely proportional to food
   hoard size. Similarly, after 48 h of food deprivation, a stimulus that
   initiates high levels of food hoarding upon refeeding in this species,
   hamsters with artificially increased food hoard size hoarded
   significantly less than did hamsters where we left the hoard unaltered
   additionally suggesting that food hoard size directly affects food
   hoarding. Collectively, as we previously found when the caloric value of
   the food offered was increased or decreased, food hoard size is in some
   sense `regulated' and not simply a reflexive response triggered by
   inter-meal hunger or food deprivation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Animals generally live in multisensory worlds; however, our
   understanding of multisensory perception is rather limited, despite its
   relevance for explaining the mechanisms behind social interactions, such
   as collective detection while foraging in groups. We tested how
   multisensory stimuli affected the antipredator behavior of dark-eyed
   juncos (Junco hyemalis) using alarm calls as an auditory signal and
   flushing behavior as a visual cue. We varied the degree of risk within
   the group by manipulating the number of group mates alarm calling and/or
   flushing using robotic birds. We assumed that alarm calling and flushing
   were redundant stimuli and predicted that they could generate one of
   three types of responses (enhancement, equivalence, or antagonism)
   depending on the mechanism of multisensory perception. We set up an
   artificial flock with three robotic juncos surrounding a live junco and
   controlled for multiple confounding factors (e.g., identity of the
   focal, body mass, food deprivation time). We found that the degree of
   alarm of live juncos increased when at least one robot flushed. However,
   the time it took the live individuals to react to the robots' behavior
   increased, rather than decreased, with at least one alarm call. This
   could be the result of an orienting response or sensory overload, as
   live juncos increased scanning behavior after being exposed solely to
   alarm calls. Contrary to some theoretical assumptions, alarm calling and
   flushing behavior elicited independent unimodal responses, suggesting
   that they are non-redundant stimuli and that together they could reduce
   the occurrence of false alarms and facilitate flock cohesion.}},

Abstract = {{1. Maternal effects are increasingly recognized to impact upon

   2. We studied how maternal temperature (15 degrees C, 20 degrees C and

   influenced the ability of the crustacean, Daphnia magna, to resist its
   bacterial parasite, Pasteuria ramosa.
   3. Mothers held at a higher temperature and mothers fed a restricted

   5. As Daphnia populations experience regular summer epidemics of P.

Abstract = {{1. Original sperm competition theory assumed that males trade
   expenditure on searching for mates for expenditure on the ejaculate and
   predicted that males should increase their expenditure on the ejaculate
   in response to increased risk of competition. A recent extension of this
   theory has modelled pre-copulatory expenditure in terms of direct
   contest competition and predicts that when the gains from marginal
   investment in weaponry are large, males might be expected to allocate
   resources to armaments even at the expense of the ejaculate.
   2. Here, we examine socially cued plasticity in allocation to pre- (body
   condition) and postcopulatory (testes mass) traits in a male dimorphic
   beetle, Onthophagus taurus, where major males fight for access to
   females and minor males obtain reproductive success via sperm
   competition. Both male morphs were either reared in social isolation or
   exposed to rivals during the period of sexual maturation following adult
   emergence.
   3. Testes mass was found to be insensitive to social cues of future
   mating competition for both major and minor males. Major males allocated
   more to body condition when exposed to rivals, a response expected for a
   species in which the outcome of dyadic contests strongly affects male
   reproductive success. In contrast, minor male allocation to condition
   was insensitive to social cues.
   4. Our data illustrate how socially cued plasticity in pre- and
   post-copulatory traits can depend on the relative importance of these
   episodes of selection for individual male fitness. In O. taurus dung
   beetles, males strategically adjusted the amount of resources they
   allocated to winning pre-copulatory contests over access to females.
   Strategic allocation to pre-copulatory contest competition did not come
   at a cost to male investment in sperm competition, suggesting that males
   may trade investment into contest competition against some other
   life-history trait, such as longevity. The lack of plasticity in testes
   size suggests that selection from sperm competition may be a relatively
   constant feature of this species mating system.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Forming foraging groups may help to improve protection from predators,
   foraging efficiency and exchange of information, but to benefit from
   these advantages, animals need to maintain group cohesion. Several
   studies have investigated how social status or behavioural and
   physiological traits promote leadership and followership in various
   species, but the potential role of ecological factors in modulating
   social cohesion of foraging groups has received less attention. We used
   social network analysis to investigate how a temporary shortage of food
   affects within-group following behaviour in house sparrow, Passer
   domesticus, flocks and which individual characteristics influence birds'
   positions in the following networks. To test this, we observed nine
   captive house sparrow flocks, composed of 12 individuals each, in three
   consecutive sessions, in which the food availability was altered. We
   found that food reduction did not modify the following network structure
   and that individuals had consistent positions within the flocks, as
   males and adults were followed more often than females and juveniles,
   respectively. However, short-term food reduction affected individuals'
   following behaviour according to their age: adults increased their
   following rates during food scarcity, whereas the opposite trend was
   found in juveniles. This pattern also remained after the
   re-establishment of initial conditions, suggesting that ecological
   changes can also induce individual-level lasting effects. Our study
   provides empirical evidence that food reduction does not affect the
   global social structure of house sparrow flocks but nevertheless
   individuals respond differently to ecological changes according to their
   age. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{297-303}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Many animals show behavioural syndromes (i.e. suites of correlated
   behaviours across multiple situations). These behavioural correlations,
   however, imply limitations in the behavioural plasticity of individuals
   when facing the trade-off between predation risk and starvation risk.
   Some models suggest that proactive animals prioritize the reduction of
   starvation risk, while reactive animals do the opposite. Therefore, fast
   explorers that are also bold (i.e. proactive) are assumed to pay a
   predation cost associated with their behavioural trait. However, it has
   recently been suggested that proactive individuals may be able to
   compensate for their higher risk of predation by adopting some
   antipredator behaviours. In this study we tested these two alternative
   hypotheses with wild wintering Eurasian siskins, Carduelis spinus,
   foraging at artificial feeders. Male siskins have a melanin-based black
   bib that has been found to be correlated with exploratory behaviour,
   aggressiveness and dominance, and therefore is a signal of pro-activity.
   We found that male siskins with large black bibs uttered more distress
   calls upon capture and displayed a vigilance strategy that improved
   predator detection. Moreover, this vigilance strategy did not reduce
   food intake rate. These results show that proactive individuals are not
   reckless, but instead compensate for their personality trait with
   stronger antipredator behaviours, and thus, do not necessarily have to
   pay a predation cost. Our results support the view of a positive
   relationship between eumelanism, proactive personality and the display
   of antipredator behaviours. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{The purpose of this review is to evaluate the evidence for an
   association between the Big Five dimensions of personality, dietary
   intake, and compliance to dietary recommendations. Poor diet is a known

   consumption of fruits and vegetables and between Conscientiousness and
   healthy eating. Although no evidence has been found that personality
   dimensions are associated with adherence to dietary recommendations over

Abstract = {{For long-lived organisms, the fitness value of survival is greater than

   organisms inhabiting unpredictable environments should adopt a

   reproduction. We tested this using data from reindeer populations
   inhabiting contrasting environments and using winter body mass
   development as a proxy for the combined effect of winter severity and
   density dependence. Individuals in good and harsh environments responded
   similarly: Females who lost large amounts of winter body mass gained
   more body mass the coming summer compared with females losing less mass
   during winter. Additionally, females experienced a cost of reproduction:
   On average, barren females gained more body mass than lactating females.
   Winter body mass development positively affected both the females'
   reproductive success and offspring body mass. Finally, we discuss the

Abstract = {{Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by a
   deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which metabolizes
   phenylalanine (phe) to tyrosine. A low-phe diet plus amino acid (AA)
   formula is necessary to prevent cognitive impairment; glycomacropeptide
   (GMP) contains minimal phe and provides a palatable alternative to the
   AA formula. Our objective was to assess neurotransmitter concentrations
   in the brain and the behavioral phenotype of PKU mice (Pah(enu2) on the
   C57BI/6 background) and how this is affected by low-phe protein sources.
   Wild type (WT) and PKU mice, both male and female, were fed high-phe
   casein, low-phe AA, or low-phe GMP diets between 3 and 18 weeks of age.
   Behavioral phenotype was assessed using the open field and marble
   burying tests, and brain neurotransmitter concentrations were measured
   using HPLC with electrochemical detection system. Data were analyzed by
   3-way ANOVA with genotype, sex, and diet as the main treatment effects.
   Brain mass and the concentrations of catecholamines and serotonin were
   reduced in PKU mice compared to WT mice; the low-phe AA and GMP diets
   improved these parameters in PKU mice. Relative brain mass was increased
   in female PKU mice fed the GMP diet compared to the AA diet. PKU mice
   exhibited hyperactivity and impaired vertical exploration compared to
   their WT littermates during the open field test. Regardless of genotype
   or diet, female mice demonstrated increased vertical activity time and
   increased total ambulatory and horizontal activity counts compared with
   male mice. PKU mice fed the high-phe casein diet buried significantly
   fewer marbles than WT control mice fed casein; this was normalized in
   PKU mice fed the low-phe AA and GMP diets. In summary, C57BI/6-Pah(enu2)
   mice showed an impaired behavioral phenotype and reduced brain
   neurotransmitter concentrations that were improved by the low-phe AA or
   GMP diets. These data support lifelong adherence to a low-phe diet for
   PKU. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tadpoles show considerable behavioral plasticity. When population
   densities become high, tadpoles often become cannibalistic, likely in
   response to intense competition. Conspecific tissues are potentially an
   ideal diet by composition and should greatly improve growth and
   development. However, the potential release of alarm cues from the
   tissues of injured conspecifics may act to deter potential cannibals
   from feeding. We conducted multiple feeding experiments to test the
   relative effects that a diet of conspecifics has on tadpole growth and
   development. Results indicate that while conspecific tissues represent a
   better alternative to starvation and provide some benefits over
   low-protein diets, such a diet can have detrimental effects to tadpole
   growth and/or development relative to diets of similar protein content.
   Additionally, tadpoles raised individually appear to avoid consuming
   conspecific tissues and may continue to do so until they suffer from the
   effects of starvation. However, tadpoles readily fed upon conspecific
   tissues immediately when raised with competitors. These results suggest
   that cannibalism may occur as a result of competition rather than the
   specific quality of available diets, unless such diets lead to

Abstract = {{The main impetus for `modern' intensive animal production occurred after
   the Second World War, when Western governments developed policies to
   increase the availability of cheap, safe food for their populations.
   Livestock benefit under intensive husbandry by protection from
   environmental extremes and predators, and better nutritional and health
   management. Nevertheless, there are costs to the animal, such as
   impaired social behaviour, limited choice of living environment or pen
   mates, poor environmental stimulation and behavioural restrictions. The
   rapid progress in genetic selection of production traits has also, in
   some cases, adversely affected welfare by creating anatomical and
   metabolic problems. Above all, the intensively housed animal is heavily
   reliant on the stockperson and, therefore, inadequate care and husbandry
   practices by the stockperson may be the largest welfare risk.
   In a future in which the food supply may be limited as the world's
   population grows and land availability shrinks, intensive animal
   production is likely to expand. At the same time, ethical considerations
   surrounding intensive farming practices may also become more prominent.
   Novel technologies provide the opportunity to enhance both the
   productivity and welfare of intensively kept animals. Developing
   countries are also establishing more intensive commercial systems to
   meet their growing need for animal protein. Intensive livestock
   production in such countries has the potential for major expansion,
   particularly if such developments address the key constraints of poor
   welfare, inadequate nutrition, poor reproduction, poor housing, and high
   mortality often seen with traditional systems, and if farmer access to
   emerging market opportunities is improved. However, as shown by previous
   experience, inadequate regulation and staff who lack the appropriate
   training to care for the welfare of intensively housed livestock can be
   major challenges to overcome.}},

   stream in northwest Georgia, USA. Individuals were collected in May and
   June 2011 and dissected to quantify the gut length and gut quotient.
   With standard length as a covariate, gut length was shorter in the
   urbanized stream, and gut quotients were significantly lower. Gut
   lengths were also significantly longer in May than in June. One possible

Abstract = {{Obesity-induced changes in the metabolic and endocrine milieu elicit
   deficits in neuroplasticity, including increased risk for development of
   neuropsychiatric disorders such as depressive illness. We previously
   demonstrated that downregulation of hypothalamic insulin receptors
   (hypo-IRAS) elicits a phenotype that is consistent with features of the
   metabolic syndrome (MetS) and that rats with this phenotype exhibit
   deficits in neuronal plasticity, including depressive-like behaviors
   such as anhedonia. Since food restriction paradigms effectively inhibit
   obesity-induced neuroplasticity deficits, the aim of the current study
   was to determine whether food restriction could reverse obesity-induced
   anhedonia in hypo-IRAS rats. Compared to hypo-IRAS rats provided ad lib
   food access, food restriction paradigms that were initiated either prior
   to increases in body weight or following development of the MetS/obesity
   phenotype effectively restored sucrose intake in hypo-IRAS rats.
   Moreover, food restriction paradigms were able to prevent and reverse
   the changes in the endocrine/metabolic/inflammatory milieu observed in
   hypo-IRAS, such as increases in plasma leptin and triglyceride levels
   and increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 alpha, IL-6 and

Abstract = {{High fat, low carbohydrate diets have become popular, as short-term

   Animal models with high translational value can help provide relevant
   and important information in elucidating potential effects of high fat,

   Gottingen minipigs were fed either a high fat/cholesterol, low

   contrast to a standard low fat, high carbohydrate minipig diet.
   Spontaneous behaviour was observed through video recordings of home pens

Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{The performance of herbivorous insects depends on a balance of nutrient
   uptake and toxin avoidance. Whereas high concentrations of defensive
   plant metabolites impair both generalists and specialists, generalists
   are likely less adapted to particular hosts and thus more negatively
   affected by plant defense traits. Furthermore, resulting diet-dependent
   differences in the physiological state and the gained experience of an
   animal may shape its behavior. Here, we investigated the effects of
   life-long experience with leaves of different quality on the performance
   and various behavioral traits of the generalist leaf beetle Galeruca
   tanaceti. Rearing individuals continuously on three different diets
   {[}young leaves, old leaves, or leaves of different age of cabbage
   (Brassicaceae) in alternating order every other day], we found that
   relative growth rates (RGRs) of the larvae were higher when feeding on
   young leaves than when feeding on the other diets. Feeding on leaves of
   different age in alternating order reduced the performance of G.
   tanaceti, indicating costs involved in diet mixing. The experience
   gained by the respective food qualities shaped the preference behavior
   in adult beetles. Positive and negative feedbacks of animals reared on
   young or old leaves, respectively, led to a preference towards young
   leaves. In contrast, feedback was probably prevented for animals reared
   on alternating diet, which did not exhibit any preferences. Older adults
   did not show any diet-dependent differences in body mass due to
   physiological changes during adult development. A battery of behavioral
   tests with the older adults revealed that the behavior was consistent
   over context and partially over time but behaviors did not differ in
   dependence of the diet experience. We retrieved three personality
   dimensions for this species, namely boldness, activity, and exploration.
   The behavioral structure was very similar to earlier findings for
   another chrysomelid species, indicating a broader validity of the
   concept of personality dimensions in insects. Our results demonstrate
   the importance of both experience- and state-dependence when

Abstract = {{Understanding the causes of animal personality (i.e. consistent
   behavioural differences) is a major aim of evolutionary studies.
   Recent theoretical work suggests that major personality traits may
   contribute to evolutionary trade-offs. However, such associations have
   only been investigated in a few study systems, and even less so in free
   ranging animal populations.
   Eastern chipmunks exhibit consistent individual differences in
   exploration, ranging from slow to fast. Birth cohorts also experience
   dramatic differences in age at first breeding opportunity due to annual
   differences in beech mast. Individuals may breed for the first time at
   24, 33 or 50\% of their average life span, depending on year of birth.
   Here, we used data from a long-term survey on a wild population to
   investigate the relationship between reproductive life history and
   consistent individual differences in exploration. We determined whether
   predictable differences in age at first breeding opportunity among birth
   cohorts were associated with exploration differences and favoured
   individuals with different exploration.
   Birth cohorts with a predictably earlier age at first breeding
   opportunity were faster explorers on average. Slower explorers displayed
   their highest fecundity (females) or highest fertilization success
   (males) later in their life compared with faster explorers. Overall,
   slow explorers attained a higher lifetime reproductive success than fast
   explorers when given an opportunity to reproduce later in their life.
   Our results suggest that the timing of mating seasons, associated with
   fluctuating food abundance, may favour individual variation in
   exploration and maintain population variation through its effects on
   reproductive life history. Together, our result shed light on how
   fluctuation in ecological conditions may maintain personality
   differences and on the nature of the relationships between animal
   personality and life history.}},

Abstract = {{To understand the molecular and neural mechanisms underlying alcohol
   addiction, many models ranging from vertebrates to invertebrates have

   assaying acute responses to alcohol and to behaviors more closely
   modeling addiction have emerged in recent years. However, both the CAFe
   assay, similar to a two-bottle choice consumption assay, as well as
   conditioned odor preference, where ethanol is used as the reinforcer,
   are labor intensive and have low throughput. To address this limitation,
   we have established a novel ethanol consumption preference assay, called
   FRAPPe, which allows for fast, high throughput measurement of
   consumption in individual flies, using a fluorescence plate reader. We
   show that naive flies do not prefer to consume ethanol, but various
   pre-exposures, such as ethanol vapor or voluntary ethanol consumption,
   induce ethanol preference. This ethanol-primed preference is long
   lasting and is not driven by calories contained in ethanol during the

   To investigate the notion that a major effect of gluten in those with
   NCGS is on mental state and not necessarily on gastrointestinal
   symptoms.
   Methods
   Twenty-two subjects (24-62years, five male) with irritable bowel
   syndrome who had coeliac disease excluded but were symptomatically
   controlled on a GFD, undertook a double-blind cross-over study.
   Participants randomly received one of three dietary challenges for
   3days, followed by a minimum 3-day washout before crossing over to the
   next diet. Challenge gluten-free food was supplemented with gluten
   (16g/day), whey (16g/day) or not supplemented (placebo). End-points
   included mental state as assessed by the Spielberger State Trait
   Personality Inventory (STPI), cortisol secretion and gastrointestinal
   symptoms.
   Results
   Gluten ingestion was associated with higher overall STPI state
   depression scores compared to placebo {[}M=2.03, 95\% CI (0.55-3.51),
   P=0.010] but not whey {[}M=1.48, 95\% CI (-0.14 to 3.10), P=0.07]. No
   differences were found for other STPI state indices or for any STPI
   trait measures. No difference in cortisol secretion was identified
   between challenges. Gastrointestinal symptoms were induced similarly
   across all dietary challenges.
   Conclusions
   Short-term exposure to gluten specifically induced current feelings of
   depression with no effect on other indices or on emotional disposition.
   Gluten-specific induction of gastrointestinal symptoms was not
   identified. Such findings might explain why patients with non-coeliac
   gluten sensitivity feel better on a gluten-free diet despite the
   continuation of gastrointestinal symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to identify overeating phenotypes and
   their correlates in overweight and obese children. One hundred and
   seventeen treatment-seeking overweight and obese 8-12 year-old children
   and their parents completed the study. Children completed an eating in
   the absence of hunger (EAH) paradigm, the Eating Disorder Examination
   interview, and measurements of height and weight. Parents and children
   completed questionnaires that evaluated satiety responsiveness, food
   responsiveness, negative affect eating, external eating and eating in
   the absence of hunger. Latent profile analysis was used to identify
   heterogeneity in overeating phenotypes in the child participants. Latent
   classes were then compared on measures of demographics, obesity status
   and nutritional intake. Three latent classes of overweight and obese
   children were identified: High Satiety Responsive, High Food Responsive,
   and Moderate Satiety and Food Responsive. Results indicated that the
   High Food Responsive group had higher BMI and BMI-Z scores compared to
   the High Satiety Responsive group. No differences were found among
   classes in demographics or nutritional intake. This study identified
   three overeating phenotypes, supporting the heterogeneity of eating
   patterns associated with overweight and obesity in treatment-seeking
   children. These finding suggest that these phenotypes can potentially be
   used to identify high risk groups, inform prevention and intervention
   targets, and develop specific treatments for these behavioral.

Abstract = {{The objective of the current study was to determine if group-housing
   Holstein heifer calves in indoor pens with poor ventilation and drainage
   influences performance, health, leukocytes, and behavioral responses
   compared with individually housed calves. Ninety colostrum-fed calves (2
   +/- 1 d of age) were randomly assigned to 3 treatments: individually
   housed (Gl; n = 30 calves), 2 calves per pen (G2; n = 30 calves), or 3
   calves per pen (G3; n = 30 calves). The space allowance per calf was 2.5
   m(2) for all treatment groups. All calves were fed 747 and 1,010 g/d of
   dry matter of a 28\% CP and 20\% fat milk replacer during the first 2 wk
   and wk 3 to 6, respectively. Weaning was initiated on d 46 by removing
   the evening feeding, and calves were completely weaned when they
   consumed 800 g/d of dry matter calf starter for 2 consecutive days after
   d 54. Calves were randomly commingled at d 90 in groups of 5 calves per
   pen in outdoors pens with an attached hutch. Peripheral blood was
   collected during the neonatal (3, 10, 21 d), weaning (46, 48, 54 d), and
   commingling periods (90, 93, 98 d) and was analyzed for neutrophil
   oxidative burst capacity when cocultured with an Escherichia coli,
   neutrophil surface L-selectin protein concentration, and whole blood
   secretion of tumor necrosis factor-et when cocultured with
   lipopolysaccharide. Behavior of each calf was assessed using 2
   independent tests: an approach response to a human subject and the
   response of the calf when placed in an isolated cage. Calf starter
   intake was greater for G2 and G3 during wk 8 and 9, and also at wk 11
   for G3 compared with G1. No treatment x time interaction or treatment
   effect for average daily gain was observed. Additionally, no treatment x
   time or treatment effect was noted for any leukocyte or biochemical
   variable of biological significance throughout the entire study.
   Individually housed calves tended to have a reduced
   \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}incidence of respiratory disease during
   the first 90 d of life. No other treatment differences for the other
   health outcomes were observed. Group-housed calves also relied more on
   calf-to-calf interactions than calf-to-human interactions, as evident by
   their reduced approach of the human observer and more frequent movement
   when placed in an isolated pen. Group housing in an environment with
   poor ventilation and drainage may increase the risk of respiratory
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{The decision to consume toxic prey is a trade-off between the benefits
   of obtaining nutrients and the costs of ingesting toxins. This trade-off
   is affected by current state: animals will consume more toxic prey if
   they are food deprived. However, whether the trade-off is affected by
   developmental history is currently unknown. We studied the decision to
   eat quinine-injected mealworms in adult starling siblings that had been
   exposed to either high or low levels of food competition as chicks, via
   a brood size manipulation. At the time of our experiments, the two
   groups of birds did not differ in size, body weight or current
   environment. Each bird was presented with the toxic prey while living on
   a high-quality diet and a low-quality diet. We found an effect of diet,
   with birds consuming more toxic prey while on the low-quality diet, and
   also of developmental history, with birds from the high-competition
   brood size treatment eating more toxic prey than their low-competition
   siblings. The effects of brood size treatment were not completely
   mediated by early growth, although we did find evidence that early
   growth affected toxic prey consumption independently of brood size
   treatment. We discuss our results in relation to adaptive developmental
   plasticity and the developmental origins of behavioural variation. (C)

Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{161-169}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Birds present a variety of antipredator responses, including the use of
   acoustic signals that may be directed to other individuals or to the
   predator. We tested competing hypotheses regarding antipredator
   responses by analysing patterns of variation in the use of distress
   calls in campo flicker, Colaptes campestris campestris, nestlings. More
   specifically, we tested whether immune response and social context
   (presence or absence of other individuals of the social group) were
   associated with variation in use of acoustic signals in response to
   human handling. Individuals with higher immunocompetence used
   proportionally more harsh, low-pitched calls ('scream' notes) than
   individuals with lower immunocompetence, while the latter used mostly
   tonal, high-pitched calls ('week' notes); in both cases there was no
   influence of the social context on call type. Individuals responded to
   the social context by giving fewer scream notes and week notes in the
   presence of adults of the social group than when the adults were absent.
   Although playbacks are necessary to determine the function of the calls,
   our results indicate that campo flicker nestling antipredator calls
   could be used to attract other individuals of the group to help defend
   the nestling. Also, the use of proportionally more scream notes by
   healthier individuals suggests that these notes could act as an honest
   signal of the nestlings' physiological condition. (C) 2014 The

Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Rapid human urbanization can have strong and varied impacts on the
   behavior and fitness of wild animals. The ``credit-card hypothesis{''}
   predicts that low predation and high food predictability in cities lead
   to the presence of many weak competitors in urban populations. However,
   no experimental studies to date have found support for this hypothesis.
   Here, we studied the relationship between urbanization and
   aggressiveness in males of a widespread North American songbird (the
   house finch, Haemorhous mexicanus) while taking into account the degree
   of sexual signal elaboration (plumage coloration), which is known to
   impact competitive outcomes. In paired laboratory experiments, we found
   that colorful urban males were less aggressive than drab urban males,
   whereas there was no significant difference in aggressiveness between
   colorful and drab rural males. Moreover, we found that colorful urban
   males were less aggressive than colorful rural males, whereas there was
   no significant difference in aggressiveness between drab urban and drab
   rural males. In 4-bird trials (i.e., trials with colorful and drab males
   from both urban and rural environments), we found that colorful urban
   males were consistently less aggressive than all others. Taken together,
   these results support the credit-card hypothesis and the idea that
   plumage color is an important predictor of social status in urban
   environments. Finally, in a model-presentation study, we found that
   urban males with lower body condition avoided drab male models. Urban
   settings, along with the social and foraging conditions they create, may
   exert novel selection pressures that shape the competitiveness and
   status signaling systems of animals.}},

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Omnivory enables animals to fill more than one trophic niche, providing
   access to a wider variety of food resources with potentially higher
   nutrient value, particularly when resources become scarce. Animals can
   achieve omnivory using different strategies, for example opportunistic
   foraging, or switching between multiple trophic niches.
   The Neotropical bat Glossophaga soricina (Pallas, 1766) is a common and
   widespread species known for nectar feeding, but it also eats fruit and
   insects. Approaching stationary objects (flowers and fruits) or moving
   objects (insects) poses different sensory tasks and should require
   different echolocation behaviours. Here we tested the contrasting
   hypothesis that G.soricina can approach both stationary and moving
   objects using the same echolocation behaviour, thus feeding at different
   trophic levels by a single sensory mechanism.
   Using DNA barcoding, we demonstrate that G.soricina eats beetles
   (Coleoptera), flies (Diptera) and noctuid moths with bat-detecting ears.
   Laboratory observations show that G.soricina actively hunts for prey so
   insect consumption does not appear to be opportunistic. After capture,
   individuals consumed prey while perched and manipulated them with jaw,
   thumb, wrist and wing movements, but food handling was longer and
   chewing rate slower than in obligate insectivores.
   In contrast to most insectivorous bats, the echolocation calls of
   G.soricina are of high frequency and low intensity, and G.soricina did
   not produce feeding buzzes when approaching insects. An acoustic model
   of detection distances shows that its low-intensity calls fail to
   trigger the auditory neurons of eared moths, allowing G.soricina to
   overcome auditory prey defences.
   Individuals achieved niche flexibility using a unique but generalist
   behavioural approach rather than employing two different specialist
   methods. Our findings provide a novel insight into the functional
   mechanisms of insect capture in G.soricina and highlight the importance
   of considering niche flexibility in classifying trophic links in
   ecological communities.}},

Journal = {{OIKOS}},

Volume = {{123}},

Abstract = {{The theory of predation risk effects predicts behavioral responses in
   prey when risk of predation is not homogenous in space and time. Prey
   species are often faced with a tradeoff between food and safety in
   situations where food availability and predation risk peak in the same
   habitat type. Determining the optimal strategy becomes more complex if
   predators with different hunting mode create contrasting landscapes of
   risk, but this has rarely been documented in vertebrates. Roe deer in
   southeastern Norway face predation risk from lynx, as well as hunting by
   humans. These two predators differ greatly in their hunting methods. The
   predation risk from lynx, an efficient stalk-and-ambush predator is
   expected to be higher in areas with dense understory vegetation, while
   predation risk from human hunters is expected to be higher where visual
   sight lines are longer. Based on field observations and airborne LiDAR
   data from 71 lynx predation sites, 53 human hunting sites, 132 locations
   from 15 GPS-marked roe deer, and 36 roe deer pellet locations from a
   regional survey, we investigated how predation risk was related to
   terrain attributes and vegetation classes/structure. As predicted, we
   found that increasing cover resulted in a contrasting lower predation
   risk from humans and higher predation risk from lynx. Greater terrain
   ruggedness increased the predation risk from both predators. Hence,
   multiple predators may create areas of contrasting risk as well as
   double risk in the same landscape. Our study highlights the complexity
   of predator-prey relationship in a multiple predator setting.
   Synthesis
   In this study of risk effects in a multi-predator context, LiDAR data
   were used to quantify cover in the habitat and relate it to
   vulnerability to predation in a boreal forest. We found that lynx and
   human hunters superimpose generally contrasting landscapes of fear on a
   common prey species, but also identified double-risk zones. Since the
   benefit of anti-predator responses depends on the combined risk from all
   predators, it is necessary to consider complete predator assemblages to
   understand the potential for and occurrence of risk effects across study
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the foraging patterns of reef fishes is crucial for
   determining patterns of resource use and the sensitivity of species to
   environmental change. While changes in prey availability and
   interspecific competition have been linked to patterns of prey
   selection, body condition, and survival in coral reef fishes, rarely has
   the influence of abiotic environmental conditions on foraging been
   considered. We used underwater digital video to explore how prey
   availability and wave exposure influence the behavioural time budgets
   and prey selectivity of four species of obligate coral-feeding
   butterflyfishes. All four species displayed high selectivity towards
   live hard corals, both in terms of time invested and frequency of
   searching and feeding events. However, our novel analysis revealed that
   such selectivity was sensitive to wave exposure in some species, despite
   there being no significant differences in the availability of each prey
   category across exposures. In most cases, these obligate corallivores
   increased their selectivity towards their most favoured prey types at
   sites of high wave exposure. This suggests there are costs to foraging
   under different wave environments that can shape the foraging patterns
   of butterflyfishes in concert with other conditions such as prey
   availability, interspecific competition, and territoriality. Given that
   energy acquisition is crucial to the survival and fitness of fishes, we
   highlight how such environmental forcing of foraging behaviour may
   influence the ecological response of species to the ubiquitous and
   highly variable wave climates of shallow coral reefs.}},

Abstract = {{The transmission of insect-vectored diseases entails complex
   interactions among pathogens, hosts and vectors. Chemistry plays a key
   role in these interactions; yet, little work has addressed the chemical
   ecology of insect-vectored diseases, especially in plant pathosystems.
   Recently, we documented effects of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) on the
   phenotype of its host (Cucurbita pepo) that influence plant-aphid
   interactions and appear conducive to the non-persistent transmission of
   this virus. CMV reduces host-plant quality for aphids, causing rapid
   vector dispersal. Nevertheless, aphids are attracted to the elevated
   volatile emissions of CMV-infected plants. Here, we show that CMV
   infection (1) disrupts levels of carbohydrates and amino acids in leaf
   tissue (where aphids initially probe plants and acquire virions) and in
   the phloem (where long-term feeding occurs) in ways that reduce plant
   quality for aphids; (2) causes constitutive up-regulation of salicylic
   acid; (3) alters herbivore-induced jasmonic acid biosynthesis as well as
   the sensitivity of downstream defences to jasmonic acid; and (4)
   elevates ethylene emissions and free fatty acid precursors of volatiles.
   These findings are consistent with previously documented patterns of
   aphid performance and behaviour and provide a foundation for further
   exploration of the genetic mechanisms responsible for these effects and
   the evolutionary processes that shape them.
   This study explores the biochemical mechanisms underlying the influence
   of a widespread plant pathogen, the non-persistently transmitted
   Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), on aspects of host-plant phenotype that
   influence interactions with aphid vectors. This virus has previously
   been shown to enhance the attractiveness of plants for aphids (via
   volatile cues), while simultaneously reducing host plant palatability
   and quality (stimulating dispersal and virus transmission). Our current
   results demonstrate that CMV infection reduces host plant quality by
   altering ratios of carbohydrates to free amino acids in both
   non-vascular cells (those first sampled by aphids and from which virions
   are acquired) and in phloem sap, and that infection results in an
   increase in organic volatile precursors and herbivore defense signaling
   molecules both constitutively and in response to aphid damage. These
   changes are consistent with observed effects on host-plant phenotype and
   patterns of vector behavior, as well as with existing knowledge about
   the use of host plant resources by CMV during replication and systemic
   spread. Our results thus provide new insight into the transmission
   ecology of a multi-host plant pathogen of significant economic and
   ecological importance.}},

   activation than BAND patients in brain reward systems, particularly to
   high-calorie foods, including the orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala,
   caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens and hippocampus. This was associated
   with lower palatability and appeal of high-calorie foods and healthier
   eating behaviour, including less fat intake, in RYGB compared with BAND
   patients and/or BMI-matched unoperated controls. These differences were
   not explicable by differences in hunger or psychological traits between
   the surgical groups, but anorexigenic plasma gut hormones (GLP-1 and
   PYY), plasma bile acids and symptoms of dumping syndrome were increased
   in RYGB patients.
   Conclusions The identification of these differences in food hedonic
   responses as a result of altered gut anatomy/physiology provides a novel
   explanation for the more favourable long-term weight loss seen after
   RYGB than after BAND surgery, highlighting the importance of the
   gut-brain axis in the control of reward-based eating behaviour.}},

Title = {{Differential influence of the 5-HTTLPR genotype, neuroticism and

Journal = {{APPETITE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{77}},

Abstract = {{Stress or negative mood often promotes energy intake and overeating.
   Since the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) is
   found to mediate stress vulnerability as well as to influence energy
   intake, this gene may also influence the negative effects of stress
   exposure on overeating. Moreover, since stress proneness also reflects
   cognitive stress vulnerability as often defined by trait neuroticism
   this may additionally predispose for stress-induced overeating. In the
   present study it was investigated whether the 5-HTTLPR genotype
   interacted with neuroticism on changes in mood, appetite and energy
   intake following exposure to a real-life academic examination stressor.
   In a balanced-experimental design, homozygous S-allele and L-allele
   carriers (N= 94) with the lowest and highest neuroticism scores were
   selected from a large database of 5-HTTLPR genotyped students. Mood,
   appetite and energy intake were measured before and after a 2-hour
   academic examination and compared with a control day. Examination
   influenced appetite for particular sweet snacks differently depending on
   5-HTTLPR genotype and neuroticism. S/S compared with L/L subjects
   reported greater examination stress, and this was accompanied by a more
   profound post-stress increase in appetite for sweet snacks. Data also
   revealed a 5-HTTLPR genotype by trait neuroticism interaction on energy
   intake, regardless of examination. These results consolidate previous
   assumptions of 5-HTTLPR involvement in stress vulnerability and suggest
   5-HTTLPR and neuroticism may influence stress-induced overeating
   depending on the type of food available. These findings furthermore link
   previous findings of increased risk for weight gain in S/S-allele
   carriers, particularly with high scores on trait neuroticism, to
   increased energy intake. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Eating slowly contributes to a lower risk of obesity, probably because
   it could aid appetite control. Chewing thoroughly is an effective
   strategy to reduce eating rate; however, insufficient data are available
   to demonstrate the relationship between such an eating behavior and

   chews before swallowing on meal size, a randomized cross-over trial was
   conducted in 18- to 45-year-old normal-weight, overweight, and obese
   participants (n=45) who were recruited from the local community (Ames,
   IA). After assessment of baseline number of chews, participants were
   asked to attend three test sessions to eat pizza for lunch until
   comfortably full by chewing each portion of food either 100\%, 150\%, or
   200\% of their baseline number of chews before swallowing. Two-way
   analysis of variance was used to test the effect of treatment and
   body-weight status, as well as their interactions on food intake, meal
   duration, eating rate, and appetite at meal termination. Appetite data
   during 60 minutes were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of
   variance. Food intake in the sessions with 150\% and 200\% of their
   baseline number of chews was reduced significantly, by 9.5\% and 14.8\%,
   respectively, compared with the 100\% session. Increasing the number of
   chews also prolonged meal duration and reduced eating rate. However,
   subjective appetite at meal termination or during the immediate
   postprandial period did not differ. These data indicate that increasing
   the number of chews before swallowing might be a behavioral strategy to
   reduce food intake and potentially aid body-weight management.}},

Abstract = {{Many forms of developmental plasticity have been observed and these are
   usually beneficial to the organism. The Predictive Adaptive Response
   (PAR) hypothesis refers to a form of developmental plasticity in which
   cues received in early life influence the development of a phenotype
   that is normally adapted to the environmental conditions of later life.
   When the predicted and actual environments differ, the mismatch between
   the individual's phenotype and the conditions in which it finds itself
   can have adverse consequences for Darwinian fitness and, later, for
   health. Numerous examples exist of the long-term effects of cues
   indicating a threatening environment affecting the subsequent phenotype
   of the individual organism. Other examples consist of the long-term
   effects of variations in environment within a normal range, particularly
   in the individual's nutritional environment. In mammals the cues to
   developing offspring are often provided by the mother's plane of
   nutrition, her body composition or stress levels. This hypothetical
   effect in humans is thought to be important by some scientists and
   controversial by others. In resolving the conflict, distinctions should
   be drawn between PARs induced by normative variations in the
   developmental environment and the ill effects on development of extremes
   in environment such as a very poor or very rich nutritional environment.
   Tests to distinguish between different developmental processes impacting
   on adult characteristics are proposed. Many of the mechanisms underlying
   developmental plasticity involve molecular epigenetic processes, and
   their elucidation in the context of PARs and more widely has
   implications for the revision of classical evolutionary theory.}},

Abstract = {{Although many studies have been carried out on plant-animal mutualistic
   assemblages, the roles of functional traits and taxonomy in determining
   both whether interactions involve mutualisms or predation and the
   structure of such assemblages are unclear. We used semi-natural
   enclosures to quantitatively assess the interaction strengths between
   seeds of 8 sympatric tree species and 4 rodent species in a tropical
   forest in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, Southwest China. We found 2 clusters of
   species in the seed-rodent network represented by 2 genera in the
   Fagaceae (Castanopsis, Lithocarpus). Compared to seeds of 3 Castanopsis
   species, seeds with heavy weight, hard coat or caloric content
   (including 3 Lithocarpus species) were eaten less and more frequently
   hoarded by rodents. In turn, hoarded seeds showed less predation and
   more mutualism with rodents. Our results suggest that seed traits
   significantly affected the hoarding behavior of rodents, and,
   consequently, the occurrence of mutualisms and predation as well as
   assemblage structure in the plant-animal seed dispersal system.
   Taxonomically-related species with similar seed traits as functional
   groups belong to the same substructures in the assemblage. Our results

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{63-71}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The `cognitive capacity hypothesis' states that song complexity could
   potentially be used by prospective mates to assess an individual's
   overall cognitive ability. Several recent studies have provided support
   for the cognitive capacity hypothesis, demonstrating that individuals
   with more complex songs or larger song repertoires performed better on
   various learning tasks. These studies all measured individuals' learning
   performance in social isolation. However, for gregarious species such as
   the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, testing individuals in a group
   context is socially and ecologically more relevant if song complexity is
   to be a meaningful indicator of cognitive ability. We tested whether
   song complexity correlated with performance on a suite of novel foraging
   problems in flocks of male zebra finches, starting by replicating the
   lid-flipping task used by Boogert et al. (Animal Behaviour, 2008, 76,
   1735-1741), who provided the first support for the cognitive capacity
   hypothesis in zebra finches isolated during testing. We also presented
   flocks with a barrier task and two types of novel food. We found that
   males' song complexity scores did not correlate with their latency to
   solve any of these novel foraging problems in a social context.
   Individuals that solved the tasks likewise did not have more complex
   songs than nonsolvers. However, performance was positively correlated
   across the different foraging tasks. These results raise doubts as to
   whether the song complexity measures used by Boogert et al. are
   predictors of problem- solving performance, and perhaps cognitive
   ability, in a more ecologically relevant, social setting. Stress
   responsiveness might instead explain the association between song
   complexity and foraging task performance among isolated zebra finches

Abstract = {{Prey consumption forms a large part of prey-handling time, and knowledge
   of where prey is ingested can inform management of predator-prey
   systems. Safeguarding habitats that promote prey consumption could
   enhance populations of facultative or obligate carnivores of
   conservation concern. We investigated habitat characteristics at 124
   sites where radiocollared adult grizzly bears, Ursus arctos (N = 9)
   consumed ungulates, and we contrasted these sites with paired random
   sites. We developed a priori models incorporating the potential effects
   of ungulate and plant food distribution as well as risks of detection by
   humans and other carnivores on consumption site choice, and evaluated
   which factors best explain grizzly bear food-caching behaviour.
   Ungulates were consumed in forested areas, close to edges, and where
   horizontal cover was high, whereby vegetation impeded visibility of the
   ungulate carcass. Distance to roads had no effect on the distribution of
   prey consumption sites, but carcasses were further from trails than
   expected. Models incorporating presence/absence of key non-ungulate bear
   foods had little weight of evidence (w(i) <= 0.01). Food-caching
   behaviour did not appear to be related to variation in resource
   availability or risk of food spoilage but was significantly influenced
   by prey size. Although bears chose sites that minimized detection risk,
   spent more time at larger carcasses and cached 75.9\% of ungulates, 50\%
   of consumption sites had other carnivore sign, which was more likely to
   be present at large carcasses. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{The global pandemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes is often causally
   linked to marked changes in diet and lifestyle; namely marked increases
   in dietary intakes of high energy diets and concomitant reductions in
   physical activity levels. However, less attention has been paid to the
   role of developmental plasticity and alterations in phenotypic outcomes
   resulting from altered environmental conditions during the early life
   period. Human and experimental animal studies have highlighted the link
   between alterations in the early life environment and increased risk of
   obesity and metabolic disorders in later life. This link is
   conceptualised as the developmental programming hypothesis whereby
   environmental influences during critical periods of developmental
   plasticity can elicit lifelong effects on the health and well-being of
   the offspring. In particular, the nutritional environment in which the
   fetus or infant develops influences the risk of metabolic disorders in
   offspring. The late onset of such diseases in response to earlier
   transient experiences has led to the suggestion that developmental
   programming may have an epigenetic component, as epigenetic marks such
   as DNA methylation or histone tail modifications could provide a
   persistent memory of earlier nutritional states. Moreover, evidence
   exists, at least from animal models, that such epigenetic programming
   should be viewed as a transgenerational phenomenon. However, the
   mechanisms by which early environmental insults can have long-term
   effects on offspring are relatively unclear. Thus far, these mechanisms
   include permanent structural changes to the organ caused by suboptimal
   levels of an important factor during a critical developmental period,
   changes in gene expression caused by epigenetic modifications (including
   DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA) and permanent
   changes in cellular ageing. A better understanding of the epigenetic
   basis of developmental programming and how these effects may be
   transmitted across generations is essential for the implementation of
   initiatives aimed at curbing the current obesity and diabetes crisis.}},

Volume = {{85}},

Abstract = {{Human modification of habitats can reduce reproductive success by
   providing novel cues to which birds may respond with behaviors that are
   actually maladaptive in those environments. Ad libitum human-provided
   foods may provide the perception that urban habitats are food-rich even
   as natural food availability decreases. Similarly, human activity may
   increase the perception that predation risk is high even as natural
   predators may decrease in abundance. In response, birds may reduce
   parental care with a subsequent cost to successful reproduction. Florida
   Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) in suburban areas have lower nest
   success during the nestling period than do wildland jays, possibly the
   result of such maladaptive responses, but maybe because of ecological
   differences with wildlands. We manipulated adult perception of predation
   risk and the availability of nestling foods in suburban and wildland
   areas to determine if these factors influenced parental care and
   nestling begging, and if the behavioral responses of adults influence
   nest survival during the nestling stage. Experimentally increasing
   perception of predation risk reduced parental care by both suburban and
   wildland females, but did not influence care by males. Increasing food
   availability, but not predation risk, had little influence on parental
   care, but resulted in decreased nestling begging rates and an increase
   in the frequency (pitch) of begging calls in both habitats. However,
   neither parental care nor food availability influenced nest survival
   during the nestling stage. Instead, the presence of helpers was the most
   important variable in nest survival analyses, suggesting that
   habitat-specific differences in nest survival during the nestling stage
   were not simply the result of maladaptive parental behavior or shortage
   of nestling food resources in the suburban habitat. The lack of helpers
   combined with ecological differences, such as the abundance of nest
   predators, may be why fewer nests of Florida Scrub-Jays survive during
   this stage in suburban areas.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of environmental change on species interactions will
   affect population dynamics and community structure in the future, but
   our current understanding of the outcomes of species interactions in a
   high-CO2 world is limited. Here, we draw upon emerging experimental
   research examining the effects of ocean acidification on coastal
   molluscs to provide hypotheses of the potential impacts of high-CO2 on
   predator-prey interactions. Coastal molluscs, such as oysters, mussels,
   and snails, allocate energy among defenses, growth, and reproduction.
   Ocean acidification increases the energetic costs of physiological
   processes such as acid-base regulation and calcification. Impacted
   molluscs can display complex and divergent patterns of energy allocation
   to defenses and growth that may influence predator-prey interactions;
   these include changes in shell properties, body size, tissue mass,
   immune function, or reproductive output. Ocean acidification has also
   been shown to induce complex changes in chemoreception, behavior, and
   inducible defenses, including altered cue detection and predator
   avoidance behaviors. Each of these responses may ultimately alter the
   susceptibility of coastal molluscs to predation through effects on
   predator handling time, satiation, and search time. While many of these
   effects may manifest as increases in per capita predation rates on
   coastal molluscs, the ultimate outcome of predator-prey interactions
   will also depend on how ocean acidification affects the specified
   predators, which also exhibit complex responses to ocean acidification.
   Changes in predator-prey interactions could have profound and unexplored
   consequences for the population dynamics of coastal molluscs in a

   The purpose of the current study was to examine whether three
   temperament dimensions (surgency, negative affectivity, and effortful
   control) were uniquely associated with six obesogenic eating behaviors
   (caregiver-reported food responsiveness, enjoyment of food, emotional
   overeating, satiety responsiveness, and tantrums over food; and observed
   eating in the absence of hunger) among low-income preschool-age
   children, covarying home environment quality. Results showed that
   temperament dimensions were differentially associated with different
   eating behaviors. Specifically, preschoolers with higher surgency were
   more likely to overeat in response to external cues, have frequent
   desire to eat, derive pleasure from food, and eat in the absence of
   hunger. In contrast, preschoolers with higher negative affectivity were
   more likely to have tantrums over being denied food and less likely to
   eat in the absence of hunger. Effortful control was not uniquely
   associated with obesogenic eating behavior. Findings remained
   significant even when home chaos was accounted for, suggesting that

Abstract = {{Early human food cultures were plant-based. Major religions such as
   Hinduism and Buddhism have recommended a vegetarian way of life since
   their conception. The recorded history of vegetarian nutrition started
   in the sixth century BC by followers of the Orphic mysteries. The Greek
   philosopher Pythagoras is considered the father of ethical
   vegetarianism. The Pythagorean way of life was followed by a number of
   important personalities and influenced vegetarian nutrition until the
   19th century. In Europe, vegetarian nutrition more or less disappeared
   during the Middle Ages. In the Renaissance era and in the Age of
   Enlightenment, various personalities practiced vegetarianism. The first
   vegetarian society was started in England in 1847. The International
   Vegetarian Society was founded in 1908 and the first vegan society began
   in 1944. Prominent vegetarians during this time included Sylvester
   Graham, John Harvey Kellogg, and Maximilian Bircher-Benner. A paradigm
   shift occurred at the turn of the 21st century. The former prejudices
   that vegetarianism leads to malnutrition were replaced by scientific
   evidence showing that vegetarian nutrition reduces the risk of most
   contemporary diseases. Today, vegetarian nutrition has a growing
   international following and is increasingly accepted. The main reasons
   for this trend are health concerns and ethical, ecologic, and social
   issues. The future of vegetarian nutrition is promising because
   sustainable nutrition is crucial for the well-being of humankind. An
   increasing number of people do not want animals to suffer nor do they
   want climate change; they want to avoid preventable diseases and to

Title = {{Ectoparasites modify escape behaviour, but not performance, in a coral
   reef fish}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{93}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Survival depends on escape responses and when to flee a predator. As a
   result, factors affecting the escape performance of prey species,
   including parasite infection, may profoundly influence the outcome of
   predator-prey encounters. Several hypotheses predict the responses of
   prey to simulated predator attacks based on intrinsic characteristics
   such as individual reproductive value and flight costs: as predation
   risk and reproductive value increase, so should the distance at which an
   organism begins to flee an escaping predator (flight initiation
   distance; FID). Conversely, FID should decrease if the costs of fleeing
   are high. Despite providing testable hypotheses, rarely have these
   theories been used to predict the escape behaviour of parasitized
   individuals. The bridled monocle bream, Scolopsis bilineata, is
   parasitized by a large cymothoid isopod, Anilocra nemipteri, which
   attaches above the eye. In this species, ectoparasite infection is
   associated with increased energy costs and decreased endurance. We
   investigated the effects of infection on escape performance and FID.
   Maximum velocity, maximum acceleration, cumulative distance travelled
   and response latency did not differ between parasitized fish,
   unparasitized fish and fish that had their parasite experimentally
   removed. Parasitized fish were smaller, on average, than unparasitized
   individuals. Smaller, parasitized individuals allowed a threat to
   approach closer before fleeing (shorter FID) than larger parasitized or
   uninfected individuals. Since parasite infection has known effects on
   host growth and metabolism, we suggest that parasitism alters fish
   escape behaviour as predicted by two nonexclusive hypotheses: (1) by
   decreasing reproductive value (the asset protection hypothesis) and (2)
   by increasing the relative costs of fleeing (the economic hypothesis)
   compared with uninfected and large parasitized fish. The relative
   importance of each hypothesis in driving the trends observed remains to
   be tested. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{69-76}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Wormlion larvae (Diptera: Vermileonidae) construct conical pits in fine
   loose soils and ambush arthropod prey. Their hunting strategy resembles
   that of pit-building antlions (Neuroptera: Myrme-leontidae), offering a
   classical example of convergent evolution, as they belong to different
   orders of insects. However, compared with other trap-building predators,
   spiders and antlions, the foraging behaviour of wormlions is almost
   unknown. In this study we used a combination of field observations and
   laboratory experiments to close this gap and investigate how hunger and
   ecological factors such as density and spatial pattern affect pit size,
   that is, how they shape investment in foraging and indicate competition
   between neighbouring larvae. We found slight, mainly decreasing, changes
   in pit size with hunger, with no change in response to prey.
   Surprisingly, body mass and length were not tightly correlated with pit
   size, unlike in antlions and spiders. Other factors, in addition to body
   mass and size, affect pit size, as the correlation between pits
   constructed in the field and in the laboratory was strong. The evidence
   for competition was mixed. On the one hand, we detected, in the
   laboratory, a change towards a regular spatial pattern with increasing
   pit densities, as expected, suggesting interference competition. On the
   other hand, we detected, in the field, a positive correlation between
   the sizes of neighbouring pits, and a negative correlation in the
   laboratory between pit size and distance to the nearest neighbour, both
   indicating clustering in favourable microhabitats, and not supporting
   strong competition. We discuss our findings in comparison with other
   trap-building predators and locate them within the general framework of
   foraging theory. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal

Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{237-242}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Individual variation in physiology and behaviour can have strong effects
   on ecological and evolutionary processes. Natal habitat, one source of
   individual variation, can influence individual phenotype, behaviour and
   fitness through effects on eventual habitat selection. Natal habitat
   preference induction occurs when individuals match stimuli in their
   selected habitat to those of their natal habitat. Natal habitat can also
   affect habitat selection through its influence on body condition (silver
   spoon effect). We tested for natal habitat preference induction and
   body-condition-dependent habitat selection in two species with complex
   life histories, the spotted salamander, Ambystoma maculatum, and the
   small-mouthed salamander, Ambystoma texanum. We reared salamanders from
   hatchlings in mesocosms with leaf, grass or control substrate, and
   tested juvenile habitat selection through two behavioural assays. We
   found weak evidence of larger salamanders having decreased latency and
   sampling more habitats, lending support to the body-condition-dependent
   habitat selection hypothesis in these species. Juveniles preferred grass
   litter cues regardless of the substrate in their natal mesocosm,
   suggesting natal habitat preference induction may not occur in species
   with complex life histories. We propose that species with complex life
   histories use simple movement rules, such as moving along habitat
   gradients, to select postnatal habitat when moving through a novel
   environment. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Urbanization poses serious extinction risks, yet some species thrive in
   urban environments. This may be due to a pronounced developmental
   plasticity in these taxa, since phenotypically, plastic organisms may
   better adjust to unpredictable urban food resources. We studied
   phenotypic plasticity in Nuctenea umbratica, a common European forest
   and urban vegetation spider. We subjected spiderlings to low (LF),
   medium (MF) and high (HF) food treatments and documented their growth
   and developmental trajectories into adulthood. Spiders from the three
   treatments had comparable numbers of instars and growth ratios, but
   differed in developmental periods. Longest developing LF spiders (a (TM)
   EuroaEuro parts per thousand= 390, a (TM),aEuro parts per thousand= 320
   days) had the smallest adults, but MF (a (TM) EuroaEuro parts per

   EuroaEuro parts per thousand= 240, a (TM),aEuro parts per thousand= 210
   days) spiders reached comparable adult sizes through shorter
   development. While males and females had comparable instar numbers,
   females had longer development, higher growth ratios, adult sizes and
   mass; and while males adjusted their moulting to food availability,
   female moulting depended on specific mass, not food treatment. We
   discussed the patterns of Nuctenea sex-specific development and compared
   our results with published data on two other Holarctic urban colonizers
   (Larinioides sclopetarius, Zygiella x-notata) exhibiting high plasticity
   and fast generation turn-over. We conclude that despite relatively
   unconstrained developmental time in the laboratory enabling Nuctenea to
   achieve maximal mass and size-main female fitness proxies-their
   relatively fixed growth ratio and long generation turn-over may explain
   their lower success in urban environments.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how different herbivores make forage patch use choices
   explains how they maintain an adequate nutritional status, which is

   Using telemetry data, we investigated nonruminant zebra (Equus
   burchelli) and ruminant red hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus subspecies
   camaa), use of burnt patches in a landscape mosaic of nutrient-poor, old
   grassland interspersed with young, recently burnt, nutrient-rich grass
   patches. The Mkambati Nature Reserve landscape on the east coast of
   South Africa provided large grazers with a challenge in finding and
   using appropriate patches in which to forage to meet their nutritional
   requirements. In Mkambati, grassland fires, mostly ignited by poachers,
   induce regrowth of young nutrient-rich grass, which subsequently attract
   grazers. We tested if the study animals foraged more in burnt patches
   than in the unburned grassland and whether burnt patch use was related
   to the distance to the previously visited burnt patch, burnt patch size,
   burnt patch age, and distance to areas with high poaching risk using
   MANOVA. In general, zebra moved faster than red hartebeest, and both
   species moved faster in unburnt grassland than in burnt patches. Red
   hartebeest and zebra patch selection were influenced by interpatch
   distance, patch age, patch size, and poaching risk. A limited set of
   intrinsic traits, i.e., body mass, digestion strategy, and muzzle width,
   yielded different patch use rules for the two species. Large ungulates
   patch use behaviour varied among species and across conditions and was
   influenced by anthropogenic impacts such as poaching and changed fire
   regimes. This could potentially affect biodiversity negatively and needs

Abstract = {{Reproductive success is a critical fitness attribute that is directly

   reproductive success: a change in mating system based on mate
   availability, consequent inbreeding depression, and the deterioration of
   reproductive efficiency with age (senescence). We employed a factorial
   experimental design using 22 full-sib families of the hermaphroditic
   freshwater snail Physa acuta to explore these interactions. Individual
   snails were reared in one of two mate-availability treatments (isolated
   {[}selfing] or occasionally paired {[}outcrossing]) and one of two diet
   treatments (boiled lettuce or Spirulina, an algae that is rich in
   protein, vitamins, and minerals). Spirulina-fed snails initiated
   reproduction at a 13\% earlier age and 7\% larger size than lettuce-fed
   snails. Spirulina also resulted in a 30\% reduction in the time delay
   before selfing. Compared to lettuce, a diet of Spirulina increased
   inbreeding depression by 52\% for egg hatching rate and 64\% for
   posthatching juvenile survival. Furthermore, Spirulina led to a 15-fold
   increase in the rate of reproductive senescence compared with a diet of

Abstract = {{Diseases caused by impaired regulation of energy balance, in particular

   lifestyle and dietary choices have been associated with differential
   risk of obesity and related conditions, a substantial proportion of the
   variation in disease risk remains unexplained. Evidence from
   epidemiological studies, natural experiments and from studies in animal
   models has shown that a poor intra-uterine environment is associated
   causally with increased risk of obesity and metabolic disease in
   adulthood. Induction of phenotypes that increase disease risk involves
   the fetus receiving cues from the mother about the environment which,
   via developmental plasticity, modify the phenotype of the offspring to
   match her environment However, inaccurate information may induce an
   offspring phenotype that is mismatched to the future environment. Such
   mismatch has been suggested to underlie increased risk of metabolic
   disease associated with a poor early life environment. Recent studies
   have shown that induction of modified phenotypes in the offspring
   involves altered epigenetic regulation of specific genes. Identification

Abstract = {{Alcohol use is common in adolescence, with a large portion of intake
   occurring during episodes of binging. This pattern of alcohol
   consumption coincides with a critical period for neurocognitive
   development and may impact decision-making and reward processing. Prior
   studies have demonstrated alterations in adult decision-making following
   adolescent usage, but it remains to be seen if these alterations exist
   in adolescence, or are latent until adulthood. Here, using a
   translational model of voluntary binge alcohol consumption in
   adolescents, we assess the impact of alcohol intake on risk preference
   and behavioral flexibility during adolescence. During adolescence
   (postnatal day 30-50), rats were given 1-hour access to either a 10\%
   alcohol gelatin mixture (EtOH) or a calorie equivalent gelatin (Control)
   at the onset of the dark cycle. EtOH consuming rats were classified as
   either High or Low consumers based on intake levels. Adolescent rats
   underwent behavioral testing once a day, with one group performing a
   risk preference task, and a second group performing a reversal-learning
   task during the 20-day period of gelatin access. EtOH-High rats showed
   increases in risk preference compared to Control rats, but not EtOH-Low
   animals. However, adolescent rats did a poor job of matching their
   behavior to optimize outcomes, suggesting that adolescents may adopt a
   response bias. In addition, adolescent ethanol exposure did not affect
   the animals' ability to flexibly adapt behavior to changing reward
   contingencies during reversal learning. These data support the view that
   adolescent alcohol consumption can have short-term detrimental effects
   on risk-taking when examined during adolescence, which does not seem to
   be attributable to an inability to flexibly encode reward contingencies
   on behavioral responses.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 16}},
Abstract = {{Human studies indicate that alcohol exposure during gestation not only
   increases the chance for later alcohol abuse, but also nicotine
   dependence. The flavor attributes of both alcohol and nicotine can be
   important determinants of their initial acceptance and they both share
   the component chemosensory qualities of an aversive odor, bitter taste
   and oral irritation. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating
   epigenetic chemosensory mechanisms through which fetal alcohol exposure
   increases adolescent alcohol acceptance, in part, by decreasing the
   aversion to alcohol's bitter and oral irritation qualities, as well as
   its odor. Given that alcohol and nicotine have noteworthy chemosensory
   qualities in common, we investigated whether fetal exposure to alcohol
   increased the acceptability of nicotine's odor and taste in adolescent
   rats. Study rats were alcohol-exposed during fetal development via the
   dams' liquid diet. Control animals received ad lib access to an
   iso-caloric, iso-nutritive diet throughout gestation. Odorant-induced
   innate behavioral responses to nicotine odor (Experiment 1) or
   orosensory-mediated responses to nicotine solutions (Experiment 2) were
   obtained, using whole-body plethysmography and brief access lick tests,
   respectively. Compared to controls, rats exposed to fetal alcohol showed
   an enhanced nicotine odor response that was paralleled by increased oral
   acceptability of nicotine. Given the common aversive component qualities
   imbued in the flavor profiles of both drugs, our findings demonstrate
   that like postnatal alcohol avidity, fetal alcohol exposure also
   influences nicotine acceptance, at a minimum, by decreasing the aversion
   of both its smell and taste. Moreover, they highlight potential
   chemosensory-based mechanism(s) by which fetal alcohol exposure
   increases the later initial risk for nicotine use, thereby contributing
   to the co-morbid expression with enhanced alcohol avidity. Where common
   chemosensory mechanisms are at play, our results suggest broader
   implications related to the consequence of fetal exposure with one
   substance of abuse and initial acceptability of others.}},

Abstract = {{Individual variation in behavioural traits (including responses to

   studied the relationship between sociality and personality in invasive
   cane toads (Rhinella marina) from a recently established population in
   tropical Australia. In our field experiments, we manipulated social cues
   (the presence of a feeding conspecific) near a food source. We captured
   and compared toads that only approached feeding sites where another toad
   was already present, with conspecifics that approached unoccupied
   feeding sites. Subsequent laboratory trials showed correlated
   personality differences (behavioural syndromes) between these two groups
   of toads. For example, toads that approached already-occupied rather
   than unoccupied feeding sites in the field, took longer to emerge from a
   shelter-site in standardized trials, suggesting these individuals are
   `shy' (whereas toads that approached unoccupied feeding stations tended
   to be `bold'). Manipulating hunger levels did not abolish this
   difference. In feeding trials, a bold toad typically outcompeted a shy
   toad under conditions of low prey availability, but the outcome was
   reversed when multiple prey items were present. Thus, both personality
   types may be favored under different circumstances. This invasive
   population of toads contains individuals that exhibit a range of
   personalities, hinting at the existence of a wide range of social
   dynamics in taxa traditionally considered to be asocial.}},

Abstract = {{The nutritional status of an animal is maintained through a balance
   between energy intake and energy expenditure, and in the natural
   environment can fluctuate due to limited food availability and
   behavioural changes that remove the animal from its food. The integrated
   physiological processes that underlie an animal's nutritional status can
   be measured biophysically or biochemically. The Norway lobster Nephrops
   norvegicus has been shown to survive long periods of time without food,
   which is advantageous when food availability is low, such as during the
   winter months or when access to food is reduced due to risks associated
   with predation. In this study N. norvegicus was subjected to nutritional
   stress (starvation) for a period of 20 weeks and various biophysical
   measures (hepatosomatic index {[}HSI], length: weight ratio, tissue
   water content carbon: nitrogen ratio) and biochemical measures (copper,
   carbohydrate, lipids, protein, stable isotopes delta N-15 delta C-13)
   were used to determine how these animals maintain themselves over this
   period of forced starvation. Results indicate that while there was no
   variation in the whole weight of each individual, the organ-specific
   weight of the hepatopancreas (HSI) decreased and there was a
   corresponding increase in the water content of the hepatopancreas (and
   tail muscle). In contrast to the findings of previous studies, reserves
   of lipids decreased within the hepatopancreas. Fuel resources of protein
   from the tail muscle were not utilised, but reciprocal change in the
   copper content of the haemolymph to the hepatopancreas is suggestive of

Abstract = {{Exotic species can provide abundant food resources for native consumers,
   but predicting which native species will respond positively remains a
   challenge. We studied the foraging behavior of black-capped (Poecile
   atricapillus) and mountain (P. gambeli) chickadees in western Montana to
   compare the degree to which these congeric and syntopic consumers
   exploited larvae of Urophora, an exotic biological control insect living
   within the seedheads of the invasive forb, spotted knapweed (Centaurea
   stoebe). Chickadees typically forage within tree or shrub cover, whereas
   knapweed and hence Urophora larvae thrive in open grassland away from
   cover. We found that black-capped chickadees were much more likely than
   mountain chickadees to forage for Urophora. Black-capped chickadees
   strategically minimized time spent in open habitats by flying out from
   cover to retrieve knapweed seedheads and immediately returning to cover
   to extract the larvae. Black-capped chickadees also employed an atypical
   hovering technique nearly twice as often as their congeners did,
   particularly when foraging away from cover. Via this hovering technique,
   birds were able to gather knapweed seedheads from erect plants rather
   than searching for seedheads on the ground. These shifts in foraging
   behavior allowed black-capped chickadees to exploit Urophora larvae to a
   much greater degree than their congeners while minimizing exposure to a
   high-risk habitat, an outcome with potentially important community-wide
   consequences. Behavioral flexibility has been used to predict the
   success of invading species. We suggest that behavioral flexibility may
   also be used to predict how native species will respond to invasions,
   particularly the availability of exotic food resources.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personalities are by definition stable over time, but to what
   extent they may change during development and in adulthood to adjust to
   environmental change is unclear. Animals of temperate environments have
   evolved physiological and behavioural adaptations to cope with the
   cyclic seasonal changes. This may also result in changes in personality:
   suites of behavioural and physiological traits that vary consistently
   among individuals. Winter, typically the adverse season challenging
   survival, may require individuals to have shy/cautious personality,
   whereas during summer, energetically favourable to reproduction,
   individuals may benefit from a bold/risk-taking personality. To test the
   effects of seasonal changes in early life and in adulthood on behaviours
   (activity, exploration and anxiety), body mass and stress response, we
   manipulated the photoperiod and quality of food in two experiments to
   simulate the conditions of winter and summer. We used the common voles
   (Microtus arvalis) as they have been shown to display personality based
   on behavioural consistency over time and contexts. Summer-born voles
   allocated to winter conditions at weaning had lower body mass, a higher
   corticosterone increase after stress and a less active, more cautious
   behavioural phenotype in adulthood compared to voles born in and
   allocated to summer conditions. In contrast, adult females only showed
   plasticity in stress-induced corticosterone levels, which were higher in
   the animals that were transferred to the winter conditions than to those
   staying in summer conditions. These results suggest a sensitive period
   for season-related behavioural plasticity in which juveniles shift over
   the bold-shy axis.}},

Title = {{Road traffic noise modifies behaviour of a keystone species}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{135-141}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Prey species have to balance their foraging and vigilance behaviour in
   order to maximize nutritional and energetic intake while avoiding
   predation. Anthropogenic noise, a ubiquitous form of human disturbance,
   has the potential to influence antipredator behaviour through its
   effects on predator detection and perceived risk. Noise might increase
   perceived risk as predicted by the risk disturbance hypothesis, reduce
   risk by providing protection from disturbance-sensitive predators, or
   have no effect on antipredator behaviour if animals are tolerant of
   nonlethal forms of human disturbance. Road traffic is a pervasive source
   of anthropogenic noise, but few studies have experimentally isolated the
   effects of road noise on behaviour. Using systematic playback
   experiments, we investigated the influence of traffic noise on foraging
   and vigilance in a keystone species in North American prairie systems,
   the prairie dog, Cynomys ludovicianus. Exposure to road traffic noise
   significantly lowered aboveground activity, reduced foraging and
   increased vigilance, as predicted by the risk disturbance hypothesis.
   These effects were prevalent irrespective of temperature, a strong
   influence on such behaviours, and they were consistent across the
   3-month study period, providing no evidence of habituation. Our results
   provide the first experimental investigation of the potential costs of
   this ubiquitous disturbance in a free-ranging mammal, demonstrating that
   road noise can alter key survival behaviours of this ecologically
   pivotal species. These findings highlight that the presence of animals
   in a location is no guarantee of population and ecological integrity,
   while also underlining the potential synergistic impacts of noise on a
   species that has already experienced severe declines across its historic
   range due to human disturbance. Globally, roadways have profound impacts
   on biodiversity, and quantifying the behavioural and fitness costs
   associated with different forms of disturbance such as noise is crucial
   for mitigation. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Increasing urban development can have significant effects on wildlife
   species, including carnivores. Some carnivore species have been able to
   adapt to and even thrive in urban environments, including coyotes (Canis
   latrans). The presence of carnivores in urban areas can sometimes lead
   to conflicts with humans and their pets. Although coyotes may frequently
   use urban areas, they also inhabit natural areas surrounding urban
   development. Understanding the various factors affecting patch choice of
   urban coyotes may assist wildlife officials in managing human-coyote
   conflicts. Both sex and behavioral profile can influence patch choice;
   bold individuals are more likely to be exploratory than shy animals,
   which can result in increased conflicts in urban environments. Using a
   captive population of coyotes, we tested whether coyotes preferred urban
   (anthropogenic) habitat structure, natural structure, or a mixture of
   structures and whether sex, behavioral profile, biological season, or
   food manipulation affected coyote patch choice. Coyotes generally
   preferred the control, homogeneous structure representing their natal
   habitat (mean percentage of time 23.3\% +/- 19.3 SD; P = 0.037). The
   next most preferred habitat for coyotes, especially females (23.7 +/-
   16.6\% for 25\% urban pen; P = 0.020) and bold coyotes (27.8 +/- 23.2\%
   for 75\% urban pen; P = 0.005), was a mixture of anthropogenic and
   natural structures rather than uniform structure (all natural or all
   anthropogenic), and this preference was more strongly expressed during
   the non-breeding season (25.6 +/- 23.2\% for 75\% urban pen; P = 0.017).
   Food had no effect on patch choice (P = 0.983); coyotes appeared to be
   primarily motivated by the structure of the habitat rather than by the
   amount of food within each habitat. Our results suggested that urban
   areas containing large amounts of both natural and anthropogenic
   structures are more likely to be used by coyotes and, thus, could have
   the potential for human-coyote conflicts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{What drives foraging behaviour of the intertidal limpet Cellana grata? A
   quantitative test of a dynamic optimization model}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{1. State-dependent models (SDMs) of behaviour, based on dynamic
   fitness-maximizing optimality routines, offer a powerful approach to
   understanding the plasticity and complexity in the timing of behaviour
   of foraging animals; yet, they are rarely developed for individual
   species. Such models permit evaluation of the sensitivity of predicted
   behavioural patterns to parameters that describe the main elements of
   environmental risk and the dynamics of internal states, such as energy
   stores, that determine motivational state.
   2. Here, we develop a state-dependent dynamic model for the temporal
   organization of foraging in a cyclic environment, using the intertidal
   grazing limpet Cellana grata as a test species. Estimates of relevant
   parameter values were obtained wherever possible and a sensitivity
   analysis performed to estimate the relative importance of these
   parameters.
   3. The results demonstrated the value of constructing an optimality
   model of the combined effects of gut processing and food supply,
   alongside the costs and risks of foraging. The dynamic model was able to
   satisfactorily reproduce the foraging behaviour of the limpet and
   highlighted several emergent details of behaviour that were not
   immediately apparent or predicted using a more simple, static model.
   4. Ranking the importance of the different parameters in the foraging
   behaviour of the limpet helped to identify research priorities for
   further studies on these grazers. Among the investigated parameters,
   standing crop and gut volume appeared to be of greatest importance,
   while energy costs and ingestion rates were of relatively lower
   importance. Risks of mortality during the different phases also played a
   fundamental role, dictating the main temporal limits within which
   activity occurred.
   5. Even with the great number of parameters required with respect to
   simpler static models, the benefits of following such a dynamic approach
   were evident and outweighed the additional effort needed for their
   estimation, supporting the use of dynamic modelling approaches in future
   research into the behaviour of mobile consumers.}},

Abstract = {{Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a chronic eating disorder affecting females and
   males, defined by body weight loss, higher physical activity levels and
   restricted food intake. Currently, the commonalities and differences
   between genders in etiology of AN are not well understood. Animal models
   of AN, such as activity-based anorexia (ABA), can be helpful in
   identifying factors determining individual susceptibility to AN. In ABA,
   rodents are given an access to a running wheel while food restricted,
   resulting in paradoxical increased physical activity levels and weight
   loss. Recent studies suggest that different behavioral traits, including
   voluntary exercise, can predict individual weight loss in ABA. A higher
   inherent drive for movement may promote development and severity of AN,
   but this hypothesis remains untested. In rodents and humans, drive for
   movement is defined as spontaneous physical activity (SPA), which is
   time spent in low-intensity, non-volitional movements. In this paper, we
   show that a profile of body weight history and behavioral traits,
   including SPA, can predict individual weight loss caused by ABA in male
   and female rats with high accuracy. Analysis of the influence of SPA on
   ABA susceptibility in males and females rats suggests that either high
   or low levels of SPA increase the probability of high weight loss in
   ABA, but with larger effects in males compared to females. These results
   suggest that the same behavioral profile can identify individuals
   at-risk of AN for both male and female populations and that SPA has
   predictive value for susceptibility to AN. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous
   psychiatric disorder affecting 5-10\% of children. One of the suggested
   mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of ADHD is insufficient energy
   supply to neurons. Here, we investigated the role of omega 3 fatty acids
   in altering neural energy metabolism and behavior of spontaneously
   hypertensive rats (SHR), which is an animal model of ADHD. To this end,
   we employed Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (H-1 MRS) to evaluate
   changes in brain neurochemistry in the SHR following consumption of one
   of three experimental diets (starting PND 21): fish oil enriched (FOE),
   regular (RD) and animal fat enriched CAFE) diet. Behavioral tests were
   performed to evaluate differences in locomotor activity and risk-taking
   behavior (starting PND 44). Comparison of frontal lobe metabolites
   showed that increased amounts of omega 3 fatty acids decreased total
   Creatine levels (tCr), but did not change Glutamate (Glu), total
   N-Acetylaspartate (tNAA), Lactate (Lac), Choline (Cho) or Inositol (Ino)
   levels. Although behavior was not significantly affected by different
   diets, significant correlations were observed between brain metabolites
   and behavior in the open field and elevated plus maze. SHR with higher
   levels of brain tCr and Glu exhibited greater hyperactivity in a
   familiar environment. On the other hand, risk-taking exploration of the
   elevated plus maze's open arms correlated negatively with forebrain tNAA
   and Lac levels. These findings support the possible alteration in energy
   metabolites in ADHD, correlating with hyperactivity in the animal model.
   The data also suggest that omega 3 fatty acids alter brain energy and

Abstract = {{This study examined whether dietary supply of DHA and phospholipids
   during early ontogeny affected the outcome of behavioural challenges in
   pike perch larvae and fry, and whether the history of lipid nutrition
   carried over in long-term effects on learning ability. Pike perch larvae
   were fed Artemia enriched with either refined olive oil high in oleic
   acid (A); refined olive oil supplemented with a low (B) or a high (C)
   level of DHA; or refined olive oil acid supplemented with fish oil with
   a high content of phospholipids (PL) and DHA (D). The enriched live
   diets were provided until 28 days post hatch (dph), at which time larval
   behavioural responses to visual and mechano-sensory stimuli were
   assessed. All dietary groups were subsequently fed an identical enriched
   live feed (diet D) and gradually weaned to an extruded dry feed, on
   which they were maintained for 112 days. At the end of this period,
   assessment of fry avoidance behaviour was repeated and individuals were
   tested for spatial learning ability in a maze. At the larval stage,
   individuals maintained on Anemia rich in DHA showed a 5-8 fold increase
   in swimming speed when subjected to a visually simulated predator test,
   a response that was not observed for larvae on diets low in DHA content.
   Independent of the predator simulation, larvae deficient or low in DHA
   exhibited significantly more time swimming along the edge of a test
   arena and had overall higher locomotor activities compared to larvae fed
   a diet with a high DHA content. Larvae on DHA rich diets showed an
   ability to achieve significantly higher peak acceleration rates during
   the escape response, which was maintained at 112 dph. Time spent
   locating the exit of a maze decreased with repetitious training
   sessions, although fish fed diets low in DHA spent longer time in the
   maze, caused by extended periods of inactivity or ``freezing{''}
   behaviour (time lag) prior to the onset of active searching behaviour.
   The consistency of behavioural responses to mechano-sensory stimuli in
   larvae and fry suggests long-term effects on the neuromuscular path-way
   involved in escape responses. A longer period of freezing in the
   learning test may reflect a more anxious and fragile behaviour profile
   in fish fed low levels of DMA. Further studies should aim at verifying
   whether this affects performance related traits, such as immune
   competence and robustness. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{We present a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model for the quintessential
   keystone predator, the rocky-intertidal sea star Pisaster ochraceus.
   Based on first principles, DEB theory is used to illuminate underlying
   physiological processes (maintenance, growth, development, and
   reproduction), thus providing a framework to predict individual-level
   responses to environmental change. We parameterized the model for P.
   ochraceus using both data from the literature and experiments conducted
   specifically for the DEB framework. We devoted special attention to the
   model's capacity to (1) describe growth trajectories at different
   life-stages, including pelagic larval and post-metamorphic phases, (2)
   simulate shrinkage when prey availability is insufficient to meet
   maintenance requirements, and (3) deal with the combined effects of
   changing body temperature and food supply. We further validated the
   model using an independent growth data set. Using standard statistics to
   compare model outputs with real data (e.g. Mean Absolute Percent Error,
   MAPE) we demonstrated that the model is capable of tracking P.
   ochraceus' growth in length at different life-stages (larvae: MAPE =
   12.27\%; post-metamorphic, MAPE = 9.22\%), as well as quantifying
   reproductive output index. However, the model's skill dropped when
   trying to predict changes in body mass (MAPE = 24.59\%), potentially
   because of the challenge of precisely anticipating spawning events.
   Interestingly, the model revealed that P. ochraceus reserves contribute
   little to total biomass, suggesting that animals draw energy from
   structure when food is limited. The latter appears to drive
   indeterminate growth dynamics in P. ochraceus. Individual-based
   mechanistic models, which can illuminate underlying physiological
   responses, offer a viable framework for forecasting population dynamics
   in the keystone predator Pisaster ochraceus. The DEB model herein
   represents a critical step in that direction, especially in a period of
   increased anthropogenic pressure on natural systems and an observed
   recent decline in populations of this keystone species.}},

Abstract = {{Dieting and the increased availability of highly palatable food are
   considered major contributing factors to the large incidence of eating
   disorders and obesity. This study was aimed at investigating the role of
   the cannabinoid (CB) system in a novel animal model of compulsive
   eating, based on a rapid palatable diet cycling protocol. Male Wistar
   rats were fed either continuously a regular chow diet (Chow/Chow,
   control group) or intermittently a regular chow diet for 2 days and a
   palatable, high-sucrose diet for 1 day (Chow/Palatable). Chow/Palatable
   rats showed spontaneous and progressively increasing hypophagia and body
   weight loss when fed the regular chow diet, and excessive food intake
   and body weight gain when fed the palatable diet. Diet-cycled rats
   dramatically escalated the intake of the palatable diet during the first

   weight with greater efficacy in Chow/Palatable rats, compared to
   controls. Moreover, SR141716 reduced compulsive eating and risk-taking
   behavior in Chow/Palatable rats. Finally, consistent with the behavioral
   and pharmacological observations, withdrawal from the palatable diet
   decreased the gene expression of the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase

   These findings will help understand the role of the CB system in

Abstract = {{Calorie restriction (CR) was shown previously to improve cognition and
   decrease pathology in transgenic mouse models with Alzheimer-like
   amyloid deposition. In the present study, we investigated the effects of
   CR on the Tg4510 model of tau deposition. Mice in the calorie
   restriction group had food intake gradually decreased until they reached
   an average of 35\% body weight reduction. Body weight and food intake
   were monitored throughout the study. After being on their respective
   diets for 3 months, all animals were submitted to behavioral testing.
   Tg4510 mice fed ad libitum showed lower body weight than nontransgenic
   littermates despite their increased food intake. Additionally, Tg4510
   showed increased locomotor activity in the open field regardless of
   diet. Calorie restricted Tg4510 mice performed significantly better than
   ad libitum fed mice in the novel object recognition test, suggesting
   improved short-term memory. CR Tg4510 mice also performed significantly
   better in contextual fear conditioning than mice fed ad libitum.
   However, in a modified version of the novelty test that allows for
   interaction with other mice instead of inanimate objects, CR was not
   able to rescue the deficit found in Tg4510 mice in this ethologically
   more salient version of the task. No treatment differences in motor
   performance or spatial memory were observed in the rotarod or radial arm
   water maze tests, respectively. Histopathological and biochemical
   assessments showed no diet-induced changes in total or phospho-tau
   levels. Moreover, increased activation of both astrocytes and microglia
   in Tg4510 mice was not rescued by calorie restriction. Taken together,
   our data suggests that, despite an apparent rescue of associative
   memory, CR had no consistent effects on pathological outcomes of a mouse
   model of tau deposition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Transgenic growth hormone animals express remarkable alterations and

   fitness of the natural population (the Trojan Gene Hypothesis).
   Alternatively, facilitation of regulatory evolution by sexual
   reproduction (recombination and segregation) may derive modifier

   red fox were the most avoided, and this avoidance was more significant

   phase being significantly lower under full moon nights. We found sex,
   breeding condition and weight of individuals explaining the variation
   found in FCM concentrations, but no changes in FCM levels due to moon

   Methods: The sample (n = 6798) was derived from the National Health and

   fit four logistic regression models to test whether neuroticism,
   extraversion, openness to experience, or the Type A behavior pattern

   Results: In Model 1 age was associated with increased risk of diabetes
   (2\% per year); being black as opposed to white was associated with a
   three-fold increase in risk. In Model 2 age and being black were still
   significant and extraversion was associated with decreased risk (17\%

   Conclusions: Higher neuroticism was associated with reduced type 2

Pages = {{49-56}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Plant-manipulating herbivores can modify their host nutrients and
   defensive compounds to their own advantage. This generally results in
   enhanced performance of herbivores on modified tissues, but the
   anatomical and biochemical modifications undergone by host tissues could
   also modify the herbivores' behaviour. Phloeomyzus passerinii induces a
   reaction tissue in the bark of its susceptible poplar hosts, suggesting
   a host-plant manipulation by the aphid. We investigated whether the
   formation of this reaction tissue, confirmed by histological sections,
   affected the performance and feeding behaviour of the aphid. In addition
   we studied how host resistance affected these parameters by comparing
   two host genotypes of different susceptibility. Aphids developed faster
   on the preinfested susceptible host genotype, whereas no effect was
   detected on the resistant one, confirming an improvement in the host's
   nutritional value due to the preinfestation, in agreement with the
   nutrition hypothesis. The DC-EPG technique indicated that in both host
   genotypes, preinfestation shortened the delay until the first probe and
   increased both the rate and duration of sustained ingestion, and
   consequently host acceptance. This suggests that host manipulation can
   adjust not only the nutritional value of plant tissues at an optimal
   level for development but also host acceptance by the herbivores. In the
   resistant host genotype though, the number of probes and the duration of
   parenchyma exploration increased in the galled tissue, which was
   congruent with extensive cell wall modifications indicated by more
   extended induced lignification. The adaptive consequences of this
   modified feeding behaviour are discussed. (C) 2014 The Association for

Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{121-127}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Individual variation in sexual fidelity and extrapair paternity (EPP) is
   widely attributed to environmental heterogeneity, but the only variables
   known to be influential are food abundance and density of conspecific
   breeders (potential extrapair partners). Habitat structure is thought to
   impact EPP but is rarely measured and, when considered, is usually
   confounded with food abundance and predation pressure. To sidestep these
   confounds, we tested whether EPP is associated with habitat structure
   variables and with local conspecific density in a species whose nesting
   habitat is not used for feeding and lacks predators. In a blue-footed
   booby, Sula nebouxii, colony, the probability of EPP in a female's nest
   was highest in parts of the study plot where there were few obstacles to
   locomotion, and was quadratically related to local density of sexually
   active males, even though local males did not sire the EP chicks. The
   probability of a male breeder siring EP (extrapair) chicks elsewhere was
   quadratically related to local density of sexually active males around
   his nest. From these patterns we infer that both sexes may foray for EP
   interactions, that males and females nesting at intermediate density are
   most likely to be accessed by forayers, and that obstacles in the
   vicinity of a female's nest constrain access of foraying males. To our
   knowledge, this is the first demonstration that individual variation in
   EPP is associated with habitat structure in the absence of confounding
   variation in food availability, predation pressure or breeder quality,
   and the first evidence that EPP opportunities of female and male
   breeders are reduced by high density of conspecific breeders above a
   particular threshold. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{In a wide range of organisms, including humans, mothers can influence

   fathers are capable of programming their offspring for the type of
   environment they are likely to encounter. Male threespine sticklebacks,
   Gasterosteus aculeatus, were either exposed to predation risk while
   fathering or not. Fathers altered their paternal behaviour when exposed
   to predation risk, and consequently produced adult offspring with
   phenotypes associated with strong predation pressure (smaller size,
   reduced body condition, reduced behavioural activity). Moreover, more
   attentive fathers produced offspring that showed stronger antipredator
   responses. These results are consistent with behaviourally mediated
   paternal programming: fathers can alter offspring phenotypes to match
   their future environment and influence offspring traits well into
   adulthood. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{The nature of stimuli evoking cyanobacterium defence was investigated in
   experiments on Phormidium sp. strain able to defend itself against

   Pseudomicrothorax dubius separated from cyanobacterium with a mesh
   insert indicates the existence of a chemical cue originating from the
   ciliates. Grazers released into the wells where trichomes' dispersion
   was already limited by the cue initially had no difficulty finding food,
   but started to starve 24h later. Similar situation was observed in
   control wells. Direct observations of trichomes attacked by the ciliates
   showed a distinct difference between the trichomes previously subjected
   to mesh-separated ciliate and the control ones. The former withdrew more
   frequently into a rigid sheath, whereas the latter usually withdrew into
   elastic tubes. This suggests that both chemical and mechanical stimuli
   are necessary to express cyanobacterium defence to the fullest extent.
   Further investigations showed that ciliates specialised in ingesting
   filamentous Cyanobacteria limit trichomes' dispersion, whereas
   filter-feeding Euplotes and Cyanobacteria-feeding rotifer do not. The
   cyanobacterium can detect grazer presence even without direct contact

Abstract = {{The ability to adjust behavioral responses to environmental cues
   probably contributes to an individual's ability to persist in unfamiliar
   habitats. One behavior, how an individual responds to novelty,
   influences the acquisition of resources (e.g., novel foods) and
   identification of stressors, but it may also increase exposure to risks.
   Here, using house sparrows (Passer domesticus) recently introduced to
   Kenya, we tested how range expansion influenced individuals' responses
   to novel foods and objects. We predicted that range edge birds would be
   less averse to novelty than birds at the site of introduction and that
   this effect would be more pronounced for novel foods than novel
   non-nutritional items. We also expected range edge individuals to be
   more sensitive to changes in the environment and therefore more apt to
   adjust their behavior in response to different cues; in other words,
   individuals at the range edge would have a more flexible behavioral
   repertoire than individuals at the site of introduction. As predicted,
   individuals at the range edge ate novel foods faster than those from
   established areas; however, latency to touch novel objects did not vary
   across the range. Individuals throughout the range were variable in
   their response to novelty, but there was no indication that individual
   flexibility was greater at the range edge. Although many novel items
   might be useful to introduced organisms, novel foods are likely more
   valuable, and therefore individuals should be most apt to risk the

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: African American (AA) women have been shown to lose less
   weight than Caucasian women in response to behavioral interventions. Our
   objective was to examine adherence to intervention and metabolic factors
   that may explain this difference.
   DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We examined longitudinal changes in body weight and
   energy expenditure (EE), and objective assessment of physical activity
   (PA) and energy intake (EI) during 6 months of a weight-loss
   intervention program, including prescribed calorie restriction and
   increased PA in 66 Caucasian and 39 AA severely obese women. Comparisons
   were also made in 25 Caucasian and 25 AA women matched for initial body
   weight.
   RESULTS: The AA women lost 3.6 kg less weight than Caucasian women.
   Total daily EE (TDEE) and resting metabolic rate (RMR) adjusted for fat
   free mass (FFM) were significantly lower in the AA women, whereas the
   decrease in RMR in response to weight loss was greater in Caucasian
   women. Adherence to the prescribed PA and change in PA in response to
   intervention were similar in AA and Caucasian women. Prescribed EI (1794
   +/- 153 and 1806 +/- 153 kcal per day) and measured EI during
   intervention (2591 +/- 371 vs 2630 +/- 442 kcal per day) were nearly
   identical in matched AA and Caucasian women. However, the AA women lost
   significantly less body weight due to lower energy requirements (2924
   +/- 279 vs 3116 +/- 340 kcal per day; P<0.04), resulting in a lower
   energy deficit (333 +/- 210 vs 485 +/- 264 kcal per day).
   CONCLUSION: Adherence to the behavioral intervention was similar in AA
   and Caucasian women. However, neglecting to account for the lower energy
   requirements in AA women when calculating the energy prescription
   resulted in a lower level of calorie restriction and, hence, less body
   weight loss. Therefore, to achieve similar weight loss in AA women, the
   prescribed caloric restriction cannot be based on weight alone, but must
   be lower than in Caucasians, to account for lower energy requirements.}},

   scuba diving between 5 and 21 m depth in daytime. The total area swept
   was 13.75 ha. There were no significant differences between octopus
   presence in dens during open and closed fishing seasons. Depth had a
   significant negative relationship with occupancy. The average number of
   dens per 1000 m(2) was 3.84 +/- 0.84 in June and 3.89 in October. The
   area per den was 260 m(2). Den number estimations varied between 1586
   and 2057. The largest number of dens (76.5\%) was found between 5 and 10
   m depth. Den distribution was clumped. No significant differences were
   found between octopus size classes (small, medium and large) and den
   diameter. Associate dens were observed. There were no significant
   differences in den diameter and shell types found around the middens.
   Many dens could be ``permanent{''}. Drilling bivalve shell behaviour is
   discussed. The surveyed area had around 1100 individuals, mainly small
   specimens. No significant differences were found between octopus size
   and depth. Substrate, den type and food abundance and availability
   (especially razors Ensis arcuatus) seem to be the main factors
   influencing dens and octopus density and distribution. Den availability
   does not appear to be a limiting factor in this case. Temperature, den
   availability, predators and fishing pressure influencing density and
   distribution are discussed. Rodas inlet may be a preferential habitat
   for O. vulgaris individuals ranging from 200 to 2000 g, but especially
   small specimens (<= 1000 g).}},

Abstract = {{Energy is typically a limiting factor for animals during boreal winters,
   when low temperatures increase the cost of thermoregulation at the same
   times as short day-lengths and snow cover constrain foraging
   opportunities. Under these circumstances animals use a suite of
   behavioural and physiological adaptations to avoid overnight starvation.
   However, it is poorly understood how such strategies are affected by
   increased energy demands from other physiological systems. Thus, we used
   free-ranging blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, to test if competing
   demands for energy (here induced by a non-inflammatory,
   antibody-mediated immune challenge) would affect nocturnal body
   temperature (a predictor of energy expenditure in small animals) and
   energy-saving nest box roosting behaviour. We also assessed if the
   immune challenge incurred long-term survival costs. We found no evidence
   that body temperature regulation differed between immune-challenged and
   saline-injected birds. Nor did the immune challenge reduce survival to
   the next breeding season. However, old (second winter or older)
   immune-challenged birds continued roosting in nest boxes to a larger
   extent at the peak immune response, despite increased perceived
   predation risk induced by the preceding capture and immunization. In
   contrast, old control birds were less prone to roost in nest boxes after
   capture and saline injection. This difference was less pronounced in
   young (first winter) birds. We interpret the increased risk-taking
   behaviour in immune-challenged birds as a consequence of a higher need
   for exploiting the thermal benefits of nest box roosting to reduce
   energy loss. This suggests that resource deficiency might be a stronger
   predictor of overnight survival than the threat of nocturnal predation
   in this system. As such, our study provides insights into the classic
   tradeoff between starvation and predation risk, in suggesting that
   priority is given to minimizing the risk of starvation in situations
   where both starvation and predation risks increase during cold winter
   nights.}},

Abstract = {{Animal welfare enhancement requires that problems are reliably
   identified and ranked in order to prioritise corrective actions. Welfare
   problems vary with the conditions in which animals are maintained. The
   objectives were to highlight major welfare problems for dairy cows on
   farms in France, and find out how farm characteristics (housing and
   milking systems, breed) could impact specific welfare aspects on these
   farms. We conducted a cross-sectional survey on 131 French dairy farms.
   We used the Welfare Quality (R) protocol, which addresses all aspects of
   welfare, and yields scores for principles and criteria that represent
   how well farms meet welfare requirements (from 0 for a very adverse
   situation to 100 for an excellent one). We used descriptive statistics
   to highlight low welfare scores, and variance analyses to compare farms.
   Most farms were found `Acceptable' according to the Welfare Quality (R)
   classification. Principles scores for Health, Feeding and Behaviour
   ranged from 33 to 39. The median score for eight of the welfare criteria
   was below 50 ('Pain', `Integument alterations', `Diseases', `Comfort
   around resting', `Social behaviours', `Human-animal relationship',
   `Positive emotional state', `Hunger'), while the median score was above
   50 for the four other criteria ('Thirst', `Lameness', `Expression of
   other behaviours', `Ease of movement'). The scores varied widely between
   farms, within and between systems. Farms with cubicles obtained lower
   scores for `Comfort around resting', `Injuries'; farms with Holstein
   cows obtained lower scores for `Hunger'; farms using an automatic
   milking system obtained lower scores for `Expression of other
   behaviours' and `Diseases' in Holstein herds. This survey yields
   information on bottlenecks in dairy cow welfare with all dimensions of
   welfare considered together. The results can be used by stakeholders to
   prioritise corrective actions in welfare plans, focusing either on the
   whole population of farms or on farms with characteristics that are at
   high risk for specific welfare problems.}},

   Results suggest the more attributes presented to consumers, the greater
   the neural activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a brain region
   associated with working memory and uncertainty. Further, neural

Abstract = {{When individuals disperse, they modify the physical and social

   We explored how combinations of behavioural (exploration, mobility,

   measured prior to dispersal were linked to the subsequent dispersal
   decision in 77 roe deer Capreolus capreolus fawns. Using an unusually
   detailed multi-trait approach, we identified two independent behavioural
   continuums related to dispersal. First, a continuum of energetic
   expenditure contrasted individuals of low mobility, low variability in
   head activity and low body temperature with those that displayed
   opposite traits. Second, a continuum of neophobia contrasted individuals
   that explored more prior to dispersal and were more tolerant of capture
   with those that displayed opposite traits. While accounting for possible
   confounding effects of condition-dependence (body mass), we showed that
   future dispersers were less neophobic and had higher energetic budgets

Abstract = {{The ability to exert self-control in the face of appetitive, alluring

   behavioral measures that use disease-relevant stimuli can greatly
   improve our understanding of cue-specific impairments in self-control.
   To produce such a tool relevant to the study of eating and weight
   disorders, we modified the traditional go/no-go task to include food and
   non-food targets. To confirm that performance on this new task was
   consistent with other go/no-go tasks, it was given to 147 healthy,
   normal weight volunteers between the ages of 5 and 30. High-resolution
   photos of food or toys were used as the target and nontarget stimuli.
   Consistent with expectations, overall improvements in accuracy were seen
   from childhood to adulthood. Participants responded more quickly and
   made more commission errors to food cues compared to nonfood cues (F
   (1,140)=21.76, P<0.001), although no behavioral differences were seen

Abstract = {{1. Modification of behaviours in the presence of predators or predation
   cues is widespread among animals. The costs of a behavioural change in
   the presence of predators or predation cues depend on fitness effects of
   lost feeding opportunities and, especially when organisms are sexually
   dimorphic in size or timing of maturation, these costs are expected to
   differ between the sexes. 2. Larval Aedes triseriatus (Say) (Diptera:
   Culicidae) were used to test the hypothesis that behavioural responses
   of the sexes to predation cues have been selected differently due to
   different energy demands. 3. Even in the absence of water-borne
   predation cues, hungry females (the larger sex) spent more time browsing
   than did males, indicating a difference in energy needs. 4. In the
   presence of predation cues, well-fed larvae of both sexes reduced their
   activity more than did hungry larvae, and males shifted away from
   high-risk behaviours to a greater degree than did females, providing the
   first evidence of sex-specific antipredator behaviour in foraging
   mosquito larvae. 5. Because sexual size dimorphism is common across
   taxa, and energetic demands are probably correlated with size
   dimorphism, this research demonstrates the importance of investigating
   sex-specific behaviour and behavioural responses to enemies, and
   cautions against generalising results between sexes.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive developmental plasticity allows individuals experiencing poor
   environmental conditions in early life to adjust their life-history
   strategy in order to prioritize short-term fitness benefits and maximize
   reproductive output in challenging environments. Much research has been
   conducted to test whether such adoption of a ``faster{''} life-history
   strategy is accompanied by concordant changes in behavior and
   physiology, with mixed results. As research in this field has focused on
   comparison of mean-level responses of treatment groups, few studies
   include repeated measures of response variables and the effect that
   developmental stress may have on repeatability per se. We investigated
   how early-developmental stress affects the mean expression of (and
   repeatability in) a variety of behavioral and physiological traits in
   female zebra finches. We predicted that: (1) individuals subjected to
   nutritional restriction in the nestling phase would have higher feeding
   and activity rates, with associated increases in hematocrit and basal
   metabolic rates (BMRs), (2) nutritional restriction in early life would
   alter adults' stress-induced corticosterone level, and (3) developmental
   stress would, respectively, influence the amount of among-individual and
   within-individual variation in behavioral and physiological traits,
   hence affecting the repeatability of these traits. In comparison to
   control females, stressed females did not differ in activity rate or
   stress-induced corticosterone level, but they did have higher levels of
   feeding, hematocrit, and BMR. Among-individual variance and
   repeatability were generally higher in stressed females than in
   controls. Finally, we found that developmental dietary restriction
   significantly reduced the amount of within-individual variance both in
   activity rate in the novel environment and in stress-induced
   corticosterone level. Our results not only confirm previous findings on
   the effect of early-developmental stress on BMR, but also extend its
   effect to feeding rate and hematocrit, suggesting that developmental
   plasticity in these traits is ontogenetically linked.
   Early-developmental stress may disable particular genetic canalizing
   processes, which would release cryptic genetic variation and explain why
   repeatability and among-individual variance were generally higher in the
   stressed groups than in controls. For activity rate in the novel
   environment and with stress-induced corticosterone level, however,
   early-developmental stress significantly reduced within-individual
   variance, which may be a consequence of increased canalization of these
   traits at the micro-environmental level.}},

   in behavior and physiology. However, our knowledge of the ecology and
   life history of many subterranean salamanders is poor because of the
   limits and challenges of studying organisms in subterranean habitats.
   The Grotto Salamander (Eurycea spelaea) is an obligate subterranean
   plethodontid salamander, endemic to the Ozark Plateau Ecoregion of North
   America, and a top predator in many caves. We conducted a 25-mo
   mark-release-recapture study of E. spelaea within a 440-m section of a
   cave in Delaware County, Oklahoma to better understand the life history
   and demography of the species. We also examined this salamander's
   association with another cave-dependent species, the federally
   endangered Gray Bat (Myotis grisescens). We found that Grotto
   Salamanders spend typically 2-5 years as larvae, although some
   individuals delay metamorphosis several additional years, and that
   adults could live at least 9 years. We estimated population size to be
   305 +/- 126 individuals between December 2001 and February 2002, but
   decreased during subsequent surveys to a low of 101 +/- 48 individuals.
   Body condition varied seasonally; in general, body condition was greater
   from May to November, when bats were roosting and depositing fresh
   guano, and lower from December to April when bats were absent.
   Presumably, fresh guano produced pulses in nutrient availability and
   invertebrate densities, the latter of which are important food sources
   for E. spelaea. Declines in bat populations could have detrimental
   effects throughout subterranean food webs, including negative impacts on
   E. spelaea populations.}},

Abstract = {{Dietary restriction (DR) extends lifespan in a wide variety of
   organisms. Although several genes and pathways associated with this
   longevity response have been identified, the specific mechanism through
   which DR extends lifespan is not fully understood. We have recently
   developed a novel methodology to screen for transcriptional changes in
   response to acutely imposed DR upon adult Drosophila melanogaster and
   identified groups of genes that switch their transcriptional patterns
   from a normal diet pattern to a restricted diet pattern, or `switching
   genes'. In this current report we extend our transcriptional data
   analysis with gene set enrichment analysis to generate a
   pathway-centered perspective. The pattern of temporal behavior in
   response to the diet switch is strikingly similar within and across
   pathways associated with mRNA processing and protein translation.
   Furthermore, most genes within these pathways display an initial spike
   in activity within 6-8 h from the diet switch, followed by a
   coordinated, partial down-regulation after 24 h. We propose this
   represents a stereotypical response to DR, which ultimately leads to a
   mild but widespread inhibition of transcriptional and translational
   activity. Inhibition of the protein synthesis pathway has been observed
   in DR in other studies and has been shown to extend lifespan in several

Abstract = {{Annual grain crops dominate agricultural landscapes and provide the
   majority of calories consumed by humanity. Perennial grain crops could
   potentially ameliorate the land degradation and off-site impacts
   associated with annual grain cropping. However, herbaceous perennial
   plants with constitutively high allocation to harvestable seeds are rare
   to absent in nature. Recent trade-off theory models suggest that rugged
   fitness landscapes may explain the absence of this form better than sink
   competition models. Artificial selection for both grain production and
   multiyear lifespan can lead to more rapid progress in the face of
   fitness and genetic trade-offs than natural selection but is likely to
   result in plant types that differ substantially from all current
   domestic crops. Perennial grain domestication is also likely to require
   the development of selection strategies that differ from published crop
   breeding methods, despite their success in improving long-domesticated
   crops; for this purpose, we have reviewed literature in the areas of
   population and evolutionary genetics, domestication, and molecular
   biology. Rapid domestication will likely require genes with large effect
   that are expected to exhibit strong pleiotropy and epistasis. Cryptic
   genetic variation will need to be deliberately exposed both to purge
   mildly deleterious alleles and to generate novel agronomic phenotypes.
   We predict that perennial grain domestication programs will benefit from
   population subdivision followed by selection for simple traits in each
   subpopulation, the evaluation of very large populations, high selection
   intensity, rapid cycling through generations, and heterosis. The latter
   may be particularly beneficial in the development of varieties with
   stable yield and tolerance to crowding.}},

Title = {{Predictors for early introduction of solid food among Danish mothers and
   infants: an observational study}},
Journal = {{BMC PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Early introduction of complementary feeding may interfere
   with breastfeeding and the infant's self-controlled appetite resulting
   in increased growth. The aim of the present study was to investigate
   predictors for early introduction of solid food.
   Methods: In an observational study Danish mothers filled in a
   self-administered questionnaire approximately six months after birth.
   The questionnaire included questions about factors related to the
   infant, the mother, attachment and feeding known to influence time for
   introduction of solid food. The study population consisted of 4503
   infants. Data were analysed using ordered logistic regression models.
   Outcome variable was time for introduction to solid food.
   Results: Almost all of the included infants 4386 (97\%) initiated
   breastfeeding. At weeks 16, 17-25, 25+, 330 infants (7\%); 2923 (65\%);
   and 1250 (28\%), respectively had been introduced to solid food. Full
   breastfeeding at five weeks was the most influential predictor for later
   introduction of solid food (OR = 2.52 CI: 1.93-3.28). Among infant
   factors male gender, increased gestational age at birth, and higher
   birth weight were found to be statistically significant predictors.
   Among maternal factors, lower maternal age, higher BMI, and being
   primipara were significant predictors, and among attachment factors
   mother's reported perception of the infant as being temperamental, and
   not recognising early infant cues of hunger were significant predictors
   for earlier introduction of solid food. Supplementary analyses of
   interactions between the predictors showed that the association of
   maternal perceived infant temperament on early introduction was
   restricted to primiparae, that the mother's pre-pregnancy BMI had no
   impact if the infant was fully breastfed at week five, and that birth
   weight was only associated if the mother had reported early uncertainty
   in recognising infant's cues of hunger.
   Conclusions: Breastfeeding was the single most powerful indicator for
   preventing early introduction to solid food. Modifiable predictors
   pointed to the importance of supporting breastfeeding and educating
   primipara and mothers with low birth weight infants to be able to read
   and respond to their infants' cues to prevent early introduction to
   solid food.}},

Abstract = {{Research into the impact of atmospheric change on predator-prey
   interactions has mainly focused on density dependent responses and
   trophic linkages. As yet, the chemical ecology underpinning
   predator-prey interactions has received little attention in
   environmental change research. Group living animals have evolved
   behavioral mechanisms to escape predation, including chemical alarm
   signalling. Chemical alarm signalling between conspecific prey could be
   susceptible to environmental change if the physiology and behavior of
   these organisms are affected by changes in dietary quality resulting
   from environmental change. Using Rubus idaeus plants, we show that
   elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)) severely impaired
   escape responses of the aphid Amphorophora idaei to predation by
   ladybird larvae (Harmonia axyridis). Escape responses to ladybirds was
   reduced by > 50 \% after aphids had been reared on plants grown under
   eCO(2). This behavioral response was rapidly induced, occurring within
   24 h of being transferred to plants grown at eCO(2) and, once induced,
   persisted even after aphids were transferred to plants grown at ambient
   CO2. Escape responses were impaired due to reduced sensitivity to aphid
   alarm pheromone, (E)-beta-farnesene, via an undefined plant-mediated
   mechanism. Aphid abundance often increases under eCO(2), however,
   reduced efficacy of conspecific signalling may increase aphid
   vulnerability to predation, highlighting the need to study the chemical
   ecology of predator-prey interactions under environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{Predation is a strong selective pressure generating morphological,
   physiological and behavioural responses in organisms. As predation risk
   is often higher during juvenile stages, antipredator defences expressed
   early in life are paramount to survival. Maternal effects are an
   efficient pathway to produce such defences. We investigated whether
   maternal exposure to predator cues during gestation affected juvenile
   morphology, behaviour and dispersal in common lizards (Zootoca
   vivipara). We exposed 21 gravid females to saurophagous snake cues for
   one month while 21 females remained unexposed (i.e. control). We
   measured body size, preferred temperature and activity level for each
   neonate, and released them into semi-natural enclosures connected to
   corridors in order to measure dispersal. Offspring from exposed mothers
   grew longer tails, selected lower temperatures and dispersed thrice more
   than offspring from unexposed mothers. Because both tail autotomy and
   altered thermoregulatory behaviour are common antipredator tactics in
   lizards, these results suggest that mothers adjusted offspring phenotype
   to risky natal environments (tail length) or increased risk avoidance
   (dispersal). Although maternal effects can be passive consequences of
   maternal stress, our results strongly militate for them to be an
   adaptive antipredator response that may increase offspring survival

Title = {{Why does society accept a higher risk for alcohol than for other
   voluntary or involuntary risks?}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Societies tend to accept much higher risks for voluntary
   behaviours, those based on individual decisions (for example, to smoke,
   to consume alcohol, or to ski), than for involuntary exposure such as
   exposure to risks in soil, drinking water or air. In high-income
   societies, an acceptable risk to those voluntarily engaging in a risky
   behaviour seems to be about one death in 1,000 on a lifetime basis.
   However, drinking more than 20 g pure alcohol per day over an adult
   lifetime exceeds a threshold of one in 100 deaths, based on a
   calculation from World Health Organization data of the odds in six
   European countries of dying from alcohol-attributable causes at
   different levels of drinking.
   Discussion: The voluntary mortality risk of alcohol consumption exceeds
   the risks of other lifestyle risk factors. In addition, evidence shows
   that the involuntary risks resulting from customary alcohol consumption
   far exceed the acceptable threshold for other involuntary risks (such as
   those established by the World Health Organization or national
   environmental agencies), and would be judged as not acceptable.
   Alcohol's exceptional status reflects vagaries of history, which have so
   far resulted in alcohol being exempted from key food legislation (no
   labelling of ingredients and nutritional information) and from
   international conventions governing all other psychoactive substances
   (both legal and illegal). This is along with special treatment of
   alcohol in the public health field, in part reflecting overestimation of
   its beneficial effect on ischaemic disease when consumed in moderation.
   Summary: A much higher mortality risk from alcohol than from other risk
   factors is currently accepted by high income countries.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Interventions are needed to reduce poor perinatal health. We
   trained community health workers (CHWs) as home visitors to address
   maternal/infant risks.
   Methods: In a cluster randomised controlled trial in Cape Town
   townships, neighbourhoods were randomised within matched pairs to 1) the
   control, healthcare at clinics (n = 12 neighbourhoods; n = 594 women),
   or 2) a home visiting intervention by CBW trained in
   cognitive-behavioural strategies to address health risks (by the Philani
   Maternal, Child Health and Nutrition Programme), in addition to clinic
   care (n = 12 neighbourhoods; n = 644 women). Participants were assessed
   during pregnancy (2\% refusal) and 92\% were reassessed at two weeks
   post-birth, 88\% at six months and 84\% at 18 months later. We analysed
   32 measures of maternal/infant well-being over the 18 month follow-up
   period using longitudinal random effects regressions. A binomial test
   for correlated outcomes evaluated overall effectiveness over time. The
   18 month post-birth assessment outcomes also were examined alone and as
   a function of the number of home visits received.
   Results: Benefits were found on 7 of 32 measures of outcomes, resulting
   in significant overall benefits for the intervention compared to the
   control when using the binomial test (p = 0.008); nevertheless, no
   effects were observed when only the 18 month outcomes were analyzed.
   Benefits on individual outcomes were related to the number of home
   visits received. Among women living with HIV, intervention mothers were
   more likely to implement the PMTCT regimens, use condoms during all
   sexual episodes (OR = 1.25; p = 0.014), have infants with healthy
   weight-for-age measurements (OR = 1.42; p = 0.045), height-for-age
   measurements (OR = 1.13, p<0.001), breastfeed exclusively for six months

   measurements at 6 months (OR = 1.09, p = 0.017), and improved cognitive
   development at 18 months (OR = 1.02, p = 0.048).
   Conclusions: Home visits to neighbourhood mothers by CHWs may be a
   feasible strategy for enhancing maternal/child outcomes. However, visits
   likely must extend over several years for persistent benefits.}},

Title = {{Reproductive responses of birds to experimental food supplementation: a
   meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Food availability is an important environmental cue for
   animals for deciding how much to invest in reproduction, and it
   ultimately affects population size. The importance of food limitation
   has been extensively studied in terrestrial vertebrate populations,
   especially in birds, by experimentally manipulating food supply.
   However, the factors explaining variation in reproductive decisions in
   response to food supplementation remain unclear. By performing
   meta-analyses, we aim to quantify the extent to which supplementary
   feeding affects several reproductive parameters in birds, and identify
   the key factors (life-history traits, behavioural factors, environmental
   factors, and experimental design) that can induce variation in laying
   date, clutch size and breeding success (i.e., number of fledglings
   produced) in response to food supplementation.
   Results: Food supplementation produced variable but mostly positive
   effects across reproductive parameters in a total of 201 experiments
   from 82 independent studies. The outcomes of the food effect were
   modulated by environmental factors, e. g., laying dates advanced more
   towards low latitudes, and food supplementation appeared not to produce
   any obvious effect on bird reproduction when the background level of
   food abundance in the environment was high. Moreover, the increase in
   clutch size following food addition was more pronounced in birds that
   cache food, as compared to birds that do not. Supplementation timing was
   identified as a major cause of variation in breeding success responses.
   We also document the absence of a detectable food effect on clutch size
   and breeding success when the target species had poor access to the feed
   due to competitive interactions with other animals.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that, from the pool of bird species
   and environments reviewed, extra food is allocated to immediate
   reproduction in most cases. Our results also support the view that bird
   species have evolved different life-history strategies to cope with
   environmental variability in food supply. However, we encourage more
   research at low latitudes to gain knowledge on how resource allocation
   in birds changes along a latitudinal gradient. Our results also
   emphasize the importance of developing experimental designs that
   minimise competition for the supplemented food and the risk of
   reproductive bottle-necks due to inappropriate supplementation timings.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Aflatoxins (AFs) are a group of potent mycotoxins that
   frequently pollute agro-products and animal feeds. For complex reasons,
   the regulatory limits of AFs differ from nation to nation. In this
   study, feedstuffs contaminated with various concentrations of aflatoxin
   B1 (AFB1) corresponding to AF regulatory limits of major agro-product
   importing and exporting nations were tested in Sprague-Dawley rats, and
   the toxicological results were evaluated.
   RESULTS: During the trial period, no poisoning behavior was observed and
   no animals died. No significant differences in body weight were observed
   between AFB1-contaminated and control rats. However, various negative
   impacts on liver and kidney functions were observed in AFB1-contaminated
   groups, and these negative impacts were positively correlated with AFB1
   concentrations. At concentrations of 4-50 mu g kg(-1), AFB1 tolerance
   was observed for the liver after 15 days of testing, but this tolerance
   was not observed for the kidney.
   CONCLUSION: Low concentrations of AFB1 still induced obvious
   toxicological impacts on Sprague-Dawley rats, and the negative effects
   were aggravated by increasing the AFB1 dose and feeding time. Therefore
   strict AF regulatory limits are suggested for food safety
   administration, especially for the low-income nations with higher
   hepatitis B virus prevalence. (C) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) has been used as a genetic
   animal model of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). SHR/Izm
   is derived from stroke-resistant SHR as SHR/NIH and SHR/NCrl but from
   22nd to 23rd generation descendants of the SHR/NIH ancestor and
   therefore may show different behavioral phenotypes compared to other SHR
   sub-strains. In this study, ADHD-like behaviors in SHR/Izm were
   evaluated compared to Wistar rats. SHR/Izm showed high locomotor
   activity in the habituation phase in a novel environment, although
   locomotor activity in the initial exploratory phase was low. In a
   behavioral test for attention, spontaneous alternation behavior in the
   Y-maze test was impaired in SHR/Izm. However, impulsive behavior in the
   elevated-plus maze test, which is designed to detect anxiety-related
   behavior but also reflects impulsivity for novelty seeking, was

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the influence of rearing system (free-ranging (FR)
   v. confinement (C)) on buffalo heifer efficiency to reach age of puberty
   and on behavioural and immune functions, two experiments were conducted
   from September 2010 to October 2011. In Experiment I, 32 subjects aged 8
   to 9 months at the start of experiment were used. A total of 16 animals
   (group C) were group housed in an indoor slatted floor pen (4
   m(2)/animal) with an outdoor paddock (4 m(2)/animal); 16 others grazed
   on a Mediterranean natural pasture of 40 ha (group FR). Behavioural data
   were collected and organic matter digestibility, blood metabolites and
   progesterone were determined. At the end of the experiment, a novel
   object test and a skin test were conducted, and the avoidance distance
   (AD) at the manger was measured. Free-ranging animals were able to
   express natural behaviours such as wallowing and grazing. C animals
   devoted more time to the novel object than FR animals, whereas AD at
   manger was lower in group FR than in group C (P < 0.01). Cellular immune
   response was higher in FR heifers than in C animals (P < 0.01). FR
   animals also showed a higher digestibility of organic matter (P < 0.01).
   Heifers from group FR had higher plasma concentrations of non-esterified
   fatty acids (P < 0.001) and lower concentrations of glucose than heifers
   from group C (P < 0.001). C animals showed higher daily weight gains (P
   < 0.01) and weight at the puberty (P < 0.05), but there were no
   differences in terms of age of puberty between the two groups. The
   intakes of dry matter (DM), CP and energy to reach the age of puberty
   were similar in both groups. In order to verify whether the results
   obtained in Experiment I could be replicated in different rearing
   conditions (reduced pasture availability, different location and
   altitude), a second experiment was conducted on 26 animals, where only
   onset of age of puberty and metabolic profile were monitored. In
   Experiment II, 13 heifers grazed on a natural pasture of 5 ha, other 13
   received the same space as indicated for Experiment I. Results from
   Experiment II generally confirmed those of Experiment I. Only the
   intakes of DM and energy to reach the age of puberty were higher in
   group C than in FR (P < 0.001). A lower competition with human
   nutrition, reproductive performances similar to those shown by confined
   animals and the indications given by immune and behavioural variables,
   suggest that a free-range-based system may be conveniently used for
   buffalo heifer farming purposes.}},

   bead chip in cord blood samples from infants of mothers with GDM (group
   1) and infants with prenatal growth restraint indicated by rapid
   postnatal catch-up growth (group 2), compared with infants with normal
   postnatal growth (group 3). Seventy-five CpG loci were differentially
   methylated in groups 1 and 2 compared with the controls (group 3),

Abstract = {{Objective: Eating behavior traits measured in early life predict eating
   behavior and weight trajectories later in development, and may be
   associated with certain parental feeding behaviors. Our goal was to
   investigate the relationship between a range of feeding behaviors, and
   preschoolers' appetitive traits.
   Method: Four hundred thirty-nine parents of UK 3-5 year olds completed
   scales measuring authoritarian vs. authoritative forms of limiting
   (Restriction vs. Monitoring) and promoting (Pressuring vs. Prompting)
   intake, as well as Emotional and Instrumental Feeding. Parents also
   completed scales measuring child Food responsiveness and Satiety
   responsiveness. Child BMI z-scores were calculated based on measured
   heights and weights.
   Results: Parental Restriction was significantly associated with greater
   child Food responsiveness (p <. 001), but parental Monitoring was not.
   Parental Pressuring was significantly associated with greater child
   Satiety responsiveness (p <. 001), while parental Prompting was not.
   Parental Instrumental and Emotional feeding were both associated with
   greater child Food responsiveness (p <. 001). All relationships were
   independent of child BMI z-score.
   Discussion: Prospective data are needed to determine whether the
   parent-child feeding relationships identified here promote, or protect
   against, the development of eating pathology in children. However, our
   results suggest that cross-sectional associations depend on the style

Abstract = {{Animals must overcome the physical properties protecting foods to obtain
   nutrition. While animals can experience selection for traits that
   facilitate resource exploitation, specific feeding behaviors may entail
   multiple, different mechanical challenges with each potentially
   eliciting distinct selection pressures. Tree gouging by common marmosets
   (Primates: Callithrix jacchus) provides an illustrative case for
   studying these distinct mechanical challenges and their correlated
   behaviors and morphologies. We test the hypothesis that marmosets
   respond differently to three sequential mechanical stages of bark
   removal: (1) indentation; (2) crack initiation; (3) crack propagation.
   By surveying trees gouged by free-ranging marmosets in Pernambuco,
   Brazil, we found that mechanical variables related to crack initiation
   (fracture toughness, critical strain energy release rate and elastic
   modulus) were inversely correlated with measures of gouging intensity,
   with less mechanically challenging trees being gouged more intensely.
   Because crack initiation is likely the most mechanically challenging
   aspect of tree gouging, behavioral preference for less challenging
   resources likely allows marmosets to reduce costs and potential risks
   associated with accessing exudates. Variables related to bark
   indentation (hardness and friction) showed no relationship to the
   intensity of gouging behavior. Contrary to our prediction, trees with
   greater mechanical challenges for crack propagation (work to peel) were
   gouged more intensely. We attribute this pattern of gouging trees
   requiring greater effort in crack propagation to an inverse correlation
   between work to peel and fracture toughness in our tree sample.
   Importantly, marmosets exhibit morphological specializations of the
   feeding apparatus that facilitate indentation and crack propagation,
   potentially mitigating the need for behavioral choice. Here we show that
   extracting a single food resource can exert a series of distinct,
   potentially competing, selective forces during resource acquisition.
   This study illustrates how animals combine behaviors and morphological
   specializations to competently overcome distinct mechanical challenges,
   emphasizing the need for holistic approaches in understanding feeding
   adaptations.}},

Volume = {{176}},

Abstract = {{For foraging herbivores, both food quality and predation risk vary
   across the landscape. Animals should avoid low-quality food patches in
   favour of high-quality ones, and seek safe patches while avoiding risky
   ones. Herbivores often face the foraging dilemma, however, of choosing
   between high-quality food in risky places or low-quality food in safe
   places. Here, we explore how and why the interaction between food
   quality and predation risk affects foraging decisions of mammalian
   herbivores, focusing on browsers confronting plant toxins in a landscape
   of fear. We draw together themes of plant-herbivore and predator-prey
   interactions, and the roles of animal ecophysiology, behaviour and
   personality. The response of herbivores to the dual costs of food and
   fear depends on the interplay of physiology and behaviour. We discuss
   detoxification physiology in dealing with plant toxins, and stress
   physiology associated with perceived predation risk. We argue that
   behaviour is the interface enabling herbivores to stay or quit food
   patches in response to their physiological tolerance to these risks. We
   hypothesise that generalist and specialist herbivores perceive the
   relative costs of plant defence and predation risk differently and
   intra-specifically, individuals with different personalities and
   physiologies should do so too, creating individualised landscapes of
   food and fear. We explore the ecological significance and emergent
   impacts of these individual-based foraging outcomes on populations and
   communities, and offer predictions that can be clearly tested. In doing
   so, we provide an integrated platform advancing herbivore foraging
   theory with food quality and predation risk at its core.}},

Abstract = {{Consumer-driven nutrient recycling, the release of chemicals as
   byproducts and excesses of consumer physiology, can alter ecosystems by
   changing the availability of limiting nutrients at the base of the food
   web. The mere presence of predators can alter consumer physiology by
   restricting food intake and inducing stress. Predation risk, then, can
   influence ecosystem function by modifying the role of prey as nutrient
   recyclers, yet there are few empirical tests of how predation risk
   alters nutrient recycling by prey. Here, we present the results of a
   test for the effects of predation risk on the C and N budgets of
   Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). We reared female guppies for
   7 weeks on diets of varying quality, and we compared control individuals
   to those exposed continuously to chemical cues emitted by a guppy
   predator, Crenicichla alta. We measured food consumption, growth rate,
   tissue elemental stoichiometry and N excretion by guppies on all
   treatments. Guppies strongly reduced food intake in the presence of
   predator cues; however, cue-exposed guppies assimilated nutrients more
   efficiently than controls. Specifically, cue-exposed guppies strongly
   increased N retention efficiency while only moderately increasing C
   efficiency. Consequently, guppies reared with predator cues excreted 39
   \% less N than control guppies. We suggest that reduced foraging,
   enhanced nutrient efficiency, and decreased N excretion are adaptive
   responses to the extrinsic mortality threat posed by guppy predators.
   The resulting substantial reduction in N excretion by guppies may
   influence ecosystem function in natural streams by reducing the supply
   of a limiting nutrient.}},

Abstract = {{In urban habitats, organisms face unique fitness challenges including

   stress responses, which may prevent pathologies associated with
   consistent elevation of stress hormones, and may also show differences
   in baseline corticosterone (CORT, the primary avian stress hormone), due
   to altered energetic demands or chronic stress. We examined whether
   stress physiology and condition metrics in male song sparrows Melospiza
   melodia vary as a function of discrete differences in anthropogenic
   disturbance level (activity centers and refuges) or with continuous
   variation in an urbanization score and noise environment. Males breeding
   in activity centers displayed lower maximal (acute) CORT levels than
   activity refuge males, and acute CORT also tended to negatively
   correlate with urbanization score. Baseline CORT did not differ between
   habitat types, and activity center males also showed no evidence of
   changes in body mass, hematocrit, or antioxidant capacity. Further,
   activity center males had higher quality feathers (indicative of higher
   condition at molt) than activity refuge males. We found no indication

Abstract = {{Seabirds foraging on pelagic fish develop behavioral strategies
   specifically adapted to locate inconspicuous prey that are aggregated in
   spatially dynamic patches. In the marine environment, they may use
   various mechanisms to detect cues of prey availability. The aggregation
   of predators at a patch of food is a particularly obvious cue to locate
   prey, a mechanism known as local enhancement. Pioneering studies
   described the formation of foraging groups at sea, showing that seabirds
   are attracted to feeding conspecifics. Improved foraging success due to
   local enhancement has been suggested from modeling studies, but no
   direct validation of these results exists. We deployed video cameras
   concomitantly with GPS loggers on Cape gannets to study the behavioral
   responses of equipped birds to the aggregation of predators at food
   patches. We showed that the reaction distances of equipped birds
   increased with the size of an aggregation, demonstrating that predator
   aggregations enhance food detectability for foragers. For small
   aggregations (< 50 gannets), reaction distances were mostly less than 10
   km, and they increased up to almost 40 km for larger aggregations
   (100-150 gannets). In addition, we showed that the number and frequency
   of dives increased with the number of conspecifics aggregated, up to a
   threshold. The predator aggregations on a patch of food could,
   therefore, not only inform about the presence of prey but also entail
   information about foraging conditions. From direct observations on the
   various components involved, our study provides justification of the use
   and advantages of local enhancement in foraging seabirds.To locate
   inconspicuous and ephemeral fish schools in the ocean, seabirds may use
   indirect cues such as feeding conspecifics. Based on video cameras and
   GPS loggers concomitantly attached to Cape gannets, we showed that
   predator aggregations on a patch of food enhanced prey detectability.
   Gannets reacted to join a group of 50 feeding conspecifics from similar
   to 10 km, whereas a group of 100-150 gannets triggered a reaction from
   up to 40 km.}},

   classified in captivity would predict the behavioral flexibility of blue
   tits Cyanistes caeruleus as they foraged in the wild. Behavioral
   flexibility was defined as the tendency to adjust feeder use with
   changing winter air temperature, an indicator of starvation risk. At the
   population level, birds reduced their feeder use on warm days.
   Individuals, though, varied widely, with some instead using feeders at a
   relatively fixed, temperature-independent rate. Sex and size, correlates
   of dominance in blue tits, did not predict behavioral flexibility.
   Instead, behavioral flexibility was predicted by age and 2 personality
   traits: old, neophobic, and exploratory birds were more behaviorally
   flexible than young, neophilic, and nonexploratory birds. Our findings
   suggest that personality types differ in how they use information about
   their environments and hence cope with environmental change.A bird's
   response to the weather depends on their personality. Individual birds,
   like humans, respond differently to the same novel or threatening
   situations. In winter, when starvation risk is greatest, blue tits
   varied in foraging strategy. Shy but exploratory individuals adjusted
   their feeder use with air temperature, feeding most on cold days. Bold
   but less exploratory individuals fed at a fixed rate all winter. Thus,
   personality may predict how individuals cope with environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of low-level lead exposure on neuropsychological status in
   the United States (US) general adult population have been reported, and
   the relationship between neuropsychiatric dysfunction and health risk
   behaviors including substance use and sexual risk taking is well
   established. However, the potential influence of lead exposure on
   risk-taking behavior has received little attention. Using the National
   Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2010, we estimated
   multivariable logistic regression models to measure odds ratios (ORs)
   and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the cross-sectional associations
   between blood lead level and risk behaviors including binge drinking,
   drug use, and indicator of sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk.
   STI indicators included past 12 month sexual risk behaviors (age mixing
   with partners who were at least five years younger or older and multiple
   partnerships), self-reported STI, and biologically-confirmed herpes
   simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection. Dose-response like relationships
   were observed between blood lead and substance use, age mixing with
   younger and older partners, self-reported STI, and HSV-2. In addition,
   participants with lead levels in highest quartile versus those with
   levels in the lowest quartile had over three times the odds of binge
   drinking and over twice the odds of injection drug or cocaine use in the
   past 12 months, while being in one of the top two quartiles was
   significantly associated with 30-70\% increased odds of multiple
   partnerships, sex with older partners, and self-reported and
   biologically confirmed STI. Results from this study suggested that lead
   exposure may contribute to substance use, sexual risk-taking, and STI.
   However, given limitations inherent in the cross-sectional nature of the
   study, additional studies that use longitudinal data and measure
   detailed temporal information are warranted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Average Values and Racial Differences of Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio
   among a Nationally Representative Sample of United States Subjects}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Several studies reported the negative impact of elevated
   neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) on outcomes in many surgical and
   medical conditions. Previous studies used arbitrary NLR cut-off points
   according to the average of the populations under study. There is no
   data on the average NLR in the general population. The aim of this study
   is to explore the average values of NLR and according to race in adult
   non-institutional United States individuals by using national data.
   Methods: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
   of aggregated cross-sectional data collected from 2007 to 2010 was
   analyzed; data extracted included markers of systemic inflammation
   (neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, and NLR), demographic variables and
   other comorbidities. Subjects who were prescribed steroids,
   chemotherapy, immunomodulators and antibiotics were excluded. Adjusted
   linear regression models were used to examine the association between
   demographic and clinical characteristics and neutrophil counts,
   lymphocyte counts, and NLR.
   Results: Overall 9427 subjects are included in this study. The average
   value of neutrophils is 4.3k cells/mL, of lymphocytes 2.1k cells/mL; the
   average NLR is 2.15. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic participants have
   significantly lower mean NLR values (1.76, 95\% CI 1.71-1.81 and 2.08,
   95\% CI 2.04-2.12 respectively) when compared to non-Hispanic Whites
   (2.24, 95\% CI 2.19-2.28-p<0.0001). Subjects who reported diabetes,
   cardiovascular disease, and smoking had significantly higher NLR than
   subjects who did not. Racial differences regarding the association of
   smoking and BMI with NLR were observed.
   Conclusions: This study is providing preliminary data on racial
   disparities in a marker of inflammation, NLR, that has been associated
   with several chronic diseases outcome, suggesting that different cut-off
   points should be set according to race. It also suggests that racial
   differences exist in the inflammatory response to environmental and
   behavioral risk factors.}},

Abstract = {{Organisms exhibit plasticity in response to their environment, but there
   is large variation even within populations in the expression and
   magnitude of response. Maternal influence alters offspring survival
   through size advantages in growth and development. However, the
   relationship between maternal influence and variation in plasticity in
   response to predation risk is unknown. We hypothesized that variation in
   the magnitude of plastic responses between families is at least partly
   due to maternal provisioning and examined the relationship between
   maternal condition, egg provisioning and magnitude of plastic response
   to perceived predation risk (by dragonfly larvae: Aeshna spp.) in
   northern leopard frogs (Lithobates pipiens). Females in better body
   condition tended to lay more (clutch size) larger (egg diameter) eggs.
   Tadpoles responded to predation risk by increasing relative tail depth
   (morphology) and decreasing activity (behaviour). We found a positive
   relationship between morphological effect size and maternal condition,
   but no relationship between behavioural effect size and maternal
   condition. These novel findings suggest that limitations imposed by
   maternal condition can constrain phenotypic variation, ultimately
   influencing the capacity of populations to respond to environmental
   change.}},

Abstract = {{An organism's behavioral decisions often depend upon the relative
   strength of appetitive and aversive sensory stimuli, the relative
   sensitivity to which can be modified by internal states like hunger.
   However, whether sensitivity to such opposing influences is modulated in
   a unidirectional or bidirectional manner is not clear. Starved flies
   exhibit increased sugar and decreased bitter sensitivity. It is widely
   believed that only sugar sensitivity changes, and that this masks bitter
   sensitivity. Here we use gene-and circuit-level manipulations to show
   that sweet and bitter sensitivity are independently and reciprocally
   regulated by starvation in Drosophila. We identify orthogonal
   neuromodulatory cascades that oppositely control peripheral taste
   sensitivity for each modality. Moreover, these pathways are recruited at
   increasing hunger levels, such that low-risk changes (higher sugar
   sensitivity) precede high-risk changes (lower sensitivity to potentially
   toxic resources). In this way, state-intensity-dependent, reciprocal
   regulation of appetitive and aversive peripheral gustatory sensitivity
   permits flexible, adaptive feeding decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Competing successfully for the best feeding sites is an important
   behavioral strategy but little is known about how feeding sites vary
   nutritionally within a fruit tree. To answer this question we tested how
   the nutritional value of a fruit is influenced by its ripeness and its
   height within the tree crown. A complementary objective was to assess
   the nutritional value of the midripe fruit, a food item rarely mentioned
   in the literature despite being exploited on a daily basis by many
   frugivores. We measured how the dry weight of pulp, water content, and
   concentration of macronutrients and condensed tannins varied within the
   tree crowns of 15 fruit species. Collections occurred early in the
   fruiting cycle, so as to assess the amount of food in the tree before
   its exploitation by primates. We found that (1) the upper crown produced
   fruit densities 4.2 times higher, and a fruit crop 4.8 times larger,
   than the lower crown of the same tree; (2) considering only midripe and
   ripe stages, upper-crown fruits contained 28.6\% more dry pulp, 21.1\%
   more water, and 13.5\% more sugars per dry matter than lower-crown
   fruits of the same tree; (3) midripe fruits contained 80\% of the
   concentrations of sugars of ripe fruits, making them a sweeter food item
   than one would expect from the intermediate color of their epidermis;
   (4) cellulose, hemicellulose, proteins, and ash proportionally decreased
   in concentration while dry pulp and sugars increased during ripening;
   and (5) ripe fruits were usually rare in the tree (<0.5\% of all fruit
   available) compared to midripe fruits (3-8\%). Overall, upper-crown
   feeding sites produced a higher density and quality of food than
   lower-crown sites of the same tree. Our data therefore provide a clear

Abstract = {{Animals, including fish, display individually consistent behavioral
   differences that may affect an individual's vulnerability not only to
   predation, but also to fishing. Compared with complex natural
   environments, plain hatchery environments might induce development of
   behaviors that increase vulnerability to fishing, which would in turn
   have major implications for the management of stocks by supportive
   releases. We studied whether the vulnerability of hatchery-reared brown
   trout (Salmo trutta) to angling could be predicted by rearing method
   (standard versus enriched) or behavioral variation that was assessed
   using long-term observations of moving activity in groups. High moving
   activity in the beginning of the behavioral tests (i.e., exploration
   behavior) predicted increased vulnerability to angling independently of
   fish body size. Standard rearing promoted high exploration rate among
   fish, whereas enriched rearing promoted improvement in body condition in
   (semi-) natural conditions. However, the driving influence of hunger on
   vulnerability could not be ruled out, as the most explorative
   standard-reared fish appeared unable to maintain their body condition
   during the experiments. This study provides direct evidence that
   standard hatchery rearing method promotes behaviors that directly
   predict vulnerability to angling.}},

Abstract = {{1. Behavioural responses to varying macronutrient availability are
   increasingly studied in highly invasive ant species to better understand
   their ecological success. However, such work is lacking in relation to
   native ant species confronted with biological invaders. 2. Here the link
   between diet and behaviour was examined in Prolasius advenus, a native
   ant from New Zealand facing intense competition for food with invasive
   insects, including social wasps. A long-term laboratory experiment was
   conducted to assess the impact of protein and carbohydrate restriction
   on several behavioural parameters. 3. Ants shifted their food-collecting
   activity towards the least available macronutrient in both
   protein-limited and carbohydrate-limited colonies. But when lacking
   carbohydrate, they also strongly increased their efforts to discover
   resources. After 10weeks, the proportion of the colony patrolling
   outside of the nest was eight times higher than at the initiation of the
   experiment. This high patrolling activity was then maintained for
   several weeks and resulted in a higher efficiency to explore a novel
   territory. Moreover, ants fed a carbohydrate-limited diet engaged in
   longer aggressive acts towards conspecifics. 4. These behavioural
   responses to carbohydrate scarcity may, in part, enhance the ability of
   P. advenus to resist a competing invader under natural conditions. While
   much of the previous research has linked diet and behavioural dominance
   in invasive ants, the present study shows that conducting similar
   investigations in the native species to which they are confronted may
   shed light on the mechanisms behind biotic resistance and the ability of
   some native species to coexist with highly abundant invaders.}},

   policy were primarily focused on secondary prevention and treatment of
   NCDs. However, epidemiological and experimental evidence indicates that
   early-life exposures influence the risk of childhood obesity and related
   diseases later in life, and has now focused attention on the health of
   both mother and child. During pregnancy and the early neonatal period,
   individuals respond to their environment by establishing anatomical,
   physiological and biochemical trajectories that shape their future
   health. This period of developmental plasticity provides an early window
   of opportunity to mitigate the environmental insults that may increase
   an individual's sensitivity to, or risk of, developing obesity or
   related diseases later in life. Although much investigation has already
   occurred in the area of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease
   research, the science itself is still in its infancy. It remains for
   researchers to tackle the important outstanding questions and translate
   their knowledge into workable solutions for the public good. The

Abstract = {{Mutualistic symbioses are ubiquitous in nature and facilitate high
   biodiversity and productivity of ecosystems by enhancing the efficiency
   of energy and nutrient use within ecological communities. For example,
   small groups of fish that inhabit coral colonies in reef ecosystems
   potentially enhance coral growth through defense from coral predators,
   aeration of coral tissue and nutrient provisioning. This study examines
   whether the prevalence and consequences of fish-coral interactions vary
   among sites with different environmental conditions in a coral reef
   lagoon, using the humbug damselfish Dascyllus aruanus and its preferred
   coral host Pocillopora damicornis as a study system. Using a field
   experiment, we tested the site-specific effects of D. aruanus on coral
   growth, and show that the cost-benefit ratio for corals hosting fish
   varies with local environmental variation. Results of this study also
   demonstrate that fish prefer to inhabit coral colonies with particular
   branch-spacing characteristics, and that the local abundance of D.
   aruanus influences the proportion of coral colonies within a site that
   are occupied by fish rather than increasing the number of fish per
   colony. We also show that corals consistently benefit from hosting D.
   aruanus via defense from predation by corallivorous butterflyfish,
   regardless of local environmental conditions. These findings highlight
   the need to consider the potential for multiple scale- and
   state-dependent interaction effects when examining the ecology of

   Pentatomidae) and changes in the predation behaviour of this insect when
   fed with Bt (Cryl Ab) maize-fed Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith)
   larvae (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) was evaluated. The predator showed 43.7\%
   delay in the nymphal development time and 15\% biomass reduction in the
   fifth instar, probably due to low nutritional quality of prey exposed to
   Bt maize. Survival curves were similar in predators fed with S.
   frugiperda larvae exposed and not exposed to Bt maize. The predator
   search time was slightly influenced by the developmental delay of S.
   frugiperda fed with Bt maize. In a greenhouse assay P. nigrispinus was
   important in controlling S. frugiperda density in Bt maize expressing

   that indirect negative effects of Bt maize on the predator's performance

Abstract = {{Previous observations of cannibalism have been made in the aphid
   Acyrthosiphon pisum (L.): this article seeks to quantify factors
   contributing to such behaviors. We observed and quantified the responses
   of a number of clones and life stages to varying levels of starvation,
   in the form of increasingly desiccated Vica faba L. plants (receiving
   50, 25, or 10 mL every second day) or a complete absence of host plant.
   We found that, while the longest incidences of cannibalism are carried
   out by juveniles (F = 3.45, P = 0.019, df = 3) and targeted at adults,
   the starvation treatments had the most significant effect on the
   prevalence of cannibalism in mature A. pisum (F = 2.24, P = 0.025, df =
   9). Furthermore, there was no difference between the prevalence or
   duration of cannibalistic activities within and between different clones
   (P 0.05 in all cases), though juveniles were more likely to target
   unrelated aphids (V = 6112, P = 0.011), and spent more time feeding on
   aphids from the same culture (V = 6062, P = 0.018).}},

Abstract = {{A combinatory approach using metabolomics and gut microbiome analysis
   techniques was performed to unravel the nature and specificity of
   metabolic profiles related to gut ecology in obesity. This study focused
   on gut and liver metabolomics of two different mouse strains, the
   C57BL/6J (C57J) and the C57BL/6N (C57N) fed with high-fat diet (HFD) for
   3 weeks, causing diet-induced obesity in C57N, but not in C57J mice.
   Furthermore, a 16S-ribosomal RNA comparative sequence analysis using 454
   pyrosequencing detected significant differences between the microbiome
   of the two strains on phylum level for Firmicutes, Deferribacteres and
   Proteobacteria that propose an essential role of the microbiome in
   obesity susceptibility. Gut microbial and liver metabolomics were
   followed by a combinatory approach using Fourier transform ion cyclotron
   resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) and ultra performance liquid
   chromatography time of tlight MS/MS with subsequent multivariate
   statistical analysis, revealing distinctive host and microbial
   metabolome patterns between the C57J and the C57N strain. Many
   taurine-conjugated bile acids (TBAs) were significantly elevated in the
   cecum and decreased in liver samples from the C57J phenotype likely
   displaying different energy utilization behavior by the bacterial
   community and the host. Furthermore, several metabolite groups could
   specifically be associated with the C57N phenotype involving fatty
   acids, eicosanoids and urobilinoids. The mass differences based
   metabolite network approach enabled to extend the range of known
   metabolites to important bile acids (BAs) and novel taurine conjugates
   specific for both strains. In summary, our study showed clear
   alterations of the metabolome in the gastrointestinal tract and liver
   within a HFD-induced obesity mouse model in relation to the

Abstract = {{Do politically irrelevant events influence important policy opinions?
   Previous research on social welfare attitudes has emphasized the role of
   political factors such as economic self-interest and ideology. Here, we
   demonstrate that attitudes to social welfare are also influenced by
   short-term fluctuations in hunger. Using theories in evolutionary
   psychology, we predict that hungry individuals will be greedier and take
   more resources from others while also attempting to induce others to
   share by signaling cooperative intentions and expressing support for
   sharing, including evolutionarily novel forms of sharing such as social
   welfare. We test these predictions using self-reported hunger data as
   well as comparisons of subjects who participated in relevant online
   studies before and after eating lunch. Across four studies collected in
   two different welfare regimesthe United Kingdom and Denmarkwe
   consistently find that hungry individuals act in a greedier manner but

Title = {{Ecological pharmacodynamics: prey toxin evolution depends on the
   physiological characteristics of predators}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{53-67}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The use of toxic chemical defences to repel and deter predators is
   widespread across living organisms, yet there are surprisingly few
   formal models of toxin evolution. Published models tend to focus on a
   trade-off between individual benefits and costs of toxicity, and treat
   predators as simple agents of selection, reducing future attacks when
   they encounter toxic prey. In this paper we argue, however, that the
   physiological characteristics of predators may be crucial in determining
   the nature and outcomes of toxin evolution. To examine this idea we
   devised and explored a model in which prey defence evolves in the
   context of predator physiology. We represented this as dose-effect
   relationships in predators for nutrition and toxins along with variable
   rates of predator metabolism. Incorporating variables of predator
   physiology can change views of toxin evolution. A key point is that
   inclusion of predator physiological variables requires that the
   nutritional value of prey is explicitly represented in the model, and
   this directly affects predictions for toxin evolution. In our model
   costly toxins generally evolve to the point that they are `minimally
   unprofitable': just toxic enough to make prey typically unprofitable
   given their nutritional value to predators. As the nutritional value of
   prey increases, so the minimally unprofitable toxin level of prey tends
   to increase in step; hence another general prediction from this model is
   that toxin levels within prey should often correlate with the
   nutritional value of the prey. Predator physiology and cognition also
   contribute to variation in the social nature of defence. We argue that
   incorporating representations of predator physiology is important in the
   comprehension of toxin evolution and make suggestions for directions of
   future work. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Phenotypic correlations (r(P)) have frequently been observed between
   physiological and behavioural traits, and the nature of these

   unexplored. We exposed female zebra finches to dietary restriction
   during the nestling stage and tested how this affected rP among a
   variety of physiological traits (haematocrit, stress-induced
   corticosterone level and basal metabolic rate (BMR)) and behavioural
   traits (activity and feeding rates in novel and familiar environments).
   Developmental stress completely uncoupled the relationship between
   activity in a novel environment and two physiological traits:
   haematocrit and BMR. This suggests that nutritionally based
   developmental stress has provoked changes in the energy budget that
   alleviate the trade-off between maintenance (BMR) and locomotor

Title = {{Hunger is the best spice: Effects of starvation in the antennal
   responses of the blood-sucking bug Rhodnius prolixus}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{8-13}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Blood-sucking insects strongly rely on olfactory cues to find their
   vertebrate hosts. As in other insects with different lifestyles, it has
   been shown that endogenous and exogenous factors modulate olfactory
   responses. The triatomine bug Rhodnius prolixus is an important vector
   of Chagas disease and a classical model for studies of physiology and
   behavior. In this species, the behavioral response to host-derived
   odorants is modulated by both the time of the day and the starvation.
   Here I investigated the peripheral neural mechanisms underlying these
   modulatory effects. For this, I measured the electroantennogram (EAG)
   responses of insects towards different concentrations (from 0.5\% to
   75\% vol/vol) of an attractive host-odorant, ammonia. I tested the
   responses of starved and fed animals during the middle of the day (when
   insects are inactive and aggregated in refuges) and at the beginning of
   the night (when insects become active and search for hosts). Regardless
   of the time of the day and the starvation status, EAG responses
   systematically increased with odorant concentration, thus accurately
   reflecting the response of olfactory receptor cells. Interestingly, the
   EAG responses of starved insects were larger than those of fed insects
   only during the night, with larger differences (6-7 times) observed at
   low-middle concentrations. This study is the first reporting modulation
   of sensory responses at the neural level in triatomines. This
   modulation, considering that triatomine hosts are mostly diurnal and are
   also potential predators, has an important adaptive value, ensuring that
   insects search for hosts only when they are hungry and at appropriate
   times. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{161}},
Pages = {{60-74}},

Abstract = {{This study piloted a multiple aspect approach to assess differences or
   changes in equine behaviour, using physiological (heart rates - HR,
   salivary cortisol - SC) and behavioural measures in various routine
   (feed-time, riding, turning out) and test situations (novel situation
   tests NS: 2x reactivity and 2x handling, Cross-over design). In order to
   evaluate if this approach could identify different behavioural patterns,
   two distinct groups of riding school horses (selected by experienced
   equine professionals) were observed repeatedly over 6 weeks: 6
   excitable/nervous horses (EX: Age: mean = 14 +/- 3.4, 8-18 yrs, BW 677
   +/- 48 kg, Body Condition {[}BC] = 4.6 +/- 0.4) and 6 calm, quiet horses
   (CA: Age: mean = 16 +/- 2.5, 12-18 yrs, BW 645 +/- 35, BC 5.1 +/- 0.4).
   EX horses had consistently lower SC levels than CA horses (p < 0.01),
   when coming in from the paddock in the morning. Therefore, there was a
   significant increase of SC after feeding for EX horses (+43\%, p < 0.05)
   but not for Group CA (only 16\%). After feeding SC showed no difference
   between the two groups. Calm horses had significantly higher HRs (44 +/-
   1.2 bpm) while waiting for feed and post feeding (p < 0.01) than EX
   horses (38 +/- 0.7; p < 0.05). Behavioural measures showed significantly
   higher agitation scores for EX horses during feeding, walking to (p <
   0.01) and release into paddock (p < 0.05). When ridden, EX horses showed
   a greater amount of threatening behaviour towards other horses (p <
   0.05) and CA horses showed a significantly greater reluctance to move
   forward (p < 0.05). All mean agitation scores were significantly higher
   for Group EX (EX 2.3, CA 1.8, s.e.m. 0.3; p < 0.01) and apart from feed
   time these showed good correlations with behaviour observations. In the
   NS reactivity test CA horses had a significantly higher HR variability
   than EX horses (CA: 64 +/- 10.5, EX: 41 +/- 3.5, p < 0.05). There was no
   correlation between HRs and SC but in the NS handling test there was a
   correlation between SC and refusals to cross a bridge (p < 0.01; r(s)
   {[}12] = 0.70) as well as SC and agitation score (p = 0.07; r(s) {[}12]
   = 0.54). Horses which displayed a greater level of investigation scored
   lower in agitation behaviours (p < 0.01, r(s) {[}12] = -0.68). The
   methodology applied, clearly and consistently highlighted differences
   between horse groups, although the physiological measures did not always
   follow assumptions. Within groups individual horses reacted differently
   in standardised test and routine situations, highlighting that multiple
   testing will increase the chances of observing subtle changes in
   behaviour or perceived stress. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Because antipredator behaviours are costly, the threat-sensitive
   predator avoidance hypothesis predicts that individual animals should
   express predator-avoidance behaviour proportionally to the perceived
   threat posed by the predator. Here, we experimentally tested this
   hypothesis by providing wild passerine birds supplemental food (on a
   raised feeding platform) at either 1 or 4 m from the edge of forest
   cover (potential refuge), in either the presence or absence of a nearby
   simulated predation threat (a sharp-shinned hawk Accipiter striatus
   model). Compared with the control treatment, we observed proportionally
   fewer bird visits to the food patch, and the birds took longer to
   re-emerge from forest refuge and return to feed at the food patch, after
   the hawk presentation than before it. The observed threat-sensitive
   latency-to-return response was stronger when the food patch was further
   away from the nearest refuge. Overall, our results are consistent with
   the predictions of the threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis in
   that wild passerine birds (primarily black-capped chickadees Poecile
   atricapillus) exhibited more intense antipredator behavioural responses
   with increasing level of apparent threat. The birds were thus sensitive

Abstract = {{Objective: The impact of dietary factors on tinnitus has received
   limited research attention, despite being a considerable concern among
   people with tinnitus and clinicians. The objective was to examine the
   link between dietary factors and presence and severity of tinnitus.
   Design: This study used the UK Biobank resource, a large cross-sectional
   study of adults aged 40-69. 171,722 eligible participants were asked
   questions specific to tinnitus (defined as noises such as ringing or
   buzzing in the head or ears). Dietary factors included portions of fruit
   and vegetables per day, weekly fish consumption (oily and non-oily),
   bread type, cups of caffeinated coffee per day, and avoidance of dairy,
   eggs, wheat and sugar. We controlled for lifestyle, noise exposure,
   hearing, personality and comorbidity factors.
   Results: Persistent tinnitus, defined as present at least a lot of the
   time, was elevated with increased: (i) fruit/vegetable intake (OR=1.01
   per portion/day), (ii) bread (wholemeal/wholegrain, OR=1.07; other
   bread, 1.20) and (iii) dairy avoidance (OR=1.27). Persistent tinnitus
   was reduced with: (i) fish consumption (non-oily, OR=0.91; oily, 0.95),
   (ii) egg avoidance (OR=0.87) and (iii) caffeinated coffee consumption
   (OR=0.99 per cup/day). Reports of ``bothersome'' tinnitus
   (moderate-severe handicap) increased with wholemeal/wholegrain bread
   intake (OR=0.86). Reports of less frequent transient tinnitus increased
   with dairy avoidance (OR=1.18) and decreased with caffeinated coffee
   (OR=0.98 per cup/day) and brown bread (OR=0.94).
   Conclusions: This is the first population study to report the
   association between dietary factors and tinnitus. Although individually
   dietary associations are mostly modest, particular changes in diet, such
   as switching between foodstuffs, may result in stronger associations.
   These findings offer insights into possible dietary associations with
   tinnitus, and this may be useful when discussing management options in
   combination with other lifestyle changes and therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Prematurity and neonatal growth restriction (GR) are risk factors for
   autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Leptin
   production is suppressed during periods of undernutrition, and we have
   shown that isolated neonatal leptin deficiency leads to adult
   hyperactivity while neonatal leptin supplementation normalizes the brain
   morphology of GR mice. We hypothesized that neonatal leptin would
   prevent the development of GR-associated behavioral abnormalities. From
   postnatal day 4-14, C57BL/6 mice were randomized to daily injections of
   saline or leptin (80 ng/g), and GR was identified by a wean-ling weight
   below the tenth percentile. The behavioral phenotypes of GR and control
   mice were assessed beginning at 4 months. Within the tripartite chamber,
   GR mice had significantly impaired social interaction. Baseline escape
   times from the Barnes maze were faster for GR mice (65+/-6 s vs 87+/-7 s
   for controls, p < 0.05), but GR mice exhibited regression in their
   escape times on days 2 and 3 (56\% regressed vs 22\% of control saline
   mice, p < 0.05). Compared to controls, GR mice entered the open arms of
   the elevated plus maze more often and stayed there longer (72+/-10 s vs
   36+/-5 s, p < 0.01). Neonatal leptin supplementation normalized the
   behavior of GR mice across all behavioral assays. In conclusion, GR
   alters the social interactions, learning and activity of mice, and
   supplementation with the neurotrophic hormone leptin mitigates these
   effects. We speculate neonatal leptin deficiency may contribute to the
   adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with postnatal growth
   restriction, and postnatal leptin therapy may be protective. (C) 2014

Title = {{Reducing occupational stress with a B-vitamin focussed intervention: a
   randomized clinical trial: study protocol}},
Journal = {{NUTRITION JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Workplace stress in Australia and other western countries
   has been steadily increasing over the past decade. It can be observed
   not only in terms of increased compensation claims but also costs due to
   absenteeism, loss of productivity at work and reduced psychological and
   physiological health and well-being. Given the cost and pervasive
   effects of stress in the modern workforce, time efficient and
   cost-effective interventions capable of reducing occupational stress (or
   strain) and burnout are urgently required for the improved well-being of
   stressed employees. One intervention gaining scientific traction is
   supplementation with nutritional interventions, particularly the B group
   vitamins.
   Methods: This study was developed to examine the effects of B group
   vitamins on workplace stress and mood variables with a sample of
   full-time employed older adults who subjectively report feeling
   stressed. The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
   parallel-groups clinical trial where 200 (N = 100/group) participants
   will be randomized to receive Blackmores (R) Executive B Stress Formula
   or placebo daily for a period of 6 months. Participants will be tested
   at baseline and 6 months post-randomization on workplace stress,
   cognitive, personality and mood measures, cardiovascular (brachial and
   aortic systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as arterial
   stiffness), biochemical (assays to measure inflammation and safety) as
   well as genetic assessments (to assess stress processing) and
   neuroimaging measures (to investigate in vivo mechanisms of action of B
   vitamins). In addition to this pre- and post-supplementation testing,
   participants will also complete a battery of self-report questionnaires
   online to assess their stress and mood once a month for the duration of
   the study. The primary aim of the study is to investigate the effects of
   B vitamin supplementation on work related stress. The secondary aims are
   to explore the mechanisms underpinning any changes in mood or workplace
   stress due to the B vitamin intervention by examining relationships
   between cognitive, biological, neuroimaging and cardiovascular variables
   over 6 months. A subset of 40 participants (N = 20/group) will undergo
   neuroimaging at baseline and at 6 months using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in
   order to further explore in vivo mechanisms of action of B vitamins.}},

Volume = {{743}},

Abstract = {{Animals must balance the conflicting needs to forage and avoid
   predation. The optimal balance of risk and reward should depend on the
   individual's state, particularly hunger status. Satiated individuals are
   hypothesized to react more strongly to risk than hungry individuals, for
   which the necessity for food overrides perceived danger. We tested this
   in wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) tadpoles by comparing the response
   of fasted and fed tadpoles to injured conspecifics (alarm cue) and
   uninjured conspecifics (control). Food restriction significantly
   affected the activity levels of tadpoles and the impact of injured
   conspecific cues on activity. Fed tadpoles responded little to these
   cues, tending to decrease activity. Hungry tadpoles were more active
   overall and responded to injured conspecific cues by increasing
   activity. We propose that hungry tadpoles increase their activity in
   response to an injured conspecific because, in addition to indicating
   danger, this cue represents a nutrient source for this opportunistically
   cannibalistic species, and hungry tadpoles should thus adopt risky
   behavior to acquire this valuable resource. Differences in hunger may
   therefore explain variation among studies of tadpole responses to
   injured conspecifics. Future studies in aquatic organisms should
   consider the role of hunger status when assessing antipredator behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Public bicycle system is considered as an essential part of the public
   transport system in large and medium cities owing to its zero emissions

   relationship between individual's behavioral intention of using public
   bicycle and its influencing factors. A set of questionnaires was
   designed and 202 citizens in Wuhan were interviewed in order to collect
   the required data for empirical study purpose. The study results
   indicate that the behavioral intention of using public bicycle is
   influenced not only by the satisfaction towards biking environments and
   the perceived degree of security and risks, the attitude towards public
   bicycle and social personality also plays an important role. For
   inspiring an individual's willingness to using public bicycle, improving
   the quality of biking environments is a short cut for encouraging people
   to using public bicycle. The long-term approach for promoting green
   transportation is to nourish the right attitude toward public bicycle,
   and thus promote the development of public transportation system.}},

Abstract = {{Species abundances and distributions are inherently tied to individuals'
   decisions about movement within their habitat. Therefore, integrating
   individual phenotypic variation within a larger ecological framework may
   provide better insight into how populations structure themselves. Recent
   evidence for consistent individual differences in behaviour prompts the
   hypothesis that variation in behavioural types might be related to
   variation in movement in natural environments. In a multiyear
   mark-recapture study, we found that individual sticklebacks exhibited
   consistent individual differences in behaviour both within a
   standardized testing arena designed to measure exploratory behaviour and
   within a river. Therefore, we asked whether individual differences in
   movement in a natural river were related to an individual's exploratory
   behavioural type. We also considered whether body condition and/or the
   individual's habitat or social environment use was related to movement.
   There was no evidence that an individual's exploratory behavioural type
   was related to movement within the river. Instead, an individual's
   habitat use and body condition interacted to influence natural movement
   patterns. Individuals in good condition were more likely to move further
   in the river, but only if they inhabited a vegetated complex part of the
   river; body condition had no influence on movement in those individuals
   inhabiting open areas of the river. Our results suggest that individual
   traits could help improve predictions about how populations may
   distribute themselves within patchy and complex environments.}},

Abstract = {{Background: It is usual to attribute to adolescence the physical,
   psychological, cognitive and sociocultural transformations that
   contribute to the formation of personality, and that expose adolescents
   to new life contexts that lead to acquiring behaviours, habits and
   lifestyle which are determinants of their health in adulthood. On the
   other hand, in the school environment, it is recommended that the
   youngsters study and achieve academic performance.
   Objectives: Our aim is to identify factors associated with adolescents'
   academic performance, including socio-demographic, school and academic
   context variables, to analyse the influence that the lifestyles
   (physical activity, tobacco, drug and alcohol consumption, nutrition
   habits, leisure activities, hygiene and health promotion habits, risk
   and road safety behaviour, sleep and rest habits) may have in predicting
   adolescents' quality of academic performance and to analyse the
   relationship these variables establish among themselves.
   Participants and Methods: A quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive,
   correlational, explanatory, and retrospective study. The survey, through
   a directly administered questionnaire, and academic performance scale
   (Fermin, 2005) instruments were selected for the data collection. A
   non-probability convenience sample consisting of 380 adolescents
   attending the 7th, 8th and 9th years in the 2011/2012academic year, from
   a 2nd {[}up to the 6th year] and 3rd {[}up to the 9th year] cycle school
   in Viseu, Portugal was used.
   Results: Girls, younger students, those living in rural areas, those
   with a higher socioeconomic status, those who have a parent with
   secondary or higher education are classified as better students. They
   are also the adolescents with fewer years of education, those who have
   never failed, those living closest to the school, spending less time
   travelling to school, and achieving the best academic performance. Those
   who also collaborate in household activities, participate in
   sports/physical activity, do not smoke, do not drink, do not do drugs,
   do not consume stimulant drinks, have fit and healthy meals, spend less
   time per day on the computer, interactive games and TV, go out with
   friends moderately, usually have good quality sleep, sleep more, watch
   videos, study, read, and do not use the computer before going to sleep
   also achieve better school performance.
   Conclusion: School performance was associated with socio-demographic,
   school and academic contextual variables, as well as lifestyle and sleep
   habits. It is therefore concluded that young people's behaviour is
   crucial both to maintain a healthy life, as reflected in cognitive
   development, concentration skills, memory, reasoning, communication,
   interaction, attitudes and values with direct implications on school
   performance, and for overall adolescent well-being.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Anorexia nervosa and eating disorder not otherwise
   specified{*} (not fulfilling Anorexia Nervosa DSM IV criteria) are
   increasing in Singapore. Patients with eating disorders may also present
   with other psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. The
   paper aims to investigate the association of co-morbid psychiatric
   disorders with the improvement of body mass index (BMI) in these
   patients.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis of 182 patients with anorexia
   and eating disorder not otherwise specified at a tertiary hospital was
   done. The clinical course of co-morbid psychiatric disorders was
   correlated with the improvement of body mass index.
   Results: 109 patients were included in the analysis and the mean BMI on
   resolution of co-morbid psychiatric disorders was BMI 16.9. There is a
   significant association between the BMI groups and the resolution of
   co-morbid psychiatric disorders, chi(2) = 10.2, p = .03. Patients in BMI
   group 5 (BMI 16.6-18.5) were noted to be significantly less likely to

   Conclusion: Patients with anorexia nervosa and eating disorders not
   otherwise specified were at increased risk of having co-morbid
   psychiatric disorders and the clinical course of co-morbid psychiatric

Abstract = {{Throughout the Hunger Games trilogy, the residents of the Capitol are
   associated with an array of physical, behavioral, and sartorial traits
   that have stereotypically been associated with homosexuality in general

   explicitly identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or
   queer/questioning (LGBTQ), they are routinely linked with queer forms of
   feyness, fussiness, and flamboyance. How are young adult readers to
   interpret these details? What social message or political stance is
   Suzanne Collins conveying by making some of the vainest, powerful, and
   heartless characters in her book also in dialogue with common
   conceptions about queerness? Does The Hunger Games include these
   elements to dismantle negative stereotypes about LGBTQ people, or does
   the book perpetuate and even affirm homophobic attitudes? In what ways
   do these details impact the presentation of Katniss, in many ways, as a
   genderqueer figure herself? In exploring these and other questions, I
   draw on Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's notion of ``paranoid reading.{''} While
   Sedgwick's concept of paranoid reading is intended to address LGBTQ
   content exclusively, I make a case that it is also a productive lens for
   examining the Hunger Games trilogy as a whole. Using the portrayal of
   the Capitol residents as an entry point for the trilogy's engagement
   with nonheteronormative gender and sexuality, I examine how the series
   serves both to reinforce and to resist homophobia. In so doing, I
   demonstrate the risks as well as the rewards of finding what we fear
   seeing in any work of dystopian young adult (YA) fiction.}},

   opportunities to kindle a fire in the open, because it could see the
   enemy. It was felt particularly sharply in early spring, when insurgents

   It should be noted that life in kryyivtsi had strict regulations: Time

Abstract = {{Limited Editions are a widely used type of line extensions. An
   exceptional, limited available variant is added to the permanent product
   line offers. Whereas Limited Editions look back on a long tradition in
   high involvement categories, recently, they have been increasingly used
   in Fast-Moving-Consumer-Goods (FMCG) categories. For example, in the
   U.S. food and beverage sector the number of yearly Limited Edition
   launches increased from 2001 to 2004 by 87\% (Banasiak 2005). In spite
   of their high practical relevance, no scientific discussion about the
   effects of Limited Editions on the consumers exists. Some authors have
   proposed possible effects, like positive feedback effect on parent
   brands, but their theoretical foundation and empirical discussion is
   lacking. The objective of this study was to theoretically explain and
   empirically test the essential variables and their interrelations
   characterizing the consumers' evaluation of Limited Editions.
   There are two different approaches which can be used to explain the
   evaluation of Limited Editions. On the one hand, personality traits like
   exploration tendency can moderate the evaluation. Exploration tendency
   helps to regulate arousal and result from the motivation for stimulation
   seeking (Raju 1980). It was supposed that two different optimal
   stimulation levels exist (Hebb 1955; Maier, Vickers and Inman 2007).
   Exploration seekers show a high optimum, they search more likely for
   stimulation than exploration avoiders, who are characterised by a lower
   optimum level and a preference for familiar stimuli (Baumgartner and
   Steenkamp 1996). On the other hand, limited availability of a product
   produces a scarcity effect. This effect refers to a powerful persuasion
   principle. Because valuable objects are often scarce, consumers tend to
   perceive scarce objects as more attractive (Cialdini, 1993). There is a
   controversy between different psychological approaches to explain
   scarcity effects regarding the question whether scarcity can take effect
   automatically, without a deep elaboration, or a deeper processing is
   necessary (Lynn, 1992; Cialdini, 1993). Categorization theory
   considerations provide conclusions about reciprocal effects of limited
   editions towards the parent brand. This process includes the
   identification of an object as a member of an object class based on
   similarities (Rosch and Mervis 1975). Assimilation effects occur if a
   product is successfully identified as a member of a brand's category
   (Fiske and Neuberg 1990). Characteristics of the product become an
   integral part of the brand's mental representation and lead to brand's
   image change (Loken and Roedder John 1993).
   A series of three experiments was carried out to examine the following
   research questions: (1) In what way does the effect of product
   limitation, which is characteristic for Limited Editions, depend on the
   exploration tendency of the consumers? (2) In what way does the depth of
   processing influence the effect of a Limited Edition? (3) What kind of
   reciprocal effects on the parent brand launching a Limited Edition are
   expected? Three experiments were conducted in form of standardized
   interviews with a total of 511 subjects. They were exposed to product
   boards from the categories deep-frozen pizza, ice cream and biscuits.
   The evaluation of collected data took place through analyses of
   variance. Our experimental results give a deeper insight into the
   question how Limited Editions work in FMCG context. We have found that
   the effect of a product limitation is substantially moderated by the
   level of exploration seeking. For FMCG, consumers use a ``scarce =
   novel{''} heuristic. Customers deduce the unique character of the
   product from its limited availability. However, the reinforcing effect
   of limitation on product attitude and trial interest arises only in case
   of exploration seekers, which are characterized by a pronounced need for
   stimulation through exceptional products. Further, the results confirmed
   the relevance of cognitive effort for the scarcity effect to take place
   in FMCG context. Only in case of deeper processing a limitation label
   led to a more positive attitude towards the product and trial interest.
   Moreover, reciprocal effects of a Limited Edition launch on the parent
   brand could be observed. Assimilation between Limited Edition and parent
   brand was evident. Launching a Limited Edition heightens the perceived
   creativity of the parent brand, independent of brand strength. A
   positive effect on the brand attitude was found only for a weak parent
   brand.
   Several practical implications can be drawn. Before a company decides to
   use this strategy, exploration tendency of the target group should be
   examined. Furthermore, our results underline the impact of limited
   availability. To achieve a scarcity effect, consumers should recognize
   the limitation. Additionally, a deeper consideration of a Limited
   Edition by consumers positively impacts the evaluation. During and after
   launch, in-store merchandising can be carried out which help to attract
   consumers' attention. Finally, it has been found that the parent brand
   can profit from the reciprocal effects of a Limited Edition. This is an
   effective strategy for brands which aim to increase the perceived brand
   creativity.}},

Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{109-121}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Vigilance in prey species can serve many purposes, including predator
   detection and monitoring other group members, and is generally thought
   to impose a cost due to reduced food intake. However, previous studies
   have shown that herbivores are able to reduce the foraging cost of
   vigilance by chewing their food during vigilance bouts ('vigilance with
   chewing', as compared to `vigilance without chewing'). How predation
   risk, food availability and competition affect both the functions and
   the foraging costs of vigilance remains an open question. We studied
   female eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, during winter and
   summer, when available food supplies were poor and rich, respectively,
   to investigate how group size, distance to cover, proximity between
   foragers and food patch quality affected decisions of foraging female
   kangaroos to exhibit antipredator or social vigilance, distinguishing
   vigilance with and without chewing. The use of antipredator vigilance
   was mainly driven by the perception of predation risk, and antipredator
   vigilance without chewing decreased with increased group size whereas
   antipredator vigilance with chewing increased nonlinearly with group
   size in winter. Distance to cover affected both forms of antipredator
   vigilance in summer only but there was no effect of nearest-neighbour
   distance. Social vigilance was affected positively by group size, and
   distance between foragers affected social vigilance without chewing
   positively, particularly in winter, and social vigilance with chewing
   negatively. Finally, patch quality increased the use of social vigilance
   with chewing in both seasons and decreased the use of antipredator
   vigilance with chewing in winter. This study provides new information on
   how animals make decisions about the functions and foraging costs of
   vigilance and allows a better understanding of how social foragers
   respond to an ever-changing environment. (C) 2014 The Association for

Abstract = {{Tadpoles of Sphaerotheca breviceps detect food and predators using
   waterborne chemical cues (odours), which evoke appropriate behaviour.
   The present study aimed to determine whether they are capable of
   resolving the conflict between foraging choice and predator avoidance on
   encountering both food and predatory chemical cues together. Experiments
   were designed using an association choice apparatus in which prey
   tadpoles were given a choice to move themselves close to or away from a
   given stimulus (food or a predator). Food odours were either strong or
   weak. Tadpoles of Hoplobatrachus tigerinus (n = 4) were placed in an
   open-ended mesh cage wrapped in a cheese cloth that provided predator
   cues. The time spent by the test tadpoles in the predator's zone or away
   from it and the time spent feeding were recorded for 10 min (n = 25
   trials). When food odours were weak, the prey tadpoles avoided predators
   and spent significantly more time in the predator-free zone. In
   contrast, when food odours were strong, they foraged equally in the two
   zones of the test apparatus regardless of the presence or absence of
   predators. These findings confirm the inherent ability of S. breviceps
   tadpoles to distinguish between food and predators, and indicate that
   strong food odours mask predation risk. We suggest that foraging theory
   and the predation risk allocation hypothesis should include factors that
   mislead prey during predation risk assessment and the evocation of
   defence behaviours.}},

Abstract = {{Intuitive eating is an adaptive dietary behavior that emphasizes eating
   in response to physiological hunger and satiety cues. The Intuitive
   Eating Scale-2 (IES-2) measures such attitudes and behaviors. The aim of
   the present study was to adapt the IES-2 to the French context and to
   test its psychometric properties in 335 women and 297 men participating
   in the NutriNet-Sante study. We evaluated the construct validity of the
   IES-2 by testing hypotheses with regard to its factor structure,
   relationships with scores of the revised 21-item Three Factor Eating
   Questionnaire and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale,
   and differences between ``a priori{''} relevant subgroups. First, the
   exploratory factor analysis revealed three main dimensions: Eating for
   Physical Rather than Emotional Reasons, Reliance on Hunger and Satiety
   Cues, and Unconditional Permission to Eat. Second-order confirmatory
   factor analysis upheld the 3-factor solution influenced by a broader
   intuitive eating dimension. IES-2 total score was negatively related to
   cognitive restraint (r = -031, P < 0.0001), emotional eating (r =-0.58,
   P < 0.0001), uncontrolled eating (r = -0.40, P < 0.0001), and depressive
   symptoms (r = -0.20, P <0.0001). IES-2 subscales showed similar
   correlations. Women had lower scores than did men for the IES-2 total
   scale (3.3 in women vs. 3.5 in men, P < 0.0001), Eating for Physical
   Reasons, and Unconditional Permission to Eat subscales. Current or
   former dieters had lower scores on the IES-2 total scale and on all
   subscales than did those who had never dieted (all P < 0.01). Finally,
   results showed satisfactory reliability for the IES-2 total scores
   (internal consistency = 0.85 and test-retest reliability = 0.79 over a
   mean 8-week period) and for its subscales. Thus, the French IES-2 can be
   considered a useful instrument for assessing adult intuitive eating
   behaviors in empirical and epidemiological studies in the general

   reproduction were linked to level and intra-individual variability (IIV)
   of fecal cortisol metabolites over a 5-month period. Our analyses
   revealed that female cortisol levels decreased during gestation and
   lactation compared with non-reproductive females. We also found that
   slower exploring females and females with a smaller litter displayed
   higher IIV in fecal cortisol metabolites. For males, fecal cortisol
   metabolites level during the mating season increased with the number of

Abstract = {{Life-history trade-offs are considered a major driving force in the
   emergence of consistent behavioural differences (personality variation);
   but empirical tests are scarce. We investigated links between a
   personality trait (escape response), life-history and state variables
   (growth rate, size and age at first reproduction, age-dependent
   reproductive rates, lifetime reproductive success, life span) in red and
   green colour morphs of clonal pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Escape
   response (dropping/non-dropping off a plant upon a predatory attack) was
   measured repeatedly to classify individuals as consistent droppers,
   consistent nondroppers or inconsistents. Red morphs experienced stronger
   trade-offs between early reproduction and life span than green morphs;
   and red consistent (non)droppers had highest lifetime reproductive
   success. Red droppers followed a risk-averse life-history strategy (high
   late reproduction), red nondroppers a risk-prone strategy (high early
   reproduction), while reproductive rates were equivalent for all green
   behavioural types and red inconsistents. This suggests that red morphs
   suffer the highest costs of dropping (they are most conspicuous to
   predators), which equivalates' fitness payoffs to both risk-takers (red
   non-droppers) and risk-averse red droppers. The strong trade-off also
   means that committing to a particular lifestyle (being consistent)
   maximises fitness. Our study suggests that life-history trade-offs
   likely mediate personality variation but effects might depend on
   interactions with other organismal characteristics (here: colour morph).}},

Abstract = {{A trophic niche shift can occur as an adaptive response to environmental
   change such as altered resource quality, abundance or composition.
   Alterations in digestive traits such as gut morphology and physiology
   may enable these niche shifts and affect the persistence of populations
   and species. Relatively few studies, however, have assessed how niche
   shifts influence suites of digestive traits through phenotypic
   plasticity and evolutionary mechanisms, and how these trait changes can
   subsequently alter the nutrition, fitness and life history of organisms.
   We investigated how population divergence and plasticity alter the gut
   physiology of wild Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), assessing
   whether variation in digestive traits correspond with enhanced nutrient
   assimilation under a pronounced dietary shift. We examined gut enzyme
   activity, and gut size and mass of wild guppies from both high-predation
   (HP) and low-predation (LP) habitats when reared in the laboratory and
   fed on high- or low-quality diets designed to reflect their dietary
   differences previously found in nature. After 10 weeks on the
   experimental diets, HP guppies maintained shorter and lighter guts than
   LP guppies on either diet. Guppies also differed in their digestive
   enzymatic profiles, more often reflecting nutrient balancing so that
   increased enzyme expression tended to correspond with more deficient
   nutrients in the diet. LP guppies had increased somatic phosphorus at
   the end of the experiment, possibly related to the higher alkaline
   phosphatase activity in their guts. Our results suggest that differences
   in gut physiology exist among populations of Trinidadian guppies that
   may reflect local adaptation to their disparate environments.}},

Abstract = {{Predators attack and plants defend, so herbivores face the dilemma of
   how to eat enough without being eaten. But do differences in the

   explored the ecological impact of personality in a generalist herbivore,
   the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). After quantifying
   personality traits in wild individuals brought temporarily into
   captivity, we tested how these traits altered foraging by individuals
   when free-ranging in their natural habitat. To measure their responses
   to the dual costs of predation risk and plant toxin, we varied the toxin
   concentration of food in safe foraging patches against paired, non-toxic
   risky patches, and used a novel synthesis of a manipulative
   Giving-Up-Density (GUD) experiment and video behavioural analysis. At
   the population level, the cost of safe patches pivoted around that of
   risky patches depending on food toxin concentration. At the individual
   level, boldness affected foraging at risky high-quality food patches (as
   behavioural differences between bold and shy), and at safe patches only
   when food toxin concentration was low (as differences in foraging
   outcome). Our results ecologically validate the personality trait of
   boldness, in brushtail possums. They also reveal, for the first time, a
   nuanced link between personality and the way in which individuals
   balance the costs of food and fear. Importantly, they suggest that high
   plant defence effectively attenuates differences in foraging behaviour
   arising from variation in personality, but poorly defended plants in
   safe areas should be differentially subject to herbivory depending on
   the personality of the herbivore.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions with environmental parameters may alter the ecotoxicity of

   effects of nanoparticulate titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2) towards Gammarus
   fossarum, considering nano-TiO2's photocatalytic properties at ambient
   UV-intensities. Gammarids' habitat selection was investigated using its
   feeding preference on leaf discs either exposed to or protected from
   UV-irradiation in presence of nano-TiO2 as proxy (n = 49).
   UV-irradiation alone induced a significant preference for UV-protected
   habitats, which was more pronounced in simultaneous presence of
   nano-TiO2. This behaviour may be mainly explained by the UV-induced
   formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by nano-TiO2. Besides their
   direct toxicity, ROS may have lowered the leaf-quality in UV-exposed
   areas contributing (approximately 30\%) to the observed behavioural
   pattern. Since the predicted no effect concentration of nano-TiO2 in
   combination with UVirradiation falls below the predicted environmental
   concentration this study underpins the importance of considering
   environmental parameters during the risk assessment of nanoparticles.

Abstract = {{Nearly all Americans (97\%) report eating candy at least once per year;
   yet, on a given day, only approximately one-fourth of the US population
   aged >= 2 y consumes candy. Among all Americans, candy contributes a
   relatively small proportion of calories, added sugars, and saturated fat
   to the total diet, and recent research suggests that current levels of
   candy consumption are not associated with risk of weight gain and
   cardiovascular disease in children and adults. Providing guidance for
   the consumption of candy in moderation requires an understanding of
   various behavioral health-related factors that influence candy
   consumption. A roundtable of behavioral nutrition experts, researchers,
   and nutrition educators met to discuss recent data on intakes of candy,
   health outcomes associated with usual candy intake, and the impact of
   behavioral strategies, including restriction, education, and
   environmental awareness, on modifying eating behaviors to achieve
   moderate intakes of candy. Restricting access to palatable foods,
   whether self-imposed or by parental control, may have potentially
   negative consequences. Techniques and insight into how to adopt
   ``moderation{''} in candy consumption, from effective parental practices
   to environmental strategies that facilitate behavior change without a

   nutrition that is characterized by a restrictive diet, ritualized
   patterns of eating, and rigid avoidance of foods believed to be
   unhealthy or impure. Although prompted by a desire to achieve optimum
   health, orthorexia may lead to nutritional deficiencies, medical
   complications, and poor quality of life. Despite its being a distinct
   behavioral pattern that is frequently observed by clinicians, orthorexia
   has received very little empirical attention and is not yet formally
   recognized as a psychiatric disorder. In this review, we synthesize
   existing research to identify what is known about the symptoms,
   prevalence, neuropsychological profile, and treatment of orthorexia. An
   examination of diagnostic boundaries reveals important points of symptom
   overlap between orthorexia and anorexia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive
   disorder (OCD), obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD),
   somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, and psychotic
   spectrum disorders. Neuropsychological data suggest that orthorexic
   symptoms are independently associated with key facets of executive
   dysfunction for which some of these conditions already overlap.
   Discussion of cognitive weaknesses in set-shifting, external attention,
   and working memory highlights the value of continued research to
   identify intermediate, transdiagnostic endophenotypes for insight into
   the neuropathogenesis of orthorexia. An evaluation of current orthorexia
   measures indicates a need for further psychometric development to ensure
   that subsequent research has access to reliable and valid assessment
   tools. Optimized assessment will not only permit a clearer understanding
   of prevalence rates, psychosocial risk factors, and comorbid
   psychopathology but will also be needed to index intervention
   effectiveness. Though the field lacks data on therapeutic outcomes,
   current best practices suggest that orthorexia can successfully be
   treated with a combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy,
   psychoeducation, and medication.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Overweight and obesity are serious public health problem,
   which is specially among children populations.
   Objective: To determine the effectiveness of educational interventions
   conducted in Latino America for the prevention of overweight and obesity
   in scholar children from 6 to 17 years old.
   Metodology: MEDLINE, LILACS and EMBASE were searched between february
   and may 2014 to retrieve randomized controlled trials and longitudinal
   studies that evaluated the effects of educational interventions intended
   to retrieve randomized controlled trials and longitudinal studies aiming
   to prevent overweight and obesity among Latinoamerican children. Risk of
   bias was evaluated using the PEDro scale and the CASPe tool.
   Results: Twenty one studies were included (n=12,092). Different types of
   educational interventions were identified, such as nutritional
   campaigns, physical activity practice and environmental changes. Mixed
   approaches combining nutritional campaigns, physical activity promotion
   and enviromental changes were the most effective interventions, since
   their results produced the largest improvements in the overweight and
   obesity of children. None evidence of reporting bias was observed.
   Conclusion: Educational interventions performed in the educational
   environment that combined an adequate nutrition and the promotion of
   physical activity practice, are more effective for preventing overweight
   and obesity in Latino American children, although familiar interventions
   are also encouraged approach, associated with better responses on the
   behavioral change in scholar children.}},

Abstract = {{Periconceptional environment may influence embryo development,
   ultimately affecting adult health. Here, we review the rodent model of
   maternal low-protein diet specifically during the preimplantation period
   (Emb-LPD) with normal nutrition during subsequent gestation and
   postnatally. This model, studied mainly in the mouse, leads to
   cardiovascular, metabolic and behavioural disease in adult offspring,
   with females more susceptible. We evaluate the sequence of events from
   diet administration that may lead to adult disease. Emb-LPD changes
   maternal serum and/or uterine fluid metabolite composition, notably with
   reduced insulin and branched-chain amino acids. This is sensed by
   blastocysts through reduced mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1
   signalling. Embryos respond by permanently changing the pattern of
   development of their extra-embryonic lineages, trophectoderm and
   primitive endoderm, to enhance maternal nutrient retrieval during
   subsequent gestation. These compensatory changes include stimulation in
   proliferation, endocytosis and cellular motility, and epigenetic
   mechanisms underlying them are being identified. Collectively, these
   responses act to protect fetal growth and likely contribute to offspring
   competitive fitness. However, the resulting growth adversely affects
   long-term health because perinatal weight positively correlates with
   adult disease risk. We argue that periconception environmental responses
   reflect developmental plasticity and `decisions' made by embryos to
   optimise their own development, but with lasting consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: In Portugal, there are no representative data on how many
   people are actively trying to control their weight and which strategies
   and motives underlie those attempts. The aim of this study was to
   estimate the prevalence of weight loss/maintenance attempts and to
   identify the associated behavioral strategies and motives, in a
   representative sample of Portuguese adults.
   Material and Methods: Cross-sectional study with a sample of 1098
   Portuguese adults. Sociodemographic information, anthropometric data and
   weight loss/maintenance strategies and motives were assessed by
   telephone interview.
   Results: About 44\% of Portuguese adults (53\% women and 35\% men) are
   actively trying to control their weight. About 22\% of women with normal
   weight are trying to lose weight while 53\% of men and 34\% of women
   with excess weight are not trying to manage their weight. About 49\% of
   men with higher educational level are trying to control their weight,
   which compares to 32\% among the least educated men. The most frequently
   used strategy to manage weight is regular vegetable consumption and the
   motives most frequently reported were improving health/preventing
   diseases and improving wellbeing.
   Discussion and Conclusion: More than half of Portuguese women and about
   one-third of men are actively trying to control their weight, using
   behavioral strategies which are generally consistent with public health
   recommendations. The predominant motives are related to improving health
   and wellbeing. This study contributes to understanding weight management
   in Portugal, and could be useful in the development of obesity
   prevention strategies that match the population profile.}},

   the main factor determining the investment in high quality vigilance
   behaviour. Age-sex class-specific responses were not related to age-sex
   class specific lethality risk presented by African wild dogs. For
   impala, regardless of predation risk, age seemed to have some effect on
   the investment in high quality vigilance with sub-adult impala spending
   more time high quality vigilant than adult impala, which is possibly why
   African wild dogs predominantly preyed upon adult impala.}},

Abstract = {{Climatic events affect the behaviour and ecology of many mammal species

   snowfall events in a grassland ecosystem in the southern South Island of
   New Zealand during winter of 2011. Global positioning system collars

   One hundred percent minimum convex polygon areas decreased by 37\% on
   average, and 95\% and 50\% kernel density contour ranges decreased by
   34\% and 36\%, respectively. Two to three possums (depending on the
   snowfall event) actually increased their movements during snow cover. No
   dramatic changes in habitat use were observed during the study but rock
   habitats were used slightly more often during snow periods, probably

Pages = {{202-208}},
Abstract = {{Background/Aims: Telomere biology plays a fundamental role in genomic
   integrity and cell physiology. The newborn setting of telomere length
   (TL) likely has important implications for telomere dynamics over the
   lifespan; however, its determinants are poorly understood. Folate is
   essential for DNA integrity. The maternal compartment is the only source
   of folate for the developing fetus. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis
   that variation in maternal folate during pregnancy is associated with
   newborn TL. Methods: A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted in
   119 mother-newborn dyads. Eligible mothers were enrolled at 9.5 (SD +/-
   2.1) weeks gestation and followed through birth. Concentrations of
   maternal serum folate were measured in the first trimester of pregnancy.
   Newborn telomere length was measured in cord blood mononuclear cells
   (CBMC). Results: After accounting for the effects of other established
   determinants of newborn TL, each 10 ng/ml increase in maternal total
   folate was associated with a 5.8\% increase in median TL (p = 0.03). The
   median TL in newborns of mother in the lowest quartile of total folate
   levels was approximately 10\% shorter than that of newborns of mothers
   in the highest folate quartile. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that
   fetal TL exhibits developmental plasticity, and provide evidence that
   maternal nutrition may exert a `programming' effect on this system. (C)

   completed by 461 women and 219 men treated with intensive integrative
   psychotherapy with predominance of psychodynamic approach in the day
   hospital due to neurotic, behavioral and personality disorders between
   2005-2013. Percentages of patients reporting SI initially and at the end
   of the treatment were 29.1\% and 10.2\% respectively in women and 36.5\%

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Translate the Patient-centered Assessment and Counseling for
   Exercise questionnaire, adapt it cross-culturally and identify the
   psychometric properties of the psychosocial scales for physical activity
   in young university students.
   METHODS: The Patient-centered Assessment and Counseling for Exercise
   questionnaire is made up of 39 items divided into constructs based on
   the social cognitive theory and the transtheoretical model. The analyzed
   constructs were, as follows: behavior change strategy (15 items),
   decision-making process (10), self-efficacy (6), support from family
   (4), and support from friends (4). The validation procedures were
   conceptual, semantic, operational, and functional equivalences, in
   addition to the equivalence of the items and of measurements. The
   conceptual, of items and semantic equivalences were performed by a
   specialized committee. During measurement equivalence, the instrument
   was applied to 717 university students. Exploratory factor analysis was
   used to verify the loading of each item, explained variance and internal
   consistency of the constructs. Reproducibility was measured by means of
   intraclass correlation coefficient.
   RESULTS: The two translations were equivalent and back-translation was
   similar to the original version, with few adaptations. The layout,
   presentation order of the constructs and items from the original version
   were kept in the same form as the original instrument. The sample size
   was adequate and was evaluated by the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test, with
   values between 0.72 and 0.91. The correlation matrix of the items
   presented r < 0.8 (p < 0.05). The factor loadings of the items from all
   the constructs were satisfactory (> 0.40), varying between 0.43 and
   0.80, which explained between 45.4\% and 59.0\% of the variance.
   Internal consistency was satisfactory (alpha >= 0.70), with support from
   friends being 0.70 and 0.92 for self-efficacy. Most items (74.3\%)
   presented values above 0.70 for the reproducibility test.
   CONCLUSIONS: The validation process steps were considered satisfactory
   and adequate for applying to the population.}},

Title = {{Building school connectedness through shared lunches}},
Journal = {{HEALTH EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{554-569}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - School connectedness is a well-established protective factor
   for young people's physical, mental, and social health. The purpose of
   this paper is to explore the promotion of school connectedness through
   the practice of shared lunches within a secondary school context in New
   Zealand.
   Design/methodology/approach - An ethnographic methodology was used to
   explore in-depth the mechanisms by which food practices included
   indicators of school connectedness, and used interviews and observations
   with teachers and 16-18-year-old students in a New Zealand secondary
   school.
   Findings - The results describe six key mechanisms by which shared
   lunches fostered school connectedness: showing common humanity, creating
   an informal setting, encouraging sharing, enabling inclusive
   participation, demonstrating sacrifice for the communal good, and
   facilitating experiences of diversity. These mechanisms contributed to
   increased social interactions in which people got to know each other
   better and were able to gain insight into others' personalities. This
   allowed for opportunities to establish and strengthen social
   relationships, and contributed to indicators of connectedness.
   Research limitations/implications - The study is exploratory with
   findings reported from one school. Further research in other contexts on
   the value of shared lunches for building school connectedness is
   required.
   Originality/value - Shared lunches, as part of an overall strategy to
   develop a well-connected school community, are adaptable and can fit
   into a multitude of situations to meet different needs. The findings of
   this study contribute to understanding the mechanisms by which shared
   lunches can affect indicators of school connectedness.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{518-533}},
Abstract = {{African-American women experience disproportionately higher rates of
   obesity than do Caucasian women. The stress African-American women
   encounter from experiences of discrimination may influence their eating
   behaviours, which could contribute to weight gain. Emotional eating
   theory suggests some people increase their intake of high-calorie foods
   to cope with stressful experiences. We investigated the effects of
   social exclusion by other African-American women or by Caucasian women
   for African-American women's distress and food consumption using a
   laboratory paradigm. As hypothesised, there were main effects of
   ostracism and interactions between ostracism and race, although not all
   of the interactions took the expected form. As hypothesised,
   African-American women ate more potato crisps after being excluded by
   Caucasians than by African-Americans. Unexpectedly, African-American
   women who were excluded by other African-American women self-reported
   more emotional distress than did African-American women excluded by
   Caucasian women. These findings suggest that ostracism by both in-group
   and out-group members are disturbing, although people may respond to
   in-group and out-group exclusion in different ways. Directions for
   future research are suggested that could elucidate the circumstances
   under which different emotional and behavioural coping responses are
   employed.}},

Abstract = {{Bark beetles cause widespread tree mortality, so understanding how
   climate change will influence the distribution and magnitude of
   outbreaks by this group of herbivores is important. We first develop a
   framework of outbreak dynamics that emphasizes transitions from states
   dominated by negative feedback to those dominated by positive,
   density-dependent feedback. We then consider mechanisms by which
   temperature and precipitation changes can allow populations to breach
   critical thresholds, and the empirical data relating outbreaks to
   weather. Finally, we consider how anticipated climatic change, and
   relationships with new hosts and natural enemy guilds, may influence
   dynamics in new habitats. There is strong evidence that elevated
   temperature can increase over-wintering survival and decrease generation
   times of bark beetles, although evolved traits can also constrain
   response to warming in some habitats. Moreover, combinations of
   phenotypic plasticity, genotypic variation and physiological thresholds
   yield a broad range of conditions under which adults emerge
   synchronously, and thus can mass attack trees. There is likewise strong
   evidence that severe drought reduces tree defences against attack.
   Drought stress can occur through lower precipitation and/or higher
   temperatures that reduce soil moisture and/or raise vapour pressure
   deficit. We also delineate three categories of range modifications:
   increased and more persistent establishment in areas where trees
   experienced only intermittent exposure historically; establishment in
   areas dominated by host species but where local populations experienced
   little or no pressure historically; and movement into new areas
   containing susceptible species that have not been exposed previously.
   Each of these has been documented for bark beetles. Trees in areas that
   experienced minor or no exposure generally had lower defences than their
   more historically exposed counterparts. However, there can be lags in
   beetle behavioural responses. In some cases, more heterogeneous forest
   structure, more abundant local predators and competitors and low host
   nutritional quality could potentially lessen risk in new habitats.
   Direct comparative studies are needed to evaluate outbreak potentials
   following range expansions driven by climate warming.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the literature of Chateaubriand, which, nourished
   by the labyrinth of his life experience, is the image of the life rich
   in events of the author. Francois Rene Viscount of Chateaubriand is
   remembered by the most important literary stories as the man with three
   careers: first voyager, then diplomat and finally, memoirist, all three
   having fertilized his inspiration and his sensitivity. If it's the
   fabulous voyage in America that inspired the epic American of the
   Natchez in his famous novels ``Atala{''}, ``Rene{''} and ``Natchez{''},
   the future diplomat most of all, and especially the deep and
   conservative Christian who Chateaubriand has always been, produced the
   ``Genius of Christianity{''}, which brings him not only Bonaparte's
   partial acceptation, but also the recognition of an entire century which
   sees him as the personality that has made possible the return of the
   Christian religion into the artistic inspiration, after the Greek and
   Roman inspiration Pantheism of the classicism, and the ``terror{''} in
   the time of the Revolution. But it's for the memoirist producing his
   masterpiece ``Memoires d'outre-tombe{''} to open, at the same time, the
   way to the most important themes of romanticism, to romantic description
   and to romantic poetry. Even if it's a piece in prose, thanks to the
   sensitive and quiet rhythm of the sentence and the assonance games, and
   also thanks to the use of metaphors and similes, I can assert that we
   are in the presence of a true piece of poetic prose. In addition, we
   have here an explicit description of space, in contrast to poetry itself
   where space appears only implicitly. Chateaubriand's description
   contains the three fundamental themes that are haunting and defining for
   the romantics: nature, glory of the past (history) and myth. The same
   themes are taken up and developed with even more refinement (with the
   weapons of poetry), in what interests me the most, which is his poetic
   work, unrecognized and ignored by the most important critics. God,
   nature, travel, history and myth, all of them blend in poems such as:
   ``Painting of God{''}, ``The Forest{''}, ``The Slave{''}, whose eternal
   value I try to demonstrate in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Health and safety is based on the choices that people make during
   lifetime. Each of us chooses to act safely or unsafely, healthy or
   unhealthy. Specific risk group is children and youngsters. Children and
   young people often have a desire to test their independence, build a
   personal identity and expand the social life, so young people often
   experiment also with different types of behavior. In the situations not
   favorable to health and safety children and young people behavior often
   do not comply with their knowledge of how to act. Human (human
   securitability is an internationally-known concept that characterizes
   human adaptability skills in a rapidly changing environment. Are
   distinguished 7 human securitability aspects: health, economic, personal
   (physical), ecological securitability, nutritional, community and
   political securitability. In the National development plan (NDP) 2020
   strategy one of the priorities is human securitability provision. In our
   study, we analyzed the personal (physical) securitability of educational
   institutions. A person with a low sense of securitability feels
   threatened, does not want to use the opportunities of personal growth,
   trust others and cooperate with them at workplace and in collectives,
   does not want to participate in the state national development process,
   and therefore does not contribute to national growth. The pupils are
   able to learn successfully at school, develop their ability to form a
   personality only in an environment with a sustainable securitability.
   The pupil parents can successfully work and act only in the case they
   are absolutely certain about their children securitability at school,
   where they spend most of the working day: at schools, in after-school
   hobby groups, in sports trainings. Creating a safe environment at
   schools and being educated, growing and developing in this environment,
   the pupils form understanding of the necessity for a safe and healthy
   environment and its importance, and develop motivation to keep it for
   the needs of family, society and the public.
   In strengthening securitability equally important is knowledge and
   skills to act in different situations. Researching education policy
   documents, the authors draw the conclusion that it is necessary on a
   state level to strengthen the securitability of each Latvian resident
   and the issues related to state securitability in educational
   institutions and society as a whole. Sports teacher can contribute to
   the promotion of pupil securitability, using the subject content as the
   means. Human securitability can be promoted by knowledge acquisition and
   skills development in securitability-oriented sports lesson.}},

Volume = {{282}},

Abstract = {{The fitness effects of symbionts on their hosts can be
   context-dependent, with usually benign symbionts causing detrimental
   effects when their hosts are stressed, or typically parasitic symbionts
   providing protection towards their hosts (e.g. against pathogen
   infection). Here, we studied the novel association between the invasive
   garden ant Lasius neglectus and its fungal ectosymbiont Laboulbenia
   formicarum for potential costs and benefits. We tested ants with
   different Laboulbenia levels for their survival and immunity under
   resource limitation and exposure to the obligate killing entomopathogen
   Metarhizium brunneum. While survival of L. neglectus workers under
   starvation was significantly decreased with increasing Laboulbenia
   levels, host survival under Metarhizium exposure increased with higher
   levels of the ectosymbiont, suggesting a symbiont-mediated anti-pathogen
   protection, which seems to be driven mechanistically by both improved
   sanitary behaviours and an upregulated immune system. Ants with high
   Laboulbenia levels showed significantly longer self-grooming and
   elevated expression of immune genes relevant for wound repair and
   antifungal responses (beta-1,3-glucan binding protein,
   Prophenoloxidase), compared with ants carrying low Laboulbenia levels.
   This suggests that the ectosymbiont Laboulbenia formicarum weakens its
   ant host by either direct resource exploitation or the costs of an
   upregulated behavioural and immunological response, which, however,
   provides a prophylactic protection upon later exposure to pathogens.}},

Abstract = {{Sulfur is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and development.
   Reaching a thorough understanding of the molecular basis for changes in
   plant metabolism depending on the sulfur-nutritional status at the
   systems level will advance our basic knowledge and help target future
   crop improvement. Although the transcriptional responses induced by
   sulfate starvation have been studied in the past, knowledge of the
   regulation of sulfur metabolism is still fragmentary. This work focuses
   on the discovery of candidates for regulatory genes such as
   transcription factors (TFs) using `omics technologies. For this purpose
   a short term sulfate-starvation/re-supply approach was used. ATH1
   microarray studies and metabolite determinations yielded 21 TFs which
   responded more than 2-fold at the transcriptional level to sulfate
   starvation. Categorization by response behaviors under
   sulfate-starvation/re-supply and other nutrient starvations such as
   nitrate and phosphate allowed determination of whether the TF genes are
   specific for or common between distinct mineral nutrient depletions.
   Extending this co-behavior analysis to the whole transcriptome data set
   enabled prediction of putative downstream genes. Additionally,
   combinations of transcriptome and metabolome data allowed identification
   of relationships between TFs and downstream responses, namely,
   expression changes in biosynthetic genes and subsequent metabolic
   responses. Effect chains on glucosinolate and polyamine biosynthesis are
   discussed in detail. The knowledge gained from this study provides a
   blueprint for an integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics
   and application for the identification of uncharacterized genes.}},

Volume = {{121}},

Abstract = {{Animals often exhibit consistent individual differences in behavior
   (i.e., animal personality) and correlations between behaviors (i.e.,
   behavioral syndromes), yet the causes of those patterns of behavioral
   variation remain insufficiently understood. Many authors hypothesize
   that state-dependent behavior produces animal personality and behavioral
   syndromes. However, empirical studies assessing patterns of covariation
   among behavioral traits and state variables have produced mixed results.
   New statistical methods that partition correlations into
   between-individual and residual within-individual correlations offer an
   opportunity to more sufficiently quantify relationships among behaviors
   and state variables to assess hypotheses of animal personality and
   behavioral syndromes. In a population of wild Belding's ground squirrels
   (Urocitellus beldingi), we repeatedly measured activity, exploration,
   and response to restraint behaviors alongside glucocorticoids and
   nutritional condition. We used multivariate mixed models to determine
   whether between-individual or within-individual correlations drive
   phenotypic relationships among traits. Squirrels had consistent
   individual differences for all five traits. At the between-individual
   level, activity and exploration were positively correlated whereas both
   traits negatively correlated with response to restraint, demonstrating a
   behavioral syndrome. At the within-individual level, condition
   negatively correlated with cortisol, activity, and exploration.
   Importantly, this indicates that although behavior is state-dependent,
   which may play a role in animal personality and behavioral syndromes,
   feedback mechanisms between condition and behavior appear not to produce
   consistent individual differences in behavior and correlations between
   them.}},

Abstract = {{For several decades, breeding goals in dairy cattle focussed on
   increased milk production. However, many functional traits have negative
   genetic correlations with milk yield, and reductions in genetic merit
   for health and fitness have been observed. Herd management has been
   challenged to compensate for these effects and to balance fertility,
   udder health and metabolic diseases against increased production to
   maximize profit without compromising welfare. Functional traits, such as
   direct information on cow health, have also become more important
   because of growing concern about animal well-being and consumer demands
   for healthy and natural products. There are major concerns about the
   impact of drugs used in veterinary medicine on the spread of
   antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria that can negatively impact
   human health. Sustainability and efficiency are also increasingly
   important because of the growing competition for high-quality,
   plant-based sources of energy and protein. Disruptions to global
   environments because of climate change may encourage yet more emphasis
   on these traits. To be successful, it is vital that there be a balance
   between the effort required for data recording and subsequent benefits.
   The motivation of farmers and other stakeholders involved in
   documentation and recording is essential to ensure good data quality. To
   keep labour costs reasonable, existing data sources should be used as
   much as possible. Examples include the use of milk composition data to
   provide additional information about the metabolic status or energy
   balance of the animals. Recent advances in the use of mid-infrared
   spectroscopy to measure milk have shown considerable promise, and may
   provide cost-effective alternative phenotypes for difficult or
   expensive-to-measure traits, such as feed efficiency. There are other
   valuable data sources in countries that have compulsory documentation of
   veterinary treatments and drug use. Additional sources of data outside
   of the farm include, for example, slaughter houses (meat composition and
   quality) and veterinary labs (specific pathogens, viral loads). At the
   farm level, many data are available from automated and semi-automated
   milking and management systems. Electronic devices measuring
   physiological status or activity parameters can be used to predict
   events such as oestrus, and also behavioural traits. Challenges
   concerning the predictive biology of indicator traits or standardization
   need to be solved. To develop effective selection programmes for new
   traits, the development of large databases is necessary so that
   high-reliability breeding values can be estimated. For
   expensive-to-record traits, extensive phenotyping in combination with
   genotyping of females is a possibility.}},

Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{166-173}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Adopting different behavioural strategies may reduce within-group
   conflict, selecting for behavioural consistency ('personality').
   Personality may also affect grouping tendencies. The relationship
   between the personality dimensions sociability and boldness nevertheless
   remains unclear. This knowledge gap may reflect a failure to consider
   potential trade-offs between avoiding conspecifics, potentially
   alleviating social stress, and avoiding predation. Furthermore, the
   effects of personality and state (e.g. body condition or age affecting
   the costs and benefits of behavioural actions) on cooperativeness should
   be considered together. This is because state may explain predation
   vulnerability, which may affect boldness under predation risk, and thus
   antipredator grouping tendencies. To address the problem, we determined
   how group size preference and group-forming time depended on boldness
   (flight initiation distance, FID, in response to an approaching human),
   body condition and breeding experience in facultatively social eiders,
   Somateria mollissima, where females form coalitions or care for the
   young solitarily. Breeding adults and young are subject to high
   predation pressure, providing a strong incentive for brood-tending
   females to cooperate. Because hormonal differences may also explain
   differences in sociability, we included baseline and handling-induced
   serum corticosterone concentrations of incubating females as potential
   predictors of sociability. We also statistically controlled for
   availability of potential partners. The relationship between boldness
   (FID) and the number of coalition partners ranged from negative (females
   in poor body condition) to positive (females in good body condition),
   arguing against a uniform relationship between boldness and sociability.
   The number of coalition partners decreased with female breeding
   experience. The time taken to form a coalition was shortest close to the
   hatching peak in the population. Shyness (long FID) delayed group
   formation. Despite a need for safety in numbers by shy females in poor
   body condition, their entry into groups may be constrained by their
   personality, suggesting a possible trade-off between predator and
   conspecific avoidance. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Although overweight and obesity are associated with poor health outcomes

   adverse mental health in older individuals. However, it is unclear
   whether FTO influences longitudinal trajectories of adiposity and other

   examined whether a commonly carried obesity-risk variant in the FTO gene

   allele carriers of FTO exhibit dose-dependent increments in both

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{90-96}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Female investment during reproduction may reduce survivorship due to
   increased predation risk. During pregnancy, the locomotor performance of
   gravid females might be diminished due to the additional weight
   acquired. In addition, egg production may also increase
   thermoregulatoiy, metabolic and physiological costs. Also, pregnant
   females have greater potential fitness and should take fewer risks.
   Thus, females should ponder their reproductive state when considering
   their behavioural responses under risky situations. Here, we examine how
   reproductive state influence risk-taking behaviour in different contexts
   in female Spanish terrapins (Mauremys leprosa). We simulated predator
   attacks of different risk levels and measured the time that the turtles
   spent hiding entirely inside their own shells (i.e. appearance times).
   We also assessed the subsequent time after emergence from the shell that
   the turtles spent immobile monitoring for predators before starting to
   escape actively (i.e. waiting times). Likewise, we performed a
   novel-environment test and measured the exploratory activity of turtles.
   We found no correlations between appearance time, waiting time or
   exploratory activity, but appearance times were correlated across
   different risk levels. Only appearance time was affected by the
   reproductive state, where gravid females reappeared relatively later
   from their shells after a predator attack than non-gravid ones.
   Moreover, among gravid females, those carrying greater clutches tended
   to have longer appearance times. This suggests that only larger clutches
   could affect hiding behaviour in risky contexts. In contrast, waiting
   time spent scanning for predators and exploratory activity were not
   affected by the reproductive state. These differences between gravid and
   non-gravid females might be explained by the metabolic-physiological
   costs associated with egg production and embryo maintenance, as well as
   by the relatively higher potential fitness of gravid females. (C) 2015

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In many species, males possess conspicuous characteristics to attract
   females. These traits often attract predators as well, and males thus
   may have to balance the conspicuousness of their signals in relation to
   the prevailing predation risk. Here we develop a theoretical model of
   optimal signaling and risk-taking behavior for males differing in the
   attractiveness of their signals. All else being equal, more attractive
   males should behave more cautiously. Yet this prediction may drastically
   change if males differ in any additional characteristic, especially if
   basal mortality rate or signaling costs are higher or if the
   vulnerability to predators is lower for attractive males. A key insight
   from our model is that male competition will create a positive feedback
   so that selection on male risk-taking strategies is acting in opposite
   directions. If selection acts on one male type to behave more
   cautiously, this will strengthen selection on males of the other types
   to take higher risks and vice versa. Our results further demonstrate
   that the asset-protection principle, which states that individuals with
   higher future expectations should behave more cautiously, may often be
   violated. We also offer an alternative to the handicap principle
   explaining the often found positive association between male
   ornamentation and viability: attractive males may simply behave more
   cautiously.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of a high (chocolate) versus low fat/sugar (chow) food on a
   conditioned-place-preference (CPP) task was evaluated in marmoset
   monkeys. Anxiety-related behaviors and cortisol levels before and after
   the CPP task were also measured. Subjects were habituated to a
   two-compartment CPP box and then, on alternate days, had access to only
   one compartment during daily 15-min conditionings, for a total of 14
   trials. Marmosets were provisioned with chocolate chips in the CC-paired
   compartment on odd-numbered trials and standard chow in the CW-paired
   compartment on even-numbered trials. They were then tested for
   preferring the CC-paired context after a 24-h interval. During the
   conditioning, a significantly greater amount (in kcal/trial) of
   chocolate was consumed than chow, yet the foraging pattern of both food
   types was similar. On the test trial, the time spent in the CC-paired
   context increased significantly compared to pre-CPP levels, yet this
   response was not readily predicted by baseline behavioral or cortisol
   levels. Also, the chocolate CPP response was positively correlated with
   foraging time, rather than the amount of calories consumed. The sudden
   absence of the food increased exploration, while the chocolate CPP
   effect was associated with vigilance both anxiety-related behaviors in
   marmosets. This behavioral profile occurred regardless of any
   concomitant change or correlation with cortisol. Therefore, the high
   fat/sugar food was more prone to be overly consumed by the marmosets, to
   induce a CPP response and to lead to anxiety-related behavior in its
   absence. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid changes to climate in the western Antarctic Peninsula region over
   the last 50 yr, which have led to decreases in the extent and duration
   of sea ice, are likely to have significant impacts upon the Antarctic
   ecosystem as a whole. Understanding the behaviour of higher trophic
   level animals occupying these regions is important, as they may be
   indicators of changes in prey availability and food-web structure.
   Leopard seals Hydrurga leptonyx are important components of the
   Antarctic ecosystem, because they are widespread and adapted to
   consuming prey at a range of trophic levels. They rely on sea ice for
   breeding, moulting and as a resting platform. Using tracks of 12 leopard
   seals, we calculated first-passage times (indicative of the intensity of
   area-restricted behaviour) and quantified relative habitat use,
   including both foraging and resting areas, using Cox proportional hazard
   models, in relation to coastline, bathymetry and sea ice. We also
   correlated monthly home range size with monthly sea-ice extent. We found
   that when sea-ice extent was low, leopard seals were restricted to
   coastal habitat, but that this effect was lost when sea-ice extent was
   greater. This was supported by the finding that leopard seal home range
   size decreased as the sea-ice extent decreased. Since leopard seals and
   other animals that consume krill are likely to be increasingly limited
   by sea-ice cover if the warming trend continues, we suggest that the
   krill fishery be restricted to offshore areas to avoid conflict with
   krill predators.}},

   psycho-social attributes. We also found gender-specific vulnerability to
   different types of sleep problems. Among men who reported disrupted

   women exposed to restless sleep, the increase in obesity prevalence was
   1.84\%. The observed gender difference in the prevalence of increases in

   women may respond by physical inactivity. Both can contribute to an

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{Movement is a key mean for mobile species to cope with heterogeneous
   environments. While in herbivorous mammals large-scale migration has
   been widely investigated, finescale movement responses to local
   variations in resources and predation risk remain much less studied,
   especially in savannah environments. We developed a novel approach based
   on complementary movement metrics (residence time, frequency of visits
   and regularity of visits) to relate movement patterns of a savannah
   grazer, the blue wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus, to fine-scale
   variations in food availability, predation risk and water availability
   in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Wildebeests spent more time
   in grazing lawns where the grass is of higher quality but shorter than
   in seep zones, where the grass is of lower quality but more abundant.
   Although the daily distances moved were longer during the wet season
   compared to the dry season, the daily net displacement was lower, and
   the residence time higher, indicating a more frequent occurrence of
   area-concentred searching. In contrast, during the late dry season the
   foraging sessions were more fragmented and wildebeests moved more
   frequently between foraging areas. Surprisingly, predation risk appeared
   to be the second factor, after water availability, influencing movement
   during the dry season, when resources are limiting and thus expected to
   influence movement more. Our approach, using complementary analyses of
   different movement metrics, provided an integrated view of changes in
   individual movement with varying environmental conditions and predation
   risk. It makes it possible to highlight the adaptive behavioral
   decisions made by wildebeest to cope with unpredictable environmental
   variations and provides insights for population conservation.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine the relationship among sedentary

   thousand yen18 years (mean +/- SD = 43.8 +/- 19.5). SB was measured
   using ActiGraph accelerometers worn for 1 week and defined as < 100
   counts/min. Metabolic syndrome was defined using the Adult Treatment
   Panel III criteria. Natural cubic spline logistic regression models were
   used to estimate the odds of meeting criteria for the metabolic syndrome
   and its components by total daily SB time and breaks in SB. Statistical
   interactions between SB and age, sex and MVPA were explored.
   The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was 19\% and the average daily
   SB time was 8.1 +/- 2.8 h, with 90 +/- 25 breaks/day. The relationship
   between daily SB time and the metabolic syndrome was linear and
   characterised by an OR of 1.09 (95\% CI 1.01, 1.18) for each hour of SB.
   Total SB was associated with the following components: high
   triacylglycerol, low HDL-cholesterol and high fasting glucose. All three
   associations were modified by MVPA level. No relationship between breaks
   in SB and the metabolic syndrome was found.
   There appears to be no SB threshold at which the risk of the metabolic
   syndrome is elevated. Therefore, an effort should be made to maintain
   low levels of total time spent in SB and so lessen the risk of the
   metabolic syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& AimsWeight management is a cornerstone of treatment for
   overweight/obese persons with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
   This exploratory study sought to: (i) evaluate readiness to change
   weight-related behaviours; (ii) assess psychosocial characteristics that
   may interfere with weight loss; and (iii) evaluate how baseline
   psychosocial features associate with 6-month change in weight in persons
   with NAFLD receiving standard medical care. The purpose of this
   investigation was to develop hypotheses regarding relationships between
   psychosocial factors and weight for use in future fully powered studies
   and clinical interventions
   MethodsFifty-eight overweight/obese participants with NAFLD completed
   baseline measures of personality, psychiatric symptoms and readiness for
   behaviour change and were followed up for 6months in standard care.
   ResultsOne-third of participants (31.0\%) were not interested in making
   weight-related behaviour changes; 58.6\% were considering making a
   change, and 10.4\% of individuals were actively working on or preparing
   to change. Six-month change in weight was non-significant and was not
   associated with baseline readiness for change. Depression, low
   conscientiousness and high neuroticism were associated with higher
   weight at 6-month follow-up with small to large effect sizes.
   ConclusionsAlthough participants received nutritional education and
   guidance, very few individuals presented in the active stage of change.
   Although readiness for change did not predict subsequent change in
   weight, personality factors and psychiatric symptoms were associated
   with weight outcomes. Integrated multidisciplinary approaches that
   address psychiatric needs and provide behavioural support for weight
   loss may help patients with NAFLD implement sustained lifestyle changes.}},

Abstract = {{Seed dispersal constrains the environmental heterogeneity to which a
   plant species is exposed through its life. Behavior of seed dispersers
   and seed predators could be influenced by food availability and
   vegetation cover. Consequently, recruitment probabilities are
   heterogeneous in space and time, and ``regeneration windows{''} may
   appear. Aristotelia chilensis is the most abundant fleshy-fruited shrub
   in the temperate forest of southern South America (TFSA). TFSA exhibits
   an environmental patchiness that could influence fruit abundance and
   animal behavior. Our objective was to determine the regeneration windows
   of A. chilensis, and to detect how forest structure and animal behavior
   could affect the spatial distribution of this species. We characterized
   forest structure in two plots that included mature forest, young forest,
   and open areas. We assessed the spatio-temporal distribution of A.
   chilensis fruits and studied fruit removal by animals. Also, we
   experimentally evaluated germination and post-dispersal seed predation.
   We developed a conceptual model to relate A. chilensis recruitment with
   forest successional stages. The fruiting individuals of this shrub were
   mostly located in fire-opened areas or forest gaps, and the seed rain
   generated by the migratory bird Elaenia albiceps was denser in these
   areas. In contrast, seed predation by rodents was higher in closed,
   young forest areas. A. chilensis recruitment follows a nucleation
   dynamic around fruiting females. Concerning forest succession, A.
   chilensis recruitment was higher near re-sprouting females in open
   areas, and lowest in young forests, where fruiting process was hindered
   by light constraints. When forests mature, new nucleation processes
   start around females surviving in gaps. We conclude that areas opened by
   disturbances provide a regeneration window for A. chilensis shrubs.}},

Abstract = {{A wide range of developmental, nutritional, environmental, and social
   factors affect the biological activities of epigenetic mechanisms. These
   factors change spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression in a variety
   of different ways and bring significant impacts to bear on development,
   physiology, and disease risk throughout the life course. Abundant
   evidence demonstrates that behavioral stressors and adverse nutritional
   conditions are particularly potent inducers of epigenetic changes and
   enhancers of chronic disease risks. Recent insights from both human
   clinical studies and research with model organisms further indicate that
   such experience-dependent changes to the epigenome can be transmitted
   through the germline across multiple generations, with important
   consequences for the heritability of both adaptive and maladaptive
   phenotypes. Epigenetics research thus offers many possibilities for
   developing informative biomarkers of acquired chronic disease risk and
   determining the effectiveness of preventive and therapeutic
   interventions. Moreover, the experience-sensitive nature of these
   disease risks raises important questions about societal and individual
   responsibilities for the prevention of ill-health and the promotion of
   well-being during development, across the life course and between
   generations. Better understanding of how epigenetic mechanisms regulate
   developmental plasticity and mediate the biological embedding of chronic
   disease risks is therefore likely to shed important new light on the
   nature of the pathophysiological mechanisms linking social and health
   inequalities, and will help to inform public policy initiatives in this

Abstract = {{Background: Anemia during the third trimester of fetal development
   affects one-third of the pregnancies in the United States and has been
   associated with postnatal behavioral outcomes. This study examines how
   fetal iron deficiency (ID) interacts with the fetal monoamine oxidase A
   (MAOA) genotype. MAOA metabolizes monoamine neurotransmitters. MAOA
   polymorphisms in humans affect temperament and modify the influence of
   early adverse environments on later behavior.
   Objective: The aim of the study was to advance translation of
   developmental ID research in animal models by taking into account
   genetic factors that influence outcomes in human populations.
   Methods: Male infant rhesus monkeys 3-4 mo old born to mothers fed an ID
   (10 ppm iron) diet were compared with controls (100 ppm iron). Infant
   monkeys with high-or low-transcription rate MAOA polymorphisms were
   equally distributed between diet groups. Behavioral responses to a
   series of structured experiences were recorded during a 25-h separation
   of the infants from their mothers.
   Results: Infant monkeys with low-transcription MAOA polymorphisms more
   clearly demonstrated the following ID effects suggested in earlier
   studies: a 4\% smaller head circumference, a 39\% lower cortisol
   response to social separation, a 129\% longer engagement with novel
   visual stimuli, and 33\% lesser withdrawal in response to a human
   intruder. The high MAOA genotype ID monkeys demonstrated other ID
   effects: less withdrawal and emotionality after social separation and
   lower ``fearful{''} ratings.
   Conclusion: MAOA 3 ID interactions support the role of monoamine
   neurotransmitters in prenatal ID effects in rhesus monkeys and the
   potential involvement of common human polymorphisms in determining the
   pattern of neurobehavioral effects produced by inadequate prenatal

Abstract = {{The gut microbiota is intimately involved in numerous aspects of normal

   Thus, intestinal dysbiosis, i.e., altered composition or metabolism of

   complications via disrupting maternal adaptation. Indeed, pregnant women
   with potential maladaptations are at high risk of developing pregnancy

Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{61-66}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Some social signals are sexually selected both by female mating
   preferences and by male-male competition for mates. Studies of the
   behavioural mechanisms that mediate responses to these signals provide
   insight into how sexual selection operates. Courting male fiddler crabs,
   Uca terpsichores, sometimes build large sand structures called hoods at
   the openings to their burrows. Hoods attract females to males' burrows
   for mating because they elicit landmark orientation, a behaviour that is
   selected by predation. Males also orient visually to their own hoods
   when errors are introduced experimentally into their nonvisual mechanism
   for path integration. These errors occur naturally when males move far
   from their burrows to court females or fight neighbours. Here we
   explored whether courting males also use hoods as visual beacons to the
   location of their burrow. Crabs that rely on path integration to orient
   to their burrow keep their lateral axis closely aligned with the bearing
   home. We therefore measured and compared the distances males moved from
   their burrows and the maximum deviations between males' body axes and
   home bearings for males that did and did not build hoods, males that had
   their hood removed and males that had a hood added to their burrow.
   Males with hoods did not range further from their burrows than those
   without hoods, but they exhibited greater maximum deviations between
   their body axes and the bearings to their burrows. Hoods may facilitate
   courtship by allowing males to move more freely than when they rely on
   nonvisual path integration alone. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published on

Abstract = {{Stressful environmental conditions such as periods of poor nutrition
   have been shown to affect a variety of life history traits. Although
   nutrition-induced effects on the phenotype can appear through the entire
   life of an individual, it is becoming evident that there are sensitive
   periods during development when phenotypic traits have heightened
   sensitivity to nutritional conditions. Very few studies have
   investigated how nutrition can affect an important aspect of an
   organism's phenotype: the development of its `personality'. In this
   study we manipulated the availability of the main micronutrients (i.e.
   vitamins and essential minerals) present in the diet of zebra finches,
   Taeniopygia guttata, during their postnatal development and/or during
   their sexual maturation. Later, once the birds were fully adult, we
   assessed a series of behavioural traits previously used to assess
   personality in birds. We found that low availability of dietary
   micronutrients during the postnatal period resulted in reduced boldness
   in males once they reached adulthood, but had no effect on adult stress
   responses or neophobic behaviour. No such effects were found in females.
   In contrast, a low micronutrient diet during sexual maturation led in
   both sexes to reduced stress responses and neophobic behaviours in
   adulthood. Interestingly, we also found that females became more
   aggressive as adults if they had received a low micronutrient diet
   during development, irrespective of when the availability of
   micronutrients was modified. Overall, our results demonstrate
   substantial effects of diet on the development of behavioural traits,
   and that these effects differ both between the sexes and over different
   developmental periods. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Trait compensation denotes the situation in which individuals offset the
   costs of one trait with the benefits of another trait. The phenomenon of
   trait compensation is best exemplified by a negative correlation between
   the degree of predator avoidance and the strength of morphological
   defence. In this study, we used the relationship between risk-taking
   tendency (boldness) and the propensity for tail autotomy in the brown
   anole lizards Anolis sagrei to address two important questions regarding
   trait compensation. First, we investigated whether trait compensation
   existed among individuals of similar age. Second, we examined how the
   relationship between boldness and the propensity for tail autotomy
   responded to changes in food availability. Overall, bolder individuals
   autotomized their tails more readily. Although mean values of boldness
   and the propensity for tail autotomy did not differ under high and low
   food availability, the compensatory effect between the two traits was
   only obvious when food was abundant. The existence of trait compensation
   among similarly aged individuals will serve as the first step to
   understanding the evolution of compensatory effects among traits
   observed at higher level. In addition, food availability affected the
   dynamics of trait compensation by influencing the amount of variation of
   traits involved, rather than altering the mean values of traits per se.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: to investigate the presence of eating disorders (ED) and
   psychopathological traits in obese preadolescents and adolescents
   compared to normal-weight peers.
   Design: Overweight/obese patients aged 11 to 14 y and normal-weight
   peers' data collected by means of self-report questionnaires
   administered to parents and children.
   Setting: Clinical Nutrition Units in the Municipalities of Rome, Naples,
   Gallipoli and Atri, Italy.
   Subjects: 376 preadolescents and adolescents. Patients were 187 (93
   boys, BMI=27.9 +/-;4.1; 94 girls, BMI=28.1 +/- 4.5); normal-weight
   controls were 189 subjects (94 boys, BMI=19.4 +/- 1.4; 95 girls,
   BMI=19.5 +/- 1.5).
   Measures of outcome: eating disorder behaviors, psychopathological
   traits and symptoms estimated by means of the eating disorders scales
   (EDI-2) and psychopathological scales (CBCL 4-18).
   Results: Patients reached higher scores than controls in most of the
   eating disorders scales and psychopathological scales. Twenty-one
   (11.2\%) patients were considered at risk of developing an eating
   disorder and 75 (40\%) presented social problems. With regard to weight
   status, age-group and gender, main significant interaction effects were
   seen in social problems (F= 6.50; p<0.05) and ineffectiveness (F= 4.15;
   p<0.05).
   Conclusions: Findings from our study demonstrate that in preadolescence
   and adolescence, obesity is significantly associated to some traits
   typical of ED and to psychological problems in general. Although no
   inference can be made with regard to direction of causality, it is
   possible to conclude that overweight preadolescents and adolescents can
   be prone to display problematic traits more commonly associated to
   eating disorders and to present a high degree of mental distress.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral responses to food deprivation are a fundamental aspect of
   nervous system function in all animals. Several signaling molecules in
   the mammalian brain act through G proteins of the Gi/o family to mediate
   response to food restriction. The present study examined whether food
   intake changes under a condition of little stimulation to eat, such as
   that elicited by 4 h of food deprivation, was altered by Gi/o isoform
   silencing induced by intracerebroventricular (icy.) administration of
   antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (aODN) against the alpha subunit of
   G(i1), G(i2), G(i3), Go(1) and Go(2). The effect of aODN pretreatments
   on Food intake was evaluated 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after food
   re-administration. Selective effects were noted on food intake with
   anti-G(i alpha 1) (3.12-25 nmol), G(i alpha 3) (1.56-12.5 nmol) and G(o
   alpha 2) (3.12-25 nmol) aODN exerting increase in food consumption,
   while anti-G(i alpha 2) (3.12-25 nmol) and G(o alpha 1) (3.12-25 nmol)
   aODN exerting decrease in food consumption. We observed the effect of
   the alpha-subunit silencing on food consumption as soon as 15 min after
   food read ministration, that was still significant after 60 min. At the
   highest effective doses, different for each anti-G alpha i/o subunit,
   any treatment did not impair motor coordination, nor modified
   spontaneous mobility and exploratory activity. These results indicate a
   relevant distinction between G alpha i/o subunits on feeding behavior,
   and suggest that Gi/o proteins are critical for the integrative
   modulation of normal feeding behavior. Changes in Gi/o protein activity
   may be associated with modifications of feeding. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Herbivory on Mediterranean seagrass species is generally low compared to
   consumption of some other temperate and tropical species of seagrasses.
   In this study we: (1) investigate the feeding preference of the two
   dominant Mediterranean seagrass herbivores, the sea urchin Paracentrotus
   lividus and the fish Sarpa salpa, on Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea
   nodosa and (2) elucidate the role of epiphytes in herbivore choices. We
   assessed consumption rates by tethering seagrass shoots, and preferences
   by food choice experiments with the following paired combinations: 1)
   Epiphytized leaves of both C nodosa vs. P. oceanica (CE vs PE); 2)
   Non-epiphytized leaves of C nodosa vs. P. oceanica (CNE vs. PNE); 3)
   Epiphytized vs non-epiphytized leaves of C nodosa (CE vs. CNE) and 4)
   Epiphytized vs non-epiphytized leaves of P. oceanica (PE vs PNE). We
   found that preference for C nodosa was weak for S. salpa, but strong for
   P. lividus, the species responsible for most consumption at our study.
   Overall both herbivores showed preference for epiphytized leaves. The
   higher nutritional quality of C nodosa leaves and epiphytes together
   with the high coverage and diversity of the epiphyte community found on
   its leaves help explain the higher levels of herbivory recorded on
   epiphyted leaves of C nodosa. Other factors such as seagrass
   accessibility, herbivore mobility and size, and behavioral responses to
   predation risks, may also affect the intensity of seagrass herbivory,
   and studies addressing the interactions with these factors are needed to
   improve our understanding of the nature, extent and implications of

Abstract = {{Predators can impact their prey via consumptive effects that occur

   dingo) has positive effects on both abundance and foraging efficiency of
   a desert rodent. Then by manipulating predators' access to food patches
   we further the idea that apex predators provide small prey with refuge
   from predation by showing that rodents increased their habitat breadth
   and use of `risky' food patches where an apex predator was common but
   mesopredators rare. Our study suggests that apex predators' suppressive

Volume = {{282}},

Abstract = {{The fear induced by predators on their prey is well known to cause
   behavioural adjustments by prey that can ripple through food webs.
   Little is known, however, about the analogous impacts of humans as
   perceived top predators on the foraging behaviour of carnivores. Here,
   we investigate the influence of human-induced fear on puma foraging
   behaviour using location and prey consumption data from 30 tagged
   individuals living along a gradient of human development. We observed
   strong behavioural responses by female pumas to human development,
   whereby their fidelity to kill sites and overall consumption time of
   prey declined with increasing housing density by 36 and 42\%,
   respectively. Females responded to this decline in prey consumption time
   by increasing the number of deer they killed in high housing density
   areas by 36\% over what they killed in areas with little residential
   development. The loss of food from declines in prey consumption time
   paired with increases in energetic costs associated with killing more
   prey may have consequences for puma populations, particularly with
   regard to reproductive success. In addition, greater carcass
   availability is likely to alter community dynamics by augmenting food
   resources for scavengers. In light of the extensive and growing impact
   of habitat modification, our study emphasizes that knowledge of the
   indirect effects of human activity on animal behaviour is a necessary
   component in understanding anthropogenic impacts on community dynamics

   subdivided according to environmental stimulation (E or N). GR

Abstract = {{Background
   Eating disorders appear to be caused by a complex interaction between
   environmental and genetic factors, and compulsive eating in response to
   adverse circumstances characterizes many eating disorders.
   Materials and Methods
   We compared compulsion-like eating in the form of conditioned
   suppression of palatable food-seeking in adverse situations in stressed
   C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice, two well-characterized inbred strains, to
   determine the influence of gene-environment interplay on this behavioral
   phenotype. Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that low accumbal D2
   receptor (R) availability is a genetic risk factor of food
   compulsion-like behavior and that environmental conditions that induce
   compulsive eating alter D2R expression in the striatum. To this end, we
   measured D1R and D2R expression in the striatum and D1R, D2R and alpha
   1R levels in the medial prefrontal cortex, respectively, by western
   blot.
   Results
   Exposure to environmental conditions induces compulsion-like eating
   behavior, depending on genetic background. This behavioral pattern is
   linked to decreased availability of accumbal D2R. Moreover, exposure to
   certain environmental conditions upregulates D2R and downregulates alpha
   1R in the striatum and medial prefrontal cortex, respectively, of
   compulsive animals. These findings confirm the function of
   gene-environment interplay in the manifestation of compulsive eating and
   support the hypothesis that low accumbal D2R availability is a
   ``constitutive{''} genetic risk factor for compulsion-like eating
   behavior. Finally, D2R upregulation and alpha 1R downregulation in the
   striatum and medial prefrontal cortex, respectively, are potential
   neuroadaptive responses that parallel the shift from motivated to
   compulsive eating.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity is the ability held in many organisms to produce
   different phenotypes with a given genome in response to environmental
   stimuli, such as temperature, nutrition and various biological
   interactions. It seems likely that environmental signals induce a
   variety of mechanistic responses that influence ontogenetic processes.
   Inducible defenses, in which prey animals alter their morphology,
   behavior and/or other traits to help protect against direct or latent
   predation threats, are among the most striking examples of phenotypic
   plasticity. The freshwater microcrustacean Daphnia pulex forms
   tooth-like defensive structures, ``neckteeth,{''} in response to
   chemical cues or signals, referred to as ``kairomones,{''} in this case
   released from phantom midge larvae, a predator of D. pulex. To identify
   factors involved in the reception and/or transmission of a kairomone, we
   used microarray analysis to identify genes up-regulated following a
   short period of exposure to the midge kairomone. In addition to
   identifying differentially expressed genes of unknown function, we also
   found significant up-regulation of genes encoding ionotropic glutamate
   receptors, which are known to be involved in neurotransmission in many
   animal species. Specific antagonists of these receptors strongly inhibit
   the formation of neckteeth in D. pulex, although agonists did not induce
   neckteeth by themselves, indicating that ionotropic glutamate receptors
   are necessary but not sufficient for early steps of neckteeth formation
   in D. pulex. Moreover, using co-exposure of D. pulex to antagonists and
   juvenile hormone (JH), which physiologically mediates neckteeth
   formation, we found evidence suggesting that the inhibitory effect of
   antagonists is not due to direct inhibition of JH synthesis/secretion.
   Our findings not only provide a candidate molecule required for the
   inducible defense response in D. pulex, but also will contribute to the
   understanding of complex mechanisms underlying the recognition of
   environmental changes, which form the basis of phenotypic plasticity.}},

   avoidance of hungry sexual cannibals?}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{25-32}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Males often exercise mate choice when mating frequency is constrained,
   costs of choice are low and variation in female quality and/or expected
   paternity can be reliably detected. Across invertebrates, males use sex
   pheromones to discern female mating status, but there are few
   demonstrations that information about expected fecundity ('quality') is
   encoded in pheromones alone. Here we examine whether females' sex
   pheromones allow males to detect differences in female food intake and
   mass in two species of widow spiders (Latrodectus hesperus and
   Latrodectus hasselti) in which chemicals are deposited by females in
   silk. Recent work shows that male L. hesperus prefer well-fed females,
   and that these females produce more silk than hungry females. Thus,
   changes in diet could be mechanistically linked to changes in silk-bound
   pheromonal signals. We show that unmated females of both species lose
   more than half of their mass when food is withheld, and silk production
   is reduced by 48\% (L. hesperus) to 67\% (L. hasselti). Males had a
   significant sexual response to pheromones extracted from the females'
   silk in both species, although this response was not directly correlated
   with silk or female mass. In L. hesperus, but not in L. hasselti, males
   were less responsive to sex pheromones from food-deprived females
   compared to well-fed females. While females on good diets provide the
   benefit of higher fecundity in both species, the risk of being
   cannibalized by hungry females during courtship exists only in L.
   hesperus. We conclude that sex pheromones alone can provide information
   about recent female feeding history, possibly reducing the costs of
   males expressing choice in the field. The species difference in male
   response also suggests that male preferences in these spiders may depend
   less on the benefit of seeking a highly fecund female and more on
   avoiding the cost of risky mating attempts with a likely cannibal. (C)

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},

Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{259-266}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Animals frequently compete over limited resources such as food,
   territories or mating opportunities. Contest behaviour varies based on
   factors such as the value of the contested resources and the agonistic
   ability of rivals. Much work on animal contests has examined aggression,
   but vigilance, or a state of heightened alertness directed towards
   specific stimuli, may also be an important component of competition in
   many species. In this study, we measure the relationships among social
   vigilance, aggression, agonistic ability and resource value during
   staged contests over nest ownership in Polistes dominula nest-founding
   wasps. Our results show that both social vigilance and aggression are
   involved in mediating social risk during contests. Nest owner vigilance
   towards a rival increased with the time of season, a measure of nest
   value. Owner vigilance was also positively associated with aggression
   such that more aggressive owners were more vigilant. During contests,
   aggression of owners and rivals was influenced by different factors.
   Owner aggression was positively associated with nest size, another
   measure of nest value, while rival aggression was unrelated to nest
   size. Instead, rival aggression was associated with facial patterns that
   function as signals of agonistic ability; rivals were less aggressive to
   owners that signalled high agonistic ability than they were to owners
   that signalled low agonistic ability. The distinct predictors of contest
   behaviour between owners and rivals indicate that competitive role has a
   surprisingly strong influence on cues used to inform contest behaviour.
   Differences may occur because owners and rivals have different
   information and/or motivation. These results also suggest that social
   vigilance and aggression may be complementary behaviours that animals

Abstract = {{Models of adaptive behaviour typically assume that animals behave as
   though they have highly complex, detailed strategies for making
   decisions. In reality, selection favours the optimal balance between the
   costs and benefits of complexity. Here we investigate this trade-off for
   an animal that has to decide whether or not to forage for food - and so
   how much energy reserves to store - depending on the food availability
   in its environment. We evolve a decision rule that controls the target
   reserve level for different ranges of food availability, but where
   increasing complexity is costly in that metabolic rate increases with
   the sensitivity of the rule. The evolved rule tends to be much less
   complex than the optimal strategy but performs almost as well, while
   being less costly to implement. It achieves this by being highly
   sensitive to changing food availability at low food abundance - where it
   provides a close fit to the optimal strategy - but insensitive when food
   is plentiful. When food availability is high, the target reserve level
   that evolves is much higher than under the optimal strategy, which has
   implications for our understanding of obesity. Our work highlights the
   important principle of generalisability of simple decision-making
   mechanisms, which enables animals to respond reasonably well to
   conditions not directly experienced by themselves or their ancestors}},

Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{94-98}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The mutualistic interaction between scatter-hoarding rodents and seed
   plants have a long co-evolutionary history. Plants are believed to have
   evolved traits that influence the foraging behavior of rodents, thus
   increasing the probability of seed removal and caching, which benefits
   the establishment of seedlings. Tannin and nutrient content in seeds are
   considered among the most essential factors in this plant-animal
   interaction. However, most previous studies used different species of
   plant seeds, rendering it difficult to tease apart the relative effect
   of each single nutrient on rodent foraging behavior due to confounding
   combinations of nutrient contents across seed species. Hence, to further
   explore how tannin and different nutritional traits of seed affect
   scatter-hoarding rodent foraging preferences, we manipulated tannin,
   fat, protein and starch content levels, and also seed size levels by
   using an artificial seed system. Our results showed that both tannin and
   various nutrients significantly affected rodent foraging preferences,
   but were also strongly affected by seed size. In general, rodents
   preferred to remove seeds with less tannin. Fat addition could
   counteract the negative effect of tannin on seed removal by rodents,
   while the effect of protein addition was weaker. Starch by itself had no
   effect, but it interacted with tannin in a complex way. Our findings
   shed light on the effects of tannin and nutrient content on seed removal
   by scatter-hoarding rodents. We therefore, believe that these and
   perhaps other seed traits should interactively influence this important
   plant-rodent interaction. However, how selection operates on seed traits
   to counterbalance these competing interests/factors merits further
   study. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {{95-102}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Increasing performance work in the horse is often associated with a
   reduction in the forage ration and an increase in concentrates, usually
   in the form of high-starch cereal grains. This type of diet has been
   associated with stereotypic behaviours and health problems. High-starch
   diets are also associated with a high glycaemic response, which has been
   hypothesised to cause increased reactivity in horses. The aim of this
   project, therefore, was to evaluate responses of horses to novel stimuli
   and handling tests when fed a high-starch or a high-fibre diet.
   A cross-over design study incorporating 2 x 28 day periods was used to
   evaluate heart rates and behavioural responses during novel stimuli and
   handling tests when horses were fed a high-starch or a high-fibre diet.
   All measures were taken over five equally spaced sample points for each
   period. Data were initially assessed using factor analysis (Varimax
   rotation, SPSS) in order to produce combined traits of behavioural and
   heart rate measurements. A Generalised Linear Mixed Model (Genstat (R)
   edition 15) was used to analyse the effects of diet on mean data (over
   the five samples) for each factor as well as for all individual
   variables. In the handling test, factor 3 (heart rate reactivity) showed
   a significant relationship to diet (F-1,F-3=27.77, p<0.01). The
   individual handling test variables of maximum and average heart rates
   both showed a significant increase when horses were fed the high-starch
   diet compared to the high-fibre diet (F-1,F-3=10.84, p=0.017 and
   F-1,F-3=14.42, p=0.01). In the novel test factor 3 (eating reactivity)
   showed a significant relationship to diet (F-1,F-3=8.02, p=0.03) with
   horses demonstrating more interrupted eating when they were fed the
   high-starch diet compared to the high-fibre diet. The individual novel
   test variables showed that when horses were fed the high-starch diets
   their maximum heart rates were significantly higher (F-1,F-3=15.31,
   p<0.01) compared to the high-fibre diet. The results demonstrate that
   the high-starch diet had some effect on the reactivity and handling
   behaviour of horses, in particular their heart rate reactivity. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Aims: To identify dietary patterns that influence cardiometabolic risk
   among individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in China.
   Methods: Data are from a cross-sectional study of T1D in China (n = 99).
   Dietary intake was assessed using three 24-hour recalls. Reduced rank
   regression was used to identify dietary patterns from a set of 20 food
   groups that maximized the explained variation in glycated hemoglobin A1c
   (HbA1c) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.
   Results: Dietary pattern 1 was characterized by low intakes of wheat
   products and high-fat cakes, and high intakes of beans and pickled
   vegetables. Dietary pattern 2 was characterized by low intakes of
   high-fat cakes, nuts/seeds, fish/shellfish, and teas/coffee, and high
   intakes of rice and eggs. Participants in the highest tertile of dietary
   pattern 1 had significantly (p < 0.05) higher HbA1c and LDL cholesterol
   compared to participants in the lowest tertile: mean difference in HbA1c
   was 1.0 percentage point (11 mmol/mol) and in LDL cholesterol was 0.36

Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{364-375}},

Abstract = {{A striking feature of human decision making is the fourfold pattern of
   risk attitudes, involving risk-averse behavior in situations of unlikely
   losses and likely gains, but risk-seeking behavior in response to likely
   losses and unlikely gains. Current theories to explain this pattern
   assume particular psychological processes to reproduce empirical
   observations, but do not address whether it is adaptive for the decision
   maker to respond to risk in this way. Here, drawing on insights from
   behavioral ecology, we build an evolutionary model of risk-sensitive
   behavior, to investigate whether particular types of environmental
   conditions could favor a fourfold pattern of risk attitudes. We consider
   an individual foraging in a changing environment, where energy is needed
   to prevent starvation and build up reserves for reproduction. The
   outcome, in terms of reproductive value (a rigorous measure of
   evolutionary success), of a one-off choice between a risky and a safe
   gain, or between a risky and a safe loss, determines the risk-sensitive
   behavior we should expect to see in this environment. Our results show
   that the fourfold pattern of risk attitudes may be adaptive in an
   environment in which conditions vary stochastically but are
   autocorrelated in time. In such an environment the current options
   provide information about the likely environmental conditions in the
   future, which affect the optimal pattern of risk sensitivity. Our model
   predicts that risk preferences should be both path dependent and
   affected by the decision maker's current state.}},

Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1128-1138}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In animals with a complex life cycle, larval life-history plasticity is
   likely shaped by the interplay of selective factors in both larval and
   adult stages. A wide interspecific variation in responses to larval time
   constraints imposed by seasonality has been documented. Few studies have
   addressed differences among closely related species in the evolutionary
   trajectories of age and size at metamorphosis and their link with larval
   growth rate under time constraints. None have considered how
   species-specific length of the reproductive season affects larval
   developmental responses to time constraints. We tested in four
   Coenagrion damselfly species whether species with a longer reproductive
   season, facing a smaller threat of missing out on reproduction, react
   less to larval time constraints and pre-winter food shortage by
   accelerating development rate and growth rate, and therefore pay less
   physiological costs. All species increased development and growth rates
   under larval time constraints. The magnitude of this increase negatively
   correlated across species with the length of the reproductive season.
   Under larval time constraints, only the species exhibiting the longest
   reproductive season suffered a delayed emergence and a reduced
   investment in energy storage, yet also showed an increased immune
   function. Under a longer reproductive season, evolution may favor
   compensation for larval constraints after metamorphosis. Growth rate was
   accelerated after pre-winter food shortage to the same extent across
   species; effects on age and mass at emergence also did not differ among
   species. Time constraints associated with the length of the reproductive
   season may predictably contribute to species differences in their
   response to time constraints imposed in the larval stage. Our study adds
   empirical proof that the interplay of selective factors in the larval
   and adult stages may determine life-history plasticity with regard to
   larval time constraints.}},

Abstract = {{People often crave for high-caloric sweet foods when facing stress and
   this `emotional eating' is a most important cause for weight gain and
   obesity. Eating under stress contrasts with the normally expected
   response of a loss of appetite, yet in spite of intensive research from
   neurobiological and cognitive disciplines we still do not know why
   stress or negative affect triggers overeating in so many of us. Since
   the prevalence of overweight and obesity still rises, the discovery of
   crucial risk factors is a most desirable goal of today's research on
   sub-optimal eating habits. This paper summarizes the most relevant
   current knowledge from the (human) literature regarding cognitive and
   biological vulnerabilities for stress-induced emotional eating. A
   (non-systematic) review of the most relevant studies reveals that most
   studies contemplate a rather one-directional way of focusing on either
   cognitive or biological factors, showing inconsistent results. The
   current paper elaborates and/or integrates these findings into a
   biological cognitive interaction model in which a specific combination
   of genetic and cognitive vulnerabilities are thought to increase our
   bio-behavioral response to stress, critically increasing the rewarding
   value of pleasant foods and, hence, emotional eating. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Maternal effects often affect fitness traits, but there is little
   experimental evidence pertaining to their contribution to response to
   selection imposed by novel environments. We studied the evolution of
   maternal effects in Drosophila populations selected for tolerance to
   chronic larval malnutrition. To this end, we performed pairwise
   reciprocal F-1 crosses between six selected (malnutrition tolerant)
   populations and six unselected control populations and assessed the
   effect of cross direction on larval growth and developmental rate, adult
   weight and egg-to-adult viability expressed under the malnutrition
   regime. Each pair of reciprocal crosses revealed large maternal effects
   (possibly including cytoplasmic genetic effects) on at least one trait,
   but the magnitude, sign and which traits were affected varied among
   populations. Thus, maternal effects contributed significantly to the
   response to selection imposed by the malnutrition regime, but these
   changes were idiosyncratic, suggesting a rugged adaptive landscape.
   Furthermore, although the selected populations evolved both faster
   growth and higher viability, the maternal effects on growth rate and
   viability were negatively correlated across populations. Thus, genes
   mediating maternal effects can evolve to partially counteract the
   response to selection mediated by the effects of alleles on their own
   carriers' phenotype, and maternal effects may contribute to evolutionary
   trade-offs between components of offspring fitness.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{522-530}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Personality traits' are behavioural differences between individuals that
   are stable within individuals. Different combinations of personality
   traits can correlate with fitness variation but the mechanisms remain
   unclear. There is the suggestion that personality reflects variation in
   physiology. For example, fast' (bold, active, fast exploring)
   individuals are predicted to maintain a higher metabolic rate than slow'
   animals. A raised metabolic rate can result in a proliferation of
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) which, if unchecked, cause oxidative
   stress. Thus, the extended pace of life theory' predicts that fast'
   individuals will pay higher oxidative costs than slow' ones.
   Alternatively, stress hormones, which are often relatively high in slow'
   individuals, can also cause proliferation of ROS and subsequent
   oxidative damage. Here, we assessed co-variation between personality and
   oxidative profile in wild blue tits. The personality traits neophobia
   (latency to approach food near novel objects), activity level in a novel
   environment and exploratory tendency (controlling for differences in
   activity) assayed in captivity were repeatable within individuals but
   were uncorrelated with each other. Reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs an
   index of pro-oxidant status) and OXY (antioxidant capacity) were also
   uncorrelated with each other and did not vary with age or sex. Blood
   sampling birds within three minutes of capture from their familiar cage
   vs. after 15min of exposure to a standardized stressor did not affect
   ROMs or OXY. Wintering blue tits that were both highly neophobic and
   exploratory had low OXY defences and individuals that showed low
   neophobia and low exploration had high OXY defences. Variation in ROMs
   was not explained by any personality trait. High exploratory tendency
   also correlated with a reduction in body condition in captivity, but
   body condition did not predict ROMs or OXY. Activity level in the
   exploration trial did not vary with oxidative profile or change in body
   condition. Personality types differed in antioxidant defences, and it
   was the combination of an individual's personality traits that proved
   important. ROS production and antioxidant defences will vary due to many
   processes for example resource allocation, not just metabolic rate and
   stress responsiveness. Consequently, the costs of personality traits and
   thus the predictions regarding fitness are complex.}},

Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{98}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This protocol describes the modified hole board (mHB), which combines
   features from a traditional hole board and open field and is designed to
   measure multiple dimensions of unconditioned behavior in small
   laboratory mammals (e.g., mice, rats, tree shrews and small primates).
   This paradigm is a valuable alternative for the use of a behavioral test
   battery, since a broad behavioral spectrum of an animal's behavioral
   profile can be investigated in one single test.
   The apparatus consists of a box, representing the `protected' area,
   separated from a group compartment. A board, on which small cylinders
   are staggered in three lines, is placed in the center of the box,
   representing the `unprotected' area of the set-up. The cognitive
   abilities of the animals can be measured by baiting some cylinders on
   the board and measuring the working and reference memory. Other
   unconditioned behavior, such as activity-related-, anxiety-related-and
   social behavior, can be observed using this paradigm. Behavioral
   flexibility and the ability to habituate to a novel environment can
   additionally be observed by subjecting the animals to multiple trials in
   the mHB, revealing insight into the animals' adaptive capacities.
   Due to testing order effects in a behavioral test battery, naive animals
   should be used for each individual experiment. By testing multiple
   behavioral dimensions in a single paradigm and thereby circumventing
   this issue, the number of experimental animals used is reduced.
   Furthermore, by avoiding social isolation during testing and without the
   need to food deprive the animals, the mHB represents a behavioral test
   system, inducing if any, very low amount of stress.}},

   CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (n = 442, response rate =
   82.2\%); six semi-structured school and community focus groups (n = 44);
   school site visits (n = 11); and BMI screening (n = 550, response rate =
   69.7\%).
   Results: One third of children in McDowell County meet the national PA
   minimum of 60 minutes daily. At least 40\% of 5th and 8th graders engage
   in electronic screen activity for 3 hours or more every day. The
   prevalence of obesity in 5th graders is higher in McDowell County than
   the rest of WV (similar to 55\% vs. 47\% respectively). SWOT analyses of
   focus group data suggest an overall interest in PA but also highlight a
   need for increase in structured PA opportunities. Focus group data also
   suggested that a central communication (e.g. internet-based) platform
   would be beneficial to advertise and boost participation both in current
   and future programs. Schools were commonly mentioned as potential
   facilities for public PA participation throughout the county, both with
   regards to access and convenience. School site visits suggest that
   schools need more equipment and resources for before, during, and after
   school programs.
   Conclusions: An overwhelming majority of participants in the McDowell
   CHOICES needs assessment were interested to participate in more PA
   programs throughout the county as well as to improve opportunities for
   the provision of such programs. Public schools were widely recognized as
   the hub of the communities and provide the best venue for PA promotion
   for both students and adult citizens, and can potentially serve as a
   platform for change in rural communities such as McDowell County.}},

Title = {{Response of Moose Hunters to Predation following Wolf Return in Sweden}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 8}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Predation and hunter harvest constitute the main mortality factors
   affecting the size and dynamics of many exploited populations. The
   re-colonization by wolves (Canis lupus) of the Scandinavian Peninsula
   may therefore substantially reduce hunter harvest of moose (Alces
   alces), the main prey of wolves.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We examined possible effects of wolf presence on hunter harvest in areas
   where we had data before and after wolf establishment (n = 25), and in
   additional areas that had been continuously exposed to wolf predation
   during at least ten years (n = 43). There was a general reduction in the
   total number of moose harvested (n = 31,827) during the ten year study
   period in all areas irrespective of presence of wolves or not. However,
   the reduction in hunter harvest was stronger within wolf territories
   compared to control areas without wolves. The reduction in harvest was
   larger in small (500-800 km(2)) compared to large (1,200-1,800 km(2))
   wolf territories. In areas with newly established wolf territories moose
   management appeared to be adaptive with regard to both managers (hunting
   quotas) and to hunters (actual harvest). In these areas an instant
   reduction in moose harvest over-compensated the estimated number of
   moose killed annually by wolves and the composition of the hunted
   animals changed towards a lower proportion of adult females.
   Conclusions/Significance
   We show that the re-colonization of wolves may result in an almost
   instant functional response by another large predator-humans-that
   reduced the potential for a direct numerical effect on the density of
   wolves' main prey, the moose. Because most of the worlds' habitat that
   will be available for future colonization by large predators are likely
   to be strongly influenced by humans, human behavioural responses may
   constitute a key trait that govern the impact of large predators on
   their prey.}},

Abstract = {{Innovations and problem-solving abilities can provide animals with
   important ecological advantages as they allow individuals to deal with
   novel social and ecological challenges. Innovation is a solution to a
   novel problem or a novel solution to an old problem, with the latter
   being especially difficult. Finding a new solution to an old problem
   requires individuals to inhibit previously applied solutions to invent
   new strategies and to behave flexibly. We examined the role of
   experience on cognitive flexibility to innovate and to find new
   problem-solving solutions with an artificial feeding task in wild
   redfronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons). Four groups of lemurs were tested
   with feeding boxes, each offering three different techniques to extract
   food, with only one technique being available at a time. After the
   subjects learned a technique, this solution was no longer successful and
   subjects had to invent a new technique. For the first transition between
   task 1 and 2, subjects had to rely on their experience of the previous
   technique to solve task 2. For the second transition, subjects had to
   inhibit the previously learned technique to learn the new task 3. Tasks
   1 and 2 were solved by most subjects, whereas task 3 was solved by only
   a few subjects. In this task, besides behavioral flexibility, especially
   persistence, i.e., constant trying, was important for individual success
   during innovation. Thus, wild strepsirrhine primates are able to
   innovate flexibly, suggesting a general ecological relevance of
   behavioral flexibility and persistence during innovation and problem
   solving across all primates.}},

Abstract = {{Parental care often produces a trade-off between meeting nutritional
   demands of offspring and the duties of offspring protection, especially
   in altricial species. Parents have to leave their young unattended for
   foraging trips, during which nestlings are exposed to predators. We
   investigated how rodent mothers of altricial young respond to risk of
   nest predation in their foraging decisions. We studied foraging behavior
   of lactating bank voles (Myodes glareolus) exposed to a nest predator,
   the common shrew (Sorex araneus). We conducted the experiment in summer
   (high resource provisioning for both species) and autumn (less food
   available) in 12 replicates with fully crossed factors ``shrew
   presence{''} and ``season.{''} We monitored use of feeding stations near
   and far from the nest as measurement of foraging activity and strategic
   foraging behavior. Vole mothers adapted their strategies to shrew
   presence and optimized their foraging behavior according to seasonal
   constraints, resulting in an interaction of treatment and season. In
   summer, shrew presence reduced food intake from feeding stations, while
   it enhanced intake in autumn. Shrew presence decreased the number of
   visited feeding stations in autumn and concentrated mother's foraging
   efforts to fewer stations. Independent of shrew presence or season,
   mothers foraged more in patches further away from the nest than near the
   nest. Results indicate that females are not investing in nest guarding
   but try to avoid the accumulation of olfactory cues near the nest
   leading a predator to the young. Additionally, our study shows how
   foraging strategies and nest attendance are influenced by seasonal food
   provision.}},

Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{147-151}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Despite a rising interest in behavioural syndromes (correlations between
   different behaviours across context and time), the development of these
   syndromes is not well understood. Using the swordtail fish Xiphophorus
   multilineatus, we looked at the effects of maternal investment and
   social environment during development on the formation of a behavioural
   syndrome. A previous study demonstrated that the diet on which mothers
   were reared, controlling for their size, influenced the growth rate and
   size of their sons: females reared on high-quality diets had sons that
   grew faster and were larger at sexual maturity. In addition, males that
   were exposed to an adult male during development grew faster. We
   examined the behaviours of these same males across two contexts:
   aggression towards a mirror image and boldness under threat of
   predation. We detected an influence of maternal investment but not of
   social environment on the formation of a behavioural syndrome. The sons
   of mothers reared on high-quality diets exhibited a positive correlation
   between boldness and aggression, while there was no correlation among
   the sons of mothers reared on low-quality diets. Maternal investment
   influenced the formation of the syndrome by producing changes in only
   one of the behaviours, the behaviour most closely linked to energy
   acquisition (boldness under risk of predation) rather than energy
   expenditure (aggression). Our results suggest that energy balances could
   help predict the circumstances that would favour the formation of
   behavioural syndromes. Our results also support the hypothesis that
   behaviours involved in energy acquisition as compared to energy use will
   be more sensitive to fluctuations in variation in resources. (C) 2015

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{153-160}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The trade-off between starvation and predation risk is of paramount
   importance to songbirds and many other small organisms. A contaminant
   with metabolic or neurological effects may hinder a bird's ability to
   manage these ecological risks, which are contingent on metabolic state
   and require cognitive assessments. Methylmercury (MeHg) is a ubiquitous
   pollutant that is associated with neurotoxicity, reproductive failure,
   altered behaviour and increased mortality in aquatic organisms. It was
   recently discovered that MeHg can enter terrestrial food webs and affect
   songbirds that eat contaminated invertebrates. Research on behavioural
   effects of environmentally relevant doses of MeHg in songbirds is a
   conservation priority as this pollutant is widespread, poorly regulated,
   increasing and understudied in terms of sublethal effects such as
   abnormal behaviours. To help close this knowledge gap, we examined how
   MeHg affects behavioural strategies in captive zebra finches,
   Taeniopygia guttata. We quantified the birds' responses to risk by
   measuring regulation of body mass, vigilance behaviour, willingness to
   move away from dense cover in search of food and reluctance to return to
   foraging after a disturbance. Dosed and undosed birds were placed in an
   experimental arena and were videorecorded over 3 days of increasing
   perception of predation risk. We found that MeHg-exposed birds, compared
   to control birds, (1) lost significantly more mass and (2) waited
   significantly longer to forage under the highest predation risk. Our
   results indicate that MeHg-exposed birds may react more strongly to
   threat of predation and thereby increase their risk of starvation. To
   our knowledge this is the first mechanistic study of how a pervasive
   pollutant may alter optimal decision making, and therefore potentially
   survival, in songbirds. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal

Volume = {{218}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural innovation and morphological adaptation are intrinsically
   linked but their relationship is often poorly understood. In nematodes,
   a huge diversity of feeding morphologies and behaviours can be observed
   to meet their distinctive dietary and environmental demands.
   Pristionchus and their relatives show varied feeding activities, both
   consuming bacteria and also predating other nematodes. In addition,
   Pristionchus nematodes display dimorphic mouth structures triggered by
   an irreversible developmental switch, which generates a narrower mouthed
   form with a single tooth and a wider mouthed form with an additional
   tooth. However, little is known about the specific predatory adaptations
   of these mouth forms or the associated mechanisms and behaviours.
   Through a mechanistic analysis of predation behaviours, in particular in
   the model organism Pristionchus pacificus, we reveal multifaceted
   feeding modes characterised by dynamic rhythmic switching and tooth
   stimulation. This complex feeding mode switch is regulated by the
   neurotransmitter serotonin in a previously uncharacterised role, a
   process that appears conserved across several predatory nematode
   species. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of starvation, prey
   size and prey preference on P. pacificus predatory feeding kinetics,
   revealing predation to be a fundamental component of the P. pacificus
   feeding repertoire, thus providing an additional rich source of
   nutrition in addition to bacteria. Finally, we found that mouth form
   morphology also has a striking impact on predation, suppressing
   predatory behaviour in the narrow mouthed form. Our results therefore
   hint at the regulatory networks involved in controlling predatory
   feeding and underscore P. pacificus as a model for understanding the
   evolution of complex behaviours.}},

Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{32-35}},

Abstract = {{Bean weevil, Acanthoscelides obtectus (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae,
   Bruchinae) is a cosmopolitan pest of legume stored products. Storages
   with various legume seeds can facilitate shifts of the weevil from its
   primary host, common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L), to other legume
   species and enable host expansion, i.e. broadening of the range of
   acceptable plant-hosts. In the first generation of host shift, survival
   of an insect depends on ability to adjust its physiology to altered
   content of nutrients and secondary metabolites in novel host. On a
   long-term scale, physiological adaptations to a new host can comprise
   modifications both in level and plasticity of physiological traits.
   Changes in activity of phosphatases play an essential role in this
   process due to their involvement in diverse functions. This study
   investigated alterations in activity of total acid, lysosomal acid and
   alkaline phosphatases using laboratory populations of A. obtectus which
   were maintained either on the optimal host (common bean) or on the
   suboptimal host (chickpea, Cicer arietinum L.) for 28 years. To
   determine short-term (plastic) effects, subsets of individuals from each
   population were exposed to the alternative host for one generation. Our
   results revealed that one-generation shift to chickpea significantly
   increased phosphatases' activity reflecting immediate plastic response
   to nutritional/allelochemical stress where these enzymes might be
   involved in defense mechanisms. On the other hand, both level and
   plasticity of phosphatases' activities significantly declined as a
   long-term response to Cicer-based diet suggesting that selection on
   chickpea favored resistance mechanisms that were less costly than
   phosphatases. Considering diverse roles of phosphatases we suggest that
   such modifications could be crucial for expanding host range and might
   have implications on efficiency of chemical and botanical insecticides.

Abstract = {{This paper examines the impact of consumer confusion on nutrition
   knowledge, literacy, and dietary behavior. While previous research
   largely focuses on understanding why consumers might not respond to
   healthy eating communications, this paper seeks to uncover the various
   behavioral responses to such campaigns, particularly those that
   contravene health communication objectives. Using an interpretive
   methodology, findings suggest that most participants do respond to
   health communications by striving to eat healthily, but inadequate
   nutrition information derived from unreliable sources, flawed baseline
   nutrition knowledge, and poor nutrition literacy hinder participants'
   efforts. Inconsistent, incomplete, and contradictory information leaves
   many participants feeling confused about how to implement healthy eating
   habits. Further, a lack of ability to differentiate between credible and
   unreliable sources of nutrition information means that many participants
   blame their confusion on policymakers, and express frustration and
   cynicism toward vague and often contradictory communications. This, in
   turn, increases participants' reliance on food adverts, product labels,
   and other commercial sources of ambiguous yet appealing information. The
   paper's theoretical contribution includes a consumer confusion framework
   for healthy eating, and policy implications highlight that health
   campaigns seeking to increase consumer awareness of healthy eating are
   not enough. Policymakers must become the most credible sources of
   information about healthy eating, and distinguish themselves from
   competing and unreliable sources of nutrition information.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 13}},
Abstract = {{Strategic ejaculation is a behavioural strategy shown by many animals as
   a response to sperm competition and/or as a potential mechanism of
   cryptic male choice. Males invest more mating resources when the risk of
   sperm competition increases or they invest more in high quality females
   to maximize their reproductive output. We tested this hypothesis in the
   false garden mantid Pseudomantis albofimbriata, where females are
   capable of multiply mating and body condition is an indicator of
   potential reproductive fitness. We predicted male mantids would
   ejaculate strategically by allocating more sperm to high quality
   females. To determine if and how males alter their ejaculate in response
   to mate quality, we manipulated female food quantity so that females
   were either in good condition with many eggs (i.e. high quality) or poor
   condition with few eggs (i.e. low quality). Half of the females from
   each treatment were used in mating trials in which transferred sperm was
   counted before fertilisation occurred and the other half of females were
   used in mating trials where fertilisation occurred and ootheca mass and
   total eggs in the ootheca were recorded. Opposed to our predictions, the
   total number of sperm and the proportion of viable sperm transferred did
   not vary significantly between female treatments. Male reproductive
   success was entirely dependent on female quality/fecundity, rather than
   on the number of sperm transferred. These results suggest that female
   quality is not a major factor influencing postcopulatory male mating
   strategies in P. albofimbriata, and that sperm number has little effect
   on male reproductive success in a single mating scenario.}},

Title = {{Brain size and urbanization in birds}},
Journal = {{AVIAN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Brain size may affect the probability of invasion of urban
   habitats if a relatively larger brain entails superior ability to adapt
   to novel environments. However, once urbanized urban environments may
   provide poor quality food that has negative consequences for normal
   brain development resulting in an excess of individuals with small
   brains.
   Methods: Here we analyze the independent effects of mean, standard
   deviation and skewness in brain mass for invasion of urban habitats by
   108 species of birds using phylogenetic multiple regression analyses
   weighted by sample size.
   Results: There was no significant difference in mean brain mass between
   urbanized and non-urbanized species or between urban and rural
   populations of the same species, and mean brain mass was not
   significantly correlated with time since urbanization. Bird species that
   became urbanized had a greater standard deviation in brain mass than
   non-urbanized species, and the standard deviation in brain mass
   increased with time since urbanization. Brain mass was significantly
   left skewed in species that remained rural, while there was no
   significant skew in urbanized species. The degree of left skew was
   greater in urban than in rural populations of the same species, and
   successfully urbanized species decreased the degree of left skew with
   time since urbanization. This is consistent with the hypothesis that
   sub-optimal brain development was more common in rural habitats
   resulting in disproportionately many individuals with very small brains.
   Conclusions: These findings do not support the hypothesis that large
   brains promote urbanization, but suggest that skewness has played a role
   in the initial invasion of urban habitats, and that variance and skew in
   brain mass have increased as species have become urbanized.}},

Abstract = {{Objective personality tests, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic
   Personality Inventory (MMPI), might be more sensitive to reflect
   subclinical personality and be more state-dependent in an individual's
   lifetime, so they are good scales to predict the psychological distress
   regarding certain states. The aim of this study was to identify the
   specific pattern between body mass index (BMI) and psychological
   distress using the objective personality test. For this study, we
   investigated BMI and the Korean Military Multiphasic Personality
   Inventory (MPI). A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted
   with 19-yr-old examinees who were admitted to the Military Manpower
   Administration in Korea from February 2007 to January 2010. Of 1,088,107
   examinees, we enrolled 771,408 subjects who were psychologically
   apparent healthy possible-military-service groups. Afterwards, we
   reviewed and analyzed directly measured BMI and MPI results. In terms of
   the validity scales, the faking-good subscale showed an inverted
   U-shaped association, and faking-bad and infrequency subscales showed a
   U-shaped association with BMI groups. In terms of the neurosis scales,
   all clinical subscales (anxiety, depression, somatization, and
   personality disorder) also showed a U-shaped association with BMI
   groups. For the psychopath scales, the schizophrenia subscale showed a
   U-shaped association, and the paranoia subscale showed a near-positive
   correlation with BMI. In conclusion, a specific U-shaped pattern was
   observed between BMI and the MPI in 19-yr-old men in Korea. Underweight
   and obesity are related to psychological distress, so supportive advice
   and education are needed to them.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Overeating and obesity are associated with impulsivity. In
   studies among patients with a substance use disorder, impulsivity was
   found to be associated with substance-related attentional bias. This
   study examined whether obesity, impulsivity and food craving are
   associated with an attentional bias for high-calorie food. Methods:
   Obese (n = 185, mean BMI = 38.18 +/- 6.17) and matched healthy-weight (n
   = 134, mean BMI = 22.35 +/- 1.63) men (27.9\%) and women (72.1\%), aged
   18-45 years, took part in the study. Participants were tested on several
   self-report and behavioral measures of impulsivity (i.e., response
   inhibition and reward sensitivity) and self-reported trait craving. In
   addition, they performed a visual search task to measure attentional
   bias for high-and low-caloric foods. Results: Self-reported impulsivity
   influenced the relationship between weight status and detection speed of
   high-and low-caloric food items: High-impulsive participants with
   obesity were significantly faster than high-impulsive healthy-weight
   participants in detecting a high-caloric food item among neutral items,
   whereas no such difference was observed among low-impulsive
   participants. No significant effects were found on low-caloric food
   items, for trait craving or any of the behavioral measures of
   impulsivity. Conclusion: Self-reported impulsivity, but not trait
   craving or behavioral measures of impulsivity, is associated with an
   attentional bias for high-caloric foods, but only in people with
   obesity. It is in particular the speedy detection of high-caloric foods
   in the environment that characterizes the impulsive person with obesity,
   which in turn may cause risky eating patterns in a society were
   high-caloric food is overly present.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesSubjective halitosis is a growing concern in the fields of
   dentistry and psychology. This study was designed to determine the
   association between subjective halitosis and contributing psychological
   factors.
   MethodsData for this cross-sectional study were gathered from 4,763
   participants who had answered questions on subjective halitosis and
   psychological factors (depression, anxiety, stress and personality
   traits) in the study on the epidemiology of psychological, alimentary
   health and nutrition (SEPAHAN). Binary logistic regression was used for
   data analysis.
   ResultThe mean age of all subjects was 36.58years; and the majority of
   subjects were female (55.8\%), married (81.2\%) and graduates (57.2\%).
   The prevalence of subjective halitosis was 52.8\%. The majority of
   subjects with the complaint of subjective halitosis were married
   (P<0.001) and young (P=0.07). Participants with subjective halitosis
   were significantly more anxious {[}odds ratio (OR)=1.76, 95\% confidence

   depressed (OR=1.31, 95\% CI:1.09-1.57). Among personality traits,
   neuroticism was a risk factor (tertile 1 vs. tertile 2: OR=1.29, 95\%
   CI:1.09-1.51; and tertile 1 vs. tertile 3: OR=1.74, 95\% CI:1.43-2.13)

   considered as risk factors for subjective halitosis. Multidisciplinary
   efforts by dental and psychological professionals must be considered to

Abstract = {{`Fight-or-flight' stress responses allow animals to cope adaptively to
   sudden threats by mobilizing energy resources and priming the body for
   action. Because such responses can be costly and redirect behavior and
   energy from reproduction to survival, they are likely to be shaped by
   specific life-history stages, depending on the available energy
   resources and the commitment to reproduction. Here, we consider how
   heart rate (HR) responses to acute stressors are affected by the
   advancing breeding season in a colonial seabird, the king penguin
   (Aptenodytes patagonicus). We subjected 77 birds (44 males, 33 females)
   at various stages of incubation and chick-rearing to three experimental
   stressors (metal sound, distant approach and capture) known to vary both
   in their intensity and associated risk, and monitored their HR
   responses. Our results show that HR increase in response to acute
   stressors was progressively attenuated with the stage of breeding from
   incubation to chick-rearing. Stress responses did not vary according to
   nutritional status or seasonal timing (whether breeding was initiated
   early or late in the season), but were markedly lower during
   chick-rearing than during incubation. This pattern was obvious for all
   three stressors. We discuss how `fight-or-flight' responses may be
   modulated by considering the energy commitment to breeding, nutritional
   status and reproductive value of the brood in breeding seabirds.}},

Abstract = {{Some seabird species have learnt to efficiently exploit fishing discards
   from trawling activities. However, a discard ban has been proposed as
   necessary in Europe to ensure the sustainability of the seas. It is of
   crucial importance for the management and conservation purposes to study
   the potential consequences of a discard ban on the foraging ecology of
   threatened seabirds. We assessed the influence of fishing activities on
   the feeding habits of 22 male and 15 female Audouin's gulls (Larus
   audouinii) from the Ebro Delta (Mediterranean Sea) during the breeding
   period using GPS loggers together with Stable Isotope Analysis (SIA),
   which provided new insights into their foraging behavior and trophic
   ecology, respectively. GPS data revealed different sex-specific foraging
   patterns between workdays and weekends. Females were highly consistent
   in that they foraged at sea throughout the week even though discarding
   stops at weekends. In contrast, males switched from foraging at sea
   during the week (when discards are produced) to an increased use of rice
   field habitats at weekends (when fishermen do not work). This
   sex-specific foraging behavior could be related to specific nutritional
   requirements associated with previous egg production, an energetically
   demanding period for females. However, on a broader time scale
   integrated by the SIA, both sexes showed a high degree of individual
   specialization in their trophic ecology. The need to obtain detailed
   information on the dependence and response of seabirds to fishing
   activities is crucial in conservation sciences. In this regard,
   sex-specific foraging behavior in relation to fisheries has been
   overlooked, despite the ecological and conservation implications. For
   instance, this situation may lead to sex differentiation in bycatch
   mortality in longlines when trawlers do not operate. Moreover, any new
   fisheries policy will need to be implemented gradually to facilitate the
   adaptation of a specialized species to a discard ban scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Species interactions are often context dependent, where outcomes vary in
   response to one or more environmental factors. It remains unclear how
   abiotic conditions like temperature combine with biotic factors such as
   consumer density or food quality to affect resource availability or
   influence species interactions. Using the large grasshopper Melanoplus
   bivittatus (Say) and a common wolf spider {[}Rabidosa rabida
   (Walkenaer)], we conducted manipulative field experiments in tallgrass
   prairie to examine how spider-grasshopper interactions respond to
   manipulations of temperature, grasshopper density, and food quality.
   Grasshopper survival was density dependent, as were the effects of
   spider presence and food quality in context-dependent ways. In high
   grasshopper density treatments, predation resulted in increased
   grasshopper survival, likely as a result of reduced intraspecific
   competition in the presence of spiders. Spiders had no effect on
   grasshopper survival when grasshoppers were stocked at low densities.
   Effects of the experimental treatments were often interdependent so that
   effects were only observed when examined together with other treatments.
   The occurrence of trophic cascades was context dependent, where the
   effects of food quality and spider presence varied with temperature
   under high-density treatments. Temperature weakly affected the impact of
   spider presence on Melanoplus bivittatus survivorship when all
   treatments were considered simultaneously, but different
   context-dependent responses to spider presence and food quality were
   observed among the three temperature treatments under highdensity
   conditions. Our results indicate that context-dependent species
   interactions are common and highlight the importance of understanding
   how key biotic and abiotic factors combine to influence species

Abstract = {{AimThe hospital environment as a workplace has undergone rapid changes
   over the last 50 years. Despite this, there has been very little
   research exploring how dietitians working in hospitals perceive their
   workplace. Moreover, previous studies in this area have focused
   predominantly on examining the North American experience of dietitians.
   Only a handful of previous studies have investigated the experiences of
   Australian dietitians at different stages of their careers. Therefore
   this study, in part, addresses a gap in the extant literature by
   examining how New South Wales (NSW) public-hospital dietitians perceive
   their workplace and its influence on their ability to function as
   healthcare professionals.
   MethodsIn 2011, 32 in-depth interviews were conducted with dietitians
   from 11 NSW public hospitals. Participants were selected from four
   career stages: new graduates, mid-career, specialists and managers. Data
   from the interviews were analysed through a grounded theory approach.
   ResultsData analysis revealed that dietitians sought validation of their
   work experience from five sources within the workplace. In this paper,
   these five sources have been depicted as a conceptual model labelled the
   Five Sources of Value'. The five sources identified were: acquisition of
   knowledge; relationships with others; work culture; role clarity; and
   personal attributes. This study also found the relative importance of
   these values changed according to the career stage of the individual
   dietitian.
   ConclusionsThe retention and engagement of staff within a hospital
   environment is an ongoing issue for dietetic managers. The Five Sources
   of Value' identified through this study and their relative influence at
   different career stages may assist managers in developing workplace
   strategies that addresses the major areas of concern for many staff. As
   a result of the qualitative nature of this exploratory study, the
   generalisability of the findings are limited. To address this
   limitation, future research may follow a more quantitative approach.}},

Abstract = {{Recruitment success in living marine resources is variable due to high
   survival variability of early life stages. Improving our understanding
   of how environmental and ecological factors mechanistically interact and
   influence larval fish growth and survival is necessary to better predict
   year-class strength and expected physiological and behavioural responses
   to climate warming. We use a state-dependent optimality model for the
   behaviour of larval Atlantic cod Gadus morhua to analyse trade-offs
   related to growth and survival. Temperature-dependent maximum growth
   rates and vertical profiles of temperature and stochastic prey
   availability are used as inputs within a mechanistic modelling framework
   that finds optimal behavioural strategies of vertical migration and
   foraging activity. The fitness criterion used is maximization of
   survival probability until the larvae reach a given body size (15 mm).
   Detailed descriptions of predation, physiology, growth and survival of
   larval cod emerge from simulations of the optimal strategies. The model
   shows that the effect of temperature on survival is complex. Increasing
   temperature may lead to faster growth and higher survival, but only when
   there is sufficient food. In poor food environments, higher temperatures
   make larvae more susceptible to predation as they take higher risks to
   satisfy their metabolic costs. Overall, these results suggest that
   larval Atlantic cod, especially those from warmer-water stocks, may
   experience reduced survival and recruitment in climate-change scenarios
   that predict both elevated temperatures and reduced food supply.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the drivers of complex systems is a major challenge felt by
   virtually all of biology. For complex societies, there is considerable
   interest in how individuals' traits determine their social roles and how
   the milieu of trait variants within groups shapes emergent group-level
   phenotypes. In this study, we tested in spiders whether individual
   differences in behaviour, morphology, or both shape individuals'
   participation in foraging. We then tested which aspects of group
   composition (e. g. morphological composition, personality composition,
   group size) predict colony-level foraging and escape behaviour. We
   performed these studies both under (1) standardized laboratory
   conditions, where colonies' ability to build webs was constrained, and
   (2) under more free-living conditions in the field. Regardless of the
   laboratory/field distinction, we found that individual task
   participation was regulated by individuals' body size and group size:
   larger individuals and individuals in smaller groups tended to
   participate more in foraging tasks. At the colony level, colonies
   composed of bolder spiders attacked prey with a larger number of
   attackers regardless of the laboratory/field distinction. However, our
   field assessments of colony foraging revealed that the speed with which
   colonies responded to prey was determined by their group size,
   morphological composition and personality composition; none of these
   effects were detected under laboratory conditions. Finally, we found
   that colonies took longer to retreat from aversive stimuli when more
   spiders were outside the nest. Taken together, our results suggest that
   colonies' social organization and collective behaviour are determined by
   spiders' morphology, behavioural tendencies and colony demographics. The

Abstract = {{Although capture, handling and marking of birds as well as taking
   samples from them are ubiquitous and, in most cases, unavoidable
   procedures in ornithological research, their immediate effects on the
   individuals remain largely unstudied. Here, we present data over 3 years
   from a long-term field study on the breeding biology of the blue tit.
   Parents were captured at the nest when feeding 9-11-day-old young. For
   all birds, we measured the time of their first visit to the nest after
   capture and could thus establish their latency of return to the nest.
   After capture, parents stayed away a surprisingly long time (average 4.2
   h, up to 18 h) and nests were not visited by either parent for a
   duration that almost never occurred under natural conditions. Parental
   return latencies were strongly associated with previous captures. Birds
   caught, marked and sampled previously returned on average 4.4 h earlier
   than new birds. Still these birds took on average 1.9 h to return. Thus,
   capture itself can have strong effects on immediate behaviour. Once the
   birds returned to the nest, the time between nest visits was similar to
   that observed before capture, indicating that birds resumed normal
   feeding activities. Return latencies of parents and the time nests were
   left alone had no long-term effects on offspring or breeding success. We
   discuss possible causes of delayed parental return and methodological
   implications. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal

Title = {{Foraging mode switching: the importance of prey distribution and
   foraging currency}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{121-137}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Foraging methods are highly variable, but can be grouped into two modes:
   searching and ambush. While research has focused on the functioning of
   each mode, the question of how animals choose which to use has been
   largely neglected. Here we consider a forager that exploits prey that
   are patchily distributed in space and time. This forager can either sit
   and wait for prey to appear or search for prey, which is more likely to
   result in encounters with prey but costs more energy and/or exposes the
   forager to greater predation risk. The currency that natural selection
   appears to have optimized will be determined by the additional costs of
   searching and whether there is a risk of starvation. We therefore
   compare the predictions of models based on currencies that consider only
   energy and predation risk to state-dependent models in which energy
   reserves are used to trade off predation rate, starvation rate and
   investment in growth. The choice of currency qualitatively affects how
   mode should change when prey abundance and prey patchiness increase. We
   show how differing prey distributions can explain variation in effects
   of experimentally increasing prey abundance. Our work has several
   implications for the study of foraging mode, population dynamics and the
   methods used to assess population size. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published

Title = {{Exploration costs promote conservative collective foraging in the social
   caterpillar Malacosoma disstria}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{245-250}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Collective choices of a food source are generally thought to arise from
   the amplification of individual preferences. However, costs associated
   with foraging can also influence food choice: animals faced with a
   poor-quality food source may either continue feeding on it (a
   conservative strategy), or search for a potentially more profitable one
   (a more risky strategy). Groups of nomadic, trail-following Malacosoma
   disstria caterpillars were offered a leaf of two different hosts, either
   side by side to determine preference, or at a distance to investigate
   how exploration costs affect food choice. Arenas with and without
   pheromone trails were used to distinguish between direct travel costs
   and unknown territory costs. When two leaves were side by side, groups
   of second-instar caterpillars showed clear preferences between host
   trees, whereas groups of fourth-instar larvae did not. When the two
   leaves were distant from each other, groups of second-instar
   caterpillars usually remained on the known source, irrespective of food
   preference or group size. These groups were more likely to relocate to a
   preferred food source when pheromone trails were present, suggesting
   that trails effectively decrease unknown territory costs. Groups of
   fourth-instar caterpillars were more likely to leave the known food
   source even when no trail was present, suggesting a developmental shift
   in costs associated with exploration. Our results show that collective
   choices reflect food preference when exploration costs are low
   (second-instar larvae with pheromone trails), but not when they are high
   (second-instar larvae without trails). Such a conservative foraging
   strategy can be adaptive if the exploration costs of leaving a known
   food source are greater than the potential benefits of discovering a
   better alternative, for example, in a homogenous environment like that
   of a tree. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{As landscapes across the globe experience increasing human development,
   it is critical to identify the behavioral responses of wildlife to this
   change given associated shifts in resource availability and risk from
   human activity. This is particularly important for large carnivores as
   their interactions with people are often a source of conflict, which can
   impede conservation efforts and require extensive management. To examine
   the adaptations of a large carnivore to benefits and risks associated
   with human development we investigated black bear behavior in three
   systems in the western United States. Our objectives were to (1)
   identify temporal patterns of selection for development within a year
   and across years based on natural food conditions, (2) compare spatial
   patterns of selection for development across systems, and (3) examine
   individual characteristics associated with increased selection for
   development. Using mixed effects resource selection models we found that
   bear selection for development was highly dynamic, varying as a function
   of changing environmental and physiological conditions. Bears increased
   their use of development in years when natural foods were scarce,
   throughout the summer-fall, as they aged, and as a function of gender,
   with males exhibiting greater use of development. While patterns were
   similar across systems, bears at sites with poorer quality habitat
   selected development more consistently than bears at sites with higher
   quality habitat. Black bears appear to use development largely for food
   subsidy, suggesting that conflicts with bears, and potentially other
   large carnivores, will increase when the physiological demand for
   resources outweighs risks associated with human activity. Published by

Abstract = {{Survival and the underlying causes of mortality are key demographic
   parameters for understanding animal population dynamics and identifying
   conservation needs. Here we use a large data set of tagged wild
   pin-tailed sandgrouse (Pterocles alchata) to examine the influence of
   individual traits (age, sex, size, movements and reproduction), and of
   temporal and spatial variations on the survival of this steppe-bird of
   conservation concern in Europe. Annual survival for adults and juveniles
   was estimated at 0.60 and 0.61, respectively. Survival rate tended to be
   lower towards the northern margin of the European distribution. In the
   core distribution area (central Spain) mortality was more frequent
   during the non-breeding season due to higher predation rates. Survival
   rate was slightly higher in males than females, which may explain male
   skewed population sex-ratios. Sedentary birds had lower survival than
   birds using different areas for breeding and wintering, indicating that
   high mobility, as a possible behavioural response to varying conditions,
   could eventually increase fitness. Predation was the main cause of
   mortality, but illegal hunting was also recorded, indicating a need for
   stricter law enforcement and regulation plans. Sandgrouse can be
   characterized by a relatively slow life history (medium-high adult
   survival and low reproductive rate), with lower survival rates than
   other sympatric steppe birds of larger size. Management and conservation
   efforts should focus on maintaining a high adult survival within
   protected areas. Sandgrouse mobility, which positively influenced
   survival, should also be taken into account in conservation plans,
   especially when considering the size and connectivity of protected
   areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{136}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Report long-term outcomes of the NOURISH randomized
   controlled trial (RCT), which evaluated a universal intervention
   commencing in infancy to provide anticipatory guidance to first-time
   mothers on ``protective{''} complementary feeding practices that were
   hypothesized to reduce childhood obesity risk.
   METHODS: The NOURISH RCT enrolled 698 mothers (mean age 30.1 years, SD =
   5.3) with healthy term infants (51\% female). Mothers were randomly
   allocated to usual care or to attend two 6-session, 12-week group
   education modules. Outcomes were assessed 5 times: baseline (infants 4.3
   months); 6 months after module 1 (infants 14 months); 6 months after
   module 2 (infants 2 years) and at 3.5 and 5 years of age. Maternal
   feeding practices were self-reported using validated questionnaires. BMI
   Z-score was calculated from measured child height and weight. Linear
   mixed models evaluated intervention (group) effect across time.
   RESULTS: Retention at age 5 years was 61\%. Across ages 2 to 5 years,
   intervention mothers reported less frequent use of nonresponsive feeding
   practices on 6 of 9 scales. At 5 years, they also reported more
   appropriate responses to food refusal on 7 of 12 items (Ps <=.05). No
   statistically significant group effect was noted for anthropometric
   outcomes (BMI Z-score: P =.06) or the prevalence of overweight/obesity
   (control 13.3\% vs intervention 11.4\%, P =.66).
   CONCLUSIONS: Anticipatory guidance on complementary feeding resulted in
   first-time mothers reporting increased use of protective feeding
   practices. These intervention effects were sustained up to 5 years of
   age and were paralleled by a nonsignificant trend for lower child BMI
   Z-scores at all postintervention assessment points.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Research has shown that if a mother experiences a transitory
   perturbation to her environment during pregnancy or lactation, there are
   transgenerational consequences often involving a disordered metabolic
   phenotype in first generation offspring with recovery across subsequent
   generations. In contrast, little is known about the nature of the
   transgenerational response of offspring when a mother experiences a
   perturbation that is not transitory but instead persists across
   generations. Our study, using a rat model, subjected the parental
   generation to a change in environment and concomitant shift from a
   grain-based to obesogenic diets to generate an adipose phenotype in
   first generation offspring emulating a common scenario in human
   urbanisation and migration. We then investigated whether the obese
   phenotype was stable across generations when maintained in the
   transitioned environment, and whether dietary macronutrient balance
   affected the response. We found that second and third generation
   offspring had a reduced body fat to lean mass ratio and a reduced
   appetite relative to first generation offspring, irrespective of dietary
   macronutrient balance. The trajectory of this response is suggestive of
   a reduction in chronic disease risk across generations. This is one of
   the first studies, to our knowledge, to investigate the
   transgenerational response following parental transition to a persistent
   obesogenic environment, and to demonstrate that successive generations
   respond differently to this constant environment.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity and phenotypic stability are major components of
   the adaptive evolution of organisms to environmental variation. The
   invariant two-egg clutch size of Eudyptes penguins has recently been
   proposed to be a unique example of a maladaptive phenotypic stability,
   while their egg mass is a plastic trait. We tested whether this
   phenotypic plasticity during reproduction might result from constraints
   imposed by migration (migratory carry-over effect) and breeding (due to
   the depletion of female body reserves). For the first time, we examined
   whether these constraints differ between eggs within clutches and
   between egg components (yolk and albumen). The interval between colony
   return and clutch initiation positively influenced the yolk mass, the
   albumen mass, and the subsequent total egg mass of first-laid eggs. This
   time interval had only a slight negative influence on the yolk mass of
   second-laid eggs and no influence on their albumen and subsequent total
   masses. For both eggs, female body mass at laying positively influenced
   albumen and total egg masses. Female investment into the entire clutch
   was not related to the time in the colony before laying but increased
   with female body mass. These novel results suggest that the unique
   intraclutch egg size dimorphism exhibited in Eudyptes penguins, with
   first-laid eggs being consistently smaller than second-laid eggs, might
   be due to a combination of constraints: a migratory carry-over effect on
   the first-laid egg and a body reserve depletion effect on the
   second-laid egg. Both these constraints might explain why the timing of
   reproduction, especially egg formation, is narrow in migratory capital
   breeders.}},

Abstract = {{The current study evaluated 17 loads of cull beef cows transported in
   Canadian winter conditions to assess in-transit temperature and
   humidity, evaluation of events during loading and unloading, and animal
   condition and bruising. Regardless of the use of boards to block
   ventilation holes in trailers, temperatures were higher within trailers
   than at ambient locations during both travel and stationary periods (P <
   0.01). Boarding was associated with smaller differences in trailer
   temperature, compared with ambient conditions, while the trailer was
   traveling at highway speeds versus when trailers were stationary (P <
   0.01). Moisture levels within trailers were not different from ambient
   conditions when loads using boarding were traveling (P < 0.01), whereas
   loads without boarding had a larger difference (P < 0.01). The moisture
   within trailers relative to ambient conditions increased when trailers
   were stationary compared with traveling when boarding was used (P <
   0.01). The majority of cattle transported were in good body condition
   (97.4\% within BCS of 2 to 3.5) and had calm temperaments (96.7\%).
   Although all comparisons were made, only the dog-house compartment had
   an increased risk of severe bruising compared with all other
   compartments (odds ratio {[}95\% confidence interval]: 3.0 {[}1.6-5.5],
   3.7 {[}2.16.4], 2.2 {[}1.3-3.7] and 3.8 {[}1.5-9.6] in comparison with
   the back, belly, deck, and nose compartments, respectively; P < 0.05).
   Increasing the duration of waiting to unload 30 min relative to a 1 h
   duration increased the odds of severe bruising by 1.18 times (95\%
   confidence interval: 1.09-1.29; P < 0.01). Scoring systems that have
   been developed for auditing unloading of cattle had limited variation
   across loads at both loading and unloading. Pretransport assessment of
   animal condition using the American Meat Institute's compromised animal
   score was the only scoring system that was consistent with posttransport
   scores. We inferred from the temperature and humidity data in the
   current study that under commercial conditions, boarding may increase
   ventilation within trailers during travel and decrease ventilation
   during stationary periods. The current study provides the first
   indication that issues in Canadian cull cow transport may be related to
   pretransport animal condition and management of unloading.}},

   availability and in water at three different temperatures (18, 22 and 26
   degrees C), and effects on survival, growth and development were
   quantified. Over the experimental period, larval growth rate was highest
   and survivorship lowest at the warmest temperature. However, changes in
   food availability mediated the effects of temperature, with slower
   larval growth and higher survivorship in stochastic food availability
   treatments. Tadpoles in the stochastic food availability treatments did
   not reach metamorphosis during the experimental period, suggesting that
   developmental stasis may have been induced by food restriction. Overall,
   these results demonstrate that changes in food availability alter the
   effects of water temperature on survival, growth and development. From
   an applied perspective, understanding how environmental factors interact
   to cause phenotypic change may assist with amphibian conservation by
   improving the number of tadpoles generated in captive breeding
   programmes.}},

Abstract = {{Dietary intake of the micronutrient selenium is essential for normal
   immune functions. Selenium is cotranslationally incorporated as the 21st
   amino acid, selenocysteine, into selenoproteins that function to
   modulate pathways involved in inflammation. Epidemiological studies have
   suggested an inverse association between selenium levels and
   inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease and
   ulcerative colitis that can potentially progress to colon cancer.
   However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we
   summarize the current literature on the pathophysiology of IBD, which is
   multifactorial in origin with unknown etiology. We have focused on a few
   selenoproteins that mediate gastrointestinal inflammation and activate
   the host immune response, wherein macrophages play a pivotal role.
   Changes in cellular oxidative state coupled with altered expression of
   selenoproteins in macrophages drive the switch from a proinflammatory
   phenotype to an anti-inflammatory phenotype to efficiently resolve
   inflammation in the gut and restore epithelial barrier integrity. Such a
   phenotypic plasticity is accompanied by changes in cytokines,
   chemokines, and bioactive metabolites, including eicosanoids that not
   only mitigate inflammation but also partake in restoring gut homeostasis
   through diverse pathways involving differential regulation of
   transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa B and peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptor-gamma. The role of the intestinal
   microbiome in modulating inflammation and aiding in selenium-dependent
   resolution of gut injury is highlighted to provide novel insights into
   the beneficial effects of selenium in IBD.}},

Abstract = {{The internal state of an organism influences its perception of
   attractive or aversive stimuli and thus promotes adaptive behaviors that
   increase its likelihood of survival. The mechanisms underlying these
   perceptual shifts are critical to our understanding of how neural
   circuits support animal cognition and behavior. Starved flies exhibit
   enhanced sensitivity to attractive odors and reduced sensitivity to
   aversive odors. Here, we show that a functional remodeling of the
   olfactory map is mediated by two parallel neuromodulatory systems that
   act in opposing directions on olfactory attraction and aversion at the
   level of the first synapse. Short neuropeptide F sensitizes an antennal
   lobe glomerulus wired for attraction, while tachykinin (DTK) suppresses
   activity of a glomerulus wired for aversion. Thus we show parallel
   neuromodulatory systems functionally reconfigure early olfactory
   processing to optimize detection of nutrients at the risk of ignoring
   potentially toxic food resources.}},

Title = {{Long Frontal Projections Help Battus philenor (Lepidoptera:
   Papilionidae) Larvae Find Host Plants}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 29}},
Abstract = {{Animals sometimes develop conspicuous projections on or near their heads
   as, e.g., weaponry, burrowing or digging tools, and probes to search for
   resources. The frontal projections that insects generally use to locate
   and assess resources are segmented appendages, including antennae,
   maxillary palps, and labial palps. There is no evidence to date that
   arthropods, including insects, use projections other than true segmental
   appendages to locate food. In this regard, it is noteworthy that some
   butterfly larvae possess a pair of long antenna-like projections on or
   near their heads. To date, the function of these projections has not
   been established. Larvae of pipevine swallowtail butterflies Battus
   philenor (Papilionidae) have a pair of long frontal fleshy projections
   that, like insect antennae generally, can be actively moved. In this
   study, we evaluated the possible function of this pair of long moveable
   frontal projections. In laboratory assays, both frontal projections and
   lateral ocelli were shown to increase the frequency with which search
   larvae found plants. The frontal projections increased finding of host
   and non-host plants equally, suggesting that frontal projections do not
   detect host-specific chemical cues. Detailed SEM study showed that
   putative mechanosensillae are distributed all around the frontal as well
   as other projections. Taken together, our findings suggest that the
   frontal projections and associated mechanosensillae act as vertical
   object detectors to obtain tactile information that, together with
   visual information from lateral ocelli and presumably chemical
   information from antennae and mouthparts, help larvae to find host
   plants. Field observations indicate that host plants are small and
   scattered in southern Arizona locations. Larvae must therefore find
   multiple host plants to complete development and face significant
   challenges in doing so. The frontal projections may thus be an
   adaptation for finding a scarce resource before starving to death. This
   is the first evidence that arthropods use projections other than true
   segmental appendages such as antennae, mouthparts and legs, to locate
   food resources.}},

   association between the manipulative acanthocephalan Pomphorhynchus
   laevis and the amphipod Gammarus pulex}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUL 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Several parasites with complex life-cycles induce phenotypic
   alterations in their intermediate hosts. According to the host
   manipulation hypothesis, such phenotypic alterations are supposed to
   increase the fitness of the parasite at the expense of that of its
   intermediate hosts through increasing the probability of transmission to
   next hosts. Although the phenomenon has received a large attention, the
   proximate factors modulating the occurrence and intensity of host
   manipulation remain poorly known. It has however, been suggested that
   the amount of energy reserves in the intermediate host might be a key
   parameter, although its precise influence on the intensity of
   manipulation remains unclear. Dietary depletion in the host may also
   lead to compromise with other parasite traits, such as probability of
   establishing or growth or virulence.
   Methods: Here, we address the question through performing experimental
   infections of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex with two different
   populations of the acanthocephalan fish parasite Pomphorhynchus laevis,
   and manipulation of host nutritional condition. Following exposure,
   gammarids were given either a ``standard{''} diet (consisting of elm
   leaves and chironomid larvae) or a ``deprived{''} food treatment
   (deprived in proteins), and infection parameters were recorded. Once
   parasites reached the stage at which they become infective to their
   definitive host, refuge use (a behavioural trait presumably implied in
   trophic transmission) was assessed, and metabolic rate was measured.
   Results: Infected gammarids exposed to the deprived food treatment
   showed a lower metabolic rate, indicative of a lower body condition,
   compared to those exposed to the standard food treatment. Parasite size
   was smaller, and, depending on the population of origin of the
   parasites, intensity of infection was lower or mortality was higher in
   deprived hosts. However, food treatment had no effect on either the
   timing or intensity of behavioural modifications.
   Conclusions: Overall, while our results suggest that acanthocephalan
   parasites develop better in hosts in good condition, no evidence was
   found for an influence of host nutritional condition on host
   manipulation by parasites.}},

   fluorescence measurement of labeled food. This system provides detailed
   measurements that enable one to quantitatively study the adaptive food
   distribution network. To demonstrate the capabilities of our method, we
   present sample observations that were unattainable using previous

   hamsters}},
Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{102-116}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Women are more likely than men to exhibit motivational disorders (e.g.,
   anhedonia and anxiety) with limited treatment options, and to
   overconsume high-fat ``comfort foods{''} to improve motivational
   disruptions. Unfortunately, neurobiological underpinnings for sex
   differences in motivational disruptions and their responses to dietary
   fat are poorly understood. To help bridge these fundamental knowledge
   gaps, we assessed behavioral and neurobiological responses to dietary
   fat in a hamster model of female-biased motivational lability. Relative
   to social housing, social separation reduced hedonic drive in a new
   behavioral assay, the reward investigational preference (RIP) test.
   Fluoxetine or desipramine treatment for 21, but not 7, days improved RIP
   test performance. Pharmacologic specificity in this test was shown by
   non-responsiveness to diazepam, tracazolate, propranolol, or naltrexone.
   In the anxiety-related feeding/exploration conflict (AFEC) test, social
   separation worsened latency to eat highly palatable food under
   anxiogenic conditions, but not in home cages. Social separation also
   reduced weight gain, food intake, and adiposity while elevating energy
   expenditure, assessed by caloric efficiency and indirect calorimetry.
   Furthermore, chronic high-fat feeding improved anhedonic and anxious
   responses to separation, particularly in females. In the
   motivation-influencing nucleus accumbens, females, but not males,
   exhibited a separation-induced anxiety-related decrease in Creb1 mRNA
   levels and an anhedonia-related decrease in Delta Fosb mRNA levels.
   Consistent with its antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects on
   behavior, high-fat feeding elevated accumbal Creb1 and Delta Fosb mRNA
   levels in females only. Another accumbal reward marker, Tlr4 mRNA, was
   elevated in females by high-fat feeding, These results show that social
   separation of hamsters provides a novel model of sex-dependent comorbid
   anhedonia, anxiety, and anorexia, and implicate accumbal CREB, Delta
   FosB, and TLR4. Moreover, the results validate a new assay for chronic
   antidepressant efficacy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Increased frequency of eating in the absence of homeostatic need,
   notably through snacking, is an important contributor to overconsumption
   and may be facilitated by increased availability of palatable food in
   the obesogenic environment. Opportunistic initiation of snacking is
   likely to be subject to individual differences, although these are
   infrequently studied in laboratory-based research paradigms. This study
   examined psychological factors associated with opportunistic initiation
   of snacking, and predictors of intake in the absence of homeostatic
   need. Fifty adults (mean age 34.5 years, mean BMI 23.9 kg/m(2), 56\%
   female) participated in a snack taste test in which they ate a chocolate
   snack to satiation, after which they were offered an unanticipated
   opportunity to initiate a second eating episode. Trait and behavioural
   measures of self control, sensitivity to reward, dietary restraint and
   disinhibited eating were taken. Results showed that, contrary to
   expectations, those who initiated snacking were better at inhibitory
   control compared with those who did not initiate. However, amongst
   participants who initiated snacking, intake (kcal) was predicted by
   higher food reward sensitivity, impulsivity and BMI. These findings
   suggest that snacking initiation in the absence of hunger is an
   important contributor to overconsumption. Consideration of the
   individual differences promoting initiation of eating may aid in
   reducing elevated eating frequency in at-risk individuals. (C) 2015

Volume = {{178}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1215-1225}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Predicting the impacts of climate change on communities requires
   understanding how temperature affects predator-prey interactions under
   different biotic conditions. In cases of size-specific predation,
   environmental influences on the growth rate of one or both species can
   determine predation rates. For example, warming increases top-down
   control of food webs, although this depends on resource availability for
   prey, as increased resources may allow prey to reach a size refuge.
   Moreover, because the magnitude of inducible defenses depends on
   predation rates and resource availability for prey, temperature and
   resource levels also affect phenotypic plasticity. To examine these
   issues, we manipulated the presence/absence of predatory Hynobius
   retardatus salamander larvae and herbivorous Rana pirica tadpoles at two
   temperatures and three basal resource levels. and measured their
   morphology, behavior, growth and survival. Prior work has shown that
   both species express antagonistic plasticity against one another in
   which salamanders enlarge their gape width and tadpoles increase their
   body width to reach a size-refuge. We found that increased temperatures
   increased predation rates, although this was counteracted by high basal
   resource availability, which further decreased salamander growth.
   Surprisingly, salamanders caused tadpoles to grow larger and express
   more extreme defensive phenotypes as resource levels decreased under
   warming, most likely due to their increased risk of predation. Thus,
   temperature and resources influenced defensive phenotype expression and
   its impacts on predator and prey growth by affecting their interaction
   strength. Our results indicate that basal resource levels can modify the
   impacts of increased temperatures on predator-prey interactions and its
   consequences for food webs.}},

Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{59-70}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Cognitive mechanisms underlying the choice of movement patterns between
   resource sites for nonhuman primates are not well understood.
   Specifically, the influence of landscape features on decision making and
   spatial memory of naturally ranging animals has not been explicitly
   investigated. We evaluated three models of bearded capuchin monkey,
   Sapajus libidinosus, movement decisions that incorporated varying
   degrees of landscape and memory influences, and we conducted a field
   experiment using a novel call-back technique to test these influences.
   The movements and spatial decisions of the monkeys were modelled between
   temporal stop points and spatial change points during natural travel
   using straight-line path, a minimum-resistance path and
   landscape-perceiving path models. For these movement models, resistance
   was calculated as the inverse of habitat suitability, a surface based on
   the natural movement patterns of the study group. Of the three models,
   natural travel most closely resembled the straight-line path model in
   its landscape resistance, but not in its geometry. This result indicates
   that while the monkeys travel in zones of low resistance, they do not
   minimize distance or landscape resistance between travel nodes. When
   monkeys were called to an artificial resource site using the call-back
   experiment, their travel was more linear and higher in landscape
   resistance. The limited quantity and high quality of the food resource
   in the artificial resource sites may have influenced the nature of the
   monkeys' travel in these experiments. We present the advantages and
   challenges of the call-back method of experimental analysis of animal
   movement and we conclude that future analyses of spatial cognition
