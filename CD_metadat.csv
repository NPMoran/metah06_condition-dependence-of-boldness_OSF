Variable,Description,Examples,Notes: 
StudyID,,CD001,
GroupID,"Groupings of study individuals should have unique IDs where there are distinct groups within a study that each have a high and low condition treatment (e.g. factorial designs with a high and low density group, where male and female data is separated etc.)",EG001,
ExperimentID,"Variables collected within the same experimental assay (i.e. where novel enviroment and novel object responses are not measured in distinct assays), or repeated measures of the same variable in the same assay over time, should have the same experimentID",EX001,
EffectID,"Each effect is given it's own unique ID, regardless of whether is is excluded or not",ES0001,

Sex,Sex of experimental group (if known),male; female; mixed; unknown,
ManipLifeStage,Timing of diet manipulation; classified as 'both' if dietary treatment spans juvenile and adult life stages or 'unknown/mixed' if group is likely to include both juveniles and adults,juvenile; adult; both; unknown/mixed,
ManipLifeStage+,Additional information that may be used to inform ManipLifeStage,e.g. size/length at manipulation,
ManipType,To account for the differences in the type of treatment,"starvation (e.g. complete food restriction for a continuous period); quantity (e.g. reduced ration for one treatment group, including periodically removing access, provision of supplementary food); quality (provision of a nutritionally limited or enriched diet)",Ref: English and Uller use quantity v quality
ManipDirection,To account for the differences in the direction of treatment,reduced; enriched,
ManipDuration,Length of time the manipulation was imposed prior to behavioural experiments (days),23; 84,
ManipOffset,"Time between end of dietary treatment and initiation of behavioural assay (days), note: for multiple assays that cannot be separated, average time to assay intitiation used",0 = continuous/hunger treatment,
ManipPostDiet,Treatment imposed continuously through experimentation v changed to standardized diet,continuous; control; restricted,Ref: English and Uller use post-treatment diet (control or restricted)
ManipConditionEffect,Reported effect of dietary treatment on the physical condition/state of animals,"negative, neutral, unknown",
ManipGroups,if multiple treatment groups are compared to the same control group within a study; or marginalised mean/sds reuse data from two phases of dietary treatment,no; control; marginal,
ExpLifeStage,Timing of behavioural experiments,juvenile; adult; unknown,
ExpAge,Age during behavioural experiments (days),23; 2784; unknown,
ExpType,Type of experiment,novel object; novel environment; predator response; risk sensitive foraging; open plus maze,
ExpVar,Specific variable for effect,latency to emerge; latency to inspect a novel item; activity level,
ExpVarUnit,Unit of measure for bahavioural trait,cm; sec,
RiskContext,Categorical moderator for risk types,see 'risk context categories' sheet,
ExpRepeated,Note the behavioural trials were repeatedly run at an individual level,yes; no,
nLC,,,
meanLC,,,
sdLC,"Where only SE available, SD calculated as SD = SE*sqrt(N); Where only CI avaiable, SD calculated as SD = (sqrt(N)*(upper limit-lower limit))/3.92 (or  SD = (sqrt(N)*(CI))/1.96, where only ± is used). For Treatment level proportion data, if SD is not presented it is calculated as SD = sqrt((p*(1-p))/n))",,
