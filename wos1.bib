Abstract = {{Grooming behavior in response to novelty and water immersion was
   examined in rat offspring sired by males consuming liquid alcohol diets
   containing 35\%, 17.5\% or 0\% ethanol-derived calories (EDC).  In the
   first study, offspring were tested at 35-38 days of age under conditions
   of lights on or off.  Offspring in the 35\% EDC group groomed less than
   controls.  Lighting conditions did not affect grooming significantly. 
   In the second study, animals were immersed in a water bath for 15
   seconds and were then placed in the same observation chambers.  As in
   the previous study, animals sired by alcohol-consuming fathers groomed
   considerably less than controls.  These results were interpreted as
   suggesting offspring sired by alcohol-consuming fathers have a blunted
   response to conditions which spontaneously elicit behavior like grooming
   or ambulation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a series of simulations designed to determine
   optimal diet breadth under shortfall avoidance models.  Profitability
   and encounter rate functions were varied, and means and variances of
   energy intake rate were generated using a simple simulation procedure. 
   The resulting mean-variance sets assumed three distinct shapes: 
   u-shaped, arched, and looped.  These simulations show that certain
   mean-variance sets allow the forager to employ simple behavioural rules
   to determine the optimal diet breadth.  This situation occurs when low
   ranking diet items have small handling times, and these conditions may
   be quite common.  In other cases, mean-variance sets may be too
   complicated to allow for easy behavioural rules designed to minimize
   starvation probability.  The ability to characterize foraging problems
   into a limited series of mean-variance set types benefits workers
   examining the evolution and maintenance of foraging strategies, since
   these sets have clear implications for the ability of animals to develop
   simple behavioural rules.  Unfortunately data are lacking on the
   profitability and encounter rate distributions animals face in nature.}},

   RESPONSES OF MAYFLY LARVAE TO A BENTHIC FISH}},
Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{163-169}},
Abstract = {{Mayfly larvae of Paraleptophlebia heteronea (McDunnough) had two
   antipredator responses to a nocturnal fish predator (Rhinichthys
   cataractae (Valenciennes)):  flight into the drift and retreat into
   interstitial crevices.  Drift rates of Paraleptophelbia abruptly
   increased by 30 fold when fish were actively foraging in the laboratory
   streams but, even before fish were removed, drift began returning to
   control levels because larvae settled to the substrate and moved to
   areas of low risk beneath stones.  This drifting response was used as an
   immediate escape behaviour which likely decreases risk of capture from
   predators which forage actively at night.  Surprisingly, drift most
   often occurred before contact between predator and prey, and we suggest
   that in darkness this mayfly may use hydrodynamic pressure waves for
   predator detection, rather than chemical cues, since fish forage in an
   upstream direction.  Although drifting may represent a cost to mayfly
   larvae in terms of relocation to a new foraging area with unknown food
   resources, the immediate mortality risk probably out-weighs the
   importance of staying within a profitable food patch because larvae can
   survive starvation for at least 2 d.  In addition to drifting, mayflies
   retreated from upper, exposed substrate surfaces to concealed
   interstitial crevices immediately after a predator encounter, or
   subsequent to resettlement on the substrate after predator-induced
   drift.  A latency period was associated with this response and mayflies
   remained in these concealed locations for at least 3 h after dace
   foraging ceased.  Because this mayfly feeds at night and food levels are
   significantly lower in field refugia under stones, relative to exposed
   stone surfaces, predator avoidance activity may limit foraging time and,
   ultimately, reduce the food intake of this stream mayfly.}},

Abstract = {{An important aspect of motivated behavior is that organisms will perform
   complex instrumental behaviors to gain access to stimuli such as food.
   In the present study, food-deprived rats were tested in an operant
   chamber in which the animals had a choice between pressing a lever to
   obtain a more-preferred food (Bioserve pellets), or free feeding on a
   less-preferred food (lab chow). Typically, rats pressed the lever to
   obtain the preferred food pellets, and ate little of the less-preferred
   food even though it was freely available. Pre-fed rats showed
   suppression of both lever pressing and feeding. Systemic administration
   of 0.1 mg/kg haloperidol (HP) led to a dramatic shift in the behavior of
   these rats, such that the number of lever presses was substantially
   reduced, but the amount of less-preferred food consumed showed a
   significant increase. This result occurred if the rats pressed a lever
   on either a CRF or FR5 schedule. Injection of 3.5-7.0-mu-g HP directly
   into the nucleus accumbens, or intra-accumbens injections of
   6-hydroxydopamine, also decreased lever pressing for food and increased
   feeding on laboratory chow. Thus, interference with brain dopamine
   suppressed a highly active instrumental response for food, although the

Volume = {{116}},

Abstract = {{Distinct behavioural strategies for dealing with environmental and
   social challenge are known to exist in the adults of a variety of
   mammalian species, but little is known about the developmental bases of
   these strategies.  In an attempt to start to fill this gap in knowledge,
   the present study set out to describe and compare the development of
   males from two lines of wild house mice which are known to differ in
   their aggressive behaviour and response to challenging situations. 
   Adult males from one line (Short Attack Latency = SAL line) are more
   aggressive, show less sensitivity to changes in their environment and
   behave in a more internally controlled, routine-like way, than do males
   from the other line (outbred = Control line).  The parental care and
   development of eight litters of four male pups from each line was
   observed.
   Paternal care did not differ between the two lines, but SAL pups
   received higher levels of nursing and general maternal care than did
   Control pups, and they appeared to be weaned later. Despite these
   differences, SAL pups grew more slowly than Control pups, suggesting
   that their high levels of sucking behaviour were a reflection of high
   milk demand, perhaps due to a low milk supply, rather than high milk
   intake.  SAL pups were also delayed in a number of measures of early
   behavioural development relative to Control pups.
   The apparent early retardation in certain measures of SAL pup
   behavioural development disappeared at the end of the parental care
   period.  From day 32 onwards, SAL pups began to show higher levels of
   aggression towards each other than did Control pups, and also showed a
   reduced reactivity to tests involving changes to the home cage
   environment; a characteristic of adult SAL males.
   As expected, SAL males developed into faster attackers than Control
   males and, in SAL litters, intra-litter variation in attack speed was
   strongly influenced by preceding experience of sibling aggression.  The
   fastest attackers in each litter were more successful in fights
   occurring in their litter than their slowest attacking siblings.  No
   such relationship was observed in the Control litters where levels of
   inter-sibling aggression were low.
   The results point to the potential significance of maternal care
   behaviour and pup fighting behaviour in the development of the
   fast-attacking phenotype.  One hypothesis is that inadequate nutrition
   of young SAL pups, mediated through the mother, promotes increased
   competition for access to the mother's nipples and predisposes the pups
   to develop into more active/competitive individuals.  Subsequent
   sibling-sibling aggression appears to influence intra-litter variation
   in adult attack latency.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental tests of the hypothesis that natural selection favors

   urticae Koch.  However, Z. mali attacks prey independently of their
   nutritional value.  Behavioral observations and experiments documented
   that Z. mali does not detect kariomones of the prey species.  Therefore,
   prey location is due only to random encounters.  Apparently, Z. mali

Abstract = {{Comparison of the size, shape and shell morphology in littoral and
   sub-littoral morphs of the Antarctic limpet Nacella concinna reveal
   differences in shell morphology which are enhanced by structural
   anomalies within the shells of the two types.  Infestation of
   sub-littoral shells by the conchocelis phase of an endolithic alga
   significantly affects shell density and total chlorophyll levels in the
   two shell morphs.  The surface sculpture of sub-littoral shells is
   characterised by a series of grooves, the configuration of which closely
   resembles that of the radular teeth in N. concinna.  Limpets utilise the
   available food supply within the shell matrix of other limpets by
   grazing the shell material.  Epibiotic growth of calcareous algae
   prevent erosion and preserve underlying shell layers.  In severe cases,
   where protection is lacking, intraspecific shell grazing may remove
   parts of the shell exposing the internal tissues.
   The Dominican Gull, Larus dominicanus, is a major shore predator of both
   shell morphs.  Gull middens contain both shell types but are dominated
   by the more accessible littoral shells.  Comparison of living
   populations and midden assemblages indicates that size and shape
   selection of prey occurs, with pear-shaped limpets between 21 mm and 29
   mm in length being taken preferentially.
   Apparent differences in shell form are induced by physical, biological
   and behavioural influences.  Littoral animals are robust in nature,
   resist avian predation and are not extensively grazed whereas those of
   the sub-littoral are not subject to the same degree of predatory
   attention but suffer a gradual depletion of their shallower shell form
   through a combination of algal infection and intraspecific shell
   grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Background. It is not known whether psychological stress suppresses host
   resistance to infection. To investigate this issue, we prospectively
   studied the relation between psychological stress and the frequency of
   documented clinical colds among subjects intentionally exposed to
   respiratory viruses.
   Methods. After completing questionnaires assessing degrees of
   psychological stress, 394 healthy subjects were given nasal drops
   containing one of five respiratory viruses (rhinovirus type 2, 9, or 14,
   respiratory syncytial virus, or coronavirus type 229E), and an
   additional 26 were given saline nasal drops. The subjects were then
   quarantined and monitored for the development of evidence of infection
   and symptoms. Clinical colds were defined as clinical symptoms in the
   presence of an infection verified by the isolation of virus or by an
   increase in the virus-specific antibody titer.
   Results. The rates of both respiratory infection (P < 0.005) and
   clinical colds (P < 0.02) increased in a dose-response manner with
   increases in the degree of psychological stress. Infection rates ranged
   from approximately 74 percent to approximately 90 percent, according to
   levels of psychological stress, and the incidence of clinical colds
   ranged from approximately 27 percent to 47 percent. These effects were
   not altered when we controlled for age, sex, education, allergic status,
   weight, the season, the number of subjects housed together, the
   infectious status of subjects sharing the same housing, and
   virus-specific antibody status at base line (before challenge).
   Moreover, the associations observed were similar for all five challenge
   viruses. Several potential stress-illness mediators, including smoking,
   alcohol consumption, exercise, diet, quality of sleep, white-cell
   counts, and total immunoglobulin levels, did not explain the association
   between stress and illness. Similarly, controls for personality
   variables (self-esteem, personal control, and introversion-extraversion)
   failed to alter our findings.
   Conclusions. Psychological stress was associated in a dose-response
   manner with an increased risk of acute infectious respiratory illness,
   and this risk was attributable to increased rates of infection rather
   than to an increased frequency of symptoms after infection.}},

   paradigm in which laboratory rats (Rattus norvegicus) were provided with
   food at one end of an elevated beam and a refuge to which they could
   carry the food at the other end of the beam, we examined the effects of
   travel distance, travel difficulty, ambient lighting, predation risk,
   and food size on foraging behavior.  Both lengthening travel distance
   (by increasing beam length) and increasing travel difficulty (by
   decreasing beam width) decreased food carrying.  When plotted as a

   be partly different.  Decreasing ambient illumination decreased food
   carrying, although the rats still responded to distance and food size. 
   In contrast, predator's odor (cat) stopped foraging altogether.  When a
   store of small food pellets was available, the rats ate for prolonged
   periods in the open, and eating time increased with travel distance;
   however, when large food pellets were also available, the rats
   immediately selected and carried them to the refuge.  The experiments
   show that food-carrying behavior in the rat is influenced by a variety
   of independently acting factors, which include eating time, food size,

Abstract = {{Few experimental studies of mating behavior have examined mating
   behavior shifts in response to ecological factors (e.g., predators,
   starvation). We conducted experiments designed to: (1) examine multiple
   trade-offs between predator avoidance, feeding behavior, and copulation
   duration in a semiaquatic insect (Microvelia austrina); and (2) address
   the influence of altered copulation duration on male reproductive
   success. To examine multiple trade-offs, we used a 2 x 2 factorial
   design where we measured the amount of time that mating microveliids
   remained in tandem, for starved and fed microveliids in the presence and
   absence of predaceous water striders (Gerris remigis). We also looked at
   the effects of presence vs. absence of green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus)
   on microveliid tandem duration. To address the impact of premature pair
   separation on male mating success, we separated paired microveliids in
   field populations and measured the time required for each sex to find
   new mates. To examine the effects of local sex ratio on remating times
   of males and females, we quantified the sex ratio of field populations
   via periodic censuses and correlated local sex ratio with remating
   times. Finally, to address oviposition rates while pairs are in tandem,
   we measured female oviposition patterns relative to tandem duration for
   poorly fed and well-fed females.
   Both starvation and gerrid presence significantly reduced tandem
   duration. As a result of male-biased sex ratios, males that prematurely
   separated from females often faced long search times before securing a
   new mate. Females oviposited at a constant rate while in tandem. A
   simple computer simulation incorporating the above observations suggests
   that reductions in tandem duration can decrease fertilization rates.}},

Abstract = {{We examined environmental effects on the correlation between age and

   Drawing on data from both natural ponds and artificial pools we examined
   for both morphs the environmental determinants of, and the
   intercorrelations among, three life history parameters: age at
   metamorphosis, size at metamorphosis, and survivorship (both pre- and
   postmetamorphic). Censuses of four natural ponds revealed that age and

   contrast to many other amphibians and insects with complex life cycles.
   In artificial pools in which we simultaneously varied two diet
   components and pond duration, age and size at metamorphosis were
   negatively correlated in high food treatments and positively correlated
   in low food, long pond duration treatments. Ephemeral larval habitats
   should favor rapid differentiation; achieving large body size depends
   upon the quality and quantity of available food and the time available
   to develop. A negative relationship between age and size at
   metamorphosis may occur often in S. multiplicatus since this species is

Abstract = {{Patch use under predation risk requires animals to trade off needs for
   safety and food. I consider within a common framework four ways of
   modeling how safety and energy influence fitness. These models make
   similar predictions for when a forager should stop feeding from
   depletable patches that vary in predation risk. In accord with Brown
   (1988), patches should be abandoned when the harvest rate no longer
   compensates for the metabolic, predation, and missed opportunity costs
   of foraging. In accord with Gilliam \& Fraser (1987), safe and risky
   patches should be left at the same ratio of predation risk to net
   feeding rate when the alternative activities include resting in a safe
   refuge to save energy. The quitting harvest rate of the forager within a
   food patch should be sensitive to predation risk and to the marginal
   value of food (the fitness value of an additional food item). Quitting
   harvest rates should be higher in food patches with higher predation
   risk. Quitting harvest rates and the costs of predation should increase
   as the marginal value of food decreases. The difference in quitting
   harvest rates between patches with high and low predation risk should
   increase as the marginal value of food decreases. Fortunately, the
   shared qualitative predictions of these models have and can be tested.
   Unfortunately, distinguishing among die models' differing quantitative
   predictions shall prove challenging.}},

Pages = {{717-733}},
Abstract = {{1. We conducted a 2-year study of Anolis nebulosus Weigman with the aim
   of understanding the effects of seasonality and predation on the
   behaviour of this tropical, mainland anole. The study was carried out in
   a deciduous forest at the Estacion de Biologia Chamela on the Pacific
   coast of Mexico. This area has a severe 6-7 month dry season and the
   largest seasonal fluctuations in arthropod numbers and biomass yet
   recorded for a tropical habitat. As is characteristic of mainland
   anoles, the A. nebulosus population in the Chamela forest experiences
   high predation rates and low annual survivorship.
   2. Our results indicate that seasonality and predation are major forces
   shaping the foraging strategies, activity levels, and social behaviour
   of A. nebulosus. In response to the wet season flush of insects, males
   and females shift from ground to arboreal foraging and increase feeding
   rates 5-10-fold. Males also travel further to capture prey and change
   their foraging mode, switching from trunk-ground, sit-and-wait foraging
   in the dry season to trunk-crown, mobile foraging in the wet season.
   3. During the dry season, male and female A. nebulosus are the most
   sedentary lizards known, moving only once or twice per hour, and
   travelling a maximum of 8-9 m day- 1. During the wet season females are
   2-3 times and males 5-10 times more active. Following the brief breeding
   period, however, both males and females retreat into unexposed hiding
   places and are emergent and active for only 1 or 2 days week-1. This
   reclusive behaviour and the exceptional levels of inactivity found in
   this species are most likely adaptations that reduce the risk of
   predation.
   4. During the wet season breeding period, male A. nebulosus increase
   display rates 15-30-fold and expand their home ranges 10-15-fold.
   Compared to insular populations of A. nebulosus, however, the Chamela
   males invest significantly less time courting females (49\% vs. 95\%)
   and more time hiding and resting (44\% vs. 1\%). Such differences
   suggest that mainland males are trading off the probability of
   encountering and mating with females for enhanced safety.
   5. Time budget analysis reveals that females devote more time to
   foraging than males during both wet and dry seasons. This strategy may
   enhance female fitness by increasing growth rate, fat reserves, and egg
   production. Males divide their time equally between resting/hiding and
   foraging and allocate only a small proportion of their day to social
   activities, except during the breeding period when the majority of their
   time and energy is invested in reproductive behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{The hermit crab Pagurus acadianus (Benedict) possesses two major
   defences against mobile aquatic predators, viz., fleeing and refuging in
   its gastropod shell.  When approached by a potential predator, a crab
   must choose to either continue its current activity (e.g., feeding),
   flee or hide in its shell.  If a foraging crab flees when threatened, it
   must secondarily decide whether to carry its food item and, if so, how
   far to carry it whilst escaping.  Alternatively, if the crab takes
   refuge in its shell, it must then decide how long to remain hidden and
   when to resume locomotory activity following emergence from the shell. 
   Because these behavioural alternatives have associated costs (e.g.,
   energy expenditure, predation risk, lost foraging opportunity), the
   crabs' decision as to which behaviour to adopt should be sensitive to
   the respective cost of each.  We tested specific predictions of this
   general economic hypothesis of behavioural decision making by varying
   the weight of food items presented to crabs (= lost feeding opportunity
   cost, energetic cost of carry) and the amount of time the crabs were
   ``handled{''} by a predator following ``capture{''} (= predation risk). 
   Most crabs tested fled from an approaching lobster predator model. 
   Contrary to expectation, flight initiation distance was unaffected by
   the mass of the food item available to the foraging crabs.  As
   predicted, however, the distances fleeing crabs carried individual food
   items varied inversely with the food's weight.  Time spent hiding in the
   shell and latency to resume locomotion following a predator ``attack{''}
   were relatively unaffected by the size of the food item available.  As
   expected, the crabs' decision to emerge from their shell following a
   threat appeared sensitive to their perceived risk of predation, as
   evidenced by an observed positive relationship between refuging time (in
   shell) and the duration of preceding handling of the crab by the
   predator.  These findings are interpreted within the cost-benefit
   framework of behavioural decision making.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological and behavioral strategies that reduce predation were examined

   increased predation risk to avoid starvation. Observational and
   experimental data were gathered over a 2-yr period for a Great Basin
   Desert porcupine population during winter. Field experiments included
   manipulations of perceived risk using predator urines and simulated
   predator encounters with a dog (Canis familiaris). Compared to foraging
   animals, sleeping porcupines of all age classes avoided high risk (i.e.,
   open) areas. Mass loss varied by habitat with individuals foraging in
   open areas (high risk) experiencing less mass loss than those foraging
   in groves (low risk). Age class also affected habitat use by foraging
   porcupines. Juveniles invariably remained in low-risk areas, even when
   more risky habitats contained potentially better quality forage.
   Two-year-old porcupines shifted to high-risk areas as body condition
   deteriorated, but condition exerted little influence on habitat use by
   adults, as this age class utilized habitat similarly throughout winter.

Abstract = {{In the Negev desert of Israel, the pulmonate land snail Trochoidea
   seetzeni is active, grows and reproduces in the month following the
   torrential winter rains. Thereafter, these snails estivate until the
   following year's rains. By experimental supplementation of water in the
   field, we examined the ability of these snails to alter their life
   histories. Specifically, we measured changes in feeding activity,
   overall activity levels, movement patterns and reproductive output. We
   found that snails on artificially-watered plots stopped feeding on
   higher plants and fed on soil-surface algae growing as a result of
   increased water availability. Most snails moved onto the watered plots,
   and reduced the total amount of movement once there, in response to
   increased food availability. Snails on the watered plots grew more and
   remained active for a longer period into the summer months than did
   snails on control plots. However, we found little evidence for the
   ability of these snails to alter their reproductive outputs in response
   to increased water (and hence food) availability. There was also no
   carry-over effect of high water availability in one season enhancing
   reproduction in the following season. We postulate that the low level of
   phenotypic plasticity recorded here is a consequence of an adaptive
   conservative strategy to maintain a high reproductive output under
   extremely unpredictable desert conditions.}},

   Corticotropin-Releasing Factor (CRF) in the control of feeding behavior
   the present studies employed a dietary self-selection task sensitive

   nutritionally stressed animals was fed a protein deficient diet in order
   to increase the preference for unfamiliar foods relative to
   nutritionally replete subjects. Both CRF (0.05 and 0.5 mug ICV) and
   physical restraint (30 min) attenuated selectively the consumption of a
   novel food choice by deficient animals without affecting concurrent
   intake of familiar food. Further, CRF administration did not alter water
   intake or consumption of either diet by the replete control group

   response to novelty without a general effect on appetite. The CRF
   antagonist, alpha-helical CRF9-41 (1, 5 and 25 mug ICV), increased

Abstract = {{The influence of predator experience on foraging responses by the
   predatory mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot, to stimuli from
   lima bean and rose leaves with or without residues of Tetranychus
   urticae Koch, were studied in the laboratory using two-choice tests.
   Starved P. persimilis females that were born and reared on T.
   urticae-infested bean leaves spent more time on bean than on rose leaves
   with T. urticae residues, although this response was not significant
   when predators were well fed. Regardless of hunger level, predators with
   prior experience on rose leaves showed no plant preference. However, P.
   persimilis females that were born and reared on one plant species (bean
   or rose) but were subsequently exposed to the other plant species (rose
   or bean) for 5 d as adults showed no preference for either plant
   species, regardless of their experiences. P. persimilis females that
   were born on rose but reared on bean leaves spent more time on bean than
   on rose, whereas female predators that were born on bean but reared on
   rose showed no preference for either plant species. When uninfested bean
   or rose leaves were used, P. persimilis females with prior experience on
   bean showed no plant preference, regardless of feeding state, whereas
   well-fed predators with prior experience on rose leaves spent more time
   on rose than on bean. It was concluded that (1) experience by P.
   persimilis on different host plants affected predator foraging behavior;
   (2) stimuli from both prey and host plant were involved; (3)
   postembryonic experience of the present generation, rather than the
   experience of the parent generations or where the eggs were laid,
   affected predator foraging behavior; and (4) foraging responses were
   influenced by hunger state. The results of this study support two
   hypotheses of the variable-response model for foraging behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Background.-While some analytic studies have suggested that individuals
   in occupations representing higher compared with lower socioeconomic
   status have a decreased risk of coronary heart disease, it is unclear
   whether occupation itself has an etiologic role in the development of
   coronary heart disease or whether differences in as yet uncontrolled
   coronary risk factors may account for these differences in risk.
   Methods.-White-collar vs blue-collar occupation and risk of coronary
   heart disease was evaluated among 230 male patients hospitalized for a
   first myocardial infarction and 222 control subjects of the same age,
   sex, and neighborhood of residence. Information on coronary risk factors
   was obtained from home interviews, and blood specimens were drawn to
   test lipid and lipoprotein levels. Usual occupation was dichotomized
   into white-collar and blue-collar occupation according to the Edwards'
   classification.
   Results.-The relative risk of myocardial infarction of white-collar
   compared with blue-collar workers was 0.74 (95\% confidence interval,
   0.46 to 1.19) after controlling for age, cigarette smoking, family
   history of premature myocardial infarction, history of treatment for
   high blood pressure, body mass index, history of diabetes, alcohol
   consumption, type A personality, leisure-time physical activity, total
   calories, and percentage of calories consumed as saturated fat. However,
   there was no residual association after control for high-density
   lipoprotein cholesterol yielding a relative risk of 0.98 (95\%
   confidence interval, 0.59 to 1.63).
   Conclusions.-These results suggest that white-collar occupation per se
   does not appear to protect from coronary heart disease. Any apparent
   protective effect on myocardial infarction that has been previously
   observed in white-collar compared with blue-collar workers may be
   attributable to differences in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
   levels.}},

Abstract = {{Cyclic population fluctuations of small rodents are characteristic in
   northern and central Fennoscandia. In Finland research addressing this
   problem was initiated in 1940s by professor Olavi Kalela, and the work
   is carried on by his co-workers and their students. One of the paramount
   questions is to what extent and by which ways social interactions among
   individuals contribute to the observed population dynamics. The focus at
   Konnevesi Research Station has - during its whole ten years of existence
   -been on social mechanisms of small rodents. This article is a review of
   our pending studies. It rather soon turned out that population cycles
   take place in spite of stabilising social mechanisms, not because of
   them. Our studies uncovered correlation between social organisation and
   quality of food and habitat. This led to comparisons between species and
   among populations, calling for experimental research both in large
   outdoor enclosures and in detailed laboratory tests. The questions
   studied were the effect of familiarity of interacting individuals on
   population growth and spacing behaviour, comparison of dispersal
   patterns between Microtus and Clethrionomys, and the effects of odours
   of conspecific and heterospecific rodents and of predators on the
   reproduction of individual voles. Quite recently we have focused on
   predator-prey interactions between rodents and their main predators,
   mustelids and raptors. Results of these studies imply that behaviour of

Abstract = {{Workers of social insects are members of colonies that survive and
   reproduce together. Therefore, the behavioral activities of individual
   workers should be integrated with colony state. We here summarize and
   discuss the relationship between colony state and foraging behavior of
   individual workers under the provisional assumption that the colony is a
   unit. We argue that colony state can be described by a number of
   variables that should relate to fitness components in order to be
   meaningful. Among the possible candidates, colony population size seems
   to have an overriding importance in many respects, as shown by its
   relation to fitness components such as survival probability and
   reproductive performance. Other important variables include colony
   demography, i.e. caste or size distributions, nutritional status, or
   queen number. Each of these variables has been shown to affect fitness
   components; however, the evidence is rather scanty. We also discuss the
   evidence that variation in colony state variables relates to variation
   in individual worker behavior. Nutritional status (i.e. low or high
   levels of food stores) and colony size have been shown repeatedly to
   affect individual behavior. However, most of the evidence comes from the
   honey bee. Some studies suggest that behavioral responses are
   hierarchically structured. More work needs to be done to investigate the
   actual mechanisms of integration of individual behavior with colony
   state. Some knowledge has accumulated about the processes that govern
   recruitment to food sources. We conclude this review by discussing some
   concepts and problems for further research. These include the concept of
   a preferred colony state to which the colony should return after
   disturbance through the behavioral activities of the workers. Further
   theoretical elaboration and empirical investigations may help to
   elucidate whether this concept is useful and necessary. A largely
   neglected issue concerns the number versus effort problem, i.e. whether
   individuals should work harder or more workers should be allocated to a
   task that is in demand. We propose a simple scenario that suggests
   testable predictions. Finally, we discuss how colony state, individual
   work load, and the dependence of worker mortality rate on activity level
   may interact to generate different short-term foraging strategies that
   workers should adopt.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{1. Behaviour and microhabitat selection by brown trout in two streams
   presenting severe winter conditions, were investigated in south-central
   Norway. Fish were studied by direct underwater observation in different
   habitat types, during day and night, and with simultaneous sampling for
   dietary analysis and invertebrate drift.
   2. During the day in winter, brown trout exhibited two different
   behavioural strategies, depending on fish size. Smaller fish (<25 cm)
   sheltered passively in the substrate or in submerged vegetation, and
   were almost never active during daylight hours. This behaviour was
   consistent throughout the winter until water temperatures rose in
   spring. Larger trout (25-60 cm) were actively aggregating in deep-slow
   stream areas during the day.
   3. During the night the trout exhibited a third behavioural strategy.
   Fish were exposed and holding positions above or on the substrate. The
   trout were active throughout the night from dusk to dawn, and this
   behaviour was consistent throughout the winter.
   4. Measured microgradients in temperature did not affect spatial niche
   selection. Spatial niches at night were selected principally on the
   basis of focal microwater velocities. The fish minimized energy
   expenditure by selecting habitats with low water velocites (pools, back
   eddies, stream bank areas). When passively sheltering during the day,
   interstices in the substrate or macrophytes providing shelter were the
   more important microhabitat characteristic.
   5. Feeding continued at night during winter. However, the nocturnal
   activity pattern was not principally determined by food availability,
   since invertebrate drift did not show such periodicity.
   6. The behaviour and spatial niche selection by brown trout is explained
   as an ecologically adaptive homeostatic behavioural response to buffer
   the energy deficit and adverse environmental conditions experienced by
   the wintering fish. The nocturnal activity strategy reduces the risk of
   habitat exclusion and microhabitat inclusion by ice formation, and
   sheltering in the day reduces the energy expenditure and the risk of
   predation. Thus, the behaviour in winter is best described as a
   cost-minimizing shelter-and-move strategy.
   7. Little aggression in trout during winter suggests that social
   interactions may be less important as a factor regulating populations in
   winter than in summer. Instead, they may be more regulated by abiotic
   factors such as the physical structures of the stream.}},

Abstract = {{We use econometric techniques to consider whether the statistical
   association between drinking and blood pressure among men may be due, in
   part, to the constitutional hypothesis. The constitutional hypothesis
   holds that the same unobserved genetic or personality factors that
   affect blood pressure will affect the amount of alcohol consumed. Our
   sample is restricted to men because most investigations for women have
   revealed a weak to nonexistent positive, and sometimes a negative,
   association. Data are drawn from the National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey, 1971-1975. The econometric technique requires
   fitting three equations using two-stage least squares or multiple
   regressions. The first equation explains how much people drink. The
   second and third equations explain fluctuations in systolic and
   diastolic blood pressures using information on the predicted values of
   the drinking variable from the first equation. Our results suggest that,
   after accounting for unobserved constitutional factors as well as other
   observed covariates such as obesity, salt intake, schooling and so on,
   the strength of the statistical association between high blood pressure
   and heavy drinking in men drops only slightly by 8\% (diastolic) and
   23\% (systolic). Thus, a strong statistically significant result remains

Abstract = {{This study aimed to assess the suitability of using video images to
   study social facilitation of feeding behaviour in domestic chickens
   (Gallus domesticus). A comparison was made between the chickens'
   responses to a real bird feeding in an adjacent cage (RB) and a video
   image of the same bird feeding, displayed on a television screen (VB).
   The amount of food consumed by the subject bird was significantly
   greater (P<0.05) during the RB treatment than when the stimulus cage was
   empty (RC). Likewise, the amount of food consumed was significantly
   greater (P<0.05) when the video and sound of a bird feeding (VB) was
   presented than when the video image was of an empty cage (VC). The
   number of food pecks, although greater in the RB than in the RC
   treatment (P<0.001 ), was not significantly different between the VB and
   VC treatments (P<0.07). Dividing each of the 30-min trials into three
   consecutive 10-min intervals and repeating the analysis, suggested that
   this lack of overall difference may have been due to the initial novelty
   of the television screen or to a delay in recognizing and responding to
   the video image since, by the final 10-min interval, the number of pecks
   was greater in the VB than in the VC treatment (P<0.05).
   It was concluded that video could be used to study social facilitation
   of feeding behaviour and, possibly also, of other behaviour patterns
   which occur less frequently or are not so easily elicited by prior
   deprivation. Video images may also provide an opportunity to identify
   the key stimuli in feeding behaviour that elicit the social
   facilitation, since the sequence of the behavioural components can be
   edited or the image experimentally manipulated independently of the
   behaviour of the subject bird.}},

Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{361-375}},

Abstract = {{I used an observational and experimental approach to investigate the
   dietary consequences of substrate specialization in six species of
   Amazonian antwrens (Myrmotherula). Three species (leucophthalma,
   haematonota, and ornata) foraged exclusively at curled dead leaves
   suspended above ground, axillaris and longipennis foraged on live
   foliage, and hauxwelli was a substrate generalist, feeding at both live
   and dead foliage. Diet composition of all species was qualitatively
   similar, with soft-bodied orthopterans consistently the most important
   prey type. Dead-leaf specialists took other prey roughly in proportion
   to their availability in dead leaves, whereas diets of live-leaf
   foragers differed greatly from prey available on live foliage. Dead-leaf
   specialists also ate larger prey and especially larger orthopterans than
   did other antwrens. Substrate generalization in hauxwelli was associated
   with higher diet breadth and greater heterogeneity among individuals,
   compared with substrate-restricted foragers. Diet breadth was negatively
   correlated with prey size across all six species. When tested in outdoor
   cages, live-leaf foraging and generalist species showed little interest
   in dead- or live-leaf substrates, whereas all dead-leafers repeatedly
   inspected and manipulated dead and curled leaves in the absence of food.
   All foraging groups showed a similar degree of selectivity of prey types
   in feeding trials. Dead-leaf specialists did not differ from other
   species in their preference for orthopterans of different colors,
   although specialists were better able to catch and handle the largest
   katydids (>30 mm). Individual hauxwelli (the generalist) showed elevated
   levels of exploration at dead leaves with food reinforcement, suggesting
   short-term plasticity in search behavior. I conclude that substrate
   specialization in these birds involves fundamental differences in search
   behavior, but is not accompanied by equivalent changes in prey
   selectivity or preference. Dead-leaf specialists search for suitable
   substrates and then inspect them for hidden prey, taking prey roughly in
   proportion to their availability. In contrast live-leaf foragers search
   directly for prey and select suitable items from the wider array of
   arthropods available on live foliage. Substrate-restricted foraging may
   reduce diet breadth and promote diet stereotypy in both groups, whereas
   the single most important factor promoting specialization on dead leaves
   may be the predictable abundance of relatively large orthopterans.}},

Abstract = {{Paltothyreus tarsatus workers show an adaptive predatory strategy

   loading is an extension of the optimal diet choice while multiple-prey
   loading behavior would correspond to the optimal use of patches. The
   insight learning involved in the quick modifications of predatory
   strategy enables P. tarsatus to hunt all available prey in a great
   diversity of sizes and species. Nevertheless, this generalist predator
   strongly preferred termites and very large prey such as giant diplopods
   and crickets to other choices within its diet. In the hunting of these
   favorite prey, the recruitment of nestmates enhanced the efficiency of
   total predation, though the release of a chemical trail appeared to
   depend on the hunger-satiety balance of the colony. In addition to the
   hunger, the miscapture of prey also triggered the release of chemical
   trails. The strategy for capturing grouped termites was characterized by
   the loading of multiple prey at a single time, by a concentrated search
   in a restricted area and by an optional recruitment of nestmates. These
   behavioral characteristics of ponerine ants probably account for the
   flexibility of their predatory strategy for hunting aggregated small

Abstract = {{Predators can have consequences on prey populations and communities that
   extend well beyond direct predator-induced mortality. Predator-prey
   interactions often affect prey feeding rates, growth rates, or
   fecundities, thereby significantly affecting reproductive success of
   prey adults. Thus, investigation of the sublethal fitness consequences
   of behavioral responses of prey to predators is essential to our
   understanding of the total impact of predators on prey populations and
   communities. Feeding (algal grazing) rates, growth rates, and
   fecundities of Baetis bicaudatus (Baetidae) larvae were measured in
   replicated circular flow-through stream channels to determine the
   sublethal consequences on fitness correlates of the presence of
   predatory stoneflies (Perlodidae). Gut fullness of 24-h starved Baetis
   larvae was measured using fluorometry after 24 h (short-term
   experiments) in four treatments: (1) ambient resource rocks and no
   predators, (2) low resource rocks and no predators, (3) ambient resource
   rocks and one female perlodid stonefly (Megarcys signata), or (4)
   Kogotus modestus whose mouthparts were glued to prevent lethal effects
   of predation. Mid-instar male and female Baetis larvae were reared for 3
   wk until wing pad maturation (long-term experiments) and subjected to
   all but the Kogotus treatment. Predator avoidance significantly reduced
   levels of Baetis gut fullness, over the short term, to levels
   intermediate between the high and low resource treatments. Longer term
   residence with predatory stoneflies caused larvae of both male and
   female Baetis to mature at significantly smaller sizes than in the
   treatment with ambient food but no predators. Mayflies with predators
   matured at sizes similar to those held with low food levels over the
   long term. Interestingly, both starved larvae and those avoiding
   predators did not grow during the experimental period in contrast to
   about a 50\% growth rate of larvae experiencing ambient food levels, but
   no predators. Similarly, egg biomass per mature female larva was
   significantly reduced in both starved and predator treatments. The
   proportion of total body mass allocated to eggs was only reduced in
   starved mayflies indicating that the females avoiding predators accrued
   less total mass, but allocated a similar proportion to eggs as did
   well-fed Baetis. These data convincingly demonstrate that predator
   avoidance can have dramatic consequences on mayfly fitness. The
   mechanism explaining those fitness consequences is probably a disruptive
   drift/swim response by Baetis to encounters with stoneflies, which
   reduces Baetis' feeding rates. If we accept the assumption that natural
   selection has shaped the foraging behavior of organisms to maximize
   fitness, foragers need to make decisions that maximize both survivorship
   (minimizing risk of predation) and fecundity. In mayflies fecundity is
   entirely a function of resource acquisition by the larvae, which makes
   them particularly vulnerable to such sublethal effects of predation.
   Nonetheless, we suspect that the types of sublethal costs of predator
   avoidance documented by this and other recent studies are nearly
   universal consequences of organisms foraging under predation risk.}},

   latency to begin prey relocation (strike-induced chemosensory searching)
   did not vary between conditions. Hungry snakes expended less venom when
   securing prey than well-fed snakes, due perhaps to conservation of venom
   supplies or constraints on venom delivery. Performance of envenomated

Abstract = {{When animals can choose from a range of feeding options, often those
   options with a higher energetic gain carry a higher risk of predation.
   This paper analyses the optimal trade-off between food and predation. We
   are primarily interested in how an animal's decisions and its state
   change over time. Our models are very general. They can be applied to
   growth decisions, such as choice of habitat, in which case we might
   consider how the state variable size changes over an animal's lifetime.
   Equally our models are applicable to short-term foraging decisions, such
   as vigilance level, in which case we might consider how energy reserves
   vary over a day. We concentrate on two cases: (i) the animal must reach
   a fixed state, its fitness depending on when this is attained; (ii) the
   animal must survive to a fixed time, its fitness depending on its final
   state.
   In case (i) minimization of mortality per unit increase of state is
   optimal under certain baseline conditions. In case (ii) behaviour is
   constant over time under baseline conditions (the `Risk-spreading
   Theorem'). We analyse how these patterns are modified by complicating
   factors, e.g. time penalties, premature termination of the food supply,
   stochasticity in food supply or in metabolic expenditure, and
   state-dependence in the ability to obtain food, in metabolic expenditure
   and in predation risk. From this analysis we obtain a variety of
   possible explanations for why an animal should reduce its intake rate
   over time (i.e. show satiation). We show how -earlier work can be viewed
   as special cases of our results.}},

Abstract = {{Last instar Rhyachophila nubila larvae captured fast moving mayfly
   nymphs by ambush hunting from sheltered positions, while sedentary
   blackfly larvae were captured upon random search. After a trip in a
   circular aquarium larvae usually returned to the same stone from which
   they had started. Such `'favourite'' stones were often, but not always,
   attached with silk to the bottom by the larvae. The locomotory activity
   of larvae from two populations peaked during springtime prior to
   pupation in the field. High locomotory activity was linked to an
   elevated risk of predation by bullheads. The activity of starved larvae
   in a poor energetic condition was high relative to that of unstarved
   larvae. Over the year, larvae from the two populations differed markedly
   with respect to energy content and activity, and those in a poor
   condition were most active. The latter originated from a habitat devoid
   of fish predators. When larvae of the same energetic status from both
   populations were compared, those from the fishless stream still
   exhibited a higher activity. This result indicated that a high
   locomotory activity in larvae not coexisting with fish was associated
   with a relaxed mortality risk at unsheltered movements. I would
   speculate that different levels of activity in larvae from the two
   populations seemed to reflect different pressures from natural selection
   due to fish predation. The caddis larvae did not seem capable of
   detecting the presence of fish. Larval behaviour was consistent with
   current theory of time constrained organisms.}},

Abstract = {{An elevated plus-maze was used to investigate the effects of repeated

   Pup malnutrition was induced during the lactation period (0 to 21 days
   of age) by feeding the dams a protein-deficient diet (6\% protein) and
   the animals were allowed to recover from weaning to 70 days of age by
   eating a commercial lab chow diet. Control animals were suckled by dams
   receiving a normal protein diet (16\% protein) during the lactation
   period and were fed a commercial lab chow diet after weaning. At 70
   days, malnourished and control animals were placed on the central
   platform of the elevated plus-maze facing an enclosed arm and allowed to
   explore for 5 min. This procedure was repeated at 24-h intervals for 6
   days. The repeated testing in the elevated plus-maze did not change the
   total number of arm entries and attempts to enter open arms, but
   decreased the percentage of open arm entries, time spent in open arms,
   and total time spent on the central platform. These data suggest an
   increase in anxiety with repeated testing in the elevated plus-maze. In
   addition, the malnourished animals showed a larger number of both
   rearings and attempts to enter the open arms, suggesting a high level of

   Although breeding was continuous, the populations were frequently
   dominated by distinct cohorts and there was a sexual phase in spring. 
   Growth rates, particularly in Quarry Pond, were often slow, and clutch
   sizes generally small.  Egg and neonate sizes changed seasonally, but
   changes were not closely related to clutch sizes and body lengths.  In
   Taieri Pond and Raupo Pond some D. carinata grew to 6.14 mm and carried
   clutches of up to 154 eggs.  The potentially high fecundity associated
   with large size makes D. carinata a good coloniser, but our studies
   showed that it also survives well in poor food conditions by growing
   slowly and producing only 1-2 eggs per clutch.
   D. carinata showed marked seasonal polymorphism in tailspine length and
   development of head crests.  In winter, crests were absent and
   tailspines were short and varied little with body length.  Crests were
   first apparent, and tailspines began to elongate, in early spring,
   before the first appearance of a notonectid, Anisops wakefieldi.  By
   midsummer, tailspines had increased markedly with body length but the
   slope of the relationship declined in autumn.  Laboratory trials showed
   that both tailspine length and crest development increased in the
   presence of Anisops.  These increases may be due to water-soluble
   factor(s) produced by Anisops.}},

   animals provided with access to an 8\% sucrose solution (SUC). In the AL
   condition, no significant differences were found between DI and LE

   However, the DI animals were significantly slower in latency to respond
   in trial 1. With FR, the LE animals resembled the LE-AL animals in both
   passive avoidance behavior and blood glucose levels. The DI-FR animals
   that were not provided with SUC showed an impairment in passive
   avoidance behavior and low blood glucose levels, whereas DI-FR animals
   provided with SUC showed an amelioration of passive avoidance

   performance in the AL condition; 2) AL and FR conditions produce
   different responses in DI, but not LE, animals; 3) deficiencies in

Abstract = {{Although the behavioral consequences of domestication in fish have long
   been the subject of considerable interest among aquaculture geneticists,
   there is not yet a clear understanding of the conditions under which
   aggression increases or decreases during domestication. In addition,
   very little is known about how behaviors correlated with aggression may
   be altered by domestication. In this paper the evidence for an increase
   as well as a decrease in aggression during domestication in fish is
   first critically evaluated. Then the various mechanisms by which
   competitive behavior in fish can affect individual growth rates under
   natural or artificial conditions are described. It is concluded that the
   direction and intensity of any phenotypic change in food-related
   agonistic behavior following natural or artificial selection for rapid
   growth will depend on the relationship between agonistic behavior and
   access to food. Indirect selection on agonistic behavior as a result of
   direct selection on growth will be significant if selection is conducted
   under competitive conditions that promote aggressive interactions, and
   will be positive or negative depending on whether food is limited or
   available in excess. Changes in aggression induced by domestication are
   likely to induce changes in behaviors that are affected by aggression
   including schooling behavior. The tendency to school results from a
   balance between attracting factors and repelling factors. This balance
   between competitive (repelling) and antipredator (attracting) tendencies
   can be altered by domestication and such behavioral alterations may
   affect survival of wild populations if domestic stocks are allowed to
   interbreed with wild stocks.}},

Abstract = {{A state-dependent model has been used to predict daily and tidal
   patterns of migration, feeding and inactivity in juvenile plaice
   (Pleuronectes platessa L.) in their intertidal and shallow subtidal
   nursery areas. Vertical position, quantity of energy reserves and
   fullness of the gut characterized the state of individual fishes. If
   feeding is visually mediated, the model predicts that, by night, plaice
   should move to areas of low predation risk and become inactive, whereas
   by day, plaice should migrate to feed in areas of high prey encounter
   rate. Vertical zones adopted by day and night and, hence, patterns of
   migration, should depend on the distributions of predators and prey.
   When prey are more abundant in the intertidal zone, plaice should move
   onshore to feed as the tide rises and when prey are more abundant
   offshore, plaice should move offshore to feed by day. If predators are
   equally abundant in all zones, the fish should behave as if no predators
   were present, having no effective refuge. An increase in the abundance
   of predators with depth results in the restriction of plaice activities
   to shallower vertical zones, depending on the magnitude of the predation
   threat. Zones adopted thus depend on the trade-off between energy intake
   and predation risk. Concordance between predicted behaviour and observed
   patterns is evident in contrasting habitats. Migration and feeding in
   the Wadden Sea, where prey are more abundant on intertidal flats, is
   dominated by the tidal component, whereas on impoverished exposed
   beaches of the west coast of Scotland, the diurnal component is
   dominant. Tidally related behaviour persists in the latter environment,
   not predicted by the model and may be a consequence of using endogenous
   rhythms to approach optimal behavioural patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Several predatory organisms induce a defensive morphological response in
   the freshwater ciliate Euplotes octocarinatus. The morphological changes
   have demographic cost besides an adaptive advantage. The generation time
   of E. octocarinatus increased from 40 +/- 1 h (SDM) to 47 +/- 2 h when
   the ciliate changes its morphology in response to the presence of
   Stenostomum sphagnetorum (Turbellaria). It remained at a high level in
   the protective `'winged'' form of the ciliates (45 +/- 1 h). The
   population growth rate therefore decreased by 15 \% (from r = 0.60/d to
   r = 0.51/d). When predators had disappeared the duration of the
   following reproduction cycle decreased to 38 +/- 1 h. A longer growth
   phase of winged ciliates was related to their lowered reproduction rate.
   The length of the G1-phase of the cell cycle increased from 25 +/- 1 h
   to 34 +/- 2 h (SD); the length of the S phase remained constant (13 +/-
   1 h or 12 +/- 3 h). Synthesis of proteins was necessary for
   predator-induced morphological changes. The protein content of Euplotes
   octocarinatus increased from 1.1 +/- 0.1 pg/ciliate to 1.7 +/- 0.2 pg
   (SD) during morphological transformation. The protein synthesis
   inhibitor cycloheximid (greater-than-or-equal-to 50 muM) inhibited
   morphological changes. These results indicate that additional growth of
   the ciliate is necessary for morphological changes. The growth process
   leads as a cost to an increased generation time of Euplotes. The feeding
   rate of winged forms of the ciliate had slightly increased compared to
   the feeding rate of the typical form. Therefore, food limitation is not
   crucial for the cost of predator-induced defence; however, it may be
   beneficial for the winged form.}},

Abstract = {{Many species of animals face the continual problem of balancing the
   trade-off between reducing predation risks and maintaining or increasing

   asymmetric: each separate behavioral decision may lead to only a
   marginal increase in fitness, but may place the organism's entire future
   reproduction in jeopardy. Consequently, the organism's reproductive
   value is an important component of most antipredator decision problems.
   In this paper reproductive value is considered as an asset in need of
   protection. The `'asset-protection principle'' states that the larger
   the current reproductive asset, the more important it becomes to protect
   it. Because reproductive value is usually age and condition dependent,
   optimal antipredator behavior also often depends on these variables. I
   use a uniform modeling technique (dynamic programming) to address a
   variety of issues related to antipredator behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Predation and hunger are threats for most organisms, and appropriate
   behavioural responses to both factors should be shaped by natural
   selection. In combination, however, the behavioural demands of predation
   avoidance and effective foraging often cannot be satisfied at the same
   time and lead to a conflict within organisms. We examined the
   behavioural responses of two closely-related species of tadpoles, Rana
   lessonae and R. esculenta, to simulated predation by fish and hunger.
   Tadpoles, hatched and reared in the laboratory, were tested in a
   three-way factorial (predation risk x hunger x species) experiment with
   four predation levels and four hunger levels. Both species decreased
   their swimming activity with increasing predation risk. Predation risk
   did not influence the amount of activity time invested in feeding but
   caused the tadpoles to spend less time in patches with food. Refuges
   were not used to avoid predation. R. esculenta was more sensitive to
   predation risk than R. lessonae. Hunger increased both the activity of
   tadpoles and the amount of activity time invested in feeding, thus
   indicating an increased energy intake. No interactions were observed
   between predation risk and hunger. These results show that tadpoles
   possess genetically-based behavioural mechanisms that allow them to
   respond in a graded manner to predation and hunger. However, they did
   not balance the two conflicting demands of predation avoidance and
   effective foraging; the two mechanisms appeared to act independently.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates the dynamic behavior of a model of an unstable
   food chain consisting of three species or trophic levels. The model
   assumes that each of the consumer species has a Holling type 2
   functional response. The study examines how dynamic behaviors and
   top-level population densities change with the carrying capacity of the
   bottom level. In all cases examined, the mean population density of the
   top species initially increases, but eventually decreases as carrying
   capacity is increased. In some cases, a sufficient increase in the
   carrying capacity of the bottom species leads to extinction of the top
   species. If the maximum rate of change of the top species is
   sufficiently slow relative to the middle species, the period of the
   population cycles in the top species can change rapidly with a small
   change in the carrying capacity of the bottom species. Low carrying
   capacities produce simple cycles with a long period, while high carrying
   capacities produce simple cycles with a short period. For intermediate
   carrying capacities, more complex dynamical behaviors, including chaos,
   may occur. Systems that have only one equilibrium point with all species
   present may have two alternative attractors with very different
   densities of the top-level species. The responses of the bottom two
   species to an increased carrying capacity are also discussed. The
   results imply that nutrient enrichment may adversely affect high-level
   consumers and that reductions in the density of top-level consumers may
   make it difficult or impossible to restore their populations.}},

   behavioural response of the potential prey which is different from the
   normal `'avoiding reaction'' of Euplotes. Because of its defensive
   character it is called `'escape response''. The response was analysed by
   the use of a video camera and recorder system. It was found that the
   escape response takes a regular course, beginning with sudden backward
   moving of Euplotes, followed by a rapid turn around and a subsequent
   forward movement. Velocities during the escape response are 1 to 5 times
   higher than calculated for control cells. The whole reaction lasts about
   2 s. Within this time a Euplotes cell moves more than 1,000 mum away
   from its predator. While 90 \% of well-fed Euplotes cells demonstrated
   the defensive response, starved cells cultivated separately from their
   predators revealed fewer escape responses, however, several of the
   starved cells regained the capacity for the escape response after
   exposure to Stenostomum or Stenostomum-conditioned medium for 20 h. It
   is discussed whether or not the inducible behavioural response is
   triggered by the same predator-released substances that are known to
   induce defensive morphological changes in Euplotes.}},

Abstract = {{The incubation routine and mass changes of male and female Blue Petrel
   Halobaena caerulea were studied at the Kerguelen Islands to investigate
   factors influencing the durations of incubation stints and foraging
   trips at sea and the factors determining nest desertion and return to
   the nest.
   The body mass at the start of an incubation shift and also when the bird
   was relieved varied throughout the incubation period, whereas the mass
   when birds deserted the nest was stable. Birds deserted the nest when
   their mass decreased to threshold, independent of the duration of the
   fast. Temporary egg neglect was observed in successful as well as in
   unsuccessful breeding attempts, but it increased the risk of breeding
   failure. The net and daily mass gained at sea during the second part of
   the incubation period were higher than during the first part, suggesting
   an increase in food availability. During the first part, the mass gained
   at sea and time spent foraging were inversely related to the mass of the
   bird before it left the burrow, whereas a similar relationship did not
   occur thereafter.
   The results suggest the occurrence of a fixed mass threshold when birds
   decide to leave the nest if not relieved by their partner. The mass when
   a bird left its nest influenced the time spent foraging or mass gained
   when food was scarce. Although decision rules to leave the nest or
   return from the sea are related to body condition, the possibility of
   neglecting the eggs temporarily enables Blue Petrels to regulate the
   trade-off between risks of breeding failure and risks of an increase in
   adult mortality. A model for behavioural decision to stop incubating or
   stop feeding, based on a variable set point, is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Mathematical models are used to determine the optimal foraging effort of
   individuals that face increased risk of predation when they exert
   greater foraging effort but have imperfect information about the degree
   of risk. If the fitness cost of underestimating predation risk is less
   than that of overestimating risk, imperfect information should lead to
   behavior that is appropriate for a lesser risk than is actually present.
   Overestimation is favored under the opposite condition. If there is a
   trade-off between starvation and predation, an animal will usually
   underestimate (overestimate) risk if the third derivative of the
   starvation-versus-risk relation is positive (negative), provided
   uncertainty is not too large. Different, plausible starvation functions
   can favor either under- or overestimates of risk. If there is a
   trade-off between reproduction and predation, a more complex condition
   determines which type of bias is adaptive; this condition involves the
   reproduction-versus-risk function and its first three derivatives, and
   again, over- or underestimation of risk can be advantageous. In almost
   all models, increased accuracy of estimation is favored when costs of
   increased accuracy are sufficiently small. These results differ from
   those of previous analyses, and reasons for these differences are

   species. The workers forage individually and return to the nest using a
   series of cues involving light, a chemical graduated marking system near
   the nest entrance, and memory. During nest-moving, recruitment by tandem
   running was observed. However, in colonies where the food supply is
   regular, workers that discover food do not recruit nestmates, but make
   repeated trips between the nest and the food source. On the contrary, in
   starved colonies, the introduction of prey may produce a massive exit of
   foragers, corresponding to a primitive form of mass recruitment similar

   a glucocorticoid action could play a critical role in the mechanisms

   hypothesis, chicks were trained on a passive avoidance learning task and
   given bilateral intracerebral injections of selective mineralocorticoid
   (RU-28318) or glucocorticoid (RU-38486) receptor antagonists. The
   results showed that both antagonists alter information processing when
   injected prior to the training session. Possible state-dependent effects
   were discharged. Further experiments evaluating possible effects of the
   antagonists on concomitant aspects of the learning situation (such as
   novelty reaction and pecking pattern) indicated that, as opposed to the
   glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, the mineralocorticoid antagonist
   altered the birds' reactivity to non-specific aspects of the training

Abstract = {{In addition to being a pharmacological agent, alcohol (ethanol) can also

   intake decreases in relation to the calorific value of the alcohol
   consumed; in human studies, various results have been obtained from no
   compensation to full compensation for the contribution from alcohol. If
   a choice is possible, primarily the carbohydrate part of the diet is
   decreased for compensation to ethanol intake. Food, in turn, can
   influence alcohol consumption. There is evidence that it is the
   carbohydrate content of the diet which influences alcohol drinking. The
   daily intake of alcohol is equally or even better regulated than intake
   of carbohydrate, protein, or fat. There is a circadian rhythm of alcohol
   consumption which resembles the rhythm of food intake. However, the
   mechanism which regulates alcohol intake does not have a very strong
   influence on the behaviour of most animals or humans, and its control is

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},

Volume = {{99}},

Abstract = {{An important assumption made in most life-history theory is that there
   is a trade-off between age and size at reproduction. This trade-off may,
   however, disappear if growth rate varies adaptively. The fact that
   individuals do not always grow at the maximum rate can only be
   understood if high growth rates carry a cost. This study investigates
   the presence and nature of such costs in Pararge aegeria. Five females
   from two populations with known differences in life history (south
   Sweden and Madeira) were allowed to oviposit in the laboratory and their
   offspring were reared in environmental chambers under conditions leading
   to direct development. We measured several aspects of life history,
   including development times, pupal and adult weights, growth rate,
   female fecundity, longevity and larval starvation endurance. In both
   populations there seemed to be genetic variation in growth rate. There
   was no evidence for a trade-off between age and size at pupation. As
   predicted, larvae with high growth rates also lost weight at a
   relatively higher rate during starvation. High weight-loss rates were
   furthermore associated with a lower probability of surviving when food
   became available again. This is apparently the first physiological
   trade-off with growth rate that has been experimentally demonstrated. In
   both populations there were significant differences in growth rate
   between the sexes, but the populations differed in which sex was growing
   at the highest rate. In Sweden males had higher growth rates than
   females, whereas the reverse was true for Madeira. These patterns most
   likely reflect differences in selection for protandry, in turn caused by
   differences in seasonality between Sweden and Madeira. Together with the
   finding that males had shorter average longevity than females in the
   Swedish, but not in the Madeiran, population, this indicates that a
   lower adult quality also may be a cost of high growth rate. We argue
   that for the understanding of life history variation it is necessary to
   consider not only the two dimensions of age and size, but also to take
   into full account the triangular nature of the relationship between
   size, time and growth rate.}},

Abstract = {{Follow-up of early-treated children with PKU has shown that diet
   discontinuation in childhood presents risks of cognitive and emotional
   dysfunction in a substantial number of adolescents and young adults.
   This dysfunction includes IQ loss, mental processing abnormalities,
   learning difficulties, anxiety and personality disorders. In addition,
   neurologic deterioration has been reported in several such individuals.
   As a consequence of this current understanding of PKU, diet
   continuation, at least through adolescence and in the young adult years,
   is now recommended. Many centers are extending this to a policy of
   `'diet for life''. This represents a major challenge to adolescents and
   their families. Metabolic control using the criteria applied during
   childhood is virtually impossible to achieve past 12 years of age. Time
   constraints, social pressures, financial limitations and growing
   independence from the family combine to interfere with dietary control.
   Added to these difficulties are the biological changes during teenage
   years which reduce phenylalanine tolerance. To meet these challenges, we
   have identified a number of psychosocial factors that interfere with
   adherence to medical recommendations. The factors most highly related to
   metabolic control were social support for the diet and positive
   perceptions of treatment. This information has led to the development of
   support programs for adolescents and young adults with PKU. These
   programs include an annual New England maternal PKU camp, a resource
   mothers program in which mothers of young children with PKU are matched
   to women with PKU who are either planning a pregnancy or are pregnant
   and assist with meal planning, cooking, metabolic monitoring, and
   transportation to medical appointments as well as provide enormous
   emotional support to these young women, and a PKU CORPS which brings
   together on-diet adolescents for training and emotional support and then
   matches them with younger phenylketonuric children on diet. The benefits
   of these programs are becoming clear in terms of improved metabolic
   control, successful re-institution of diet, a more comfortable
   acceptance of PKU and a better self-image.}},

   Bell 412 helicopters were simulated flying across the molting grounds
   along six flight lines at various altitudes and frequencies between two
   airfields.  The model determined the behavioral and energetic responses
   of every bird encountered by the aircraft during an overflight, then
   calculated the weight of these birds at the end of wing molt.  Body
   condition of the brant, reflected in weight loss, was used to quantify
   the impact of helicopter disturbance.  The number of birds in each of
   five risk categories was determined for each route, altitude, helicopter

   Slightly altering the direct route between the two airfields resulted in

   the least disturbance; flying parallel to the coast, 1.6 km inland,

Abstract = {{The effects of diet history, hunger and predation risk on short-term
   behavioral decisions of dogwhelks were tested in a specially designed
   test apparatus, termed a linear feeding array (LFA). The LFA consists of
   a sequential series of prey items mounted in a flume with unidirectional
   current directed towards a test (predatory) animal, and into which
   potential olfactory cues regarding predation risk are introduced. For
   dogwhelks the array was constructed vertically to accomodate intertidal
   foraging movements and is termed a vertical linear array (VLA). The
   behaviors exhibited by the dogwhelks were interpreted from distribution
   patterns in the VLA. Recent experimental studies and advances in optimal
   foraging theory provided the basis for the hypotheses tested in the VLA,
   which included: foraging and other behaviors are affected by predation,
   animals will avoid risk in the presence of predation threat, responses
   to predation threat will be proportional to the number and kinds of
   predator cues present, and starved animals will take greater risks than
   fed animals. We also test the proposition that foraging decisions are
   further modified by age. Three groups of juvenile and adult animals were
   maintained on diets of barnacles, mussels or no food (starved). The
   scent of crabs and damaged conspecifics served as olfactory cues to
   predation risk. Dogwhelks exhibited a range of behaviors in the VLA
   including: sheltering, searching, feeding, and aerial climbing.
   Distribution of animals in the tank assumed a relatively stable pattern
   after 2-3 h. These patterns were interpreted as the consequence of
   heirarchial decision making including: (i) a decision to become active,
   leaving the resting place or water refuge adopted during initial
   placement, followed by (ii) a decision to move vertically upwards or
   downwards, and (iii) a decision to attack prey when encountered.
   Analysis of movement patterns revealed that the initial decision,
   analogous to leaving a crevice as the tide comes in, was influenced in
   adults by predator cues and in juveniles by both predator cues and diet
   history. Perceived risk, as crab and damaged-conspecific odors, made
   individuals more likely to remain inactive, a risk-avoiding strategy for
   animals already in a refuge. Starved animals were more likely to descend
   into the tank and attack prey than fed animals. Our results support the
   hypotheses that higher-order predators affect the foraging decisions of
   dogwhelks and that juveniles and satiated animals are more sensitive to
   predation risk than starved ones. Together, these and earlier studies
   suggest that dogwhelks assess their environment before foraging, and
   that they are attuned to reducing the risks of mortality.}},

Abstract = {{An elevated plus-maze was used to study the ontogeny of the exploratory
   behaviors of early-protein-malnourished animals in an experimental
   aversive situation. Rats were malnourished by feeding their dams a 6\%
   protein diet during the lactation period (0-21 days of age); controls
   received a 16\% protein diet. From 21 to 100 days of age, all rats
   received a balanced lab chow diet. At 21, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90,
   and 100 days of age, independent groups of malnourished and control
   animals were exposed to the elevated plus-maze and allowed to explore
   for 5 min. During this period, 12 behavioral categories (number of
   entries and time spent in the open and enclosed arms, total arms
   entries, attempts to enter open and closed arms, closed-arm returns,
   latency of first closed-arm entry, total immobility time, total grooming
   time, total rearings, total head-dippings, and total stretch attend
   posture) were recorded. The results showed that anxiety increased with
   age and that protein malnutrition produced alterations in the ontogeny
   of exploratory behaviors. It was shown that malnourished rats maintained
   or increased exploration in the maze with age, in contrast to well
   nourished animals, which exhibited a steady decrease in exploration as
   they matured. The higher number of entries and time spent in the open
   arms suggest that the protein malnutrition causes a permanent increase
   in the impulsiveness and/or an increased drive to explore open-arm
   novelty, leading to a behavior consistent with lower anxiety in
   malnourished animals, relative to that in well nourished animals, in
   this naturalistic animal model of anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{We studied over two weeks the decay of a population of Daphnia pulex
   that had invaded the previously cladoceran-free epilimnion of Lake Ciso.
   The cladoceran was found at concentrations up to 1,900 ind l-1 in the
   oxygenated epilimnion of the lake while most of the available food was
   concentrated in the metalimnion. D. pulex was never found in the
   hypolimnion with sulfide concentrations up to 1.2 mM. Probably due to
   the food distribution, D. pulex was forced to move into the anoxic lower
   part of the metalimnion. The animals spent most of the day at the
   surface, and descended especially at dawn to the upper level of the
   sulfide distribution. Mainly animals of sizes between 1.3 and 1.9 mm
   migrated. This pattern of population movement was related only to the
   food distribution and the oxygen profiles, and not to other factors
   commonly implicated in zooplankton vertical migrations (fish predation
   was absent). There was strong variability in the horizontal distribution
   of the animals that we associated to swarming behavior. During our study
   the population was in decline as shown by the lower indices of fertility
   and the higher mean sizes of the animals in the later weeks of sampling

   Comparisons across b. ourebi populations in Africa show that polygyny is
   positively correlated with the ratio of adult females to males,

Abstract = {{1.  Prey-size selectivity of predators can play an important role in
   determining the predators' impact on their prey.  In marine systems, a
   pattern of preference for small-sized molluscan prey is widespread among
   crustacean predators, even though predators are often able to consume
   prey over a wider size range.
   2.  In laboratory tests the blue crab Callinectes sapidus showed
   preference for smaller individuals of the hard clam Mercenaria
   mercenaria.  This was true for crabs starved for different durations of
   time, prior to experiment.  Hungrier crabs tended to be less selective
   than the less hungry ones, although not significantly so.
   3.  In order to determine whether such selectivity is hard-wired (i.e.
   engrained) or can be modified through experience, adult blue crabs were
   tested for preference between two different sizes of hard clams after a
   phase of conditioning on different combinations of live and sham (i.e.
   empty valves glued together and deployed in living position) clams of
   the two sizes.
   4.  In the conditioning trial, crabs consumed more sham clams of both
   sizes than live clams, although sham clams did not yield any energy
   return.  The greater consumption of sham clams by blue crabs might be
   explained by the lower cost of crushing dead clam shells, as dead shells
   seemed to be more brittle than the live ones.
   5.  Conditioning significantly affected size selectivity in the
   subsequent test trial.  Crabs assigned to different conditioning
   treatments consumed significantly different proportions of large clams
   in the test trial.  In particular, crabs that had consumed greater
   proportions of large (sham) clams during the conditioning trial also ate
   significantly greater proportions of large (live) clams in the test
   trial than those which had consumed greater proportions of small (sham)
   clams during conditioning.
   6.  These results indicate that the blue crabs' preference for
   small-sized clams does not result from a fixed decision rule and suggest
   that crabs might modify their preferences through experience. 
   Furthermore, the relative strength of shells seemed more important than
   profitability ratios in determining patterns of prey-size consumption.
   7.  An understanding of what perceptual and cognitive constraints
   underlie feeding preferences of `keystone' marine predators could help
   in making predictions about the impact of such predators on prey
   communities.}},

   fish kills in estuarine ecosystems of the southeastern USA. Here we
   report the first experimental tests of interactions between P.piscicida
   and estuarine zooplankton predators, specifically the rotifer Brachionus
   plicatilis and the calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa. Short-term (10 day)
   exposure of adult B.plicatilis to P.piscicida as a food resource, alone
   or in combination with the non-toxic green algae Nannochloris and
   Tetraselmis, did not increase rotifer mortality relative to animals that
   were given only non-toxic greens. Similarly, short-term (3 day) feeding
   trials using adult A.tonsa indicated that the copepods survived equally
   well on either P.piscicida or the non-toxic diatom Thalassiosira
   pseudonana. Copepods given toxic dinoflagellates exhibited erratic
   behavior, however, relative to animals given diatom prey. The fecundity
   of B.plicatilis when fed the toxic dinoflagellate was comparable to or
   higher than that of rotifers fed only non-toxic greens. We conclude
   that, on a short-term basis, toxic stages of P.piscicida can be readily
   utilized as a nutritional resource by these common estuarine
   zooplankters. More long-term effects of P.piscicida on zooplankton, the

   showed that both immature and mature whelks generally avoid L. polaris. 
   Surprisingly, densities of mature whelks up to 12 times the average were

Abstract = {{The tropical and subtropical estuarine fish Rivulus marmoratus is known
   for its synchronous, self-fertilizing hermaphroditism. It matures within
   3 mo and can produce eggs throughout the year These features would allow
   a particular strain to quickly colonize refuge such as crab holes in the
   high intertidal zone habitat. However, a high strain diversity has been
   found in the field. In order to explain this observation, we examined
   the phenotypic responses of R. marmoratus to variation in biotic and
   abiotic environmental factors over two consecutive generations and
   employed a modified Euler-Lotka equation to estimate and compare the net
   reproductive rate, R, among strains. We included five strains of R.
   marmoratus and manipulated levels of temperature, salinity, and food for
   the parental generation and levels of food only for the second
   generation. Low temperature (19 degrees C) inhibited sexual maturity,
   precluding any egg production during the entire 6-mo study. For
   individuals kept at high temperature (26 degrees C), salinity and food
   had an interactive effect on time to maturity, body size at maturity,
   and number of eggs produced. Using multivariate analysis of variance, we
   found a significant two-way interactive effect (food levels for the
   parental and the second generations) on the five reproductive traits
   studied in the second generation. When each trait was analyzed
   separately, we found significant three-way interactions for time to
   maturity and total length at maturity.
   We found that the fitness values for each strain varied in different
   environmental combinations (3 salinities x 3 incubation salinities for
   eggs x 2 food levels). However, four of five strains had similar overall
   fitness. Despite a lack of generic variation within each strain, X.
   marmoratus demonstrates considerable phenotypic variation in response to
   environmental changes. This feature and genetic variation among strains
   may explain how this species can survive and even prosper in an
   extremely variable and stressful environment.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in resource abundance affects population dynamics by altering
   demographic processes and interactions among individuals in the
   population. For small mammals, food is likely to be a critical resource.
   Population densities should vary directly with food abundance, but the
   underlying demographic changes are more difficult to predict. We
   experimentally increased food available to populations of hispid cotton
   rats, Sigmodon hispidus, to examine how rates of recruitment and
   disappearance varied with food abundance. We expected supplemental food
   to increase winter survival and to increase recruitment, perhaps
   advancing the date of first reproduction in the spring. We also thought
   larger behaviorally dominant animals might dominate the point sources of
   supplemental food, altering age or size ratios and producing an excess
   of transient animals.
   Supplemental food increased population densities but did not dampen
   pronounced seasonal fluctuations. Supplemented populations contained
   proportionately more juveniles and small adults than did controls;
   social behavior may have limited increases in numbers of large adults.
   Survival rates did not change; density increases were due to increased
   reproduction and immigration. In supplemented populations, reproductive
   effort by females increased, but the proportion of reproductive females
   decreased. Reproductive females and nonreproductive animals of both
   sexes were less likely to be transients than were reproductive males.
   Transients constituted higher proportions of control populations because
   of successful settlement, primarily by juveniles and small adults, into
   supplemented areas. The strongly seasonal climatic conditions under
   which northern S. hispidus populations exist produce contrasting
   selective pressures which might favor season-specific foraging
   strategies. Our data support a scenario of territorial females and
   wandering males in the reproductive season, with females maximizing
   resource acquisition for production of offspring. During winter, both
   sexes may restrict foraging time (and exposure to predators and weather)
   to the minimum required for survival.}},

Abstract = {{An individual-based population dynamics model (IBM) was used to examine
   the effect of different behavioral, bioenergetic, and physiological
   assumptions on individual growth and development of the copepod,
   Metridia lucens, in the North Atlantic Ocean. Both intrinsic
   (nutritional condition, feeding history, size) and extrinsic
   (temperature, food resources) factors that might determine individual
   growth and development rates were examined. An advantage of an IBM is
   that it allows for inter-individual variability, and can thereby provide
   an indication of the range of responses that might arise from natural
   variation in environmental conditions. The model is a refinement of an
   earlier model that successfully reproduced the observed stage structure
   and abundance of Metridia pacifica in the sub-arctic Pacific (Batchelder
   and Miller, 1989). Consequently, parameters for the ingestion and
   metabolic functions were set initially to those found appropriate for M.
   pacifica from previous model studies. Extrinsic forcing variables used
   to drive the population model were depth-specific temperature and
   chlorophyll a concentration. The model was run in two modes:
   chronological and individual. In the former mode, the model used
   measured temperature and chlorophyll a data to reproduce the
   life-history timing (phenology) and seasonal stage-structure of a M.
   lucens population measured in the early 1970s from Ocean Weather Station
   India in the North Atlantic. The individual mode was used to examine
   variation in growth caused by inter-individual variability in
   short-medium term starvation and feeding success. Ingestion, growth, and
   development were sensitive to variations in food resources. Factors that
   increased consumption rates, such as more effective searching for high
   chlorophyll layers, or recent starvation resulting in a `'hunger
   response'' in the functional response relation, led to markedly faster
   growth and development rates. Model simulations indicate that
   inter-individual variability in growth dynamics decreased for copepods
   capable of plasticity in the physiological hunger response or more
   effective food-searching behavior. Such searching behavior accentuated
   already existing inter-annual and intra-annual differences in individual
   growth dynamics forced by temperature and food. Conversely, hunger
   acclimation reduced intraannual (seasonal) variability and reduced,
   although only slightly, inter-annual variability in growth dynamics.
   These model results highlight the importance of understanding how
   copepods respond to environmental conditions. Two methods behavioral
   modification and physiological acclimation-by which copepods might
   ameliorate low food conditions, lead to different responses to temporal
   and spatial variability of resources. (C) 1995 International Council for

   (BDZ) receptor antagonist, flumazenil (FL; 4 mg/kg in drinking water),
   from the age of 13 through 22 months, significantly retarded the
   age-related loss of cognitive functions, as ascertained by the radial
   arm maze tests conducted two months after FL withdrawal.
   2) An equal number of 8 rats died in the control and FL-treated group
   before the behavioral tests were completed and the animals were
   sacrificed; the life span of the FL-treated 8 rats equaled 24.0 (+/-0.6
   SEM) months, while that of the control 8 rats equaled 22.3 months
   (+/-0.7 SEM), and the group difference was marginally significant
   (p=0.04 Mann-Whitney test).
   3) In rats sacrificed 3 months after FL withdrawal and behavioral
   testing, the protective action of FL, relative to age-matched controls,
   was revealed by a significant reduction in the age-related loss of
   neurons in the hippocampal formation.
   4) In the time period of 3 months between the drug withdrawal and
   sacrificing of the animals, stress experienced by the aging rats during
   behavioral testing, related to excessive daily handling of the animals
   and partial food deprivation to motivate them to perform in the radial
   arm maze, apparently had excitotoxic effects on the hippocampal neurons,
   as indexed by the presence of 30\% neurons in a state of moderate
   pyknosis found both in the FL group and the age-matched controls. In the
   6 months `'young'' control group, the number of pyknotic neurons equaled
   only 3.5\%. It was concluded that the drug withdrawal and stress of
   behavioral testing unleashed the previously FL-controlled age-related
   degeneration. On the basis of these results and the literature, showing
   that the tone of the GABAergic system increases with age, and
   particularly in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the hypothesis of brain aging
   was formulated. It postulates that in mammals, with growing age, and
   prematurely in humans with AD, the increasing tone of the BDZ/GABAergic
   system interferes with antero- and retrograde axonal transport through a
   chronic depolarizing block of preterminal axon varicosities of the
   ascending aminergic and cholinergic/peptidergic systems, which are
   indispensable for normal metabolic/trophic glial-neuronal relationships.
   Such a state leads to discrete anatomic deafferentation of forebrain
   systems, and particularly of the neocortex, where block of the
   anterograde axonal transport results in induction of the cortical mRNA
   responsible for synthesis of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta
   APP). The simultaneous block of retrograde transport from chronically
   depolarized preterminal axon varicosities may account for toxic
   accumulation in cortex of the nerve growth factor (NGF) and other
   trophins, without which the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons
   degenerate.
   The general pharmacologic profile of FL has been discussed on the basis
   of FL administration to animals and healthy and diseased humans. This
   profile shows that FL:
   1) increases brain metabolic functions;
   2) reduces emotional responses, thereby stabilizing the functions of the
   autonomic system in both humans and animals challenged by adverse
   environmental stimuli;
   3) improves cognitive and coordinated motor functions in both humans and
   animals;
   4) uniquely combines anxiolytic, vigilance and cognitive enhancing, i.e.
   nootropic, properties, which may, in part, stem from FL-induced
   emotional imperturbability (ataraxy);
   5) facilitates habituation of healthy humans and animals to novel but
   inconsequential environmental stimuli, and promotes non-aggressive
   interactions among animals;
   6) in single i.v. doses, and administered chronically to humans, FL has
   antiepileptic actions in the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and other forms of
   epilepsy characterized by `'spike-and-dome'' EEG patterns; these actions
   are likely to depend on FL's disinhibition of the serotonin system;
   7) administered in single i.v. doses to healthy humans, or chronically
   to 3-4 month-old rats in drinking water, FL causes restless,
   curiosity-driven and non-aggressive exploratory behavior, an effect
   which is probably related to increased brain metabolic functions, which
   in rats is indexed by increased time the animals spend in REM sleep
   without disturbing slow wave sleep EEG patterns.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of food to fish larvae influences the mean and variance
   of the growth rate in a cohort. At higher food densities, slower
   developing herring, Clupea harengus, larvae in the pre-metamorphic stage
   may co-occur with more developed, post-metamorphic individuals. The
   development of schooling in herring is closely associated with
   metamorphosis. To assess whether the presence of schooling conspecifics
   encouraged the premature development of schooling in larvae, laboratory
   reared larvae (length 29-31 mm) were exposed to wild-caught schooling
   juveniles (length 55 mm) for the duration of the experiment.
   Observations of larvae from the experimental group were carried out for
   37 days and the behaviour of the fish was recorded on video for
   subsequent analysis. These larvae were observed in the presence and
   absence of schooling juveniles with no food in the observation tank, and
   a few minutes and Ih after food was added. The behaviour of these two
   groups (juveniles present and juveniles absent) was compared with that
   of two additional groups (different rearing densities), where the larvae
   had not been exposed to schooling herring. The exposure to schooling
   conspecifics did not affect the degree of interaction among herring
   larvae unless the juveniles were present in the observation tank.
   Consequently, in the presence of a school the larvae seemed to opt for
   the increased protection of the school, regardless of associated
   disadvantages, such as greater competition for food. These findings are
   discussed in relation to larval vulnerability to predators. (C) 1995 The

Abstract = {{The present review focuses on the relation to human behavior and
   development of anthropometric or dietary indexes of mild-to-moderate
   malnutrition. The primary goal of the review is to integrate previous
   research findings with current findings from correlational studies
   conducted over the past decade. From this integration, the following
   conclusions may be drawn: 1) Chronic, mild postnatal malnutrition is
   associated with a variety of cognitive and behavioral deficits across
   the life span. The role of prenatal malnutrition in this process is less
   clear. 2) To understand the role chronic mild malnutrition plays in
   behavior and development, it is necessary to move beyond protein-calorie
   deficits to consider the role of intake of animal source foods and
   specific micronutrients such as iron, zinc and B vitamins. 3) Chronic
   mild malnutrition is embedded in a host of other biological and
   psychosocial risk factors. As a result, chronic mild malnutrition
   appears to be a necessary but insufficient condition for producing
   behavioral deficits. 4) The salience of chronic mild malnutrition as a
   risk factor is accentuated when other psychosocial-contextual risk
   factors are also present or when multiple low-level nutrient deficits
   are interacting. Suggestions for future research directions include an
   emphasis on interactions between nutrients and between specific
   psychosocial and nutritional risk factors; the ways in which individual
   (e.g., gender) or cultural characteristics can moderate nutrition
   development relations; and a broader range of populations, such as
   sibling or elderly caregivers, and outcome variables, such as
   social-emotional development, temperament and mental health.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of the ubiquity of omnivory in nature, its consequences for
   population dynamics have received little attention from theoretical and
   experimental ecologists. Having three direct consumer-resource links,
   three indirect numerical links, and a potential for indirect effects
   mediated by size structure and/or behavioral flexibility, a
   three-species omnivory system may exhibit complex population dynamics.
   In 2 x 3 m field enclosures in the littoral zone of a lake, I
   manipulated the dominating native benthivorous fish (greater than or
   equal to 2yr-old perch, Perca fluviatilis, omnivorous top consumer) and
   the dominating native benthic invertebrate predators (Sialis lutaria,
   Megaloptera, and odonates, intermediate consumers) in three gradients:
   increasing densities of perch in the near absence of Sialis and
   odonates, and increasing densities of Sialis and odonates in either the
   presence or absence of perch. The densities of their common prey (mainly
   chironomids) were left unmanipulated. Macroinvertebrate abundance,
   biomass, and size structure, as well as gut contents of perch and Sialis
   were sampled monthly over a 3-mo summer period.
   In the absence of perch, the experimental gradient of Sialis densities
   remained unchanged over time. In the presence of perch, Sialis decreased
   by about half at high initial densities, but remained unchanged at low
   initial densities. Perch also had a negative effect on odonates. In the
   near absence of Sialis and odonates, perch had a strong, negative effect
   on chironomids. Compared to enclosures without perch, chironomid
   abundance was strongly reduced at the lowest perch density, but leveled
   off with further increases in perch density. Sialis and odonates did not
   affect chironomid abundance when perch were absent. In contrast,
   chironomid abundance was positively affected by Sialis and odonates when
   perch were present. The overall effect of perch on chironomid abundance
   in the presence of Sialis and odonates was negative.
   The combined predatory and competitive effects of perch on Sialis and
   odonates raise the issue how Sialis and odonates coexist with perch. The
   lack of effect of perch on Sialis and chironomids at low densities of
   these prey suggests that prey refuges contribute significantly to their
   persistence in natural systems. The indirect positive effect of Sialis
   and odonates on chironomids indicates density dependence in per capita
   interaction coefficients and is most likely to be explained by a
   behavioral response of perch or chironomids to Sialis and odonates. I
   suggest that the theoretical and empirical investigation of model
   systems (such as three-component omnivory systems), which are
   sufficiently simple to be analytically and experimentally tractable, but
   still display a richness of common indirect effects, will contribute to
   our understanding of the dynamics of more complex food webs. Their study
   will benefit from experimental manipulations of more than one population
   at more than two densities.}},

Abstract = {{Animal welfare, or well-being, is a social issue with ethical,
   scientific, political, and aesthetic properties. Answering questions
   about the welfare of animals requires scientific definition, assessment,
   solutions, and public acceptance. With respect to the actual well-being
   of the animal, most issues are centered on how the animal `'feels'' when
   managed within a specific level of confinement, during special
   agricultural practices (e.g., tail docking, beak trimming, etc.) and
   handling. Questions of this nature may require exploration of animal
   cognition, motivation, perception, and emotional states in addition to
   more commonly recognized indicators of well-being Several general
   approaches have emerged for solving problems concerning animal
   well-being in intensive production systems: environmental, genetic, and
   therapeutic. Environmental approaches involve modifying existing systems
   to accommodate specific welfare concerns or development of alternative
   systems. Genetic approaches involve changing the behavioral and(or)
   physiological nature of the animal to reduce or eliminate behaviors that
   are undesirable within intensive system. Therapeutic approaches of a
   physical (tail docking, beak trimming) and physiological (drug and
   nutritional therapy) nature bring both concern and promise with regard
   to the reduction of confinement stress. Finally, the recent focus on
   commodity quality assurance programs may indirectly provide benefits for
   animal well-being. Although research in the area of animal well-being
   will provide important information for better animal management,
   handling, care, and the physical design of intensive production systems
   there is still some uncertainty regarding public acceptance. The
   aesthetics of modern intensive production systems may have as much to do
   with public acceptance as with science.}},

Abstract = {{Background Numerous psychosocial factors have been hypothesized to play
   a role in coronary heart disease. However, existing studies have yielded
   inconsistent results.
   Methods and Results The relations between type A personality as well as
   suppressed versus expressed anger and risk of nonfatal myocardial
   infarction (MI) were studied in 340 patients and 340 age-, sex-, and
   community-matched control subjects. Subjects were interviewed at home to
   assess behavioral and medical cardiovascular risk factors, and fasting
   blood samples were obtained. Type A personality was associated with
   nonfatal MI in crude matched-pair analysis (OR, 1.57; 95\% CI, 1.12 to
   2.20; P=.008). Adjusting for known cardiovascular risk factors
   (including treated hypertension, body mass index, treated diabetes,
   family history of premature MI, physical activity, smoking, alcohol,
   total calories per day, and saturated fat) did not substantially change
   the magnitude of the point estimate, although the finding was no longer
   statistically significant (OR, 1.43; 95\% CI, 0.97 to 2.09; P=.069).
   Further adjustment for lipids, including total cholesterol, total HDL,
   its subfractions (HDL(2), HDL(3)), LDL, LDL, and triglycerides, markedly
   attenuated the association (OR, 1.12; 95\% CI, 0.66 to 1.90; P=.687), an
   effect due almost entirely to HDL cholesterol. Suppressed anger was
   positively but not statistically significantly associated with increased
   risk of MI in crude matched-pair analysis (OR, 1.33; 95\% CI, 0.98 to
   1.81; P=.065), in analysis adjusted for behavioral and medical
   cardiovascular risk factors (OR, 1.26; 95\% CI, 0.89 to 1.78; P=.193),
   or after adjustment for lipids (OR, 1.11; 95\% CI, 0.67 to 1.82;
   P=.695).
   Conclusions These findings suggest a possible association of type A but
   not suppressed anger with risk of nonfatal MI that may be mediated by
   alterations in HDL cholesterol level. If decreases in HDL are not in the
   same causal pathway, then the apparent association between type A
   personality and risk of MI is due to confounding, principally by HDL.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major goals of an ecomorphological analysis is to correlate
   patterns of interspecific differences in morphology with patterns of
   interspecific differences in ecology. Information derived from
   functional morphological studies may provide a mechanistic framework
   supporting the correlation, but the move from a correlational
   relationship to a causal relationship requires experimental evidence
   that the interspecific morphological differences create performance
   differences and therefore ecological differences. The goal of this study
   was to examine ecomorphological relationships in the diets of cottid
   fishes (Scorpaeniformes: Cottidae) from the northeastern Pacific by
   using functional classifications of predators (based on their mode of
   attack) and of prey (based on their anti-predator defenses). The
   proposed ecomorphological relationships were tested by examining capture
   success among the cottids in attacks on prey with different escape
   abilities. As predicted on functional morphological grounds, both
   multivariate and univariate analyses indicated that the gravimetric
   importance of `elusive prey' (i.e. fishes, shrimp, mysids, and octopods)
   was greater in cottid species with a larger relative mouth size.
   Supporting a causal link between morphology and ecology, performance
   tests indicated that larger-mouthed cottids had significantly higher
   capture success on Heptacarpus shrimp than did smaller-mouthed species.
   As predicted, there were no differences in capture success among
   predators regardless of their attack style or ecomorphological patterns
   in attack on crabs (Cancer and Petrolisthes spp.) when the crabs were
   presented on a sand surface (i.e. `easy prey'). Several difficulties
   still exist when trying to apply a functional group approach to
   ecomorphology. These include the behavioral plasticity of the predators,
   the confounding factor of evolutionary history in identifying correlated
   ecomorphological features, multiple morphological solutions to common
   functional problems, the limitations of traditional dietary studies
   during extremes of prey abundance, and an inadequate understanding of
   the anti- predator defenses of most prey, including modifications that
   occur during ontogeny or in different habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The energetic cost of signalling may be important in maintaining the
   honesty of the signal, yet it is rarely measured directly. Oxygen
   consumption during crowing by roosters, Gallus gallus domesticus, was
   measured in a closed-circuit indirect calorimeter. Although there was a
   positive relationship between crowing and O-2 consumption, roosters
   consumed only 0.005 ml/g/h for each vocalization. Thus at the average
   crowing rate, O-2 consumption rate would be 15\% above standing, which
   is less than the cost of low-level activities such as feeding, drinking
   and preening, and over 10 times less than the maximum sustainable
   metabolic rate. These results contrast with previous reports of high
   energy consumption during calling in insects and frogs, which approach
   or exceed maximal levels. Other costs, such as predation and social
   retaliation, are probably more important than energetic costs in
   maintaining crowing as an honest signal. (C) 1995 The Association for

Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{47-66}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory rats, like many other animal species, transport food, Their
   behavior is influenced by factors such as food size, the time required
   to eat, travel distance, travel difficulty, and the availability of
   cover, etc. Recent versions of optimal foraging theory suggest that
   species that display such behavioral patterns do so in order to minimize
   risk to predation while at the same time maximizing food gain.
   Nevertheless, it is not clear that this explanation applies to rats, nor
   is it easy to investigate this problem in a laboratory. The results of
   the present study on urban feral rats show that their food handling
   behavior is similar to that of domestic rats, The results also suggest
   that food carrying can serve defensive as well as communicative
   functions, Aggression around food sources was high, Smaller rats always
   carried food and some large rats infrequently carried food, suggesting
   that the food carrying by smaller, subordinate rats may help them avoid
   conspecific aggression. The rats also vigorously attempted to steal food
   that was carried home by conspecifics. This result suggests that food
   carrying can redistribute food resources and inform conspecifics about
   food availability, The results demonstrate the utility of multilevel
   behavioral analysis and also demonstrate that for rats, food transport
   has functions other than predator avoidance, including avoidance of
   conspecific aggression and communication about food availability. (C)

Abstract = {{This study examines the non-lethal effects of an odonate predator (Anax
   junius) on the competitive interactions among several size classes of
   anuran larvae, In an outdoor experiment using cattle watering tanks, we
   estimated the effects of both large and small bullfrogs (Rana
   catesbeiana) on themselves, on each other, and on small green frogs (R.
   clamitans) in the absence and non-lethal (caged) presence of Anax. The
   presence of Anax depressed both growth and survivorship of small
   bullfrogs and green frogs. In contrast, the presence of Anax had
   positive effects on growth rates and size at metamorphosis of the large
   bullfrogs. Increasing density of competitors also decreased survivorship
   of small classes, and growth rates of all classes. The per-unit-biomass
   competitive effects of the small bullfrogs on target classes were much
   greater than those of large bullfrogs. The presence of Anax
   significantly altered the per-unit-biomass competitive effects of small
   bullfrogs but not large bullfrogs, presumably because individuals in the
   small class reduced their activity rates in the presence of Anax.
   Overall production of new tadpole biomass was quite similar across
   experimental units, with decreases in production of small size classes
   in the presence of Anax compensated for by increases in production of
   the large size class. Thus the non-lethal presence of Anax had
   substantial effects on the nature of competitive interactions in this
   system, and we discuss the implications of such behavioral indirect
   effects in the study of ecological communities; Our results also
   illustrate the futility of attempting to partition the effects of
   competitors and predators, as both competitors and the non-lethal
   presence of predators significantly affected growth rates and death by
   starvation of small larvae. Finally, our results illustrate how
   individual behavioral responses may be translated to community and
   ecosystem properties.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus, have
   strong effects on the activity, habitat use, social interactions and
   mating dynamics of a stream-dwelling water strider, Aquarius remigis
   (family Gerridae, hence, gerrids). In nature, however, stream pools
   often contain not just sunfish and water striders, but also smaller fish
   such as minnows. Here, we used factorial experiments in seminatural
   streams to document the direct and indirect effects of sunfish and
   fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, on water strider survival and
   behavior. Sunfish, minnows and gerrids all consume surface prey (here,
   crickets); thus these three species are potential food competitors.
   Sunfish eat minnows. Accordingly, the presence of sunfish caused minnows
   to increase their schooling behavior and shift their activity from the
   surface toward the bottom substrate. The presence of sunfish was also
   associated with an increase in the number of missing gerrids, whereas
   minnows caused relatively little gerrid disappearance. Most
   interestingly, the presence of minnows decreased the effect of sunfish
   on gerrid disappearance rates; that is, minnows apparently had an
   indirect positive effect on water strider survival. We suggest that this
   indirect positive effect reflects the fact that minnows are alternative
   prey for sunfish. The effects of sunfish and minnows on gerrid mortality
   explained the influence of these fish on gerrid behavior. Sunfish caused
   decreases in male gerrid activity, female availability, mating activity,
   mating frequency and mating duration. Larger males had a mating
   advantage over smaller males only in pools with sunfish and no minnows.
   Sunfish also caused a borderline significant decrease in the large
   female mating advantage. These results were all observed in previous
   studies and can be viewed as adaptive responses to predation risk. These
   patterns were not consistent with the expected effects of sunfish as
   food competitors with water striders. In contrast, minnows had
   relatively Little influence on water strider behavior and the few
   significant effects were the opposite of those of sunfish. Minnows
   caused increases in female activity and in mating duration, a decrease
   in the large male mating advantage and an increase in the large female
   mating advantage. These patterns fit the view that minnows caused an
   increase in gerrid hunger, i.e., that minnows acted as food competitors
   with gerrids. Finally, planned contrasts against controls showed that,
   in the presence of both sunfish and minnows, water striders showed no
   significant behavioral responses to fish (i.e., gerrid behavior in pools
   with sunfish and minnows did not significantly differ from behavior in
   fishless pools). The most likely mechanism explaining this pattern is a
   dilution of sunfish predation risk due to the presence of minnows
   serving as alternative prey for sunfish.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously shown that endogenous opioid systems (i.e.

   behavioural and physiological effects of biting-fly exposure. Opioid
   mediated reductions in pain sensitivity, or, more appropriately,
   nociceptive sensitivity (latency of a foot-lifting response to a 50
   degrees C thermal surface), are evident in laboratory mice, Mus musculus
   domesticus, exposed to biting flies. Similar opioid-mediated reductions
   in pain sensitivity (opioid analgesia) are also seen after exposure to a
   variety of other natural stressors such as the threat of predation.
   Here, we demonstrate that brief (30-min) exposure of male mice to stable
   flies, Stomoxys calcitrans, significantly and synergistically augments
   either the concurrent or subsequent (60 min after fly exposure)
   analgesic effects induced by exposure to a predator (cat odour). These
   results demonstrate that the analgesic, and probably other opioid
   mediated behavioural and physiological stress responses induced by
   exposure tb a relatively low number of biting flies, are markedly
   increased by the presence of another natural aversive stimulus. In
   addition, they show that biting-fly exposure significantly exacerbates

   come from social insects(3). It has been suggested that the proportion
   of workers of various physical castes has evolved to enhance the fitness
   of colony members(4,6) with the prediction that caste ratios should vary
   with environmental factors such as predation, competition and food
   availability. However, because it has been difficult to manipulate
   experimentally the environmental factors believed to influence optimal
   caste ratio, demonstration of adaptive caste distribution has remained
   elusive(7-10). Here we show that colonies of the ant Pheidole pallidula

Abstract = {{Two fundamental questions in the study of cooperatively breeding birds
   are (1) do auxiliaries increase the reproductive success of a flock, and
   (2) if so, how? This paper addresses these questions in the
   white-throated magpie-jay, Calocitta formosa. This social corvid was
   studied for three consecutive breeding seasons in Santa Rosa National
   Park, Costa Rica. Detailed information was gathered on 16 breeding
   flocks attending a total of 56 active nests. Auxiliaries were divided
   into three classes depending on their residency patterns and relative
   contributions to the breeding effort. The influence of auxiliaries was
   examined on eight measures of nesting success, and on five factors that
   influence reproductive outcome in this population: (1) onset of first
   laying, (2) predation, (3) hatching failure, (4) clutch desertion and
   (5) starvation. The results support three major conclusions. First,
   helpers directly enhanced nesting success at every stage in the nesting
   cycle. Second, all helpers did not help equally. Flock size alone bore
   no relationship to nesting success, but both the number of full-time
   helpers and helper score (a weighted measure of auxiliary contributions)
   were significantly related to reproductive outcome. Third, helpers
   increased breeding success by hastening the onset of first laying,
   reducing predation on eggs and chicks, and decreasing hatching failure;
   helpers did not affect the incidence of clutch desertion or chick
   starvation. These findings provide strong quantitative support for the
   anti-predator hypothesis and provide the first unequivocal evidence that
   helpers can enhance nest success by increasing hatchability. (C) 1996

Abstract = {{The effects of reduced food availability on the behavior of juvenile
   walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma were examined in laboratory
   experiments designed to test for potential energy-conserving responses.
   Groups of juvenile fish were held on 1 of 6 ration treatments ranging
   from ad libitum to near starvation, and then vertical distribution and
   activity levels were quantified in a 2.5 m deep water column under
   isothermal and thermally stratified conditions. Stratification resulted
   in a general shift to the upper, warmer layer in the 2 experiments
   employing a sharp thermocline at mid-depth, but the occurrence of fish
   in the colder bottom layer varied with different ration treatments.
   Movement into cold water increased in intermediate ration groups
   compared to high ration groups. Since reduced temperatures should reduce
   metabolic costs, this behavior is consistent with our hypothesis that
   food deprivation should invoke energy-saving behaviors. However,
   activity levels increased for fish held on intermediate rations,
   suggesting that the greater movement into cold water was a corollary
   result of increased searching for food. Fish in the lowest ration
   treatments had decreased activity levels, but also decreased their
   movement into cold water when a sharp thermocline was present, negating
   potential bioenergetic benefits. In the third experiment, there was a
   gradual thermal gradient from surface to bottom rather than a sharp
   thermocline. Temperatures associated with vertical positions of the fish
   were determined. In this experiment, clear energy-conserving responses
   to temperature were displayed by food-deprived fish; the average
   temperatures occupied by fish on starvation rations were 3 to 4 degrees
   C colder than those of the higher ration groups. Based on the high Q(10)
   for metabolic rates of juvenile pollock, these reduced temperatures
   potentially conferred energy savings of up to 34\%, relative to the
   metabolic expenditures of fish on high rations. The contrast in behavior
   for the lowest ration groups between sharply stratified and gradually
   stratified conditions suggested that the severity of the temperature
   gradient influenced the fishes' ability to take advantage of cold water
   as an energetic refuge. The behavior of fish in the laboratory was
   consistent with prior observations in the Bering Sea, where juvenile
   walleye pollock remained in surface waters if food availability was
   high, but initiated vertical migration into deeper, colder water with
   reduced prey densities. Results of this study demonstrated a broad
   flexibility in the behavioral mechanisms used by walleye pollock to deal
   with declining food levels. The initial response to food limitation was
   increased activity, indicative of greater searching behavior. With
   extended food deprivation, a switch to energy-conserving behavior was
   evident. The temperature responses of fish experiencing severe food
   limitation provided support for a bioenergetic hypothesis of diel
   vertical migration.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of a prey's food resources on predator-induced morphological
   transformation was studied in two ciliate species: Euplotes
   octocarinatus (prey) and Stylonychia mytilus (predator). The ability to
   produce defence in Euplotes was much reduced by prolonged starvation.
   The extent of prey morphological transformation and therefore the
   effectiveness of the defence was inversely related to the length of time
   without food. The results suggest that the defence involves an energetic
   cost which may be a significant part of the whole cell budget, at least
   when food is in short supply. Not only the morphological transformation
   but also the maintenance of the anti-predator phenotype were
   energetically costly for Euplotes, the cost being proportional to the
   defence level. The morphological transformation was affected by the kind
   of food (algae) provided to the prey. Ciliates fed Chlorogonium
   elongatum attained their maximum width sooner than those fed
   Chlamydomonas. Thus, both the quantity and the quality of the food
   available may significantly affect the magnitude of response and
   therefore the potential success of an induced defence.}},

Abstract = {{Optimum reproductive efficiency of farmed deer is often constrained by
   apparent maladaptation of wild cervids to a given farm environment or
   components of that environment. Seasonal breeding amongst forest-fringe
   species of northern temperate origin (e.g. red deer, fallow deer)
   benefits the species within its natural range, but often creates
   misalignment in southern temperate zones between the high nutritional
   demands of lactation in summer and the earlier peak of pasture
   production and quality occurring in spring. This can lead to increased
   calf mortality, decreased calf growth rates and depressed dam
   liveweights. Much emphasis has been placed on manipulating either
   pasture production patterns or the timing of birth to create better
   synchrony between the two. The latter largely involves artificial
   manipulation of the timing of conceptions (e.g. melatonin treatment),
   but there may also be options for genetic selection of deer for earlier
   calving patterns. Tropical cervid species farmed in temperate
   environments can exhibit either a seasonal reproduction (e.g. chital
   deer) or autumn-wintering calving patterns (e.g. rusa deer), leading to
   high mortality of neonates (hypothermia, predation) under uncontrolled
   breeding management. However, there are simple management options to
   synchronise and shift calving patterns to better align tropical species
   to temperate environments.
   The effects of chronic and acute stress on reproductive efficiency of
   farmed deer are often discussed but seldom demonstrated. Many farmed
   deer populations exhibit high pregnancy rates (i.e. > 90\% females
   pregnant), indicating robust reproductive physiology and general
   habituation to the farmed habitat. Low reproductive rates of pubertal
   red deer hinds in some herds may be partly indicative of the effects of
   chronic stress, although other factors such as social facilitation and
   nutrition cannot be discounted.
   While species of cervids that are used for farming generally display a
   high degree of behavioural plasticity, the farm environment and
   associated management practices may impinge on important components of
   the social environment. Thus, practices such as controlled breeding
   (e.g. single-sire mating) and confinement during calving may have
   effects on reducing overall reproductive potential by disrupting social
   processes (e,g. dam-calf bonds). This highlights the paucity of
   knowledge on the complexities of cervid behaviour and their implications
   in both wild and farmed deer.}},

   First-hatched (A) chicks either obtained more feeding time, or begged
   less for the same feeding time, than their siblings (B-chicks) in all

   food associated with rapid growth, coupled with increasing mobility,
   appeared to intensify competition, and A-chicks had to beg longer for
   the same feeding time than their siblings. By 41-60 days A-chicks were
   again gaining more feeding time than B-chicks. A-chicks were better
   coordinated, using their weight advantage effectively during scramble

Abstract = {{To characterize the organisation of behaviour, the responses to chemical

   were tested in the laboratory. Stimuli were introduced both singly and
   in combinations on three days (one, four, and seven days after the crabs
   were last fed). First, responses to single inputs were characterized:
   (a) odour of a predator elicited an increase in locomotion; (b) odour of
   food also elicited an increase in locomotion; (c) odour resulting from
   snail predation (a signal of availability of an empty shell) elicited
   brief grasps of the shells of other crabs and (d) the odour of
   conspecific blood elicited long grasps of shells.
   Individual crabs differed significantly in their tendencies to respond
   to chemical signals. Those responding strongly to one cue responded
   strongly to other cues. Those responding to one shell-related cue (snail
   odour) responded to the other such cue (conspecific blood) and
   individuals showing a stronger response to food odours the first day did
   so on subsequent days.
   Combinations of cues yielded examples of both summation of inputs (rate
   of locomotion when snail and predator odours were combined) and
   inhibition of the responses to one input by the detection of the second
   odour (brief grasps typical of the response to snail odour were
   eliminated by addition of predator odour). Responses to conspecific
   blood were unaffected by predator odour detection. Increasing levels of
   hunger resulted in increases in locomotion in response to some chemical
   signals (control, snail odour, and conspecific blood)and a decrease in
   the number of brief grasps elicited by snail odour.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of moonlight on the foraging behaviour of the scorpion
   Buthus occitanus israelis was observed. In contrast to their visual
   predators, most scorpions use air and surface vibrations to locate their
   prey. Therefore, moonlight is not likely to have a direct effect on the
   scorpions' foraging behaviour, but rather an indirect effect through
   changes in risk from predation or changes in prey availability. Adult
   scorpions were less active on moonlit nights than on dark nights, and
   adults that were active on full moon nights tended to ambush under
   bushes. Juveniles, however, did not seem to alter their activity as a
   response to moonlight. Mass-to-size ratios of adult scorpions foraging
   on moonlit nights were significantly lower than those of scorpions
   foraging on dark nights, suggesting that scorpions that forage in bright
   moonlight are individuals with relatively low energy reserves. The
   results are consistent with the hypothesis that risk of predation is

Abstract = {{In the hatchery environment, there is no selection by predators against
   risky foraging behaviour and excessive aggressiveness. Consequently,
   hatchery-reared trout should have a higher competitive ability and a
   less pronounced antipredator response than wild trout. Growth hormone
   increases the energy demand and thereby the feeding motivation of an
   animal. Therefore, growth hormone injections should reduce the
   antipredator response and promote competitive ability. Both hatchery
   selection and growth hormone injection consistently reduced antipredator
   behavioural responses in juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) in the
   presence of a trout predator. However, neither hatchery selection nor
   growth hormone had any effect on dominance or quantity of contested food
   consumed, whereas both hatchery selection and growth hormone injection
   promoted growth. RNA levels were increased by growth hormone, and
   hatchery-reared trout had lower RNA levels than wild trout. The presence
   of the predator increased RNA levels in the trout independent of strain
   and treatment. Our study suggests that antipredator behaviour, growth
   rate, and resource allocation patterns in brown trout change rapidly as

Abstract = {{Facultative paedomorphosis in salamanders occurs when larvae respond to
   varying environmental conditions by either metamorphosing into
   terrestrial metamorphic adults or retaining their larval morphology to
   become sexually mature paedomorphic adults. Several hypotheses have been
   proposed for the evolutionary maintenance of this environmentally
   induced dimorphism, but few data are available to assess them
   adequately. We studied a montane population of the tiger salamander,
   Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum, and measured the adult growth rate and
   body condition across three growing seasons to assess the relative costs
   and benefits of each morph. Metamorphic adults grew more than
   paedomorphic adults in terms of snout-vent length across years and in
   weight within years. Dietary analyses and foraging experiments revealed
   some of the proximate factors that may underlie these differential
   growth patterns. Across all prey, metamorphs had significantly higher
   biomass and calories per stomach sample than paedomorphs. Metamorphic
   diets primarily consisted of the fairy shrimp Branchinecta coloradensis,
   whereas paedomorphic diets contained a variety of benthic and
   terrestrial invertebrates. Foraging experiments revealed that both
   morphs are more successful at capturing fairy shrimp relative to other
   prey types and both show high electivity toward this prey. However,
   fairy shrimp occurred only in non-permanent ponds and thus are
   inaccessible to paedomorphs, which can survive only in permanent ponds.
   Paedomorphs also experience higher levels of intraspecific competition
   with large larvae in permanent ponds than metamorphs do in non-permanent
   ponds. Thus, metamorphs obtain a growth advantage over paedomorphs by
   foraging in non-permanent ponds that contain fairy shrimp and have
   reduced intraspecific competition. These results suggest that
   paedomorphs should have decreased fitness relative to metamorphs,
   primarily because metamorphs can move into the best habitats for growth.
   The net fitness effect of morph-specific differences in dispersal depend
   on whether there are trade-offs with other life history traits.
   Nonetheless, because the relative benefit of metamorph dispersal will
   change with environmental conditions in permanent ponds and the
   surrounding habitat, the relative fitness payoff to each morph should
   track changes in the environment. Thus, facultative paedomorphosis may
   be maintained in part by variable, environmentally-specific fitness
   payoffs to each morph.}},

   Principal component analyses were used to reduce the number of variables

   generally more than twice that explained by any subsequent components.

   gilts respond consistently to a specific challenge, they do not display
   the same consistency when challenged in a different context. This lack
   of inter-situation correlations, plus the absence of multimodal
   distributions, fails to support the view that behavioural `types' of

Abstract = {{Typically, tests of risk-sensitive foraging involve observing a
   subject's choices of alternative prey types differing in some
   combination of mean and variance of expected foraging gain. Here, we
   consider the problem of risk-sensitive foraging when there is a single
   prey type. We observed worker bumble bees (Bombus occidentalis) foraging
   in an array of artificial 2-flower inflorescences. After visiting the
   bottom flower in an inflorescence and obtaining a reward of some size,
   the bee decides whether to visit the top flower or to move to a new
   inflorescence (a patch departure). Here, risk-sensitive behavior is
   expressed as the forager's choice of patch departure threshold (PDT) of
   reward obtained in the bottom flower. We measured the PDTs of bees whose
   colony energy stores (and therefore energy requirements) had been
   manipulated (Enhanced or Depleted). Simulations led us to predict that
   shortfall-minimizing bees should decrease their PDTs when their colony
   energy reserves were depleted, relative to when the reserves were
   enhanced. Bees did not use a strict patch departure threshold, but
   instead the probability of departure varied with nectar volume in the
   bottom flower. Colony energy stores did affect patch departure behavior,
   but this effect was confounded by the order in which manipulation of
   colony reserves was applied, Further, simulations of observed bee patch
   departure decisions did not produce behavior expected if the decisions
   were based on shortfall-minimization. We conclude that a bee's decision
   of when to leave an inflorescence is not predicted by a static
   shortfall-minimizing model. Our results also implicate an important
   interaction between learning and foraging requirements. We review
   risk-sensitivity in bees, and discuss why risk-sensitive foraging may be
   adaptive for bumble bees.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with risk sensitivity in amount of food, and is
   concerned with modelling the risk-sensitive behaviour exhibited by an
   animal which is attempting to survive a period such as winter. I argue
   that, in maximising survival probability, risk-averse behaviour is much
   more important than risk-prone behaviour. I also argue that animals in
   the laboratory will continue to use rules which are adapted to food
   sources which change over time. A model of environmental change is
   investigated. This model predicts that a consequence of change is that
   less risk-prone behaviour than that predicted by standard models is to
   be expected in laboratory studies. The need to learn about a stochastic
   food source in a changing environment is predicted to further reduce the
   incidence of risk-prone behaviour. It is difficult to learn about highly
   variable food sources. This is shown to lead to risk-aversion even when
   the optimisation criterion is maximisation of mean long-term rate of
   food gain.
   Implications of the general modelling philosophy are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We compare the (relative) abundance of life phases {[}juveniles (JU),
   initial phase (IF) and terminal phase (TP) fish], social categories
   (territorial and group adults), and fish following alternative mating
   styles, in three local populations of the protogynous reef herbivore,
   Sparisoma viride, on the fringing reef of Bonaire (Netherlands
   Antilles). In order to determine the adaptive significance of variations
   in social organization, they are related to the density of conspecifics
   and other herbivores and to the availability of food, shelter and mating
   sites. The most striking difference is the high abundance of JU and
   group fish at one location (Playa Frans) and the total absence of group
   fish at another (Red Slave). These differences are coherent with a
   gradient in population density, total herbivore density, scarid grazing
   pressure, and reproductive output, all of which are highest at Playa
   Frans and lowest at Red Slave. Exposure to waves and currents shows an
   inverse trend. The differences in the relative abundance of territorial
   fish can be explained by the concept of economic defendability, which is
   reduced at higher population density. In a life history context, small
   TP group males represent `bachelors' that sacrifice current reproduction
   for better future prospects. As predicted by life history theory, early
   sex change is promoted at sites where the future rewards are higher
   (higher spawning rates of large TP males) and where the costs incurred
   during the bachelor phase are reduced (more spawning opportunities for
   group TP males). At Red Slave an alternative male mating style
   ('streaking') appears to be promoted by the lack of a refuge for group
   TP males and by a dense gorgonian canopy, allowing IP males to reside
   inside territories. We conclude that most observed differences in
   population structure can be considered adaptive in an ecological and in
   a life history context. Population density is a major factor in both
   contexts. Analysis of the variability in adult density in relation to JU
   density and the availability of food and shelter indicates that the S.
   viride populations at Bonaire are not totally controlled by stochastic
   processes. Considering the small spatial scale and the high dispersal of
   the planktonic embryos and larvae, the observed variability in
   behavioural and life history traits of S. viride points to a high degree
   of phenotypic plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the behavioral responses of larvae of the American
   toad, Bufo americanus, to the presence of an invertebrate predator,
   larvae of the dragonfly Anax junius. In particular, we examine whether
   responses to predators are categorical ones to some threshold level of
   predation risk or alternatively whether the responses are adjustable
   depending on the level of predation risk. If the responses are graded,
   does the response vary according to what cues about predation risk are
   available to prey? Because avoiding predation can incur costs in terms
   of resource acquisition, does food availability affect the responses of
   toad larvae to their predators? Finally, because predation risk is a
   function of body size, we also examined whether the response to predator
   presence was affected by size of toad larvae. We addressed these
   questions by measuring the activity levels and habitat use of toad
   larvae in the presence and absence of predators while manipulating
   predator density, whether the predators had fed, food availability, and
   larval toad size. In an additional experiment, we also measured activity
   and movement speed of toad larvae when we manipulated food availability
   and predator density. We found that toad larvae were less active as
   predator density increased and as food availability increased. Small
   toad larvae were more sensitive to the presence of predators than were
   large larvae. Although toad larvae did reduce activity by 35\% in the
   presence of fed predators as opposed to unfed predators, the result was
   not statistically significant. Toad larvae did avoid predators, but the
   level of avoidance could not be shown to vary with predator density,

   may face no trade-off between habitats and therefore be able to
   generalize in their habitat use. Food web interactions define the

   some niches to be lost and replaced by other niches as one moves between

Volume = {{65}},

Abstract = {{1. In this study we investigated sources of variation in growth rate and
   survival in the common lizard Lacerta vivipara.
   2. We conducted two experiments to identify factors that explain the
   pattern of geographic variation of life-history traits in this species.
   In the first experiment, we raised hatchlings from two French
   populations of L. vivipara, located at low (150 m) and high (1400 m)
   altitudes, under identical laboratory conditions. The hatchlings grew at
   the same rate when experiencing the same environmental conditions
   irrespective of their origin. This finding suggests that the observed
   differences in growth rate between these two populations of L. vivipara
   are driven by environmental factors (e.g. thermal environment) rather
   than genetic divergence. Although we did not find any genetic difference
   between populations, we found some evidence of within-population
   variation in growth rate.
   3. In a second experiment, we raised hatchlings from the high altitude
   population in outdoor enclosures located at low and high altitudes. The
   site where hatchlings were raised had a large impact on both growth and
   survival. Lizards located in the low altitude site grew faster and had a
   higher mortality rate than lizards located in the high altitude site.
   These findings are consistent with the observed differences in growth
   and survival between the natural populations inhabiting the two
   localities,
   4. In spite of the low statistical power of the models used to detect
   the family x environment interactions, we found a marginally significant
   interaction for survival (P = 0.054), which suggests that phenotypic
   plasticity of this trait may have some degree of genetic variance.
   5. Finally, we did not find any evidence for a genetic correlation
   between growth and survival in the high altitude population. This
   suggests that the observed phenotypic trade-off between the two traits
   may arise from environmental constraints (e.g. more active lizards have
   higher growth rates but also have higher risks of predation).
   6. Overall, our findings emphasize that environmental factors may play a
   major role in shaping patterns of life-history association in L.
   vivipara, and in explaining geographic variation of life histories.}},

Pages = {{75-81}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Many passerines wintering in temperate regions rely on their energy
   reserves for survival during periods when foraging is not possible.
   Excessive fat reserves, however, increase body mass and thus reduce
   agility and speed in flight, imposing a survival cost when the bird
   tries to escape from predators. If fat reserves reflect a trade-off
   between starvation and predation risks, the size of reserves could be
   expected to vary with the perceived level of predation risk. The
   hypothesis that increasing the relative risk of predation results in
   decreased body mass was tested experimentally using captive
   greenfinches, Carduelis chloris. Greenfinches show winter fattening and
   take flight when disturbed and are therefore suitable for testing the
   hypothesis. The perceived predation risk, a stuffed predator moved in
   the birds' environment, resulted in lower body mass. Handling the birds
   had the same effect. These results support theoretical predictions and
   some field data regarding the adjustment of body mass to variation in
   the predation risk. They further suggest, in line with other studies,
   that birds are able to change body mass in response to proximate
   factors.

Abstract = {{Classical software reliability research has tended to focus on
   behavioral-type failures which typically manifest themselves as
   incorrect or missing outputs. In real-time software, a correct output
   which is not produced within a specified response time interval may also
   constitutes a failure. As a result, response time failures must also be
   taken into account when real-time software reliability is assessed.
   Response-time requirements can be stated in a hard or a soft form, The
   latter form is often preferred wizen the quality of service offered is
   of concern. fn a number of real-time applications, the responses to a
   particular stimulus are highly state dependent and, therefore, the
   response time requirements must be predicated on state.
   This paper considers the case where the detection of response times
   failures is done by a separate unit which observes the inputs and
   outputs of the target software. Automatic detection of such failures is
   complicated by state dependencies which require the unit to track a
   target's state as well as the elapsed times between specified stimulus
   and response pairs. A novel, black-box approach is described for
   detecting response time failures and quality of service degradations of
   session-oriented, real-time software.
   The behavior of the target software is assumed to be specified in a
   formalism based on the notion of communicating extended finite state
   machines. The response time failure detection unit, implemented
   independently of the target software, interprets a formal model derived
   directly from the target's requirement specifications. The model is used
   both to track the state of the target and to determine when to start and
   stop time interval timing measurements. Measurements of multiple
   response time intervals may occur simultaneously. The approach was
   evaluated on the call processing program of a small telephone exchange
   Some results of the evaluation are presented and discussed.}},

   10-19\%. Statistically significant differences were found in lipid

   Lake Erie had significantly higher lipid concentration values than Lake

Abstract = {{Polygyny appears to be beneficial for males, yet comprises less than
   20\% of all pair bonds formed by male willow ptarmigan, Lagopus lagopus.
   This study tested whether polygyny was costly to males. Polygynous males
   defended larger territories than monogamous and unpaired males and were
   more likely to be adults than males of other pairing status. Pairing
   status changed throughout the life of some males. Naturally polygynous
   males were in better body condition in the early part of the breeding
   season than other male types, and unpaired territorial males had the
   lowest condition. Naturally polygynous males had a tendency to lose the
   least amount of body mass over the season. Naturally polygynous and
   monogamous males had larger combs than males of other pairing status.
   Polygynous males had higher reproductive success, similar survival and
   similar future reproductive success compared with monogamous and
   unpaired territorial males. Even in years of high clutch predation, and
   accounting for higher levels of extra-pair paternity in the clutches of
   polygynous males, naturally polygynous males were more successful than
   other male types. A group of experimentally polygynous males (i.e. they
   became polygynous because of a male removal experiment) had similar
   reproductive success to naturally polygynous males, but lower overwinter
   survival than other male types. These results suggest that naturally
   polygynous males were older and `better' than other males and this
   allowed them to defend larger territories and attract more than one
   female. Males that became polygynous only as a result of our experiment,
   however, appeared to suffer costs from this increased breeding effort.

Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{43-52}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. Trophic breadth may be correlated with behavioural and functional
   versatility or flexibility (Liem 1984), such that species with limited
   diets would be predicted to be less versatile or flexible in their
   feeding capabilities than would trophic generalists. The relationship
   was examined between the trophic breadth of a species and the degree to
   which muscle activity is influenced by prey type in two species of
   pufferfishes: Chilomycterus schoepfi, a specialist on hard-shelled prey,
   and Sphoeroides nephalus, a generalist predator. It was predicted that
   the specialist would show a decreased ability to alter its motor pattern
   in response to prey type and an increased amount of motor-pattern
   variability when feeding on different prey.
   2. Electromyographic recordings of five feeding muscles were made from
   five individuals per species feeding on four prey types that differed in
   their hardness and escape abilities. Muscle-activity duration, relative
   onset and integrated rectified area were analysed for prey capture and
   manipulation behaviours for each prey type,
   3. Prey-type effects on mean motor-pattern variables for capture were
   limited to one of 14 variables in each species. Prey effects on buccal
   manipulation were not significant for any of the 14 variables for C.
   schoepfi, but S. nephalus exhibited prey effects for seven out of 14
   variables. No differences in motor-pattern variation were found for the
   strike, but-species differed significantly in overall motor-pattern
   variability during buccal manipulation; C. schoepfi, the dietary
   specialist, exhibited greater motor variability than S. nephalus, the
   dietary generalist.
   4. The results therefore support a direct relationship between the
   trophic breadth of a species and its functional versatility for buccal
   manipulation. In contrast, prey capture was a relatively stereotyped
   behaviour for both species, as few prey-type effects were found.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Baboon, Papio cynocephalus, populations show a circumscribed range of
   troop sizes, dependent on features of the habitat that set limits on the
   ability of animals to balance their time budgets. To assess the proposal
   that a rising probability of troop fission is the mechanism underlying
   this it is first shown that (1) the distribution of troop sizes in two
   very different baboon populations, in the Drakensberg and at Amboseli,
   are not described by the null model of random allocation of individuals
   to troops (the Poisson process); and (2) data on troops undergoing or
   attempting fission support the hypothesis that the probability of
   fission increases with increasing troop size. A model was constructed
   that generated a distribution of troop size from an underlying,
   `pre-fission' distribution by varying two parameters: the probability
   that a troop of given size will split, and the relative sizes of the two
   daughter troops that result if fission occurs. Both the Drakensberg and
   the Amboseli populations were adequately described by the model and it
   is concluded that the distribution of troop size in both populations is
   governed by fission in the manner proposed by Dunbar (1992, Behav. Ecol.
   Sociobiol., 33, 35-49). The model also indicates that, relative to
   Amboseli, the probability of fission in the Drakensberg is very high,
   with all troops of more than 28 members eventually splitting. The
   hypothesis that low food availability accelerates fission in mountain
   baboons through the decreased foraging efficiency of larger troops was
   tested, Troops of a wide range of sizes allocated very similar amounts
   of time to foraging, foraged with the same efficiency, and travelled
   approximately the same distances to do so. It is concluded that fission
   in mountain baboons, being exacerbated neither by predation nor by
   inefficient foraging, may be caused directly by the inability of
   individuals to service social relationships in growing troops in the
   face of small amounts of time available for social interaction. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{This study tested whether female red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius
   phoeniceus, acquire non-genetic, material benefits from copulating with
   multiple males. In this population, females solicit extra-pair
   copulations, primarily from males defending adjacent territories on the
   same breeding marsh. Results of a feeder experiment revealed that
   females that copulated with an extra-pair male were allowed to feed on
   his territory, but females that remained faithful to their social mates
   were actively excluded from foraging on neighbouring territories. Males
   discriminated between faithful and unfaithful social mates. Females that
   engaged in extra-pair copulations were prevented from foraging on their
   social mate's territory significantly more often than females that did
   not. Measurement of neighbouring male responses to a mounted nest
   predator, a black-billed magpie, Pica pica, revealed that males were
   also significantly more aggressive towards a predator at a nest on a
   neighbouring territory if they had copulated with the breeding female
   than if they had not. These findings provide a possible explanation for
   results of Gray (1997, Anim. Behav., 53, 605-623), which showed that
   fledging success was significantly higher for females that engaged in
   extra-pair copulations than for females that did not, because
   depredation rates were significantly lower in clutches laid by females
   that had engaged in extra-pair copulations, and starvation rates tended
   to be lower in broods containing extra-pair young. This study is the
   first to demonstrate that females can benefit materially as well as
   genetically by copulating outside their pair bond and illustrates the
   need for manipulative tests to understand fully the reproductive

Abstract = {{The damaging effects of fear on a number of performance indicators in
   poultry and other farm animals are becoming increasingly recognised.
   More specifically, there is growing evidence for a negative association
   between growth and fearfulness (an underlying behavioural
   characteristic). The present study examined this putative relationship
   in Japanese quail from two genetic fines that had been selected over
   several generations for low (LBW) or high (HBW) body weight at 4 weeks
   of age and in those of a non-selected control (CON) line. HEW quail were
   substantially heavier than LEW ones at 31 days of age (197 and 34 g,
   respectively), with CON birds occupying an intermediate (104 g)
   position. Birds were observed individually and once only between 26 and
   32 days of age in one of three putative tests of fear. Quail of the LEW
   line showed greater avoidance of a conspicuous novel object placed near
   the home cage and longer tonic immobility fear reactions, and they
   vocalized and struggled later and less often during brief mechanical
   restraint than did the HEW quail. Quail of the control line generally
   showed intermediate responses. Plasma corticosterone concentrations
   following mechanical restraint were greater in LEW quail than in CON or
   HEW ones. Consideration of the intra-individual correlations between
   behavioural and adrenocortical responses to restraint suggested that the
   nature of the relationship was labile and that it was sensitive to the
   background genome. Collectively, the present findings demonstrated that
   underlying fearfulness was greater in quail that had been genetically
   selected for low rather than high body Height. The present results
   thereby support the hypothesis that fearfulness and growth are

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine the effects of several aspects of
   transportation (movement to a novel environment, reduced space allowance
   and deprivation of food and water) on the behavioural and physiological
   responses of red deer. In two experiments conducted in winter and
   summer, two groups of five adult male castrated red deer (housed at a
   space allowance of 2.7 m(2) per deer) were subjected to either 3- or 6-h
   treatment periods (without food and water) at a reduced space allowance
   (0.9 m(2) per deer). The effect of ambient temperature (9 degrees C, 13
   degrees C and 20 degrees C) was also examined in the winter experiment.
   In both experiments, each of the two groups was subjected to one
   treatment combination per week, in a random order. The deer lost live
   weight during treatment periods, although the rate of loss decreased
   with time. In Experiment 1, there was a significantly larger increase in
   sodium concentration at the end of 6-h treatments than after 3-h
   treatments (1.73 versus 0.30 mmol l(-1), P < 0.05), although other
   measures of dehydration were not affected by either the length of
   treatment period or the ambient temperature. Neither plasma NEFA
   concentration nor plasma cortisol concentration were significantly
   affected by treatment periods. Proportionately more time was spent
   standing and moving during treatment periods, while less time was spent
   lying and grooming (all P < 0.05). Behavioural changes during treatment
   periods were short-lived, as all activities had returned to (or
   approached) baseline levels by 3 h after the treatment periods. In
   Experiment 1, a greater proportion of time was spent moving at the two
   higher temperatures, and there was more pen-directed activity during
   longer treatment periods (P < 0.05). There were only minor
   between-experiment differences, suggesting that seasonality was not a
   major influence on the animals' responses. It is concluded that any

Abstract = {{The polychaete worm Serpula vermicularis (Serpulidae) filter feeds at

   While in its tube, a worm is safe but cannot feed. Thus. hiding has a
   lost-opportunity cost. We show that this cost can be substantial, given
   that food in the natural habitat appears in pulses, and good feeding
   conditions may not last long or recur frequently. We expect that a
   worm's hiding time will be sensitive to the lost-opportunity cost, and
   we present data ft-om a series of experiments that support this
   prediction. The worms seem able to track relatively short-term changes
   in food availability, and some evidence suggests that they assess food
   availability on a relative basis, comparing current feeding conditions
   to those recently experienced. Hiding and other types of cryptic

   subcutaneous injection of 10 mg/kg DZP or of the dissolution Vehicle
   from postnatal day (P) 2 to 21. Learning and memory were tested in
   P60-P70 rats on 5 consecutive days in a T maze and an eight arm maze
   while anxiety and reaction to novelty were tested in a 2 compartment box
   with a 2 step staircase on one side. Social behavior was evaluated in a
   condition of restricted access to food. LCMRglcs were measured at P60 by
   the quantitative autoradiographic {[}C-14]deoxyglucose method. In the T
   maze, when performed without delay between the 2 trials, the rate of
   alternation was significantly lower in DZP than in vehicle-exposed rats
   on the first 2 days of testing and similar in both groups on days 3-5.
   In the procedure with a 30 s intertrial delay, the rate of alternation
   was similar in DZP and vehicle-treated rats on all days of testing. In
   the eight arm maze, DZP-treated rats were more active, i.e. entering
   more arms per min than control animals. The number of arms entered
   before the first error was lower on day 1 and higher on day 3 in DZP
   compared to vehicle-exposed rats. In the 2 compartment box, DZP-treated
   rats crossed more often the lower step of the staircase and spent more
   time than controls on the 2 steps of the staircase while control rats
   made more rearings than DZP-exposed rats in the well protected corner of
   the box. LCMRglcs were decreased by early DZP exposure in several
   cortical regions, mammillary body, septum and dorsomedian caudate
   nucleus; in conclusion, an early chronic DZP treatment induces an
   increase inactivity only a delay but no impairment in learning and leads
   to a decrease in the level of anxiety and emotionality leading to an
   active response to novelty. These quite subtle behavioral changes are
   accompanied by discrete metabolic changes and probably reflect the state
   of hyperactivity/hyperarousal of these animals which could result from a
   change in the distribution, the sensitivity and/or function of GABA-BZD

Abstract = {{In reflecting upon insecticides and their use, it is easy to dwell on
   their well-documented problems as environmental pollutants and nontarget
   toxicants. Yet very few chemical industries have been as responsive or
   as innovative as the agrochemical companies in providing society with
   new and novel compounds that have allowed us to produce and protect the
   high quality food and fiber necessary to feed and clothe an ever
   increasing human population. Given the effectiveness and wide-spread use
   of insecticides, it was naive not to have envisioned the environmental
   impacts that these chemicals have caused. Nevertheless, the impacts of
   insecticide use have resulted in a much more complete and rigorous
   understanding of the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of environmental
   contaminants, their environmental fate and degradative processes, and an
   increased insight on mechanisms leading to acquired drug tolerance and
   resistance. Such understanding would certainly not have been possible
   without the explicit structure-activity relationships provided by
   insecticidal chemicals. The availability of homologous series of
   insecticidal analogues, toxic and nontoxic insecticidal enantiomers, and
   radiolabeled insecticides have provided us with invaluable tools in the
   elucidation of how insecticides bind receptors and ultimately produce
   their toxic response. Pesticide science owes a debt of gratitude to the
   agrochemical industry for making these compounds readily available to
   environmental researchers and academic scientists alike.
   In this review, I examine the mode of action studies of three
   structurally dissimilar insecticides on the nervous system. These
   insecticides are DDT, a chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon that acts as a
   nerve toxin by modifying the kinetics of voltage-dependent ion channels
   associated with the neurolemma; deltamethrin, a synthetic pyrethrin
   analog that acts in a similar fashion as DDT; and azinphosmethyl, a
   phosphorodithioate organophosphate that acts as nerve toxin by
   competitively inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (Fig. 1). The activity of
   these insecticides are assessed using three functional assays: (i) the
   enhanced release of neurotransmitters from isolated presynaptic nerve
   terminals; (ii) the behavioral and mortality responses of the ciliate
   organism, Paramecium; and (iii) the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase
   associated with azinphosmethyl resistance in Colorado potato beetle. In
   each case, I summarize our findings in terms of the future benefit that

Abstract = {{This study explored how baboons, Papio cynocephalus ursinus, in a desert
   population trade off foraging and predation risk in patterns of habitat
   use. Four hypotheses were proposed and tested; that habitats are used on
   the basis of (1) availability, (2) foraging rewards (following the ideal
   free distribution), (3) foraging rewards modified by the constraints of
   nocturnal predation risk (partial trade-off) or (4) foraging rewards
   modified by the constraints of continuous predation risk (full
   trade-off). Food availability in each habitat was quantified through
   quadrat surveys describing stem density, plant part availability and
   nutrient availability (protein and energy) of key plant foods per unit
   area. Predation risk in each habitat was evaluated using measures
   describing the relative threat of attack and capture by both leopards,
   Panthera pardus, and lions, Panthera lee; attack risk was determined on
   the basis of habitat visibility and predator ambush distances, while
   capture risk was calculated using a simple model incorporating predator
   and prey velocities, habitat visibility and nearest refuge distance.
   Patterns of baboon behaviour were assessed for adult males and females
   in four groups through day-follows and instantaneous sampling. The
   baboons did not use habitats directly in proportion to their
   availability in the group's ranging area (in contrast to hypothesis 1).
   Nor did patterns of habitat use match those expected on the basis of the
   ideal free distribution, either during all activities (hypothesis 2) or
   during feeding (hypothesis 3). Instead, the baboons spent less time
   feeding in the high-risk food-rich habitat but more time feeding in the
   low-risk relatively food-poor habitat. Baboons also preferred low-risk
   habitats in other activities, where during resting and grooming all
   habitats were avoided except the safest (where key food species were
   absent). These results support hypothesis 4. Deviations from these
   patterns by a unimale group indicate that male reproductive strategies
   may also play a role in habitat selection. (C) 1997 The Association for

Abstract = {{Enclosure and field trials were used to investigate the responses of
   hedgehogs, Erinaceus europaeus, to predator (badger, Meles meles) and
   non-predator odours. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) hedgehogs are
   capable of responding to badger odour; and (2) hedgehogs prefer not to
   forage in areas tainted with badger odour. In enclosure trials,
   hedgehogs almost exclusively avoided feeding at sites tainted with
   badger faeces in favour of sites tainted with non-predator faeces, and
   continued to avoid the previously badger-tainted site after 2 days, but
   got after 4. Field experiments with free-ranging hedgehogs showed a
   reduction in foraging effort in response to badger odour over periods of
   5 and 30 min, but no evidence of site avoidance over a 24-h period. Lack
   of persistent avoidance of badger odour in the field was probably due to
   the costs of predator avoidance, which were negligible in the enclosure
   owing to the presence of an alternative superabundant food source. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{781-798}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Crucian carp Carassius carassius show great phenotypic plasticity in
   individual morphology and physiology, and strong variation in population
   density in different fish communities. Small fish with shallow bodies
   and large heads are typical in overcrowded monospecific fish communities
   in small ponds, whereas deep-bodied, large fish are found in larger,
   multispecies lakes. Crucian carp are especially vulnerable to predation
   by piscivorous fish and their greater relative body depth in
   multispecies fish communities has been proposed to be an induced defence
   against size-limited predation, and hence to be an adaptive feature.
   Data are presented here on the two divergent body forms in field
   populations in eastern Finland, together with results of laboratory
   experiments on predator effects on morphology and physiology (growth,
   respiration, heart rate). The deep body can be achieved in a few months
   by introducing a low population density of shallow-bodied fish into a
   food-rich environment with no piscivores. In the laboratory, both the
   presence of piscivores (chemical cues) and enhanced food availability
   increased the relative depth of crucian carp, but only to a modest
   extent when compared to natural variation. It is concluded that the
   deep-body form of crucian carp in the low density populations of
   multispecies fish communities is the normal condition. Reproduction in
   monospecific ponds results in high intraspecific competition, low growth
   rate and a stunted morphology. According to pilot tests, the mechanism
   behind the predator effect in the laboratory might be a behavioural
   reaction to chemical cues (alarm substances/predator odour) causing
   changes in energy allocation: predator-exposed crucian carp adopt a
   `hiding' mode with decreased activity (less swimming, lower respiration
   and heart rate) and with higher overall growth. Whether, and to what
   extent, this predator-induced mechanism works in nature is unclear. (C)

Abstract = {{Individual foraging specializations are an important source of

   about what ecological factors affect their intensity or development. We
   evaluated stomach contents in marked individual largemouth bass
   (Micropterus salemoides) and tested the hypothesis that diet
   specialization is most pronounced during periods with high conspecific

   variation in density. Although diet composition of the aggregate bass
   population did not change during the study, bass body condition was
   inversely correlated with population size. Individual marked bass
   exhibited high diet consistency (diet overlap between successive
   captures) during years with high population densities. Diet overlap
   between randomly assigned pairs of bass was not correlated with
   population size. We did not detect the expected positive relationship
   between diet breadth and population size. Our analyses demonstrate that
   population responses to density changes may represent the sum of many

Title = {{Free food or earned food? A review and fuzzy model of contrafreeloading}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1171-1191}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Animals will work (e.g. lever press) for `earned' food even though
   identical `free' food can easily be obtained from a nearby dish. This
   phenomenon, called contrafreeloading, appears to contradict a basic
   tenet of most learning, motivation and optimal foraging theories; namely
   that animals strive to maximize the ratio of reward, or benefit, to
   effort, or cost. This paper reviews the factors that have been found to
   affect the level of contrafreeloading, to try to explain the behaviour.
   In experiments involving intensive training, contrafreeloading may be
   explained on the basis of secondary reinforcement and/or differential
   exposure to the alternative food sources. However, contrafreeloading
   also occurs without prior training. Contrafreeloading declines with
   increasing hunger and with increases in the effort required to obtain
   the earned food: it also has an inverted-U relationship with the degree
   of stimulus change associated with the earned food. A fuzzy logic model
   is developed to predict the outcome of interactions between these
   factors. The model successfully simulates previous empirical findings
   and provides novel, testable predictions. It is argued that
   contrafreeloading does not contradict reinforcement theory, provided
   that the sensory reinforcement obtained from stimuli associated with the
   earned food is also taken into account. A functional explanation of why
   such stimuli are reinforcing, and of contrafreeloading itself, is based
   upon the advantage of gathering information for animals living in
   changing environments (i.e. an information primacy model). Animals work
   for earned food in order to update their estimate of a currently
   sub-optimal food source because, in the longer term, it may
   unpredictably become the optimal place to feed. Contrafreeloading is
   therefore a behaviour that, under natural conditions, is adaptive. (C)

Abstract = {{The efficacy of cardiovascular risk-reduction programs has been
   established. However the extent to,which risk-reduction interventions
   are effective may depend on adherence. Noncompliance, or non-adherence,
   may occur with any of the recommended or prescribed regimens and may
   vary across the treatment course. Compliance problems, whether occurring
   early or late in the treatment course, are clinically significant, as
   adherence is one mediator of the clinical outcome. This article, which
   is based on a review of the empirical literature of the past 20 years,
   addresses compliance across four regimens of cardiovascular risk
   reduction: pharmacological therapy, exercise, nutrition, and smoking
   cessation. The criteria for inclusion of a study in this review were:
   (a) focus on cardiovascular disease risk reduction; (b) report of a
   quantitative measure of compliance behavior; and (c) use of a randomized
   controlled design. Forty-sis studies meeting these criteria were
   identified A variety of self-report, objective, and electronic
   measurements methods were used across these studies. The interventions
   employed diverse combinations of cognitive, educational, and behavioral
   strategies to improve compliance in an array of settings. The strategies
   demonstrated to be successful in improving compliance included
   behavioral skill training, self-monitoring, telephone/mail contact
   self-efficacy enhancement, and external cognitive aids. A series of
   tables summarize the intervention strategies, compliance measures, and
   findings, as well as the interventions demonstrated to be successful.
   This review reflects the progress made over two decades in compliance

Volume = {{78}},

Abstract = {{A 5-yr field study examined the ways in which prey abundance can
   influence the reproductive rates of predators. Water pythons (Liasis
   fuscus) on the Adelaide River floodplain in tropical Australia prey
   almost exclusively on dusky rats (Rattus colletti). Rat numbers varied
   dramatically among years of the study. Feeding rates of pythons were
   highest when rats were abundant, and the snakes were in good condition
   (mass relative to body length) at these times. The proportion of adult
   female pythons that reproduced in a given year was also tightly linked
   to rat abundances. However, reproductive output per litter (offspring
   size, and fecundity relative to maternal body size) was unaffected by
   prey availability, perhaps because of high fecundity-independent costs
   of reproduction. Instead, female pythons reproducing in `'good'' years
   were in better condition after oviposition.
   These data support an energy-limitation model for snake reproduction,
   whereby prey availability determines predator reproductive output, but
   the relationship between the two variables is complex. The degree to
   which prey availability influences feeding rates of pythons and the
   degree to which feeding rates influence body condition depend crucially
   on snake body size (due to size-related shifts in foraging abilities and
   metabolic costs). Thus, a given prey abundance translates into different
   energy reserves for different-sized predators. Also, females delay
   reproduction until they can gain enough energy for a large clutch of
   eggs, and reproductive output per litter does not then increase with
   additional energy availability. Such nonlinearities in predator
   responses to prey availability may be widespread.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that food supplementation for the generalist

   Cannibalism in these cohorts did not differ between food levels.
   Therefore, greater mortality at higher food levels probably was not

Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{450-458}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The study objectives are: (1) to examine and compare patterns
   of covariation of a wide range of health behaviors among adolescent boys
   and girls; (2) to determine whether eating behaviors are part of a
   larger construct of health-related behaviors and to identify the
   behaviors with which they share underlying similarities; and (3) to
   determine whether youth engaging in other health-compromising behaviors
   are at risk for unhealthy eating.
   Methods: Data were analyzed from the Minnesota Adolescent Health Survey,
   a classroom-administered questionnaire, completed by 36,284 adolescents,
   in grades 7-12 from 1986-87.
   Results: Among boys, factor analysis revealed five factors: (1)
   risk-taking behaviors, (2) school-related behaviors, (3) `'quietly''
   disturbed behaviors (e.g., frequent dieting, self-induced vomiting,
   suicide attempts), (4) health-promoting behaviors; and (5) exercise.
   Eating behaviors loaded on the construct of health-promoting behaviors
   with brushing teeth and seat belt use. Among girls, four similar factors
   emerged; however, exercise loaded on the construct of health-promoting
   behaviors. Therefore, eating behaviors loaded with brushing teeth, seat
   belt use, and exercise among girls. Logistic regression analyses,
   controlling for sociodemographic and personal variables, revealed that
   boys and girls engaging in health-promoting behaviors were less likely
   to have unhealthy eating behaviors, while those engaging in quietly
   disturbed behaviors, risk-taking behaviors, and problematic school
   behaviors were more likely to have unhealthy eating behaviors.
   Conclusions: Eating behaviors appear to be part of a health-promoting
   behavioral construct and should not be viewed in isolation from other
   behaviors. Although eating behaviors do not appear to be part of the
   `'problem behavior syndrome,'' youth engaging in a wine range of
   health-compromising behaviors are at risk for unhealthy eating;
   emphasizing the need to target high-risk youth with health promotion

   Sea to estimate, compare, and model survival and capture probabilities,

   Microtus agrestis, the primary prey of adders, every year from 1989 to

   survival probabilities of adders varied in a nonparallel manner through
   time between localities and ranged from 0.36 to 1.00, with a mean of
   0.72 across years and localities. Survival did not differ between males

   voles in one of the two populations (In-Fredeln), suggesting that
   starvation may have been an important source of snake mortality in some
   years, or that physiological stress resulting from food shortage may
   render individuals more susceptible to predators and diseases. Adders at
   In-Fredeln also grew faster and were in better body condition when vole
   density was high than when it was low. Inter-island movement rates of

Abstract = {{Trophic cascades are regarded as important signals for top-down control
   of food web dynamics. Although there is clear evidence supporting the
   existence of trophic cascades, the mechanisms driving this important
   dynamic are less clear. Trophic cascades could arise through direct
   population-level effects, in which predators prey on herbivores, thereby
   decreasing the abundance of herbivores that impact plant trophic levels.
   Trophic cascades could also arise through indirect behavioral-level
   effects, in which herbivore prey shift their foraging behavior in
   response to predation risk. Such behavioral shifts can result in reduced
   feeding time and increased starvation risk, again lowering the impact of
   herbivores on plants. We evaluated the relative importance of these two
   mechanisms, using field experiments in an old-field system composed of
   herbaceous plants, grasshopper herbivores, and spider predators. We
   created two treatments, Risk spiders that had their chelicerae glued,
   and Predation spiders that remained unmanipulated. We then
   systematically evaluated the impacts of these predator manipulations at
   behavioral, population, and food web scales in experimental mesocosms.
   At the behavioral level, grasshoppers did not distinguish between Risk
   spiders and Predation spiders. Grasshoppers exhibited significant shifts
   in feeding-time budget in the presence of spiders vs. when alone. At the
   grasshopper population level, Risk spider and Predation spider
   treatments caused the same level of grasshopper mortality, which was
   significantly higher than mortality in a control without spiders,
   indicating that the predation effects were compensatory to risk effects.
   At the food web level, Risk spider and Predation spider treatments
   decreased the impact grasshoppers had on grass biomass, supporting the
   existence of a trophic cascade. Moreover, Risk spider and Predation
   spider treatments produced statistically similar effects, again
   indicating that predation effects on trophic dynamics were compensatory
   to risk effects. We conclude that indirect effects resulting from
   antipredator behavior can produce trophic-level effects-that are similar
   in form and strength to those generated by direct predation events.}},

   regulated in a dynamic way by behavioral context and the animal's
   previous experience. Prolonged exposure to an odorant leads to a
   decreased response to that odorant, a form of behavioral plasticity
   called olfactory adaptation. We show that starvation can increase the
   extent of olfactory adaptation to the odorant benzaldehyde; this effect
   of starvation persists for several hours after the animals have been
   returned to food. The effect of starvation is antagonized by exogenous
   serotonin, which induces many of the same behavioral responses in C.
   elegans as are induced by food. Starvation also inhibits recovery from
   adaptation to a different odorant, 2-methylpyrazine, thus enhancing
   olfactory memory. In addition to its effects on adaptation, starvation
   modulates olfactory discrimination in C. elegans; starved animals
   discriminate more classes of odorants than fed animals. Increased
   olfactory discrimination is also seen in the adaptation-defective mutant
   adp-1(ky20). These various forms of behavioral plasticity enhance the
   ability of starved animals to respond to novel, potentially informative
   odorants.}},

Abstract = {{Elevation has long been considered a major influence on the evolution of

   traits has been attributed to changes in climate, duration of breeding

   show that life histories are closely associated with breeding elevation
   in extant cardueline finches. Finches at high elevations had smaller
   clutches, fewer broods, and longer incubation periods. Neither food
   limitation nor nest predation appear to readily account for this strong
   elevational variation in cardueline life histories. However, juvenile
   survival may be greater at higher elevations as a result of prolonged
   parental care and shorter natal dispersal and can potentially compensate
   for reduced fecundity in high-elevation finches.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of recent theoretical interest, few field studies have

   individuals and the spatial distribution of a population of blue tits
   (Parus caeruleus) just before the main breeding season, when blue tit
   foraging was not affected by central-place or flocking behaviors. The
   study was carried out in open helm oak Quercus ilex woodlands (dehesas)
   that are patchy for canopy-foraging birds because of the scattered
   arrangement of trees. Residence time on each tree was not correlated
   either with previous flight time or with prey abundance in trees. Flight
   distances between trees were larger than average distances estimated ill
   random samples of holm oaks taken close to foraging birds. Trees were
   not selected by birds on the basis of their expected energy costs and
   rewards. Bird abundance was not related to food availability in trees or
   to tree size across dehesas. However, bird abundance was strongly
   correlated with tree density and with the availability of tree holes for
   nesting, to the extent that the proportion of tits matched the
   proportions of both tree abundance and hole abundance across study
   plots. Overall, neither the behavior of individuals nor the distribution

Abstract = {{Previous research showed that pigs reared in substrate-impoverished
   conditions performed a smaller proportion of their total behavioural
   repertoire in their home pens (showed lower behavioural diversity), than
   pigs reared in substrate-enriched conditions. This study examined
   whether these differences were the result of fundamental changes in
   behavioural organisation. A T-maze task was used to test the hypothesis
   that substrate-impoverished pigs are prone to develop fixed, unvarying
   behaviour which may underlie their reduced behavioural diversity. They
   were predicted to be poorer at reversing previous response patterns in
   the maze, and less able to alter their behaviour in response to a novel
   (distracting) stimulus. Female pigs were housed singly for five months
   in substrate-impoverished pens with bare concrete floors (N = 10) or
   substrate-enriched pens with straw and other foraging material (N = 10).
   The pigs were then trained to negotiate a T-maze to reach a food source.
   There were no differences in responses to a distracting stimulus in the
   start arm of the maze but, contrary to expectation, substrate-enriched
   pigs were less able to change their behaviour when the route to food was
   switched. Thus, the hypothesis was not supported. During training
   trials, substrate-enriched pigs moved fairly rapidly to the food while
   substrate-impoverished pigs spent more time investigating the maze;
   their motivation to `explore' the maze appeared to override their
   interest in food. The rapid, food-directed behaviour of the
   substrate-enriched pigs probably became more fixed and routine-like than
   the more exploratory behaviour of the substrate-impoverished pigs. The
   apparent importance of exploration to pigs reared in
   substrate-impoverished environments suggests that such conditions
   provide inadequate stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{A widely held idea regarding information processing in the brain is the

   to a specific stimulus. This work presents a novel method of
   characterizing this supposed activity using a hidden Markov model. This
   model is able to reveal some of the underlying cortical network activity
   of behavioural processes. In our study the process in hand was the
   simultaneous activity of several cells recorded from the frontal cortex
   of behaving monkeys. Using such a model we were able to identify the
   behavioural mode of the animal and directly identify the corresponding
   collective network activity. Furthermore, the segmentation of the data
   into the discrete states also provides direct evidence for the state
   dependence of the short-time correlation functions between the same pair

Abstract = {{Theoretical models for the evolution of inducible anti-predator defenses
   predict that there should be fitness costs associated with the defense,
   otherwise it should be permanent. Thus, in the absence of predators and
   with limited resources, defended individuals are expected to be
   outcompeted by individuals lacking the costly defense. Crucian carp,
   Carassius carassius, increase in body depth in response to chemical
   stimuli from piscivorous fish, and the deeper body constitutes a
   morphological defense against gape-limited piscivores. Here, we have
   performed a field experiment investigating effects of population density
   on the relative competitive performance of shallow-bodied and
   deep-bodied crucian carp. We assigned groups of six individually marked
   fish (the `'focal'' individuals) of either morph into enclosures with
   either low or high crucian carp density, and monitored changes in body
   mass, length, and body depth of these fish for 4 mo. In addition, we
   determined sex, and final liver and gonadal mass, of all focal fish.
   At high population density, there was a reduction in food resources
   (zooplankters), which resulted in reduced gonad mass, reduced
   gonadosomatic indices, and reduced growth in fish of both morphs.
   Unexpectedly, the relative allocation to livers was higher at high
   density. There was no difference in body mass gain between morphs at the
   low density, whereas at the high density shallow-bodied fish gained
   twice as much body mass as deep-bodied fish. Hence, when predators were
   absent and food resources were limited, deep-bodied individuals suffered
   a substantial cost when competing with shallow-bodied conspecifics.
   This study verifies the theoretical prediction that an inducible defense
   results in fitness costs in the absence of predators. Further, as we
   found no measurable disadvantage of the deep-bodied morphology at high
   food availability but a strong disadvantage under intense competition
   for food, our results also demonstrate the importance of relating
   defense costs to levels of intraspecific competition.}},

   decreased with predation risk. Concerning the energetic aspects, both

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine whether college athletes are at greater risk for

   peers and to identify high risk taking groups by gender, sport, and
   other identifiers.
   Design: Multicenter, cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Seven major geographically represented collegiate institutions
   in the United States.
   Participants: A total of 2,298 college athletes and 683 randomized
   nonathlete controls completed a confidential survey questionnaire
   between the summer of 1993 and winter of 1994, assessing lifestyle and
   health-risk behaviors over the previous 12 months.
   Main outcome measures: Self-reports of lifestyle behaviors and health
   risks in the following areas: motor-vehicle safety, substance abuse,
   sexually transmitted diseases and contraception, mental health, cancer
   prevention, nutrition, exercise and general preventive health issues.
   Results: Athletes demonstrated significantly higher risk-taking
   behaviors (p < 0.05) than their nonathlete peers in the following areas:
   less likely always to use seatbelts; less likely always to use helmets
   with motorcycles, mopeds, and bicycles: more often drive as a passenger
   with a driver under the influence of alcohol or drugs: greater quantity
   and frequency of alcoholic beverages; greater frequency of smokeless
   tobacco and anabolic steroid use; less-safe sex; greater number of
   sexual partners; less contraceptive use: and more involvement in
   physical fights. Female athletes reported a higher prevalence of
   irregular menses, amenorrhea, and stress fractures compared with female
   nonathletes. Male athletes had more risk-taking behaviors than did
   female athletes (p < 0.05), and athletes in contact sports demonstrated
   more risk-taking behaviors than did athletes in noncontact sports (p <
   0.05). Athletes with one risk-taking behavior were likely to have
   multiple risk-taking behaviors (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: College athletes appear to be at higher risk than their
   nonathletic peers for certain maladaptive lifestyle behaviors. Athlete
   subgroups at highest risk include male athletes and athletes
   participating in contact sports. Athletes at risk for one high-risk
   behavior demonstrated an increased risk for multiple risk-taking

Abstract = {{It is well recognised that although nutritionally breast milk is the
   optimal food for babies, there are a number of caveats to this, based on
   the consequences of the modem lifestyle. Here we have considered ways in
   which the young breast fed child may be exposed to various environmental
   and medical contaminants which might cause adverse reactions and to
   which he/she may not otherwise be exposed. These substances are divided
   into four different areas: (i) medication taken by the mother; (ii)
   exposure to possibly addictive drugs taken by the mother; (iii) exposure
   to pollutants mainly from the maternal diet or as the result of her
   occupation; (iv) viruses. The infant who consumes breast milk may be
   exposed to a variety of chemicals which may have untoward effects on
   his/her immediate health and temperament and future development.
   Potentially hazardous substances ingested by the breast fed infant
   include medicaments (or their metabolites) that may have been ingested
   by the mother, potentially addictive common neurotoxicants such as
   nicotine, caffeine and alcohol, illicit drugs such as heroin and
   cocaine, and pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls and
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). There is a paucity of good
   information on which to base reliable estimates of the harm that this
   may cause the child. Although breast feeding is known to protect against
   bacterial infection, a number of viruses are excreted in the breast milk
   which may infect the child asymptomatically (e.g. cytomegalovirus,
   Epstein-Barr virus) and which are not known to be harmful, as well as
   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) excretion which, in contrast, does

Abstract = {{Previous work has established a number of sex-related deficits in immune
   function, behavior, and endocrine responses to stress in the offspring
   of dams exposed to ethanol. To examine the potential role of maternal
   glucocorticoids as a mediator of these sexually dimorphic effects in the
   fetus, we examined the influence of prenatal alcohol exposure in the
   presence or absence of maternal glucocorticoids on fetal plasma
   corticosterone (CORT) production. An additional question to be addressed
   by these studies was whether maternal adrenalectomy could eliminate the
   known inhibition by ethanol of the prenatal surge of plasma testosterone
   in male fetuses.
   Pregnant dams were adrenalectomized (ADX) or sham-adrenalectomized on
   gestational day (G) 7 and placed on a liquid diet containing 35\%
   ethanol-derived calories or pair-fed an isocaloric control diet
   throughout the experiment. On G18, G19, and G21, plasma levels of CORT,
   testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were measured in male
   and female fetuses and their mothers. Ethanol administration
   consistently increased maternal plasma CORT levels but did not
   significantly alter CORT levels in the fetus. Maternal ADX resulted in
   compensatory increases in fetal CORT levels that were lower in fetuses
   of ADX dams on alcohol, suggesting a direct effect of ethanol on fetal
   pituitary-adrenal activity. There were no significant sex differences in
   fetal plasma CORT levels in response to ang of these manipulations.
   A novel surge of maternal plasma DHEA was found on G19 that was absent
   in plasma from ADX dams. In spite of the absence of a surge on G19,
   plasma DHEA levels of ADX dams rose from very low levels at G18 to
   levels on G21 that were significantly higher than in Sham dams. A normal
   testosterone surge was observed in male fetuses on G18 and G19 from
   sham-adrenalectomized dams administered the pair-fed diet. However, this
   surge was greatly attenuated in males administered ethanol and also in
   male fetuses from ADX dams. These results reveal a direct inhibitory
   influence of ethanol on fetal CORT secretion as well as on the prenatal
   testosterone surge in males. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate the
   presence of a surge of DHEA in the pregnant rat. Overall, these data
   suggest that there is a critical adrenal factor in the rat that
   regulates the maternal surge of DHEA on G19 and the prenatal
   testosterone surge of male fetuses on G18-19.}},

Abstract = {{More than 250 studies, covering 29 Northern and five Southern Hemisphere
   countries, have been published on the birth seasonality of individuals
   who develop schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder. Despite
   methodological problems, the studies are remarkably consistent in
   showing a 5-8\% winter-spring excess of births for both schizophrenia
   and mania/bipolar disorder. This seasonal birth excess is also found in
   schizoaffective disorder (December-March), major depression (March-May),
   and autism (March) but not in other psychiatric conditions with the
   possible exceptions of eating disorders and antisocial personality
   disorder. The seasonal birth pattern also may shift over time, Attempts
   to correlate the seasonal birth excess with specific features of
   schizophrenia suggest that winter-spring births are probably related to
   urban births and to a negative family history. Possible correlations
   include lesser severity of illness and neurophysiological measures.
   There appears to be no correlation with gender, social class, race,
   measurable pregnancy and birth complications, clinical subtypes, or
   neurological, neuropsychological, or neuroimaging measures. Virtually no
   correlation studies have been done for bipolar disorder. Regarding the

Abstract = {{Variation in the intensity of schooling behavior in fishes suggests that
   the benefits of aggregation are balanced by certain costs. We examined
   the proximity of group members to each other in juvenile walleye
   pollock, Theragra chalcogramma, under different environmental
   conditions. Food availability, simulated by a gradient of six ration
   treatments, had a major influence on group cohesion, with increasing
   dispersion as food level decreased. Group cohesion also decreased at
   night relative to daytime levels. Small juveniles ((x) over bar = 53 mm
   TL) maintained on high rations were highly responsive to the potential
   threat of a predator, with groups becoming more cohesive and remaining
   so for up to an hour after the initial threat. A chronic threat
   (continual presence of predators) resulted in tighter group cohesion
   than an acute threat (single simulated attack). Small juveniles
   maintained on low rations were less responsive to predation threats and
   recovered quickly, supporting the hypothesis that hunger induces
   risk-taking behavior. Large juveniles ((x) over bar = 149 mm TL) did not
   change their degree of aggregation in response to either type of
   predation threat. An overall plasticity in the degree of cohesiveness
   among group members indicates that walleye pollock are capable of
   gradually modifying their schooling behavior according to the
   environmental context.}},

Pages = {{1993-1999}},

Abstract = {{Inclusive fitness theory predicts that organisms can increase their
   fitness by helping or not harming relatives, and many animals modify
   their behavior toward kin in a manner consistent with this prediction.
   Morphogenesis also may be sensitive to kinship environment, particularly
   in species where certain individuals facultatively develop structures
   that can be used against conspecifics as weaponry. We tested this
   hypothesis by examining whether and how consanguinity affected the
   probability that a structurally distinctive carnivore phenotype, which
   is opportunistically cannibalistic, would be produced in plains
   spadefoot toad tadpoles (Spea bombifrons) and southern spadefoot toad
   tadpoles (S. multiplicata). For tadpoles of S. multiplicata, individuals
   were significantly more likely to express the carnivore phenotype in
   mixed sibship groups than in pure sibship groups. For tadpoles of S.
   bombifrons, individuals were significantly more likely to express the
   carnivore phenotype when reared alone than in pure sibship groups. Both
   outcomes were independent of food availability or sibship specific
   differences in size or growth rate, and waterborne chemical signals from
   nonkin were sufficient to trigger expression of the carnivore phenotype.
   Our results suggest that morphogenesis may be responsive to kinship
   environment in any species or population that occurs as multiple,
   environmentally induced forms (polyphenism) that differ in their ability
   to help or to harm others.}},

Abstract = {{In the ponerine ant Ectatomma ruidum, workers displaying outside
   activities belong to, at least five behavioral categories, including
   namely hunters. When faced with small and numerous prey, hunters
   specialize into two behavioral sub-categories: stingers, which stay in
   the hunting site and kill prey in serial, and transporters which perform
   numerous single-loaded trips to the nest. Seven colonies showing
   different sizes (24 to 350 workers) were studied. Although the number of
   both categories of hunters gradually increases with colony size, me
   proportions of stingers (23\%) and transporters (77\%) remain relatively
   stable. In young foundations and small colonies, a more in depth study
   of the emergence of the behavioral specialization of the first stinger
   among predators indicates a gradually differentiation during
   sociogenesis for developmental colony stages corresponding to 15-22
   workers. By a temporary removing of all individuals specialized in
   stinging behavior, we showed that some of the transporters can
   differentiate into stingers, securing the efficiency of the predatory
   behavior. The behavioral differentiation of a given hunter into stinger
   or transporter depends both on individual characteristics
   (specialization and activity levels, previous experience, decision
   making) and on social characteristics (behavior of cooperating
   individuals, task competition, colonial starvation state). Relationships
   between collective performances and individual capacities allow to
   explain the important flexibility of the predatory behavior of E. ruidum
   and, more generally, of its foraging behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Visalberghi and Fragaszy {[}Animal Behaviour 49:1089-1095, 1995] have
   shown that social influences affect acceptance of novel foods. However,
   little is known about the temporal. course on which such influences act
   (e.g., for how long they persist and for how many encounters they are
   effective). To explore this issue, 11 adult tufted capuchins were
   observed during ten successive encounters with eight unfamiliar foods
   (phase 1, in which subjects were tested in social or individual
   condition) and ten more encounters 6 months later (phase 2, in which all
   subjects were tested in social condition). A total of 680 observational
   sessions were carried out. Results show that during the first five
   encounters in phase 1, capuchins ate more when they encountered these
   foods in the presence of their groupmates than if they encountered them
   alone. Thereafter, during the second five encounters of phase 1, foods
   were consumed equivalently whether presented to monkeys socially or
   individually. In phase 2, the foods were consumed equivalently
   regardless of the previous circumstance of their presentation (social or
   alone). In phase 2, consumption was similar to that scored in a previous
   study for familiar foods {[}Visalberghi \& Fragaszy, Animal Behaviour
   49:1089-1095, 1995]. We conclude that 1) foods remain unfamiliar to
   capuchins only for the first few encounters, 2) social facilitation of
   consumption of unfamiliar foods is of limited duration, and 3)
   individuals consumed equivalent amounts of an unfamiliar food when they
   repeatedly encountered it alone or in the presence of groupmates. These

Abstract = {{The effects of food restriction on predation risk-taking behavior were
   studied in juvenile coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, during the period
   before seawater migration in the spring. A radiographic technique
   enabled the study of individual food intake in a safe and risky food
   patch before and after exposure to a piscivorous predator. The study
   revealed a significant increase in food intake and specific growth rate
   in the weeks following deprivation, resulting in compensatory growth and
   a recovery of the weight loss caused by dietary restriction. The
   increase in food intake resulted from a change in risk-taking behavior.
   Following a period of diet restriction, the fish habituated faster after
   predator exposure, and the proportion of fish in the risky patch was
   significantly higher than before deprivation. Deprived fish took greater
   shares of the group meal compared with control fish, and the pattern of
   the individual share of the group meal after food restriction indicated
   a change in the social hierarchy. This study indicates that risk-taking
   behavior is state dependent and changes temporarily to compensate for a

   trade-offs between food and risk in a period leading up to an

   vasopressin in the rat}},
Journal = {{BIOGENIC AMINES}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{367-385}},
Abstract = {{Arginine-vasopressin (AVP), a mammalian neuropeptide, has been
   postulated to function as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator. There is
   clinical evidence that, apart from its role in affective illness, AVP
   may be involved in anxiety syndromes as well. The present study
   investigated the putative anxiogenic effect of intracerebroventricularly
   (i.c.v.) AVP administered in rats, using well validated animal models of
   anxiety, including the open-field, elevated plus-maze, social
   interaction and feeding latency in a novel environment tests.
   Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 20 mg/kg, i.p.) was used as the standard
   anxiogenic agent for comparison. In addition, the effect of AVP was
   assessed on rat brain tribulin activity in terms of endogenous monoamine
   oxidase (MAO) A and B inhibition. Tribulin has been shown to be an
   endocoid marker of anxiety and stress. AVP (100, 200 and 500 ng/rat,
   i.c.v.) produced a dose-related decrease in ambulation and rears, and an
   increase in immobility and defaecation, in the open-field test. These
   doses of AVP produced a dose-related decrease in the number of entries
   and time spent on the open arms of the elevated plus-maze, reduced
   social interaction in paired rats and increased the latency to feed in
   an unfamiliar environment in food-deprived rats. A qualitatively similar
   behavioural response was induced by PTZ in all the test parameters. AVP
   and PTZ increased rat brain tribulin activity, the increase in the MAO A
   inhibitor component being more marked than that on the MAO B inhibitor
   component, consonant with earlier studies with several anxiogenic agents
   and anxiety during addictive drug withdrawal in rats. The findings
   indicate that AVP exhibits an anxiogenic effect, unlike the earlier
   reported anxiolytic effect of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), its
   physiological antagonist, in rats. The anxiogenic effects of AVP (200
   and 500 ng/rat, i.c.v.) and PTZ were inhibited by the benzodiazepine
   anxiolytic, lorazepam (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.). However, the selective
   dopamine D-2 receptor antagonist, pimozide (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), inhibited
   only the anxiogenic effect of AVP. The results of the present study
   indicate that AVP induces significant anxiogenic response in rats which
   may be dopamine-mediated, like its antidiuretic effect in this species.
   AVP and ANP have contrary effects on water homeostasis and may be
   involved in the syndrome of acute water intoxication seen in psychiatric
   patients. The present investigations suggest that this postulate may
   hold relevance in view of the opposite effects of AVP and ANP on
   behaviour.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{73-94}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A major objective in behavioural and evolutionary ecology is to
   understand how animals make decisions in complex environments.
   Examinations of animal behaviour typically use optimization models to
   predict the choices animals ought to make. The performance of animals
   under specific conditions is then compared against the predicted optimal
   strategy. This optimization approach has come into question because
   model predictions often do not match animal behaviour exactly. This has
   led to serious scepticism about the ability of animals to exhibit
   optimal behaviour in complex environments. We show that conventional
   approaches that compare observed animal behaviour with single optimal
   values may bias the way we view real-world variation in animal
   performance. Considerable insight into the abilities of animals to make
   optimal decisions can be gained by interpreting why variability in
   performance exists. We introduce a new theoretical framework, called
   `multi-objective optimization', which allows us to examine
   decision-making in complex environments and interpret the meaning of
   variability in animal performance. A multi-objective approach defines
   the set of efficient choices animals may make in attempting to reach
   compromises among multiple conflicting demands. In a multi-objective
   framework, we may see variation in animal choices, but, unlike
   single-objective optimizations where there is one `best solution', this
   variation may represent a range of adaptive compromises to conflicting
   objectives. An important feature of this approach is that, within the
   set of efficient alternatives, no choice can be considered to yield
   higher fitness, a priori, than any other choice. Thus, variability and
   optimal behaviour may be entirely consistent. We illustrate our point
   using selected examples from foraging theory where there is already an
   optimization program in place.}},

Abstract = {{To test the importance of predators and food availability in determining
   patterns of aggregation and movement in the urchin Tetrapygus niger, we
   studied the behavioral responses of animals with different body sizes
   under laboratory conditions. Experiments were carried out on a square
   platform in tanks with circulating water. Twelve sea urchins of three
   size ranges were placed following a uniform spatial distribution on the
   platform and maintained in the presence or absence of: (a) one predator
   (the fish Pinguipes chilensis or the asteroid Meyenaster gelatinosus),
   or (b) food (fronds of the brown kelp Lessonia nigrescens). The
   experiments were followed with a video camera. The movement patterns of
   the sea urchins, the number and size of aggregations, and the dispersion
   patterns were quantified. To determine the importance of aggregation as
   a defensive mechanism, artificial aggregations of large sea urchins were
   created on the platform in the presence or absence of predators.
   Behavioral responses were followed and analyzed as described above.
   Individuals of T. niger recognize the presence of predators, and respond
   with increased mobility (e.g., number of sea urchins moving or average
   speed of movement; i.e., escape responses) but do not increase the
   number or size of aggregations. Moreover, the increased mobility of sea
   urchins would account for the random spatial distribution of individuals
   at the end of the experiments with predators. The escape responses were
   specially marked in the presence of the starfish M. gelatinosus. In this
   case, the aggregations were unstable, suggesting that the aggregations
   of T. niger would not have a protective function against this starfish.
   By contrast, sea urchins aggregated in the presence of food. It is
   concluded that the generation of aggregations in this species would be
   more related to feeding patterns (or to other factors related to spatial
   heterogeneity; e.g., substrate topography) than to responses to
   predators. The escape behavior of sea urchins to starfish is also
   described.}},

   dependent (type 2).
   Results: The type 1 sleep disturbances (reduced rapid eye movement
   latency, decreased delta sleep ratio, and decreased slow wave sleep
   {[}in percentage]) were stable, as predicted, across time. A composite
   measure of type 2 disturbances (based on rapid eye movement latency,
   sleep efficiency, and rapid eye movement density) improved
   significantly, although a minority of patients in remission had
   persistent abnormalities.
   Conclusions: The electroencephalographic sleep correlates of depression
   can be disaggregated into state-independent and partially reversible
   subgroups. Persistent sleep disturbances in remitted patients may have
   ominous prognostic implications.}},

Abstract = {{It has been observed that susceptibility to many degenerative diseases
   increases concurrently with industrialization and rising living
   standards. Although epidemiologic studies suggest that specific
   environmental and dietary factors may be important, caloric intake alone
   (as reflected in body size) may account for much of the differential
   risk observed among diverse human populations. it has been suggested
   from animal studies that caloric intake may be the primary effector for
   many hormonal, metabolic, physiologic, and behavioral responses that
   coordinate reproductive strategy to apparent availability of food. When
   caloric intake is excessive, particularly at critical developmental
   stages, physiologic priorities are set for body growth and fecundity
   rather than for endurance and longevity. The converse occurs during
   periods of famine, thus increasing the probability that sufficient
   individuals survive to restore the population when conditions improve.
   Calorically restricted rodents have significantly longer reproductive
   and total life spans than their ad libitum-fed controls and exhibit a
   spectrum of biochemical and physiologic alterations that characterize
   their adaptation to reduced caloric intake. These include reduced
   stature, hypercorticism in the absence of elevated adrenocorticotropic
   hormone levels, increased metabolic efficiency, decreased mitogenic
   response coupled with increased rates of apoptosis, reduced inflammatory
   response, induction of stress proteins and DNA repair enzymes, altered
   drug-metabolizing enzyme expression, and modified cell-mediated immune
   function. The overall profile of these changes is one of improved
   defense against environmental stress. This has been suggested as the
   mechanistic basis for the protective effects of low body weight on
   radiation-and chemically induced cancers in experimental animals. It may
   also explain the significantly higher thresholds of acute toxicity
   observed when calorically restricted rodents are exposed to certain lest
   compounds.}},

   The behaviour of the nests towards the new patch was also significantly
   affected by what the foraging workers had previouisly encountered in the

Abstract = {{The efforts in optimizing feeding conditions of food producing animals
   in the past were focussed primarily on promoting performance and/or the
   products' quality (MEYER 1997). In spite of great success in this
   direction various risks occure due to the conflict between the increased
   requirements on the one hand and the species typical demands on the
   other (for example: need of roughage as well as of concentrates with
   high energy and nutrient density in ruminants). Especially in feeding
   high yielding dairy cows the conflict is obvious: Even in the case, that
   high amounts of concentrates are fed it becomes more and more difficult
   to meet the energy requirement when the milk yield exceeds 40 kg milk
   per day (FLACHOWSKY a. LEBZIEN 1997). A negative energy balance is
   accompanied by a forced predisposition for ketosis and infertility
   (KRUIP 1996).
   Insufficient proportions of roughage in those rations predispose the
   animals for rumen acidosis and associated problems (health of claws
   etc.) as well as for displacement of abomasum. Thereby in feeding high
   yielding dairy cows there is only the choice between different risks due
   to the fact that the feed intake capacity did not increase to the same
   extent as the milk production did. In fattening calves the use of
   roughage tin Germany required by law) is on debate in this direction
   (necessary to avoid disturbances in the behaviour). Further problems in
   feeding animals according to their species typical demands are related
   to the established conditions of housing, feeding and water supply
   (risks of mechanization and automatization due to potential
   disfunction). The gene rally increased feeding intensity results - for
   example in poultry - in a higher frequency of skeleton diseases; the
   more and more specialized pig production (separate units for piglet
   production, rearing units, fattening units) is accompanied by increased
   changes in diets and techniques of feed and water supply, to that the
   animals have to be accustomed. too.
   The science of animal nutrition gets more and more involved in questions
   on the species depending requirements that guarantee a physiological
   development of the animal, health and normal behaviour. There is an
   increased need to create and evaluate parameters that can be used for
   characterization animals' well-being related to different feeding
   strategies. Without any doubts it is a special task to veterinary
   nutritionists to point out risks, problems, conflicting aimes when the
   feeding intensity is forced continuously. The slogan,,back to nature{''}
   is too simple and does not correspond to the complexity of efforts which
   are suitable and necessary to meet animals` energy and nutrient
   requirements as well as demands of animals' welfare. Eventually it is
   helpful to remember sometimes the limits set up by the biology and
   physiology when feeding intensity or techniques are on debate.}},

Abstract = {{For many benthic fish species, initial settlement patterns are dependent
   on the supply of larvae to nursery grounds, and recent work on flatfish
   population dynamics indicates that larval supply may influence
   recruitment. After the larvae arrive on the nursery grounds, selection
   of an appropriate substratum is necessary to maximize their subsequent
   growth and survival. This paper describes the results of experiments
   undertaken to determine the behavioural responses of settling plaice,
   Pleuronectes platessa, to the presence of food and predators. Reared
   plaice larvae were starved for 24 h, transferred to aquaria and the
   proportion of time spent on the sediment was recorded in four
   treatments: no food, benthic food, pelagic food, and benthic + pelagic
   food. The food supply consisted of newly hatched Artemia as pelagic food
   and meiofauna extracted from natural sediment as benthic food. Settling
   behaviour was evident for late stage 3b larvae but there was no effect
   of food supply on time spent on the sediment. Stage 4b and early stage 5
   larvae spent significantly more time on the bottom in the food
   treatments than in the no-food treatment. No differences could be
   established between food treatments. In another experiment, with the
   potential predator Crangon crangon as stimulus, stage 4b and early stage
   5 larvae spent significantly more time on the bottom when predators were
   absent than when predators were present. Behavioural preferences were
   also studied to establish if benthic food and potential predators, C.
   crangon, influenced habitat selection. Newly metamorphosed plaice (mean
   TL 13 mm) were given a choice of sediment with and without food and in a
   separate experiment, a choice of sediment with and without predators.
   Plaice spent significantly more time on a sediment with benthic food
   than on one without food and on st sediment devoid of predators than on
   one with predators. The habitat selection experiments showed that food
   supply and predators can influence distribution patterns on a small

Abstract = {{I examined the number of lifetime mating opportunities and mating
   behaviour of males in two sexually cannibalistic species, the
   Mediterranean, Iris oratoria, and bordered, Stagmomantis limbata,
   praying mantids (Mantodea: Mantidae). Two approaches estimated the
   number of lifetime mating opportunities: direct observations of
   intersexual encounters in the field, and an encounter model. I collected
   behavioural observations, together with ecological data for use in the
   model, over three field seasons. The ecological data included an
   assessment of the feeding condition of S. limbata females in nature; the
   females fed at a level comparable to females maintained on an abundant
   diet in the laboratory. As for the number of mating opportunities,
   individual males of both species encountered two or more females, as
   predicted by the model. I observed no male, however, in more than one
   copulation. This result could reflect individual variation in the times
   and places of sexual activity or an actual low number of mating
   opportunities in the field. Furthermore, a higher percentage of I.
   oratoria males encountered two or more females than S, limbata males, as
   the model indicates. Fewer mating opportunities could lead to greater
   selection upon S. limbata males to ensure paternity at each mating,
   which can explain the longer copulation times observed for S. limbata
   males. I considered two hypotheses about male behaviour in light of the
   number of lifetime encounters with females: male suicide and male
   reduction of the risk of cannibalism. Behavioural observations do not
   strongly support male suicide in either species. Certain male
   behaviours, such as the nature of copulatory position and, in captivity,
   mounting females from the rear, are consistent with the idea that males
   behave so as to reduce the probability that they are cannibalized during
   intersexual encounters. Moreover, male I. oratoria preferentially mount
   well-fed, fecund females in captivity. Taken together, these results
   suggest that the prospect of multiple mating opportunities has
   :influenced male mating behaviour over evolutionary time. (C) 1998 The

   behavioural responses of wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and American toad
   (Bufo americanus) tadpoles to both direct and indirect chemical signals

   tadpoles of both species responded strongly to water conditioned with
   Anax nymphs by decreasing foraging rates, becoming immobile, and moving
   away from the stimulus. The responses to water conditioned with starved
   Anax versus Anax that fed on conspecific tadpoles did not differ
   significantly; these results suggest that tadpoles rely primarily on
   direct signals to detect odonates. Rana did not respond to water
   conditioned with conspecific tissue extracts, while Bufo responded with
   behaviours that were indistinguishable from those of tadpoles exposed to
   Anax-chemicals. In a field experiment, the responses of R. sylvatica
   tadpoles to Anax chemicals were similar to those of tadpoles observed in
   the laboratory. Collectively, our data indicate that tadpoles of both
   species use chemical cues to assess predation risk from other community
   members. Tadpoles can selectively distinguish members who pose a threat,
   and only evacuate food patches or reduce foraging rates when in danger.
   These behaviours appear to be adaptive and are consistent with the

Abstract = {{When animals reproduce, does energy for the brood come from stored
   reserves (from food eaten months or years before), or from food eaten
   during the current reproductive season? Variation in the duration of
   energy storage prior to reproduction is an important, but
   little-studied, axis of life history variation. We experimentally
   manipulated the availability of resources to females of a long-lived
   viviparous lizard (Eulamprus tympanum, Scincidae) in the first year of a
   two-year study to assess the relative importance of current food intake
   vs, stored reserves as sources of energy for breeding. Females given
   greater access to high temperatures (and hence, to resources) in the
   laboratory amassed larger caudal energy stores than did females with
   lesser opportunities. Energy intake during gestation slightly influenced
   offspring size, but the magnitude of energy stores prior to ovulation
   had a more dramatic effect: females with larger caudal energy stores
   produced much larger litters in the following year. Growth rates of
   females were unaffected by basking treatments or by reproduction in
   either year, but females that reproduced in the second year showed a
   large concomitant decrease in caudal energy stores compared to females
   that did not reproduce, indicating a large energetic cost of
   reproduction. Hence, reproductive output within this species can be
   influenced by resource availability over 12 months prior to
   reproduction, and simple comparisons of reproductive output with current
   resource availability may fail to detect the ways in which
   phenotypically plastic life history traits are influenced by
   environmental features. In addition to an appropriate temporal
   framework, models of resource allocation should also incorporate the
   possible roles of physiological and morphological constraints (e.g.,
   maternal inability, in some species, to modify post ovulation
   reproductive expenditure) and trade-offs with other life history
   currencies (e.g., decrements in maternal survival due to high relative
   clutch masses). The time lag between resource acquisition and
   expenditure may have significant consequences for a population's
   demographic response to shifts in resource availability or predation
   pressure (via tail autotomy). Finally, this study illustrates the way in
   which thermal aspects of the environment can influence life history
   phenotypes in ectothermic vertebrates with long-term energy stores.}},

Abstract = {{The vertical distribution of early juvenile sablefish, Anoplopoma
   fimbria (Pallas), and their behavioral responses to changing food and
   temperature conditions were examined in laboratory experiments. Although
   field collections have suggested that juveniles are obligate residents
   of the neuston, laboratory experiments on diel movements indicated the
   potential for downward movement during the day, when activity levels
   were high and active foraging would be likely. The relationship of
   downward movement to fish size (small vs. large juveniles), prior
   feeding success (high vs. low rations) and thermal structure of the
   water column (isothermal vs. varying intensities of thermal
   stratification) were tested. Thermal stratification inhibited downward
   movement, with sablefish displaying clear avoidance of cold water even
   when the thermal gradient was moderate (12 degrees C top layer and 8
   degrees C bottom layer). However, sablefish could be induced to swim
   downward into cold water if food was introduced beneath the thermocline.
   Across all temperature treatments, occurrence in cold water
   significantly increased when food was present. Increasing the sharpness
   of the thermal gradient (top layer = 12 degrees C, bottom layer = 8, 6,
   4 or 2 degrees C) did not affect the percentage of time spent in cold
   water, but did shorten the maximum time an individual would spend
   beneath the thermocline. Movement into cold water constituted a
   potentially lethal risk for juvenile sablefish; dives beneath the
   thermocline that exceeded 60 s resulted in loss of equilibrium and
   immediate death for small fish moving from 12 to 2 degrees C water.
   Thus, sablefish displayed behavioral trade-offs between food acquisition
   and the physiological risk of cold temperatures, similar to previous
   studies documenting balancing of foraging behavior and predation risk.
   Behavioral responses to thermal stratification were modified by fish
   size and hunger level, with larger juveniles and those held on low
   rations spending more time in cold water. These behavioral responses
   correspond with the high feeding requirements necessary to maintain the
   naturally rapid growth rates of this species and the transitions in
   habitat associated with different life history stages. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Obtaining convincing evidence for spatial memory of natural food sources
   in wild animals is hard because the observer rarely knows as much about
   the available food as does the animal, and the ability of the animal to

   advantage of the scarcity of natural fruit sources in the subtropical
   winter to present a wild group of brown capuchin monkeys with a
   large-scale array of 15 feeding platforms spaced ca 200 m apart. With
   this array, I could control the location, productivity and renewal
   schedule of the major fruit sources used by these animals. Combining an
   independent measurement of their detection held for these platforms with
   the known locations of the platforms, I calculated the expected patterns
   of movement among platform sites by the group under various models of
   `random' foraging. These expected patterns were compared to the actual
   spatial movements of the group. The capuchin group moved significantly
   more often toward closer platforms and in straighter lines than expected
   by any random search model using their observed detection field of 82 m,
   although their behaviour did agree with such models for unrealistically
   large search fields of 225-350 m. I infer that the movements of this

   straight-line movement and a preference for closer platforms are in
   general not convincing evidence for spatial memory unless the detection

Abstract = {{Cannibalism is uncommon in most species despite being taxonomically
   widespread. This rarity is surprising, because cannibalism can confer
   important nutritional and competitive advantages to the cannibal. A
   general, but untested, explanation for why cannibalism is rare is that
   cannibals may be especially likely to acquire pathogens from
   conspecifics, owing to greater genetic similarity among conspecifics and
   selection for host specificity and resistance to host immune defences
   among pathogens. We tested this hypothesis by contrasting the fitness
   consequences of intra-versus interspecific predation of diseased and
   non-diseased prey. We fed cannibalistic tiger salamander (Ambystoma
   tigrinum) larvae diseased conspecifics, healthy conspecifics, diseased
   heterospecifics (a sympatric congener, small-mouthed salamanders, A.
   texanum), or healthy heterospecifics. Cannibals that ate diseased
   conspecifics were significantly less likely to survive to metamorphosis
   and grew significantly less than those that ate diseased
   heterospecifics, but none of the other groups differed. Tiger salamander
   larvae also preferentially preyed on heterospecifics when given a choice

Abstract = {{According to predictions from theoretical models, body mass and the
   daily foraging pattern of small birds in winter should be sensitive to
   predation risk. With increased risk of predation birds are expected to
   lower their body mass and shift their foraging to the afternoons. I
   studied the effect of predator presence on daily mass gain in captive
   yellowhammers, Emberiza citrinella. The birds were tested in unisex
   pairs, one bird being dominant over the other. In the first treatment
   the amount of food was restricted, and the daily pattern of mass gain
   was recorded. The second treatment was identical to the first, but, in
   addition, a stuffed sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus, was displayed to the
   birds in the morning. Contrary to predictions from some theoretical
   models and other studies, the birds gained weight on days when the hawk
   was shown. Furthermore, the increased foraging happened mainly in the
   first half of the day, which also contradicts predictions from models.
   These results could be explained as a response to interrupted foraging,
   decreasing the probability of the birds acquiring the critical evening
   body mass. Alternatively, the birds increased their body reserves in
   preparation to leave a dangerous situation. Both dominance classes
   showed a similar response. The results suggest that the effects of
   predators on foraging interruptions should be included in models of
   daily routines of reserve accumulation. (C) 1998 The Association for the

   natural food could not elicit any feeding response in Chinese perch, and
   gustation was only important to the fish for the last stage of food

   responses. The present experiments examined the behavioral mechanisms
   responsible for any hyperphagic effect of pregnanolone. The effect of
   pregnanolone (1-10 mg/kg IP) on the intake and microstructure of licking
   for two sucrose solutions (1 and 3\%) in well familiarized nondeprived
   male rats under either light or dark conditions was examined.
   Pregnanolone had no effect on either intake or the duration or number of
   bouts of licking in these experiments, although in all cases the
   intrabout lick rate was significantly reduced at the highest dose.
   Pregnanolone (1-10 mg/kg) also failed to increase intake of a sweet wet
   mash in familiarized nondeprived male rats. However, in a food choice
   test where both novel and familiar food items were available,
   pregnanolone (1-3 mg/kg) significantly increased the time spent eating

Abstract = {{Background. One hundred and thirty-five women with bulimia nervosa
   participated in a randomized clinical trial designed to determine
   whether the addition of exposure with response prevention to a core of
   cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) leads to greater clinical
   improvement and lower risk of relapse. We present results from the end
   of treatment and 6- and 12-month follow-up.
   Methods. Participants received eight sessions of CBT and were then
   randomized to either exposure to pre-binge cues (B-ERP), exposure to
   pre-purge cues (P-ERP), or a relaxation training control condition
   (RELAX).
   Results. CBT produced significant clinical change. At the end of the
   behavioural treatments, there were no significant differences across the
   three groups on abstinence (66\% in B-ERP, 45\% in P-ERP and 47\% in
   RELAX), or frequency of bingeing and purging. B-ERP, but not P-ERP,
   significantly reduced anxiety on the cue reactivity assessment, food
   restriction, body dissatisfaction and depression. These differences were
   not maintained at 6-month follow-up. At 12-months, B-ERP was
   independently associated with lower food restriction and better global
   functioning.
   Conclusions. CBT is a highly effective treatment for bulimia nervosa.
   B-ERP was modestly superior to P-ERP at post-treatment; however, the
   advantage did not remain throughout the follow-up interval. ERP for
   bulimia nervosa is an expensive and logistically complicated treatment
   that does not appear to offer any significant additive benefits that are
   proportional to the amount of effort required to implement the

Abstract = {{We investigated determinants of territory size in White-winged
   Trumpeters (Psophia leucoptera), frugivorous, cooperatively breeding
   birds that defend large, permanent, all-purpose territories in lowland
   Amazonian rain forest. During a 7-mo period, we measured changes in food
   density at a site in Manu National Park, Peru, and conducted full-day
   focal samples on individuals that allowed us to record daily food intake
   of territorial birds. We used data from laboratory analyses on energy
   content of fruit species eaten by trumpeters to calculate a phenology of
   energy content for food available on territories of focal groups, and to
   calculate daily energy intake of focal trumpeters. Additionally, we used
   lab measurements of basal metabolic rate of trumpeters to estimate daily
   energy requirements of wild trumpeters.
   Both census and focal sample data suggested that food availability on
   trumpeter territories varied widely, sometimes greatly exceeding and
   sometimes falling short of the amount that we calculated was necessary
   to meet average daily energy requirements of groups. To determine
   whether trumpeter territory size was related to food density, we
   conducted fruit removals. Every day, we removed an amount of fruit from
   the territory that was equivalent to the amount of fruit ingested daily
   by the focal group during a control period preceding the removal
   experiment. We conducted removal experiments during periods when food
   density on territories appeared to be abundant and also when food
   abundance appeared to be low. Trumpeter food consumption did not change
   when fruit was removed during periods of resource abundance; however,
   when experimental removals were conducted during periods of food
   scarcity, the total energy value of food consumed decreased
   significantly. These results suggest that food abundance on trumpeter
   territories sometimes exceeds and sometimes is close to or below the
   amount needed to meet energy needs of the groups. Based on our data, we
   propose that territory size of White-winged Trumpeter groups reflects
   some minimum size needed to provide the group with a baseline level of
   food intake during seasonal periods of decreased food abundance.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To identify nutritional risk factors for growth failure in

   Design A cohort of 40 infants with BPD was followed up for 7 monthly
   visits after initial hospital discharge. Data on potential risk factors
   were gathered prospectively.
   Subjects/setting Forty infants with BPD were recruited from all 4
   tertiary-level neonatal intensive care units in the Puget Sound area of
   Washington. Exclusionary criteria included congenital or chromosomal
   anomalies, grade IV intraventricular hemorrhage, and drug or alcohol
   exposure in utero.
   Main outcome measures Growth failure defined as weight less than the 5th
   percentile on National Center for Health Statistics growth curves at 2
   or more points in time and a decrease in weight-for-age z score during
   the study period.
   Statistical analyses performed Relative risk of growth failure with
   exposure to each risk factor was determined. The chi(2) test was used to
   measure association between growth and development, and change in z
   scores was used to examine growth patterns.
   Results Growth failure occurred in 8 of 40 infants. Twenty nine of the
   infants experienced a drop in weight-for-age z score from the initial to
   the final study visit. Growth failure was associated with low
   socioeconomic status (relative risk=4.0, 95\% confidence interval=1.3,

Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{9-16}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity is adaptive for an organism inhabiting a variable
   environment if the optimal phenotype of a trait that affects fitness
   varies with environmental conditions, and if the organism can perceive
   environmental conditions and respond appropriately. Wilbur and Collins
   have proposed that amphibian larvae might respond adaptively to changes
   in their resource environment. If conditions for growth in the aquatic
   environment deteriorate, then a tadpole should metamorphose earlier and
   smaller than a tadpole under constant high growth conditions. Several
   experiments on a variety of species have tested this prediction, but
   only one demonstrated such a response. That experiment involved Couch's
   spadefoot toads (Scaphiopus couchii) and employed a gradual decrease in
   food level, whereas the others all used an abrupt switch from high to
   low food. The purpose of the present experiment was to examine the
   response of S. couchii to an abrupt change in food level, and to
   determine if the response depended on the level of two other factors,
   density and temperature, that also affect larval development. The
   average effects of the abrupt change in food level were similar to those
   seen in studies on other species: age at metamorphosis was primarily
   determined by the early food regime, and size at metamorphosis was
   determined by food level late in the larval period, suggesting that the
   effect of decreased food depends on how the food change is done.
   However, the response to even an abrupt food change depended on
   interactions with other environmental factors. At high temperature, high
   initial food, and low density, development was very rapid and tadpoles
   switched from high to low food metamorphosed at about the same time and
   size as those at constant high food. In contrast, under high temperature
   and high initial food conditions, but at high density, tadpoles switched
   to low food metamorphosed somewhat earlier and smaller, on average, than
   tadpoles kept at high food. At low temperature, the direction of
   response depended on density: tadpoles metamorphosed much smaller and
   slightly, but significantly, earlier at low density, but smaller and
   later at high density. The developmental response to increased food also
   varied with temperature. Larvae at high temperature metamorphosed
   earlier and larger than those at constant low food. At low temperature,
   larvae metamorphosed larger; but at nearly the same time as their
   counterparts at constant low food. The combination of high density and
   constant low food prevented any tadpoles from metamorphosing at high
   temperature, and allowed relatively few metamorphs at low temperature.
   Under conditions which impose either very rapid or retarded development,
   the opportunity to respond to altered food level may be limited.
   Interactions among environmental factors, therefore, may constrain
   responses to changing conditions, and may even prevent completion of
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Fat reserves are an important energy source for animals wintering in
   temperate zones. Long nights, low ambient temperature and often
   unpredictable food all increase the probability of death from
   starvation, and to survive, animals carry energy reserves as fat. Based
   on the assumption that extra weight makes birds more vulnerable to
   diurnal predators, it has been hypothesized that predation risk places
   an upper limit on avian fat reserves. The hypothesis leads to the
   prediction that birds should decrease their mass in response to
   increased risk of predation. We tested this prediction with a resident
   species, the tufted titmouse, Baelophus bicolor. During a 3-day period,
   we presented a taxidermic mount of a sharp-shinned hawk, Accipiter
   striatus (predator treatment) or a mourning dove, Zenaida macroura
   (control treatment) to seven titmice housed individually with food ad
   libitum. Even though vigilance and delay in time to resume foraging were
   significantly higher after exposure to the hawk model, the body mass of
   titmice after exposure to the hawk increased rather than decreased, a
   result opposite to that predicted. In particular, the birds
   significantly increased their evening body mass and mean daily mass gain
   during the treatment period. Our results suggest that risk-dependent
   foraging appears to regulate avian body fat reserves by limiting
   foraging time. When food is unlimited, as in our experiment, birds may
   be able to obtain high energy reserves even while maintaining intense
   vigilance for predators, and under such conditions, the energetic costs
   of flying may control upper level energy reserves. (C) 1998 The

Abstract = {{Like many sexually dimorphic ungulates, bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis,
   form sexually segregated groups. Nursery groups include females, lambs
   and subadult males, while adult males form bachelor groups. Previous
   hypotheses to account for sexual segregation in ungulates have suggested
   sexual differences in energy requirements, predation risk and social
   preferences. I tested the hypothesis that differing nutritional demands,
   due to sexual dimorphism in body size, would lead to different movement
   patterns and time budgets. If ruminating/foraging schedules differed
   according to body size, males and females could not synchronize their
   activities and therefore would segregate by sex. To test this
   hypothesis, I observed a population of marked bighorns. I recorded the
   time males and females spent lying, grazing or walking during 8-14 h of
   focal-animal observations. Initial and final location of groups and
   steps taken per minute foraging were also noted. Females spent more time
   foraging and walking and had longer foraging and walking bouts than
   adult males, but did not differ in numbers of steps taken while
   foraging. Males spent more time lying than females. Subadult males
   switched between nursery and bachelor groups and changed their foraging
   behaviour depending on the type of group they were in. The distance
   moved was on average almost four times greater for female than for male
   groups. I suggest that sexual difference in time budgets and movement
   patterns make it difficult for males and females to stay in the
   same,group and therefore lead to sexual segregation. (C) 1998 The

   with two diverging shoals of conspecifics that differed with respect to
   key characteristics. In six choice experiments, subjects discriminated
   between shoal partners on the basis of: (1) shoal size, subjects
   preferring a shoal of 10 to a single fish; (2) size of shoaling fish,
   small fish preferring small conspecifics rather than an equal number of
   large fish, while large fish showed no preference; (3) local foraging
   experience of shoaling fish, shoals containing fish that had previously
   been repeatedly fed in the experimental tank being preferred to shoals
   with no such experience; and (4) familiarity of shoaling fish, guppies
   preferring familiar rather than unfamiliar conspecifics. No
   discrimination on the basis of colour or hunger was observed. In
   addition, following a shoal to a food site on just three trials allowed
   guppies to learn a route, or food site, preference. Guppies were
   considerably more likely to learn to adopt the behaviour shown by
   members of a shoal of several demonstrators than an alternative
   behaviour shown by a single conspecific demonstrator. The relationship
   between preferences for different shoals and the social transmission of
   information is discussed in the light of these findings. The results
   suggest that shoaling preferences may strongly influence-the social

Abstract = {{Predators that aggregate in ``hot spots{''} of high prey density have

   During a peak and decline in a snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) cycle,
   we created artificial hot spots of increased hare abundance by adding
   food and excluding mammalian predators on three 1-km(2) blocks and then
   recorded the response of radio-marked Great Horned Owls (Bubo
   virginianus) to these food additions. Territorial owls showed a decrease
   in home range size and patchiness of spatial use as hare densities
   peaked and declined, although this was better explained by smaller
   territory sizes due to a growing owl population rather than a direct
   behavioral response to changing food density. Experimental owls on
   food-enriched territories did not show a difference in conventional
   measurements of home-range size and patchiness of spatial use

Abstract = {{We present a model of the survival-maximizing foraging behavior of an
   animal searching in patches for hidden prey with a clumped distribution.
   We assume the forager to be Bayesian: it updates its statistical
   estimate of prey number in the current patch while foraging. When it
   arrives at the patch, it has an expectation of the patch's quality,
   which equals the average patch quality in the environment. While
   foraging, the forager uses its information about the time spent
   searching in the patch and how many prey has been caught during this
   time. It can estimate both the instantaneous intake rate and the
   potential intake rate during the rest of the patch visit. When prey
   distribution is clumped, potential intake rate may increase with time
   spent in the patch if prey is caught in the near future. Being optimal,
   a Bayesian forager should therefore base its patch-leaving decision on
   the estimated potential patch value, not on the instantaneous patch
   value. When patch value is measured in survival rate and mortality may
   occur either as starvation or predation, the patch should be abandoned
   when the forager estimates that its potential survival rate during the
   rest of the patch visit equals the long term survival rate in the
   environment. This means that the instantaneous intake rate, when the
   patch is left, is not constant but is an increasing function of
   searching time in the patch. Therefore, the giving-up densities of prey
   in the patches will also be higher the longer the search times. The
   giving-up densities are therefore expected to be an increasing, but
   humped, function of initial prey densities. These are properties of
   Bayesian foraging behavior not included in previous empirical studies
   and model tests.}},

   (including personality), pretreatment clinical status, and posttreatment
   clinical status. Outcome was based on the frequency of binging and
   purging in the 3 months before assessment based on carefully constructed
   lifechart interviews. A series of stepwise logistic regressions were
   performed to determine independent predictors of 1-year outcome while
   controlling for treatment received. Demographic variables were unrelated

   outcome, whereas a history of alcohol dependence decreased the odds of
   poor outcome, High self-directedness on the Temperament and Character

Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{265-274}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The development and occurrence of anorexia, the voluntary reduction in
   food intake during parasitic infections in animals, is somewhat
   paradoxical and contrary to conventional wisdom and expectation. We take
   the view that its occurrence is an evolved, costly behavioural
   adaptation which serves a function. Five such functional and general
   hypotheses to account for it are developed: (1) anorexia is induced by
   the parasite for its own benefit; (2) food intake decreases to starve
   parasites; (3) the negative effect on the host's energetic efficiency
   during parasitic diseases has a direct effect on food consumption; (4)
   food intake decreases for the purpose of promoting an effective immune
   response in the host; and (5) anorexia allows the host to become more
   selective in its diet, and thus select foods that either minimize the
   risk of infection or are high in antiparasitic compounds. Only
   hypotheses (4) and (5) survive the comparison for consistency with the
   physiological, metabolic and behavioural alterations that occur during
   the development of parasitic infections, and with the rule of generality
   (i.e. account for its occurrence in both protozoan and helminth
   infections). Both surviving hypotheses will need further experimental
   testing for their support or rejection, and such experiments are
   proposed. Also, the advantages and consequences of viewing anorexia
   during parasitic infections within a functional framework are discussed.
   These arise from the recognition that anorexia is a disease-coping
   strategy, part of the mechanism of recognition of parasite invasion by
   the immune system, which leads to a modification of the host's feeding
   behaviour. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{A better understanding of the animal x plant interaction is needed to
   develop management practices which will maintain a sufficiently rich and
   abundant vegetation in the pastures. Such practices would permit the
   animals to meet their nutritional requirements, and to ensure a
   sufficient production, while contributing to the maintenance of the
   environment. This review, drawn on a large number of experimental
   studies, takes stock of the factors influencing the selection and use of
   feeding sites and stations by herbivores. First, we present the
   theoretical framework in which the experimental observations are
   discussed. The general context of optimal foraging theory (OFT) and its
   predictions are described. Its `applicability', usefulness and validity
   to study the foraging behaviour of herbivores are then discussed.
   Second, we analyse how forage (quantity and quality, plant species,
   distribution), environment (topography, distance to water, predator
   risk) and some animal factors (cognitive abilities, social organisation)
   affect the choice and use of feeding sites and stations. In spite of
   some problems of definitions ('patch', `prey' for an herbivore?) and of
   the herbivores' specific characteristics, the OFT has been successfully
   used to explain the foraging behaviour of herbivores. However, animals'
   choices are rarely as absolute as predicted. Under natural conditions,
   animals not only respond to food resource, but are also constrained by
   some non-alimentary environmental factors and by the limits of their
   cognitive abilities (memory, discrimination). Other complementary
   approaches, such as `hedonism' and `nutritional wisdom', can partly
   influence animals' choices and are also briefly discussed. ((C)

Abstract = {{In the Dutch Hunger Winter at the end of World War II a combination of
   circumstances created the conditions of a natural experiment. Unlike
   other famines, the Dutch famine struck at a precisely circumscribed time
   and place, and in a society able to document the timing and severity of
   the nutritional deprivation as well as the effects on fertility and
   health. Because the Dutch maintained comprehensive military and health
   records, it was possible to compare the incidence of neurodevelopmental
   disorders in adulthood for birth cohorts exposed versus those unexposed
   to prenatal famine. We have conducted several studies guided by the
   hypothesis that prenatal micronutrient deficiencies can cause
   neurodevelopmental schizophrenia or related personality disorders. In
   this paper we shall summarize our previous work and combine the outcome
   data of the different studies. Early prenatal famine was found to be
   specifically and robustly associated with each of three conditions: (1)
   congenital anomalies of the central nervous system, (2) schizophrenia,
   and (3) schizophrenia spectrum personality disorders. We found that the
   greatest increase in the risk of schizophrenia spectrum disorder -
   schizophrenia plus spectrum personality disorder - occurred among males
   born in the famine cities in December 1945 (relative risk = 2.7; 95\%
   confidence interval = 1.5-5.1). Persons born in December 1945 were
   generally conceived at the absolute peak of the famine (March-April
   1945). In the hope that the associations we have found may offer clues
   to the aetiology of schizophrenia, we are currently tracing and
   examining the cases of schizophrenia after prenatal exposure to famine.}},

   mother-daughter dyads it can be concluded that daughters of highly
   restrained mothers tend to present high scores in the Restraint scale of
   the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire of Stunkard and Messsick,
   translated into Spanish and validated as Cuestionario de Conducta

   than those belonging to daughters of highle restrained mothers. Previous

Abstract = {{Background: Approximately 39\% of children aged <5 y in developing
   countries are growth retarded (stunted) and many have poor mental
   development and behavioral abnormalities. Animal research suggests that
   an altered stress response may contribute to the negative outcomes
   following undernutrition.
   Objective: We tested the hypothesis that stunted children have higher
   salivary cortisol concentrations and heart rates and altered behavior
   when compared with nonstunted children when social background was
   controlled for.
   Design: We compared 30 stunted with 24 nonstunted children, all of whom
   were 8-10 y old and lived in the same poor areas of Kingston, Jamaica.
   All subjects were participants in a prospective, longitudinal,
   case-control study of children who were stunted in early childhood. We
   administered a test session (including psychologic and physical
   stressors), measured baseline and response levels of salivary cortisol
   and heart rate, and observed behavior.
   Results: Compared with nonstunted children, stunted children had higher
   salivary cortisol concentrations (P = 0.007), had higher heart rates
   during the psychologic test session (P = 0.03), exhibited enhanced
   cardiovascular responsivity to a physical stressor (P = 0.04), vocalized
   less, were more inhibited, and were less attentive. After birth weight
   or social background and maternal and child intelligence quotients were
   controlled for, the differences in cortisol concentration and
   cardiovascular reactivity remained significant.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that consistent growth retardation
   since early childhood affects physiologic arousal, which, we speculate,
   may contribute to the poor cognitive functioning and immune responses of
   stunted children and the relation between adult short stature and
   increased cardiovascular risk.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers have normally considered weaning to be a non-reversible
   event. To determine the validity of this assumption, we interviewed 36
   mothers of toddlers who were living in a poor shanty town of Lima, Peru.
   Data from 32 women were complete and used in this analysis. Mothers
   described their beliefs, practices, and decisions about breastfeeding,
   weaning, and relactation (the reintroduction of breastfeeding after
   weaning). We recorded attempted weaning events if the mother reported
   (1) purposefully not breastfeeding with the intention to wean, or (2)
   carrying out an action that was believed to cause the child to stop
   breastfeeding. Using a constant comparative approach, references to
   child-feeding decisions were coded, categorized, and analyzed. All
   mothers breastfed for at least 12 months; the median duration of
   breastfeeding was 25 months. There were several different patterns of
   child-feeding. Thirteen women never attempted to wean their children or
   had weaned on the first attempt. The majority (n = 19) of women,
   however, attempted to wean their children - some as early as 3 months of
   age - but relactated between less than 1 day and 3 months later. Factors
   that influenced feeding decisions were primarily related to maternal and
   child health, and maternal time commitments. Children were weaned when
   there was a perceived problem of maternal health or time commitments and
   child health was not at risk of deterioration. Mothers postponed weaning
   because of poor child health. The primary reason for relactation was a
   child's negative reaction to weaning (e.g., incessant crying or refusal
   to eat). Personalities of the mother and child were important
   determinants of feeding decisions. These results demonstrate that
   maternal and child factors jointly influence child-feeding decisions and
   that these decisions are easily reversed. As relactation is.culturally
   acceptable, health practitioners should consider recommending
   relactation when children have been prematurely weaned and human milk
   would improve their nutritional and health status. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Foraging adaptations include behavioral and physiological responses, but
   most optimal foraging models deal exclusively with behavioral decision
   variables, taking other dimensions as constraints. To overcome this
   limitation, we measured behavioral and physiological responses of
   European starlings Sturnus vulgaris to changes in food availability in a
   laboratory environment. The birds lived in a dosed economy with a choice
   of two foraging modes (flying and walking) and were observed under two
   treatments (hard and easy) that differed in the work required to obtain
   food. Comparing the hard with the easy treatment, we found the following
   differences. In the hard treatment, daily amount of work was higher, but
   daily intake was lower. Even though work was greater, total daily
   expenditure was smaller, partly because overnight metabolism was lower.
   Body mass was lower, but daily oscillation in body mass did not differ.
   Feces' caloric density was lower; indicating greater food utilization.
   Energy expenditure rate expressed as multiples of basal metabolic rate
   (BMR) increased during the working period from 3.5 X BMR (easy) to 5.2 X
   BMR (hard), but over the 24-h period, it was close to 2.4 X BMR in both
   treatments. We also found that rate of expenditure during flight was
   very high in both treatments (52.3 W in easy and 45.5 W in hard), as
   expected for short (as opposed to cruising) flights. The relative
   preferences between walking and flying were incompatible with maximizing
   the ratio of energy gains per unit of expenditure (efficiency) but
   compatible with maximizing net gain per unit of time during the foraging
   cycle (net rate). Neither currency explained the results when
   nonforaging time was included. Time was not a direct constraint: the
   birds rested more than 90\% of the time in both treatments.
   Understanding this complex picture requires reasoning with ecological,
   physiological, and cognitive arguments. We defend the role of optimality
   as an appropriate tool to guide this integrative perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity has primarily been studied in the context of

   migration of competing, physiologically distinguishable, Daphnia
   populations. We developed a model that evaluates the competitive
   strength of daphnids which are food limited and which face predation.
   Competitive strength is assessed by a population's ability to invade and
   defend a previously established site. Phenotypically plastic individuals
   were assumed to choose an evolutionarily stable migration strategy at
   any time during the invasion process. We found plasticity to increase a
   population's competitive ability and in special cases to support
   coexistence of similar populations. Including community structure in
   analyzing the adaptive Value of phenotypic plasticity reveals aspects
   that are not directly inferable from isolated population models. Hence,
   selection for plasticity may be more widespread than generally expected.}},

   considerable intraspecific variation in nest sites. Few Studies have
   tested whether nest-site selection by birds changes after experience
   with nest predators. Using data collected over 9 years, we examined
   within- and between-year variation in 331 nests of white-tailed
   ptarmigan, Lagopus leucurus. We found the first direct evidence for a
   fitness trade-off with amount of cover at the nest; concealed sites were
   less often detected by predators but were more risky for incubating
   hens. Small ptarmigan and those in good body condition used sites with
   less cover, while large ptarmigan nested at higher elevations. Nesting
   success was not related to age or spring body condition. Responses to
   experience with predators were less clear. Successful females tended to
   use less cover the following year, whereas unsuccessful females tended
   to change cover types, but not the amount of cover, in subsequent years.
   Overall, characteristics of nest sites showed strong seasonal patterns,
   suggesting that microclimate may be a more important selective pressure
   than predation. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Optimal foraging theory predicts that an individual should resort to
   intraspecific kleptoparasitism when this foraging strategy helps to
   maximize its intake rate. Thus aggressor and victim should be foraging
   at lower and higher rates, respectively, than the flock average (intake
   rate maximization). Independent of the maximization principle, moreover,
   an aggressor should attack when its intake rate falls below a threshold
   critical for survival, and select a victim foraging at an intake rate
   high enough to ensure survival (starvation risk minimization). We tested
   both hypotheses using 324 aggressive displacements from feeding sites
   observed in flocks of common cranes, Gills grus, foraging on cereal
   fields. Aggressors attacked cranes feeding at higher rates than average
   birds. The immediate consequences of a successful attack were an
   increase in intake rate for the aggressor and a decrease for the victim.
   The intake rate of the aggressor prior to the attack was lower than both
   the mean intake rate of the flock and the minimum intake rate necessary
   to cover basic metabolic needs. After displacing its victim, the intake
   rate of the aggressor was higher than before the attack and also higher
   than the average intake rate of the flock. The intake rate of the
   aggressor after the attack was not higher than the mean intake rate of
   the flock, however, when the time spent on the attack was included. We
   conclude that cranes used a kleptoparasitic strategy to recover from
   temporary reductions in feeding rate. This was particularly the case
   below the threshold of intake necessary for survival. (C) 1998 The

Abstract = {{In the common goby, Pomatoschistus microps (Pisces, Gobiidae), males
   build nests under mussel shells where they care for the eggs until
   hatching. To investigate why male common gobies cannibalize their own
   eggs (filial cannibalism), we conducted a feeding experiment. Males
   given little food ate from their eggs more often than males given food
   in excess. However, males given mussel meat in excess did not eat more
   of their eggs than males fed with both mussel meat in excess and goby
   eggs. This may suggest that male common gobies cannibalize their eggs to
   obtain energy rather than essential nutrients lacking in other diets.
   Moreover, males ate their whole clutch if it was exceptionally small
   regardless of food treatment, suggesting that males stop investing in
   their clutch if its reproductive value is less;than the cost of guarding
   it. Thus, whole clutch cannibalism and partial clutch cannibalism seem
   to be governed by different factors. Furthermore, poorly built nests
   were associated with starved males, suggesting that nest concealing is
   costly. There was an association between how well the nest was built and
   partial clutch filial cannibalism, suggesting that the appearance of the
   nest may indicate the condition of the male, and thus the risk of filial
   cannibalism. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{In hedonic theories of motivation, `motivational affective states'
   (MASs) are typically seen as adaptations which motivate certain types of
   behaviour, especially in situations where a flexible or learned response
   is more adaptive than a rigid or reflexive one. MASs can be negative leg
   unpleasant feelings of hunger or pain) or positive (eg pleasant feelings
   associated with eating and playing). Hedonic theories often portray
   negative and positive MASs as opposite ends of a one-dimensional scale.
   We suggest that natural selection has favoured negative and positive
   affect as separate processes to solve two different types of
   motivational problems. We propose that negative MASs leg thirst, fear)
   evolved in response to `need situations' where the fitness benefit of an
   action has increased, often because the action is needed to cope with a
   threat to survival or reproductive success. We propose that these
   negative MASs develop in response to a change in the body leg
   dehydration) or the environment (eg the approach of a predator) which
   creates the need for action, and that negative MASs can become intense
   and prolonged if the threat to fitness is high and persistent. We
   propose that positive MASs evolved in `opportunity situations' where an
   action (eg playing, exploring) has become advantageous because the
   fitness cost of performing it has declined. We propose that these
   positive MASs occur during, or as a result of the performance of types
   of behaviour which are beneficial for fitness at a variety of times, not
   only when they are required to meet immediate needs; and that the
   pleasure inherent in the behaviour motivates the animal to perform it
   when the cost of so doing is sufficiently low. Some behaviour leg
   eating) can be motivated by both positive and negative affect. Other
   behaviour, such as playing or fleeing from a predator, may be motivated
   largely by positive or negative affect alone. Our hypothesis needs to be
   tested, but we suggest that it corresponds well to common human
   experience.
   The hypothesis provides a basis for predicting whether an aspect of
   animal management is likely to cause strong and prolonged negative
   affect ('suffering', or to prevent animals from experiencing certain
   types of pleasure. This distinction is important for bringing animal
   welfare assessment into line with ethical concerns.}},

Abstract = {{Cholecystokinin (CCK) is one of the first discovered gastrointestinal
   hormones and one of the most abundant neuropeptides in the brain. Two
   types of CCK receptors have been identified: (1) CCK-A receptors are
   mainly located in the periphery, but are also found in some areas of the
   CNS; and (2) CCK-B receptors are widely distributed in the brain. Major
   biological actions of CCK are the reduction of food intake and the
   induction of anxiety-related behavior. Inhibition of feeding is mainly
   mediated by the A-type receptors, whereas anxiety-like behavior is
   induced by stimulating B type receptors. This paper presents new
   findings on the effects of the biologically active CCK agonists, CCK-8S,
   CCK-I, and A71378. The results reviewed suggest that the hypophagic
   effects of CCK are strongly dependent on the experimental design, sex,
   and age of the rats. For example, food intake measured during the night
   or after food deprivation is reduced by CCK-8S in young adult and aged
   rats, whereas, under fixed feeding conditions, CCK-8S does not inhibit
   food intake in young adult rats. The sensitivity to the hypophagic CCK
   effect increases with age in male and female rats; however, female rats
   are less sensitive to the CCK action. Further, using a nongenetic and
   non-stressful model of obesity due to unspecific postnatal overfeeding,
   the satiating effect of moderate CCK-8S doses is weaker in obese than in
   normal rats. Again, the hypophagic effect is more pronounced in male
   than in female obese and normal rats. Considering that aversive
   reactions in rats are markedly influenced by strain and breeding-line
   variations, research results in this area are critically reviewed. It is
   shown that anxiety-like symptoms can only be induced by a selectively
   acting CCK-B agonist, whereas mixed CCK-A and -B agonists and selective
   CCK-A agonists fail to change behavior in anxiety tests. CCK-4 induces
   stable and reproducible anxiogenic-like behavior only in certain rat
   strains. Moreover, CCK-4 effects can be demonstrated in the conflict
   test, in the ultrasonic vocalization test in rat pups, on the elevated
   plus maze, and in the black and white box, but not in the social
   interaction test. CCK has also been reported to modulate memory
   processes. On the one hand, CCK-8S and CCK-4 enhanced habituation to the
   novelty of a hole board. On the other hand, repeated administration of
   CCK-8S did not improve maze performance in aged rats. The literature on
   the behavioral pharmacology of CCK is rife with inconsistency and
   contradiction. The major biological actions of CCK depend on the
   receptor selectivity of the CCK fragments used and on organismic and
   procedural variables. All these variables potentially influence
   behavioral responses in rats. Therefore, in CCK research more attention
   should be paid to the importance of these methodological factors.}},

   WESSELS et al. (1954) definition is that babies in usually good health
   and nutritional condition are screaming/whining more than three hours
   daily, more than three days weekly for no apparent reasons. The question
   is whether/in what way daily routines of infants concerned differ from
   normal, infants. Mothers of colicky infants (n =25) and mothers in a
   control group (n=25) record characteristics of the mother/child
   relationship, their assumptions why the child is screaming, care and
   attention they provide and babies' reactions. For seven days the mothers
   kept a diary about the babies' behaviour and worked on questionnaires
   concerning social support received, depressant effects and exhaustion.
   Interviews about the extent of care provided as well as personal
   thoughts and emotions were conducted. The ``colic group{''} formed two
   subgroups: one fulfilling Wessels criteria (Wessel-Koliker; WK), the
   other more conforming with the ``control group{''} babies though mothers
   complained about screaming (Non-Wessel-Koliker; NWK). ``Colic
   group{''}-babies received more attention and care (compared to the
   ``control group{''} babies), attempts to calm them down frequently
   failed and mothers in this group reacted less promptly to their babies'
   screaming. ``NWK-group{''}-mothers strongly lend to attribute the
   babies' screaming to ``meteorism{''} or ``discontent{''}. No differences
   existed between groups concerning social support, depressant effects and

Abstract = {{In the Kruger National Park, male lions, Panthera lee, acquire most of
   their food by hunting rather than scavenging. This study, the most
   intensive to date of male lion ecology, showed that in savanna
   woodlands, with high buffalo, Syncerus caffer, densities, male lions
   were frequent and successful hunters. The main prey species of all male
   group types, but particularly nonterritorial males, was buffalo: By
   contrast, females preyed more frequently on the most abundant
   medium-sized ungulates, such as wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, and
   zebra, Equus burchelli. Thus intraspecific prey selection separation was
   based primarily on intersexual and, to a lesser extent, social
   differences. Furthermore, both nonterritorial males and pride females
   located their favoured prey, buffalo and medium-sized ungulates,
   respectively, more often than other prey. We investigated the influence
   of several ecological variables on the socioecology of male lions,
   particularly as we had determined that territorial males spent little
   time with their pride females and tended to hunt by themselves in their
   respective male coalitions. Further analysis showed that in a range of
   ecosystems in southern and eastern Africa the proportion of time
   territorial males spent with, and thus scavenged from, their pride
   females was strongly influenced by vegetation structure, and therefore
   probably by the assemblage of available ungulates. In open systems,
   territorial males were, therefore, likely to be encountered with pride
   females, whereas in more wooded areas they were likely to be encountered
   away from their pride females. We suggest that this is because
   vegetation structure influences food/prey availability and hunting
   success and influences territory maintenance and/or cub defence. (C)

Abstract = {{Several novel cyclic MSH analogs were synthesized, and their binding
   properties were tested on cells transiently expressing the human
   melanocortin-1 (MC1), MC3, MC4, and MC5 receptors. We discovered a novel
   substance (HS024) that showed about 20-fold selectivity and very high
   affinity (K-i = 0.29 nM) for the MC4 receptor. HS024 (cyclic
   {[}AcCys(3),Nle(4),Arg(5),D-Nal(7),Cys-NH211] alpha-MSH-(3-11)) has a
   29-membered atom ring structure that includes an Arg in position 5.
   HS024 was found to antagonize an alpha MSH-induced cAMP response in
   cells expressing the human MC1, MC3, MC4, and MC5 receptor DNAs. HS024
   also caused a dose-dependent increase in food intake, with a maximum
   response (4-fold increase) at a l-nmol dose injected
   intracerebroventricularly in free feeding rats. We also tested SHU9119,
   a previously described nonselective MC receptor antagonist, and found
   HS024 and SHU9119 to have similar potencies for increasing food intake,
   although SHU9119 appeared to induce more serious side-Effects. HS024
   increased the food intake of free feeding rats to levels comparable to
   those in food-deprived rats, indicating that blockade of the MC4
   receptor is a highly effective way to increase feeding. Moreover, we
   tested the effects of intracerebroventricular injections of HS024 in
   elevated plus-maze and open-field experiments on rats. In these tests,
   HS024 did not appear to affect emotionality or locomotor activity,
   suggesting that the MC4 receptor does not mediate the anxiogenic-like
   and locomotor effects related to the melanocortic peptides.}},

Abstract = {{Avian long-distance migration involves the storage and expenditure of
   very large fuel loads. Birds may double in weight before take-off on
   flights of many 1000 km, and they may lose half their body mass over the
   subsequent few days that such trips take. Recent studies indicate that
   in addition to the storage and depletion of fat, the muscles and belly
   organs also undergo considerable changes in size in the course of such
   migrations. Such intraindividual and repeatedly reversed changes in
   stores and organ sizes represent a class of phenotypic plasticity called
   `phenotypic flexibility'. Using preliminary comparative data for
   different populations of Bar-tailed Godwits Limosa lapponica, and
   several other shorebird species adding variation to the migration
   strategies sampled (Golden Plover Pluvialis apricaria, Ruff Philomachus
   pugnax, Red Knot Calidris canutus and Bristle-thighed Curlew Numenius
   tahitiensis), the thesis is developed that the size of the organs
   carried during take-off represent evolutionary compromises between their
   functions during the storage, flight and post-arrival phases of
   migration. In all cases fat-free tissue along with fat is deposited
   during fuel storage, but the proportions vary a great deal between
   similarly sized species. Just before departure on long-distance flights,
   exercise organs (pectoral muscle and heart) tend to show hypertrophy and
   nutritional organs (stomach, intestine and liver) tend to show atrophy.
   Reductions in nutritional organs appear most pronounced in (sub-)
   species that are about to overfly barren oceans with few or no
   opportunities for emergency landings. Migrant birds seem to show a great
   deal of adaptive flexibility, and the study of this flexibility may shed
   light on (presently unknown) physiological mechanisms as well as on
   correlated ecological constraints on bird migration.}},

Abstract = {{n-Butyl acetate, a common industrial solvent, was selected by the US EPA
   as a chemical of concern for neurotoxicity as part of the Multisubstance
   Rule for the Testing of Neurotoxicity. The neurotoxic potential of
   n-butyl acetate was investigated in Sprague-Dawley rats using a
   functional observational battery, motor activity, neurohistopathology,
   and schedule-controlled operant behavior (SCOB) as indicators of
   neurotoxicity. Animals were exposed to concentrations of 0, 500, 1500,
   or 3000 ppm of n-butyl acetate for 6 hours per day for 65 exposures over
   14 weeks. Functional observational battery and motor activity values for
   ad libitum-fed male and female rats were measured during Weeks -1, 4, 8,
   and 13. SCOB testing of food-restricted animals, using a multiple fixed
   ratio/fixed interval schedule, was conducted daily prior to each
   exposure to maintain the operant behavior; the data from Weeks -1, 4, 8,
   and 13 were evaluated for evidence of neurotoxicity. Transient signs of
   sedation and hypoactivity were observed only during exposure to the 1500
   and 3000 ppm concentrations. The only signs of systemic toxicity were
   reduced body weights for the 3000 ppm ad libitum-fed groups and
   occasionally for the female 1500 ppm ad libitum-fed group. No evidence
   of neurotoxicity was seen during the functional observational battery
   examinations. Motor activity for the 3000 ppm male group was
   significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) higher than for the control
   group only during Week 4. No significant differences were observed among
   groups for Weeks 8 and 13. No significant differences in motor activity
   values were observed for female rats. No significant differences were
   seen in operant behavior at any test vapor concentration. Microscopic
   evaluations of sections from the brain, spinal cord (cervical and lumbar
   regions), dorsal and ventral spinal roots, dorsal root ganglia, sciatic
   nerve, and tibial nerve of animals in the control and 3000 ppm groups
   did not indicate any treatment-related effects. ln conclusion, there was
   no evidence of cumulative neurotoxicity based on the functional

Abstract = {{A herbivore faces challenges while foraging-ongoing changes in its
   physiological condition along with variation in the nutrient and toxin
   concentrations of foods, spatially and temporally-that make selecting a
   nutritious diet a vital affair. Foraging behaviours arise from simple
   rules that operate across levels of resolution from cells and organs to
   individuals and their interactions with social and physical
   environments. At all these levels, behaviour is a function of its
   consequences: a behaviour operating on the environment to induce changes
   is itself changed by those events. Thus, behaviour emerges from its own
   functioning-behaviour self-organizes-not from that of its surroundings.
   This ostensible autonomy notwithstanding, no self-organizing system
   (cell, organ, or individual) is independent of its environs because
   existence consists of an ongoing exchange of energy and matter.
   According to this view, the notion of cause and effect is replaced with
   functional relationships between behaviours and environmental
   consequences. Changes in physical environments alter the distribution,
   abundance, nutritional, and toxicological characteristics of plants,
   which affect food preference. Social interactions early in life
   influence behaviour in various ways: animals prefer familiar foods and
   environments, and they prefer to be with companions. Animals in
   unfamiliar environments often walk farther, ingest less food, and suffer
   more from malnutrition and toxicity than animals in familiar
   environments. An individual's food preferences-and its ability to
   discriminate familiar from novel foods-arise from the functional
   integration of sensory (smell, taste, texture) and postingestive
   (effects of nutrients and toxins on chemo-, osmo-, and
   mechano-receptors) effects. The ability to discriminate among foods is
   critical for survival: all problems with poisonous plants are due to an
   inability to discriminate or a lack of alternatives. Animals eat a
   variety of foods as a result of nearing or exceeding tolerance limits
   for sensory and postingestive effects unique to each food. After eating
   any food too frequently or excessively, the likelihood increases that
   animals will eat alternative foods owing to exceeding sensory-,
   nutrient-, and toxin-specific tolerance limits. Cyclic patterns of
   intake of a variety of foods reflect seemingly chaotic interactions
   among flavours, nutrients, and toxins interacting along continua.}},

Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Infanticide, the killing of conspecific young, has been documented in
   numerous species of mammals and is considered an adaptive behavioral
   strategy to enhance the reproductive success of the perpetrator. The
   potential benefits of committing infanticide for males are obtaining
   nutritional gain and mating partners, and for females are acquiring
   access to resources such as food and nest sites. Some costs are
   associated with committing infanticide such as additional energy
   expenditure, risk of injury, and exposure to predation. However, the
   major costs associated with infanticide are borne by the victim Female
   and the sire male in loss of fitness. In response to this selection,
   males and females use a variety of counter-strategies to protect their
   young from infanticide.
   We summarize the published accounts and theory associated with
   infanticide and the occurrence of counter-strategies in a variety of
   mammalian groups in order to explain how infanticide may influence
   individual behavior as well as the social systems of mammals. We focus
   on the behavioral strategies used, primarily by females, to deter major
   losses in reproductive success. These strategies include aggression,
   female choice of dominant males, and promiscuity to confuse paternity as
   defense against males, and territoriality, association with kin,
   reproductive suppression, and reproductive synchrony as defenses against
   females. Male counter-strategies are less well known, but intrasexual
   territoriality may in part function as defense against infanticide. The
   costs associated with the different male and female counter-strategies
   are likely to vary, but may include increased energy expenditure,
   exposure to predators and injury for both sexes, as well as increased
   competition for resources, limited mate choice, and postponed
   reproduction for females. We propose that the occurrence of infanticide
   does not only have the potential to affect the behavior of individuals
   (e.g. aggression. spacing and mate choice), but may also have
   consequences for the shaping of mammalian mating systems.}},

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{The trophic role of ciliates in microbial food webs has often been
   considered to be either bacterivore, herbivore or predatory. In general,
   single species have been assigned to only one trophic level, although
   early publications have already pointed to omnivorous feeding in many
   different groups of ciliates. However, the knowledge on the quantitative
   aspects of ciliate food preferences is scarce up to now The aim of this
   study was to quantify food selectivity with the help of different
   fluorescently labeled potential prey organisms offered to the omnivorous
   filter-feeding ciliate Stylonychia mytilus as a model organism.
   Different fluorescently labeled bacteria (FLB) and algae (FLA), and
   inert fluorescent particles (FP) were offered in feeding experiments and
   evaluated with the help of epifluorescence microscopy. In addition,
   different live-stained fluorescent ciliates (FLCi) were offered as
   living prey. A vital staining method for obtaining FLCi is described.
   The results of this study showed a selective ingestion of different
   ciliates as well as a clear selection between different algae. Bacteria
   and FP were ingested, but negatively selected. There was a variability
   in the food preference regarding different-sized cells by Stylonychia
   mytilus indicating ontogenetic differences in feeding habits. Young
   daughter cells were not able to ingest the largest prey items. Feeding
   rates of Stylonychia were highest during the first twenty minutes of the
   experiments and reached a plateau after 60 min. Capture efficiency for
   ciliate prey was 70\% at the beginning and declined to a value of about
   30\% after 30 min. Such behavioural patterns may significantly
   overestimate feeding rates of ciliates determined by short-term
   experiments. Food concentration was shown to have strong effects on
   ciliate ingestion rates leading to a clearly detectable functional
   response. Various factors influencing the feeding behaviour of
   filter-feeding ciliates and their significance in grazing experiments
   are discussed.}},

   to lower predation risks and are less affected by food deprivation than
   small fish, with fish decreasing their responses to food-deprivation
   treatments more strongly with increasing body length than to predation
   treatments. This may explain our observation that large fish emerged
   later from a refuge than small ones and spent shorter times outside the
   refuge. The key role of differential responses to food deprivation was
   further illustrated by the finding that the relative weight loss of
   individual fish was strongly correlated with a reduction in hiding time

   information to determine foraging patch sampling duration. In a series
   of two-chambered artificial foraging patches, I tested 26 S. ocreata
   once as immatures, and again as adults, under two hunger states
   (satiated and 7 days without food). Patches varied in the type of
   sensory information provided by live prey (crickets) as follows: visual
   cues alone; vibratory cues alone; combined visual/vibratory cues; and
   control (no prey). Without feeding in patches, the type of sensory
   stimuli available from prey strongly affected patch residence time, with
   spiders using primarily visual rather than vibratory cues. Hunger level
   as a main effect had no influence on residence time, but hunger state
   did mediate the importance of visual or vibratory information.
   Significant age- and sex-related differences in patch residence time in
   the presence of different sensory cues were found. These data suggest

Abstract = {{We quantified parental behaviour of eastern kingbirds during the

   examine the impact of previous breeding experience (defined as having
   bred on the territory in the past) on behaviour and reproductive
   success. Females performed all incubation, while males spent more than
   60\% of their time in vigilant or nest guarding behaviour during
   incubation. Parental roles were not defined as sharply during the
   nestling period. Females spent more time vigilant, but males provisioned
   young at only 54\% of the rate of females. Vigilance and nest watching
   were still primarily male duties. Male and female behaviour did not vary
   with the pair's combination of experience (e.g. experienced-experienced
   versus inexperienced-inexperienced in previous-current breeding season,
   respectively) during either phase of reproduction, but experienced males
   were more vigilant during incubation and fed young relatively more than
   inexperienced males. Experienced females were also more efficient
   foragers. Although behaviour did not differ among the four combinations
   of pair experience, inexperienced pairs none the less lost the most
   young to starvation and predation. Consequently, inexperienced pairs
   fledged one less nestling per nesting attempt than did pairs with at
   least one experienced breeder. Our results suggest that having at least
   one experienced breeder substantially improved a pair's reproductive

Abstract = {{When novel behaviour patterns spread through animal populations,

   whether such `innovators' are particularly creative individuals,
   individuals exposed to the appropriate environmental contingencies, or
   individuals in a particular motivational state. We describe three
   experiments that investigated the factors influencing
   foraging;innovation in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata. We exposed small
   laboratory populations of fish to novel foraging tasks, which involved
   exploration and problem solving to locate a novel food source.
   Experiments 1 and 2 found that (1) females were more likely to innovate

   nonfood-deprived subjects, and (3) smaller fish were more likely to

Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{285-301}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the effect of risk of mortality on the optimal
   diet of an animal foraging for two food types. The foods are
   characterized by different nutritional or energetic values per unit
   volume, and the forager has constraints on both the amount of time it
   has available for foraging and on the volume of food that can be
   processed per unit time. Such a situation characterizes the diet choice
   problem faced by many herbivores. The two food types may occur in the
   same habitat, or they may occur in different habitat patches; in the
   latter case, they cannot be encountered simultaneously. Unlike earlier
   analyses of these diet problems, here we consider the risk of mortality
   when foraging and allow risk to differ between habitats. Optimal time
   allocation strategies and the resultant functional responses are
   calculated for both one- and two-habitat situations. Mortality risk can
   substantially change the forager's time allocations and, consequently,
   its functional responses. Increasing mortality risk in both habitats
   proportionally can increase use of the habitat that has the greater
   risk. Time allocation often responds in a non-monotonic fashion to
   changes in the density of a particular food. As a result, functional
   responses may decrease with increasing food abundance over one or more
   ranges of abundance. Experimental findings on the response of
   grasshopper foraging to the risk of spider predation are compared with
   the theory. Finally, the possible indirect interactions between the food
   species in this simple food web are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated how parental provisioning and nestling departure
   behaviour interact to produce prefledging mass recession in Cassin's
   auklets, Ptychoramphus aleuticus. Under our hypothesis, auklet parents
   are reluctant provisioners and should be increasingly likely to
   terminate or reduce provisioning of their single nestling as it matures.
   For the nestling, remaining in the nest presents a risk of losing mass
   (if the parent does not provision) but also a possibility of additional
   provisioning. As the nestling matures and becomes increasingly capable
   of independence, the benefits of remaining in the nest decrease and
   nestlings should be increasingly likely to fledge. Nestlings also should
   be more likely to fledge when the expectation of additional provisioning
   is low. Data on parental provisioning (based on growth increments) and
   nestling departure were consistent with our hypothesis. Older and
   heavier nestlings had smaller growth increments than younger and lighter
   nestlings, suggesting that parents were reluctant to provision old and
   heavy nestlings. Older and heavier nestlings also were increasingly
   likely to fledge. We hypothesized that nestlings might use the intensity
   of mass loss to gauge parental reluctance to provision, and accordingly,
   nestlings were increasingly likely to fledge after experiencing a
   greater amount of mass loss. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Using juvenile coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, we tested predictions
   arising from dynamic optimization models of foraging under predation
   risk. Coho juveniles from two size groups raised in the laboratory were
   individually fed varying food rations. Their willingness to risk
   Predation was measured as the time to resume foraging after presentation
   of a predator model. Small fish (mean weight 1.5 g) resumed feeding
   earlier than larger fish (3.5 g) as predicted by dynamic models under
   summer photoperiod but not under autumn photoperiod. Contrary to
   predictions, larger fish did not increase risk taking and small fish
   decreased risk taking between summer and autumn treatments. Food ration
   significantly influenced time to resume feeding only in small coho. A
   simple mechanistic model we proposed to explain feeding motivation under
   risk as a function of body size and prior growth rate was not sufficient
   to explain observed variation in risk taking. This study suggests that
   coho salmon use photoperiod and their own body size as cues for
   long-term, state-dependent adjustments of feeding behaviour. The lower
   risk taking of larger fish is probably an example of asset protection,
   whereby larger animals accept less predation risk to protect their
   greater accumulated fitness value. The decrease of risk taking in small
   fish in the autumn was possibly caused by a switch of life history
   trajectory towards delayed smelting. (C) 1999 The Association for the

Abstract = {{We document and interpret microgeographic variation in life history
   traits of water pythons (Liasis fuscus) on the Adelaide River floodplain
   in tropical Australia. Subpopulations of pythons separated by <2 km
   differ in reproductive timing, in survival rates at three different life
   history stages (adults, embryos, and hatchlings), in costs of
   reproduction, and in reproductive frequencies. Remarkably, these
   differences all seem to result from a minor divergence in nest-site
   characteristics, Female water pythons use two main types of nest sites:
   those with relatively low, variable temperatures (especially hollows
   within paperbark root systems on the edge of the floodplain) and those
   with higher, constant temperatures (burrows dug by large varanid lizards
   in the higher, drier ridges similar to 2 km away). ``Cool{''} nests
   delayed reproduction and reduced survival rates of hatchlings in at
   least one year. Females ovipositing in ``cool{''} nests remained with
   the clutch throughout the 2-mo incubation period, whereas they deserted
   the clutch within a few days of laying in warmer nests. Most
   egg-attending females did not feed. Hence, ``cool{''}-nesting females
   were emaciated by the end of incubation, and many died from starvation
   or predation; surviving females required two years to replenish their
   energy reserves before producing another clutch. In contrast,
   ``hot{''}-nesting females had higher rates of survival, and most could
   reproduce again the following year. Most females showed strong nest-site
   fidelity in successive clutches, but some moved between ``hot{''} and
   ``cool{''} nest sites. We have previously shown that the incubation
   thermal regime also affects developmental rates and hatchling phenotypes
   (shape and behavior). Thus, nest-site selection is a phenotypically
   plastic character, which although superficially trivial, engenders
   significant microgeographic variation in a wide range of life history

Abstract = {{The response of Chaoborus to biomanipulation-induced changes in fish
   community structure was studied in two small south-central Ontario lakes
   which had similar physical and chemical characteristics. The
   biomanipulation involved: (a) three years (1991-1993) of
   pre-manipulation characterization of the food webs in two lakes with
   very different food web structures (Ranger Lake was dominated by
   piscivores and Mouse Lake had no piscivores), (b) removal of
   approximately 90 \% of the piscivores from Ranger Lake and their
   addition to Mouse Lake, and (c) three years (1994-1996) of
   post-manipulation characterization of the resulting changes in food web
   structure. The analysis presented here focuses on behavioural changes in
   Chaoborus, with specific reference to changes in Chaoborus density and
   migration patterns. At Ranger Lake, during both the pre- and
   post-manipulation phases of the experiment, the absolute density of
   Chaoborus (C. albatus, C, punctipennis, C. trivittatus and C, flavicans)
   varied little, remaining at or near 150 individuals m(-3). At Mouse
   Lake, densities were more than twice as high, and although inter-annual
   variability was also much higher, there were no significant pre- to
   post-manipulation changes in density, suggesting that changes in fish
   community structure had little direct influence on Chaoborus standing
   stocks. At Ranger Lake, diel migration patterns remained constant
   through the entire experimental period (1991-1996), but at Mouse Lake,
   there were clear changes in migratory behaviour. At Mouse Lake, during
   the pre-manipulation years (1991-1993), all four Chaoborus species
   migrated to the sediments during the day and ascended to the epilimnion
   at night. Post-manipulation, all four species remained in the water
   column during both the night and the day. Given that direct effects of
   fish on Chaoborus densities were not obvious, we suggest that changes in
   behaviour may have been mediated by the indirect effects of kairomones
   exuded by fish. Our data suggested that changes in Chaoborus migratory
   behaviour were non-linear and that the boundary in fish densities that
   elicited full diel migrations, lay between 700 and 2,400

Abstract = {{We report on the responses of wild European rabbits (Oryctolagus
   cuniculus) to a reduction in predation risk from red foxes (Vulpes
   vulpes) in a predator removal experiment in montane Australia.
   Specifically we tested whether rabbits in two sites with reduced fox
   numbers moved further from refuge than rabbits in two sites with
   abundant foxes. We then compared diet quality by analysing stomach
   contents, gut morphology and age-specific body mass to determine if
   release from predation risk enables rabbits to access higher quality
   food and hence attain higher body mass and condition.
   During spotlighting on three quarterly surveys in 1994-1995, rabbits in
   fox removal sites were observed, on average, three times further from
   refuge compared to rabbits at sites with foxes. However, this freedom to
   forage far from cover did not translate into a higher quality diet.
   Analysis of the nitrogen and neutral-detergent fibre content of stomach
   samples taken from a shot sample of rabbits at their peak densities
   after fox removal showed no differences in short-term diet quality of
   male or female rabbits due to fox removal. In contrast, analyses of gut
   morphologies, which reflect long-term fibre intake, suggested that
   rabbits in removal sites fed on a diet higher in fibre and hence of
   lower quality. This was possibly due to the large increases in rabbit
   density associated with fox removal. Despite this, male rabbits in fox
   removal sites were heavier for their age, had longer intestines, and
   heavier stomach and gut contents. We suggest that rabbits in fox removal
   sites compensated for the lower quality diet by increasing intake which
   enabled them to maintain higher age-specific body mass but only because
   predation risk was reduced. This result highlights the untenable link
   between resource limitation and predation risk.}},

Abstract = {{Variation among bird species in growth rates is traditionally attributed
   to differences in energy availability and developmental mode. However,
   the extent and form of competition among siblings for limited food
   resources may also be an important determinant. Kin-selection-based
   models of intrabrood competition suggest that nestling growth rates
   should be highest in those species in which siblings are likely to be
   less genetically related to one another (half-sibs rather than
   full-sibs). We test this novel prediction using the frequency of
   multiple paternity as an index of average sib relatedness within broods.
   As predicted, we find a significant positive association between the
   rate of multiple paternity within broods and nestling growth rates.
   Furthermore, this holds true when we control for the effects of
   variation in other factors that may be associated with variation in
   growth rate, such as body size, brood size, mating system and the form
   of parental care. We suggest, therefore, that variation in growth rate

Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{153}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{649-659}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The rapid response of animals to changes in predation risk has allowed
   behavioral ecologists to learn much about antipredator decision making.
   A largely unappreciated aspect of such decision making, however, is that
   it may be fundamentally driven by the very thing that allows it to be so
   readily studied: temporal variation in risk. We show theoretically that
   temporal variability in risk leaves animals with the problem of
   allocating feeding and antipredator efforts across different risk
   situations. Our analysis suggests that an animal should exhibit its
   greatest antipredator behavior in high-risk situations that are brief
   and infrequent. An animal should also allocate more antipredator effort
   to high-risk situations and more feeding to low-risk situations, with an
   increase in the relative degree of risk in high-risk situations.
   However, the need to feed leaves an animal with little choice but to
   decrease its allocation of antipredator effort to high-risk situations
   as they become more frequent or lengthy; here, antipredator effort in
   low-risk situations may drop to low levels as an animal allocates as
   much feeding as possible to brief periods of low risk. These conclusions
   hold under various scenarios of interrupted feeding, state-dependent
   behavior, and stochastic variation in risk situations. Our analysis also
   suggests that a common experimental protocol, in which prey animals are
   maintained under low risk and then exposed to a brief ``pulse{''} of
   high risk, is likely to overestimate the intensity of antipredator
   behavior expected under field situations or chronic exposure to high
   risk.}},

Abstract = {{1. Recently, a small predatory beetle, Trechisibus antarcticus
   (Carabidae), was accidentally introduced onto the island of South
   Georgia, sub-Antarctic.
   2. From the presumed site of introduction the beetle is invading the
   coastal lowland area, building up high densities locally in the
   tussock-forming grass Parodiochloa flabellata.
   3. In the coastal area the endemic detritivorous/herbivorous beetle
   Hydromedion sparsutum (Perimylopidae) is common, especially in and
   beneath the tussocks.
   4. The first three, out of six, larval instars of H. sparsutum are
   easily taken prey by the carabid.
   5. In sites colonized by the carabid, total abundance and the ratio
   between larval and adult numbers of H. sparsutum are far lower, and its
   adult body size clearly larger, than in comparable sites where the
   carabid is absent.
   6. Two hypotheses are proposed for explaining the increase in adult body
   size of H. sparsutum: (i) the increase is a direct effect of predation:
   selection by the predator favours large hatchlings and/or larvae with a
   high growth rate; and (ii) the increase is an indirect effect of
   predation: by lowering the density of H. sparsutum, predation has
   increased its per capita food supply, enabling a higher growth rate and
   a larger adult body size.
   7. A food addition experiment in a carabid-free site showed availability
   of high quality food to be insufficient for sustaining the initial
   larval population.
   8. In the laboratory, females from the predator-infested sites produced
   larger eggs and hatchlings than females from the carabid-free sites, but
   mass specific growth rates of the larvae were not higher.
   9. Field and laboratory data give stronger support to the food
   hypothesis than to the size selectivity hypothesis.}},

   Cosmetic surgery to achieve the desired physique carries a significant

   thinner bodies despite already being at a healthy weight. This pursuit
   is motivated primarily to enhance appearance. The ideal body portrayed
   in the media has stabilized in thinness, but it is becoming increasingly
   tubular, i.e., taller with slimmer hips and thicker waist. This ideal is
   presented to adult and adolescent women in their popular magazines, and
   to little girls with their dolls. Exercise is promoted as an optimal
   means to achieve the ideal physique. Young American women tend to
   idealize an athletic body shape, especially with upper-body muscularity.
   This shape can be attained only through sustained exercise and
   upper-body strength training. Hi,oh-level exercise may be a precursor to
   eating disorders. Women who exercise to excess, who are highly
   preoccupied with weight, and who are characterized by perfectionism and

Abstract = {{Context Several observational epidemiological studies report an
   association of pregnancy and obstetric complications with development of
   antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) in offspring. However, the
   precise nature and timing of the hypothesized biological insults are not
   known.
   Objective To test whether severe maternal nutritional deficiency early
   in gestation is associated with risk for ASPD in offspring.
   Design and Setting Retrospective cohort study. From October 1944 to May
   1945, the German army blockaded food supplies to the Netherlands,
   subjecting the western Netherlands first to moderate (official food
   rations, 4200-6300 kJ/d) then to severe (<4200 kJ/d) nutritional
   deficiency. The north and south were subjected to moderate nutritional
   deficiency only.
   Participants Dutch men born in large urban areas in 1944-1946 who were
   given psychiatric examinations for military induction at age 18 years (N
   = 100 543) were classified by the degree and timing of their prenatal
   exposure to nutritional deficiency based on their birthdate and
   birthplace.
   Main Outcome Measure Diagnosis of ASPD by psychiatric interview at time
   of medical examination for military induction, using the International
   Classification of Diseases, Sixth Revision (ICD-6).
   Results Men exposed prenatally to severe maternal nutritional deficiency
   during the first and/or second trimesters of pregnancy exhibited
   increased risk for ASPD (adjusted odds ratio {[}OR], 2.5; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], 1.5-4.2). Third-trimester exposure to severe
   nutritional deficiency and prenatal exposure to moderate nutritional
   deficiency were not associated with risk for ASPD.
   Conclusions Our data suggest that severe nutritional insults to the
   developing brain in utero may be capable of increasing the risk for
   antisocial behaviors in offspring. The possible implications of these
   findings for both developed countries and developing countries, where
   severe nutritional deficiency is widespread and often exacerbated by
   war, natural disaster, and forced migration, warrant study.}},

Abstract = {{During the course of ontogeny, odonates switch from being aquatic larvae
   to being terrestrial adults. Ontogenetic niche shift theory proposes
   that such shifts are adaptive and have evolved to maximize a growth rate
   (size) to mortality rate ratio. Individuals should therefore switch from
   one niche to the other at an optimal size or state. Since the majority
   of odonates are seasonal breeders, the extent to which the switch is
   optimal will depend upon the time and the resources available during
   postembryonic development. We collected a cohort of larvae that varied
   in how close they were to eclosion and reared them on either a
   high-nutrition or a low-nutrition diet. We then determined the relative
   influence of both time and nutritional constraints on survival and
   development rate, as well as the body size, size-corrected flight muscle
   mass and fat reserves of individuals at eclosion. Damselflies in both
   high- and low-nutrition treatments responded to a short development
   period by developing faster and reducing their body size, but did not
   change their proportional investment in fat reserves and flight muscle.
   Reduced larval nutrition resulted in decreased body size, flight muscle
   mass and fat reserves at eclosion. However, it had no effect on survival
   to eclosion, or development rate. We discuss these results in terms of
   the influence that time and nutritional constraints have on odonate

Abstract = {{Prey often respond to predator presence by increasing their use of
   refuges. However, unfavorable thermal conditions in refuges might entail
   physiological costs for an ectothermic prey. Thus, the decision of when
   to come out from a refuge should be optimized by considering the
   expected fitness effects of diminution of predation risk with time, but
   also by considering the cost of the loss of time spent at optimal body
   temperature maximizing physiological functions. The model of Ydenberg
   and Dill describes the trade-off between risk and cost for a prey
   fleeing to a refuge. We present a special case of this model to predict
   how emergence time from the refuge in lizards or other ectotherms should
   vary as a function of risk of predation and thermal costs of refuge use.
   The analyses of the variation in emergence time from a refuge of Lacerta
   monticola lizards in the held under two different predation risk levels
   supported the predictions of the model. As predicted, time spent in the
   refuge tvas longer when the threat of the initial attack had been
   higher, and therefore the subsequent diminution of risk was slower, but
   only when lizards emerged at the same place where they hid. When initial
   body temperature was high, some lizards decreased emergence time by
   emerging from a different place. In addition, the effects of thermal
   costs were more relevant in the highrisk situation. Time spent in the
   refuge under high risk increased when thermal conditions of the refuge
   were more similar to thermal conditions outside (i.e., physiological
   costs of refuge use were lower). We conclude that optimization of
   refuge-use strategies might help lizards cope with changes in predation
   risk without incurring excessive physiological costs.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: One of South Africa's principal tourist attractions is the
   opportunity to encounter Africa's large mammals in the wild. Attacks by
   these mammals can be exceptionally newsworthy with potentially
   deleterious effects on tourism. Little is known about the risk of injury
   and death caused by wild mammals to visitors to South Africa's nature
   reserves. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of fatal
   and nonfatal attacks on tourists by wild mammals in South Africa and to
   ascertain avoidable factors, if any.
   Methods: Commercial press records covering all South African Newspapers
   archived at the Independent Newspapers' central library were
   systematically reviewed for a 10-year period, January 1988 to December
   1997 inclusive, to identify all deaths and injuries to domestic and
   international tourists resulting from encounters with wild mammals in
   South Africa. All of these incidents were analyzed to ascertain
   avoidable factors.
   Results: During the review period seven tourists, including two students
   from Thailand and a German traveler, were killed by wild mammals in
   South Africa. Three of the four deaths ascribed to lions resulted from
   tourists carelessly approaching prides on foot in lion reserves. A
   judicial inquiry found that the management of a KwaZulu-Natal Reserve
   was culpable for the remaining death. Tourist ignorance of animal
   behavior and flagrant disregard of rules contributed to the two
   fatalities involving hippopotami. The unusual behavior manifested by the
   bull elephant responsible for the final death, resulted from discomfort
   caused by a dental problem to this pachyderm. During the same period
   there were 14 nonfatal attacks on tourists, including five by hippo,
   three by buffalo, two by rhino, and one each by a lion, leopard, zebra
   and musth elephant. Only the latter occurred while the visitor was in a
   motor vehicle. Tourist ethological naivete and failure to determine the
   experience of trail guides prior to travel, resulted in inadvertent
   agonistic behavior, unnecessary risk-taking and avoidable injury.
   Conclusions: This retrospective study has shown that attacks on tourists
   by wild mammals in South Africa are an uncommon cause of injury and
   death. Sensible precautions to minimize this risk include remaining in a
   secure motor vehicle or adequately fenced precincts while in the
   vicinity of large mammals, rigidly observing nature reserve
   instructions, never approaching animals that appear ill, malnourished,
   displaying aggressive behavior traits or female wild mammals with young,
   and demanding adequately trained and experienced game rangers when
   embarking on walking trails. Any behavior that might be construed as
   antagonistic and which could provoke an attack by large mammals should
   be avoided (e.g., driving directly at a lion). Visitors need to be
   informed of classic signs of aggression, in particular in elephants,
   which will allow timely avoidance measures to be taken. The
   risk-enhancing effect of excessive alcohol intake is undesirable in the
   game reserve setting, as is driving at high speed after dusk in areas
   where hippos graze. Local advice on personal safety in wildlife reserves
   and the credentials of trail guides should be obtained from lodge or
   reserve management, tourism authorities or the travel industry prior to
   travel to game reserves.}},

Abstract = {{Ghost crabs (Ocypode quadrata) have been implicated in mortality of eggs
   and chicks of the beach-nesting Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) whose
   Atlantic Coast populations are listed as threatened. Through observation
   and experimentation, we investigated the interactions between ghost
   crabs and plovers on Wild Beach, a Piping Plover nesting area on
   Assateague Island, Virginia. This site has a high abundance of ghost
   crabs and historically low hedging success compared to adjacent areas
   with fewer crabs. We observed encounters of crabs with plover eggs,
   chicks, and adults in the field, but never predation. In staged
   encounters of crabs with eggs and chicks (using hatchery reared quail as
   plover surrogates), we were unable to elicit predatory behavior either
   on the beach or in the lab. We conclude that although instances of ghost
   crab predation on Piping Plover eggs and chicks occur, they are rare and
   cannot account for the high mortality frequently reported on beaches
   where ghost crabs are abundant. Adult plovers behave toward crabs as if
   they were dangerous to eggs and chicks, and their young broods in the
   study area did not forage along the foreshore. Hence, ghost crabs may
   increase mortality indirectly. Frequent responding to crabs by parents
   may attract more deadly brood predators. Brood nutrition may suffer as
   adult plovers direct chicks away from areas where forage is reportedly
   richer but crabs are abundant, such as the foreshore. Nutrient intake
   may be further reduced on more southerly breeding grounds where high
   temperatures on backshores force chicks to stop foraging and take
   shelter during mid-day. Although high mortality cannot be attributed
   directly to predation by crabs, it may be due to factors that covary
   with crab abundance, such as high temperature, behavioral responses of
   adult birds, and poor forage.}},

Abstract = {{The size of an individual is a key feature influencing and determined by
   a species' life history and ecology. Here, I consider how life-history
   plasticity within a single species can influence the outcome of food web
   interactions along a productivity gradient. An individual can either
   reproduce early but remain susceptible to predators throughout its life
   (strategy 1) or delay reproduction and grow to a predator-invulnerable
   size refuge (strategy 2). At low productivity, strategy 1 is favored
   because the probability of growing to a size refuge is low compared to
   the probability of being eaten. Here, the system is consumer controlled,
   and predators have large effects on the food web. At high productivity,
   strategy 2 is favored because high food availability increases the
   probability of prey attaining size refuge before being eaten.
   Consequently, the system becomes less consumer controlled, and predators
   have weaker effects on food web dynamics. At intermediate productivity,
   either strategy 1 or strategy 2 can be favored, depending on the initial
   conditions of the system. Field and laboratory experiments with a common

   transgenic salmon bred to contain and transmit a growth hormone

   Atlantic salmon, we directly tested the hypothesis that relative growth
   rates should be correlated with willingness to risk exposure to a
   predator. We used size-matched transgenic and control salmon in two
   experiments where these fish could either feed in safety, or in the
   presence of the predator. The first experiment constrained the predator
   behind a Plexiglas partition (no risk of mortality), the second required
   the fish to feed in the same compartment as the predator (a fintie risk
   df mortality). During these experiments, transgenic salmon had rates of
   consumption that were approximately five times that of the control fish
   and rates of movement approximately double that of controls. Transgenic
   salmon also spent significantly more time feeding in the presence of the
   predator, and-consumed absolutely more food at that location. When there
   was a real risk of mortality, control fish almost completely avoided the
   dangerous location. Transgenic-fish continued to feed at this location,

   position significantly further from the substratum, and were on average
   closer to the river bank, than salmon. The vertical segregation of young

   the bottom. This size-dependent segregation is probably a result of
   different outcomes of the trade-off between the conflicting interests of
   higher food availability and greater predation risk in the upper part of
   the water column. We suggest that intercohort predation and competitive

   of food supply on both ranging behaviour and mass gain. I measured
   change in winter mass and amount of food eaten in conjunction with the
   distance that blackbirds travelled to a randomly sited mobile feeder.
   Blackbirds that travelled shorter distances (per trip and in total) and
   less often to the feeder had the highest mass midwinter relative to
   their spring mass. Blackbirds with a higher mean mass midwinter also
   travelled, on average, shorter distances to the feeder. The distance an
   individual blackbird travelled to the feeder at any one time was
   probably independent of the state of its daily energy reserves (how much
   of its daily total mass gain it had achieved at that point). The
   relationship between distance travelled and mass was probably
   independent of food supply because distances actually increased at the
   end of the winter and the amount of food eaten per individual changed
   little. More mobile blackbirds were therefore likely to have compensated
   for any increases in predation risk associated with their greater ranges
   by decreasing winter mass gain, but will have had an increased risk of
   starvation because of their lower mass. (C) 1999 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Complications of bone marrow transplantation can compromise its

   greatest risk. In a previous study we reported that certain
   psychological factors correlated with a high incidence of
   post-transplant mortality, and here we analyze the associated
   complications and causes of death. Prior to receiving high-dose
   chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation, 112 patients underwent a
   psychodynamically oriented psychiatric assessment (the `FIT'
   assessment). Mortality and associated complications were ascertained by
   a retrospective chart review. The results of the `FIT' assessment
   correlated with the incidence of complications and death, whether or not
   the transplant was performed for hematologic or solid organ cancers, or
   was from an allogeneic or autologous source, Most individuals with a
   high risk profile died of progressive major organ dysfunction or
   recurrent/refractory neoplastic disease in the first year after
   transplant. We propose that such a psychiatric assessment might identify
   a subgroup of individuals in whom pre-emptive therapeutic interventions

Abstract = {{Food-restricted rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss maintained a lower

   satiated and food-restricted fish were positioned lower in the tank
   after the predator attack. Heart rate increased more during feeding in
   the food-restricted fish compared to the satiated, but energy status had
   no general effect on the relation between heart rate and behaviour.
   Hence, the increase in heart rate was mainly a response to the more
   active foraging behaviour in the food-restricted fish. Moreover,
   behavioural activity in the food-restricted fish was associated with a
   higher heart rate after the predator attack than when the fish was
   undisturbed, which may reflect physiological preparation for flight.

   food arriving later in the day led to higher intake levels.}},

Abstract = {{It is now widely accepted that obesity develops by way of genetic
   mechanisms conferring specific dispositions which interact with strong
   environmental pressures. It is also accepted that certain dispositions
   constitute metabolic risk factors for weight gain. It is less well
   accepted that certain patterns of behaviour (arising from biological
   demands or environmental influences) put individuals at risk of
   developing a positive energy balance and weight gain (behavioural risk
   factors). Relevant patterns of behaviour include long-lasting habits for
   selecting and eating particular types of foods. Such habits define two
   distinct groups characterized as high-fat (HF) and low-fat (LF)
   phenotypes. These habits are important because of the attention given to
   dietary macronutrients in body-weight gain and the worldwide epidemic of
   obesity. Considerable evidence indicates that the total amount of
   dietary fat consumed remains the most potent food-related risk factor
   for weight gain. However, although habitual intake of a high-fat diet is
   a behavioural risk factor for obesity, it does not constitute a
   biological inevitability. A habitual low-fat diet does seem to protect
   against the development of obesity, but a high-fat diet does not
   guarantee that an individual will be obese. Although obesity is much
   more prevalent among KF than LF, some HF are lean with BMI well within
   the normal range. The concept of `different routes to obesity' through a
   variety of nutritional scenarios can be envisaged, with predisposed
   individuals varying in their susceptibility to different dietary inputs.
   In a particular subgroup of individuals (young adult males) HF and LF
   displayed quite different profiles of appetite control, response to
   nutrient challenges and physiological measures, including BMR, RQ, heart
   rate, plasma leptin levels and thermogenic responses to fat and
   carbohydrate meals. These striking differences suggest that HF and LF
   can be used as a conceptual tool to investigate the relationship between
   biology and the environment (diet) in the control of body weight.}},

   General activity was very high on entry to the lairage pen. Drinking and

Abstract = {{Honest sexual signalling requires that the level of advertisement
   reveals mate quality. In the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus
   aculeatus, females base their mate choice mainly on the intensity of the
   males' red breeding coloration. Different results have, however, been
   obtained on the relationship between red breeding coloration and
   physical condition. In this study, the relationship was curvilinear in a
   natural population, with males in good and poor condition (measured as
   lipid content) having larger red areas than males of intermediate
   condition. By manipulating food intake and thus male condition prior to
   breeding, I further show that poor condition can induce an increase in
   signalling effort. This effect was further strengthened when the
   predation cost of signalling was increased by exposing the males to
   predators. This suggests that the reason for the high signalling effort
   of males in poor condition is their low probability of future
   reproduction and thus lower cost of signalling in terms of loss of
   future reproductive opportunities. Males in poor condition signal as a
   terminal effort and take larger risks and invest more in current
   reproduction than males in good condition. Finally, I discuss whether an
   effect of decreasing residual reproductive value on signalling effort
   could result in the breakdown of the honesty of the signal. (C) 1999 The

Volume = {{65}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The process of domestication involves adaptation, usually to a captive
   environment. Domestication is attained by some combination of genetic
   changes occurring over generations and developmental mechanisms (e.g.,
   physical maturation, learning) triggered by recurring environmental
   events or management practices in captivity that influence specific
   biological traits. The transition from free-living to captive status is
   often accompanied by changes in availability and/or accessibility of
   shelter, space, food and water, and by changes in predation and the
   social environment. These changes set the stage for the development of
   the domestic phenotype. Behavioral development in animals undergoing
   domestication is characterized by changes in the quantitative rather
   than qualitative nature of responses. The hypothesized loss of certain
   behavior patterns under domestication can usually be explained by the
   heightening of response thresholds. Increases in response frequency
   accompanying domestication can often be explained by atypical rates of
   exposure to certain forms of perceptual and locomotor stimulation.
   Genetic changes influencing the development of the domestic phenotype
   result from inbreeding, genetic drift, artificial selection, natural
   selection in captivity, and relaxed selection. Experiential
   contributions to the domestic phenotype include the presence or absence
   of key stimuli, changes in intraspecific aggressive interactions and
   interactions with humans. Man's role as a buffer between the animal and
   its environment is also believed to have an important effect on the
   development of the domestic phenotype. The domestication process has
   frequently reduced the sensitivity of animals to changes in their
   environment, perhaps the single-most important change accompanying
   domestication. It has also resulted in modified rates of behavioral and
   physical development. Interest in breeding animals in captivity for
   release in nature has flourished in recent decades. The capacity of
   domestic animals to survive and reproduce in nature may depend on the
   extent to which the gene pool of the population has been altered during
   the domestication process and flexibility in behavioral development.
   ``Natural{''} gene pools should be protected when breeding wild animals
   in captivity for the purpose of reestablishing free-living natural
   populations. In some cases, captive-reared animals must be conditioned
   to Live in nature prior to their release. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Food quality of ladybirds is known to influence the biological
   performances of the aphidophagous predators. Development (larval. and
   total durations, mortality) and reproduction of the beetle are modified
   by changes of both prey species and their relative host plants.
   Suitablity of many aphid species was already studied and was observed to
   induce lower consumption until complete rejection of preys by some
   aphidophagous predators. Even if polyphagous insects are considered,
   some aphid species provide only low quality food including sometimes
   toxic compounds.
   In response to low nutritional value or food limitation, many insects
   have evolved developmental plasticity in which larvae mature more
   rapidly, leading to smaller body size adult. Here we investigate the
   effect of food quality represented by aphid species on Adalia bipunctata
   reproduction after having relaxed the nutritive selection from adult
   emergence. Reciprocal crosses between emerging adults fed with
   Acyrthosiphon pisum (optimal diet) or Aphis fabae (unappreciated diet)
   demonstrated that negative effect of the latter aphid species was
   maternally inherited. Female fecundity (egg laying and egg numbers per
   female) and egg viability was observed for each cross and compared to a
   full A. fabae nutrition (for both male and female at larval and adult
   stages) and A. pisum references. This environmentally based maternal
   effect was directly linked to developmental parameters induced by larvae
   nutrition. Influence of aphid prey constitute an important change of
   predator environment which was discussed in relation to biological

Abstract = {{The field slug, Deroceras reticulatum, a common pest of agricultural and

   for particular food items. However, these preferences are not fixed, but
   are influenced by the recent dietary history of the slugs. In
   particular, slugs tend to select novel food items ('neophilia'). We
   investigated the basis of such influences, using artificial diets in
   which protein and carbohydrate composition could be controlled and
   non-nutritional ('secondary') chemicals added as flavours. The slugs
   showed no general inclination for neophilia based on taste alone. There
   was a possible learned association between protein content and taste,
   but this was weakly expressed. However, the slugs selected food items,
   when given a choice, containing nutrients that were deficient in earlier
   diets, even though all the food items contained the same familiar
   secondary taste chemicals. Injections of missing nutrients into the
   haemocoel of slugs inhibited such changes in food preference, indicating
   that slugs' feeding preferences are influenced directly by their

Abstract = {{Treatment for brain injury has focused on neuroprotection against brain
   edema, brain ischemia, and control of intracranial hypertension in
   animal studies. However, these concerts are not successful in the
   management of in severely brain-injured patients, because animal studies
   do not include information about the influence of the excess response of
   systemic circulatory-metabolic changes and hypothalamus-pituitary
   endocrine axis dysfunction caused by anesthesia. In our recent clinical
   studies of severe brain injury, the management of restoration therapy of
   dying neurons in injured brain tissue before neuroprotection therapy
   produced successful clinical results. Three major targets of treatment
   are important: Adequate administration of oxygen and metabolic
   substrates, control of excess release of vasopressin and growth hormone
   for prevention of blood-brain barrier dysfunction and cytokine
   encephalitis, and preclusion of selective neuronal radical damage of the
   dopamine A 10 nervous system for prevention of vegetation. Management of
   intensive care is focused on three subsequent targets: Initial care
   management is to maintain sufficient cerebral oxygenation and adequate
   brain metabolism by control of PaO2/FiO(2) above 300, systolic blood
   pressure above 100 mmHg, serum glucose at 120-140 mg/dl, brain
   temperature at 34 degrees-32 degrees C, ICP below 20 mmHg,
   antithrombin-III (AT-III) above 100\%, hemoglobin 2,3 diphosphoglycerate
   at 12-15 mmol/mL, serum pH above 7.3, oxygen delivery above 800 ml/min,
   and fluid resuscitation. The second target is control of
   hypothalamus-pituitary axis activation by management of brain tissue
   temperature at 34 degrees C with 120-140 mg/d serum glucose, 9\% saline
   followed by 4\% saline fluid resuscitation, AT-III above 100\% followed
   by replacement of albumin drip, and maintaining serum albumin higher
   than 3.5 g/dl within 2-3 h after injury. The third target is to prevent
   the selective neuronal damage of the dopamine A 10 nervous system by
   controlling brain tissue temperature at 32 degrees-33 degrees C with
   management of Hb above 11 g/dl and administration of vitamin E and C.
   However, in brain hypothermia treatment, there are five major pitfalls:
   hemoglobin dysfunction associated with masking brain hypoxia, inadequate
   management of brain tissue temperature with hyperglycemia, undesirable
   duration of brain hypothermia, inadequate care management of systemic
   infections, and misunderstanding of nutritional issues in the management
   of brain injury. These pitfalls are discussed in this chapter. A novel
   technique for control of these clinical issues, the success of adequate
   neuronal oxygenation and brain metabolism, neurohormonal control of the
   blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and preservation of the dopamine A 10
   nervous system are explained. Prevention of brain edema, elevation of
   ICP, and neuroexcitaion are not mechanisms of brain hypothermia. The
   effectiveness of brain hypothermia treatment was studied by comparing
   the clinical results of brain hypothermia (99 cases) and normothermia
   (65 cases) of head injury with Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) less than 6.
   Patients with initial GCS scores of 3 did not benefit from brain
   hypothermia treatment, but with GCS 4, 5, and 6, clinical benefit was
   observed. As clinical signs, memory, intelligence, and personality were
   not much disturbed in the brain hypothermia-treated group.}},

Abstract = {{Depth of burrowing in bivalves presents the individual with a trade-off:
   burrowing more deeply increases safety against predators hut shallow
   burrowing increases food intake. Large variation in burrowing depth
   exists both between and within species. This study investigated whether
   part of this variation in depth in the tellinid Macoma balthica can be
   attributed to phenotypic plasticity. A predatory crab and food
   availability were either offered or withheld in separate aquaria and the
   response in burrowing depth measured. Individuals burrowed more deeply
   in the presence of a crab but only to shallow depths in the presence of
   food. This suggests that individuals can assess their environment and
   subsequently make decisions on their burrowing depth.
   Phenotypic plasticity like this flexible anti-predation behaviour in M.
   balthica can have far-ranging effects. In the presence of predators
   burrowing depth increases. reducing energy uptake and subsequent growth
   and reproduction, whereas increased burrowing depths reduces mortality
   by predation, further affecting prey and predator population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Morphological adaptations of amphisbaenians to fossorial life may affect
   their anti-predator behaviour and escape decisions. Amphisbaenians
   exposed on the soil surface by a predator may decide to escape either by
   burrowing immediately or by using alternative defensive behaviours. This
   decision may depend on the internal state (body temperature and
   associated burrowing performance) but, because anti-predator behaviours
   may be costly, an optimal response should also be sensitive to risk and
   vary according to the threat of predator attack. In a laboratory
   experiment we simulated predatory attack on individual amphisbaenians of
   the species Blanus cinereus, and specifically examined the effects of
   temperature (warm vs, cold) and predation threat (low vs. high) on
   escape decisions. Amphisbaenians showed significantly longer episodes of
   an alternative anti-predator behaviour on the soil surface (coiling)
   when the predation threat was high and when the temperature was low. The
   time to burrow until half of the body was buried was significantly
   longer when the temperature was low and was significantly shorter when
   the threat was high. The variations observed in anti-predator behaviours
   may reflect the choice of the optimal response under each circumstance,

   the characteristics of the initial attack, and potential burrowing
   performance, which is dependent on body temperature.}},

Title = {{Interacting effects of predation risk and food availability on larval
   anuran behaviour and development}},
Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{497-505}},
Abstract = {{Age and size at metamorphosis are two important fitness components in
   species with complex life cycles. In anurans, metamorphic traits show
   remarkable phenotypic plasticity, especially in response to changes in
   growth conditions. It is also possible that the perception of risk
   directly determines changes in larval period and the size of metamorphs.
   This study examines how the perception of predation risk affects the
   timing of and size at metamorphosis in common frogs (Rana temporaria). I
   raised tadpoles at two risk levels (fish-conditioned water or
   unconditioned water) crossed with the availability or lack of food at
   night (all tadpoles had food available in the day). Tadpoles reacted to
   chemical cues from predatory fish by decreasing activity. A novel
   behavioural result was a predationXfood interaction effect on refuge
   use, which also accounted for most of the predator main effect:
   predation risk only caused increased refuge use in the night-starved
   treatment. Despite these behavioural modifications, the perception of
   predation risk did not affect growth rate and mass at metamorphosis in a
   simple way: the effects of food regime on growth and size at
   metamorphosis were dependent on the level of predation risk as revealed
   by significant predationXfood interaction effects. Tadpoles who had food
   withheld at night metamorphosed at the smallest size, suggesting a
   negative relationship between size at metamorphosis and refuge use.
   Tadpoles raised in fish-conditioned water had longer larval periods than
   those in unconditioned water, but these differences were significant
   only if food was available at night. These results conflict with the
   hypotheses that tadpoles should reduce their larval period or growth
   rates (and hence metamorphose at a smaller size) as the risk of
   predation increases. In contrast to predation risk, food availability
   strongly affected the length of the larval period: night-starved
   tadpoles metamorphosed relatively early with or without fish stimulus.
   Thus, early metamorphosis resulted from periods of low food
   availability, but not from a heightened ``perceived risk{''} of
   predation. This example counters the hypothesis of acceleration of the
   developmental rate (which shortens the time to metamorphosis) as a
   mechanism to escape a risky environment.}},

   between Ho scores and cardiovascular mortality. This study was
   undertaken to examine associations between hostility and cardiovascular
   risk factors representing the metabolic syndrome in 1081 older men who
   participated in the Normative Aging Study. Methods: Subjects included
   men who completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory in
   1986 and who participated in a subsequent laboratory examination within
   1 to 4 years. Total and subscale Ho scores were computed, and
   associations with anthropometric data, cigarette smoking, dietary
   information, serum lipids, blood pressure, and fasting glucose and
   insulin levels were examined. Results: The total Ho score was positively
   associated with waist/hip ratio, body mass index, total caloric intake,
   fasting insulin level, and serum triglycerides. The Ho score was
   inversely related to education and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
   concentration. Path analysis also suggested that the effects of
   hostility on insulin, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein
   cholesterol were mediated by its effects on body mass index and
   waist/hip ratio, which, in turn, exerted their effects on lipids and
   blood pressure through insulin. Conclusions: The results are consistent
   with those of prior research and also suggest that, in older men,
   hostility may be associated with a pattern of obesity, central
   adiposity, and insulin resistance, which can exert effects on blood
   pressure and serum lipids. Furthermore, effects of hostility on the
   metabolic syndrome appear to be mediated by body mass index and

Abstract = {{Body size affects survival probabilities, reproductive output and

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of seed size on patch use and diet selection for
   three co-existing Negev Desert granivores: Allenby's gerbil (Gerbillus
   allenbyi), greater Egyptian sand gerbil (Gerbillus pyramidum). and
   crested lark (Galerida cristata). We manipulated size and spatial
   distribution of seeds in experimental food patches and quantified
   foraging behavior by measuring giving-up densities (GUDs: the amount of
   food remaining in a resource patch following exploitation by a forager).
   In one experiment, we presented small (< 1.4 mm in diameter cracked
   wheat). medium (2.0-3.3 mm), and large (> 3.4 mm) seeds in separate
   trays; in a second, we presented small and medium seeds separately and
   mixed together. Gerbils had a higher handling lime efficiency on smaller
   seeds, but a much higher encounter probability on larger seeds (20 times
   higher on large than medium seeds, and 2-5 times higher on medium than
   small seeds). This led gerbils to have significantly lower GUDs on
   larger seeds than smaller seeds and to harvest a higher proportion of
   the larger seeds. When presented with rich and poor patches G. allenbyi
   tended to equalize GUDs in both patches, indicating a quitting harvest

   fixed time rule for patch exploitation. For larks, seed size did not
   influence encounter probabilities, and they showed no seed-size
   selectivity. Still, larks had higher handling efficiencies on smaller
   than larger seeds, and consequently had a significantly lower GUD on
   small than medium seeds. Despite large differences between the gerbils
   and larks in their foraging, our results do not support species
   coexistence via seed-size partitioning: the larks had much higher GUDs
   than the gerbils on all seed sizes. Nonetheless, seed size, seed
   abundance, seed distribution and the animal's patch use behavior all
   played major roles in determining gerbils' and larks' diet selectivities

Abstract = {{Variation in mean food availability, and in the variance around the

   work on the influence of environmental quality or growth rates on the

   syrphids should pupate (mature) when average food availability changes,

   The optimal strategy takes into account not only the availability of
   food, but also the timing of its availability. Food availability, when
   small, influences developmental time, but not weight at pupation. Food
   availability, when large, influences weight at pupation, but not
   developmental time. When the food supply is low, the optimal strategy
   adjusts the size at pupation downwards for stochastic as opposed to
   deterministic availability of food. The conclusions reinforce the need

Abstract = {{Juvenile thirteen-lined ground squirrels, Spermophilus tridecemlineatus,
   are less vigilant (i.e. they spend less time visually scanning the
   environment) than adults. To determine whether nutritional need was a
   potential cause of this difference, we supplemented two groups of
   free-ranging juveniles during the predispersal stage, while juveniles
   were still near and around the natal burrows. The high-energy food group
   (HEF: 11 squirrels) received peanut butter and oats while the low-energy
   food group (LEF: seven squirrels) received lettuce. Adults (14
   squirrels) were also supplemented, but due to their greater home range
   sizes, it was not feasible to classify them as either HEF or LEF. To
   evaluate the effect of supplementation on antipredator vigilance, the
   behavioural act of visually scanning for predators, we videotaped
   individuals while they were foraging above ground during 5-min
   observation periods. Each squirrel was observed and weighed during three
   time periods over 23 days. From the videotape, we extracted measures of
   time spent vigilant, locomoting and foraging. All three categories of
   squirrels gained mass over the study period, but the HEF juveniles
   rapidly exceeded that of the LEF juveniles. Early in the study, LEF and
   HEF juveniles did not significantly differ in either body mass or time
   budgets, and, initially, both juvenile groups were similar to adults in
   the amount of time devoted to vigilance. Later in the study, the
   behaviour of HEF juveniles closely resembled that of adults (increased
   time devoted to vigilance and decreased time devoted to foraging), while
   LEF juveniles decreased vigilance and increased their foraging time.
   This study indicates that for thirteen-lined ground squirrels the lower
   vigilance of juveniles is due, at least in part, to the greater
   nutritional needs of young animals with consequent increases in
   foraging, which is largely incompatible with vigilance. (C) 2000 The

Pages = {{593-601}},

Abstract = {{Wintering birds increase their fat reserves throughout the day, and
   impaired escape performance is often considered to be an important cost
   of fat reserves. Since lifting a larger mass requires more energy, if
   birds escape at maximum power output, an increase in mass will impair
   the escape flight. In this study we did not find support for
   mass-dependent escape performance for yellowhammers, Emberiza
   citrinella, and greenfinches, Carduelis chloris, with natural daily mass
   increases of 7-8\%. This suggests either that the birds were not
   performing at maximum output at dawn, when light, or that maximum power
   output was higher at dusk, when heavy. Either way the birds seemed to be
   able to put more effort into their escape flight when heavier. In both
   species, when alarmed, birds took off significantly faster and at a
   steeper angle than when not alarmed. Yellowhammers escaped at a higher
   speed and angle than greenfinches, and reacted faster to the predator
   model. This suggests that predator escape is more than just Newtonian
   physics, and may be influenced by behavioural, as well as morphological,
   adjustments. Different species may have evolved different responses to
   predation risk. Our results seem to be in disagreement with recent ideas
   about mass-dependent predation risk. However, to build up reserves,
   birds have to increase exposure time, which increases predation risk.
   This cost may be more important than impaired escape performance when
   relatively small, daily, changes in body mass are considered. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Zygiella x-notata is an orb-weaving spider that often renews its trap
   daily. Web building has associated costs and benefits, and building
   successive webs may have consequences for lifetime reproductive success.
   In the laboratory, we tested the ability of Z. x-notata to modify its
   building behaviour in response to various stages in predation (prey
   detection, capture and ingestion) experienced with a previous web. We
   determined which stages provided information for the spiders. Spiders
   that detected, captured and ingested prey and then rebuilt their web
   used less silk and made a smaller capture area than in the previous web.
   There was no effect of prey detection alone on the next web. Capture
   without feeding gave the same results as capture followed by feeding.
   The spiders that ate prey without detection and capture (feeding by
   hand) had the same energetic gains as spiders that caught prey but
   delayed building a new web. The spiders thus showed plasticity in
   web-building behaviour and in the amount of silk used (energetic
   investment) in the short term (from one web to the next). Changes in
   body condition may therefore influence web construction. Moreover,
   information gained during prey capture appeared to influence the size
   and structure of the next web. This ability should enable spiders to
   adapt their web building to maximize their fitness. (C) 2000 The

   Method: Body mass index (BMI) dietary intake, self-reported depressive
   symptoms, and eating disorder psychopathology (assessed with the Eating
   Disorder Examination - Questionnaire {[}EDE-Q]) were examined in women
   who had been diagnosed with breast cancer (n = 56) and the comparison
   group of women with no breast cancer history (n = 52). Multivariate
   regression analysis was used to identify factors independently
   associated with global and subscale EDE-Q scores and BMI. Results: BMI
   and depressive symptoms were significantly and independently associated
   with global and subscale EDE-Q scores in women at risk for breast cancer
   recurrence and rt omen with no breast cancer history. Dietary
   restriction was also significantly associated with EDE-Q scores in the
   group with no breast cancer history. Conclusions: An association among
   obesity, depressive symptomatology, and abnormal eating attitudes and
   behavior may affect response to standard nutritional interventions in
   women at risk for breast cancer recurrence. (C) 2000 by John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{1. We sought evidence for state-dependent behaviour and energy
   expenditure by manipulating the body-state of birds. We reviewed three
   hypotheses that could describe responses to a change in body-state: the
   Increased Effort; Reduced Effort; and Balanced Effort Hypotheses.
   2. Territorial European robins Erithacus rubecula L. were captured at
   dusk during winter, and chilled or warmed overnight to manipulate
   body-state.
   3. The robins were released onto their territories before dawn. Their
   subsequent behaviour was monitored by radio-tracking, and energy
   expenditure was measured using the doubly labelled water technique.
   4. Robins with high overnight energy expenditures (= `negative'
   body-state; chilled) were less likely to initiate vocal behaviour, and
   less likely to respond to the song or calls of conspecifics than those
   with low overnight expenditures (= `positive' body-state; warmed).
   5. Chilled birds moved around their territories at almost twice the rate
   of warmed birds, and had significantly higher daytime energy
   expenditures.
   6. We concluded that behaviour, including vocalizations and activity
   levels, and energy expenditures of robins, were sensitive to
   manipulations of body-state.
   7. These behaviours are interpreted as adaptive responses to restore
   condition, while minimizing the risk of mortality from predation and
   starvation. Our results were consistent with the Balanced Effort
   Hypothesis, entailing an increase in energy expenditure on foraging and
   a reduction in expenditure on non-maintenance activities.
   8. We suggest that inter-individual differences in body-state may be a
   key cause of previously unexplained variation in daily energy
   expenditure.}},

Abstract = {{In many amphibian larvae a suite of morphological and behavioural
   characters varies together in an induced defence against predators, but
   it remains unclear which features are functionally related to defence.
   We independently manipulated behaviour and morphology in tadpoles of
   Hyla versicolor and assessed their consequences for swimming performance
   and predator escape. Data on burst swimming showed that tadpoles which
   accelerated rapidly were elongate, with shallow bodies and tails.
   Predator escape was measured by exposing tadpoles to predators (larval
   Anax dragonflies or larval Ambystoma salamanders) and recording time
   until death. Tadpoles were first reared for 30 days in ponds containing
   either caged Anax or no predators; individuals responded to predators by
   developing large brightly coloured tails and short bodies. We placed
   tadpoles of both morphological phenotypes into plastic tubs, and
   manipulated their behaviour using food and chemical cues from predators.
   Mortality risk experienced by the predator-induced phenotype was about
   half that of the no-predator phenotype, and risk increased with time
   spent swimming. An interaction between morphology and behaviour arose
   because increasing activity caused higher risk for tadpoles with deep
   tail fins but not shallow tail fins.}},

Abstract = {{Hunger/satiation state interacts with appetitive and noxious stimuli to
   determine feeding and avoidance responses. In the predatory marine snail
   Pleurobranchaea californica, food chemostimuli induced proboscis
   extension and biting at concentration thresholds that varied directly
   with satiation state. However, food stimuli also tended to elicit
   avoidance behavior (withdrawal and avoidance turns) at concentration
   thresholds that were relatively low and fixed. When the feeding
   threshold for active feeding (proboscis extension with biting) was
   exceeded, ongoing avoidance and locomotion were interrupted and
   suppressed. Noxious chemostimuli usually stimulated avoidance, but, in
   animals with lower feeding thresholds for food stimuli, they often
   elicited feeding behavior. Thus, sensory pathways mediating appetitive
   and noxious stimuli may have dual access to neural networks of feeding
   and avoidance behavior, but their final effects are regulated by
   satiation state. These observations suggest that a simple cost-benefit
   computation regulates behavioral switching in the animal's foraging
   behavior, where food stimuli above or below the incentive level for
   feeding tend to induce feeding or avoidance, respectively. This decision
   mechanism can weigh the animal's need for nutrients against the
   potential risk from other predators and the cost of relative energy
   outlay in an attack on prey. Stimulation of orienting and attack by
   tow-revel noxious stimuli in the hungriest animals may reflect
   risk-taking that can enhance prey capture success. A simple, hedonically
   structured neural network model captures this computation.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) is a computational technique that
   has been used to model daily routines of foraging in small birds. A
   diurnal bird must build up its fat reserves towards dusk in order to
   avoid starvation during the night, when it cannot feed. However, as well
   as the benefits of avoiding starvation, storing fat imposes costs such
   as an increased predation risk and higher flight and metabolic costs.
   There is therefore an optimal level of fat reserves for a bird to reach
   at dusk in order to survive overnight without being left with excessive
   fat reserves at dawn. I tested a prediction common to all SDP models of
   daily foraging routines, that a bird will attempt to reach this level at
   dusk, regardless of its fat reserves the previous dawn. I provided
   supplementary food to manipulate the fat reserves at dawn of free-living
   European robins, Erithacus rubecula. Diurnal changes in body mass (a
   reliable estimate of fat reserves! were then monitored remotely. Robins
   provided with an ad libitum food supply reached almost exactly the same

Abstract = {{To begin identifying what behavioral details might be needed to

   dynamic optimization to calculate the optimal trade-off for four models
   of prey behaviorally responding to predation risk. We consider a fixed
   behavior model in which prey use constant levels of foraging effort and
   three flexible behavior models in which prey change their foraging
   effort according to their physiological state and their perceived level
   of predation risk. Flexible behavior was destabilizing at the community
   level as evidenced by higher predator-prey oscillations and lower
   community persistence times. The mechanisms by which prey estimated
   predation risk also affected community stability. We found that
   community dynamics resulting from prey with flexible behavior and fixed
   perception of risk approximated community dynamics resulting from prey
   with flexible behavior and perfect information about predation risk,
   however neither approximated the community dynamics resulting from prey

Abstract = {{The swimming behaviour of adult Daphnia largely governs their depth,
   which has a direct effect on both individual foraging success and
   predation avoidance. We treated individual swimming behaviour as a
   threshold character and used directional changes in average clonal depth
   within experimental tubes as a test for character plasticity. We
   compared the swimming behaviours of two cohabiting, phenotypically
   similar Daphnia (Daphnia galeata and Daphnia galeata-Daphnia rosea
   hybrid) to determine (1) whether there is inherited variation (H-2) for
   different traits (responses to hunger and predator cues); (2) whether
   changes in genetic parameters (norm of reaction and character state)
   across four environments could be simulated by combinations of the
   presence or absence of a predator cue and high or low hunger levels; and
   (3) whether these Daphnia would respond to directional selection,
   particularly in a trade-off environment thigh hunger and predator cue
   treatments). Responses of both D. galeata and the D. galeata- rosea
   hybrid to hunger and a predator cue and the trade-off environment were
   plastic. Daphnia galeata expressed significant genetic variation within
   (H-2) and between environments (heritability of plasticity): Both the
   character state and norm of reaction estimates of heritable variation in
   the hybrid were close to zero. Genetic correlations were positive and
   stable across six environmental pairs in Daphnia galeata. Most hybrid
   genetic correlations were not significant. The phenotypic distributions
   of both D. galeata and the hybrid were bimodal in the trade-off
   environment. The D. galeata distribution was partly due to between-clone
   variation and the hybrid distribution was almost entirely due to
   within-clone variation. Genetic variation expressed by D. galeata in the
   trade-off environment appears to depend on both clone by environment
   interactions and stable inherited differences. These results indicate
   that while plastic phenotypic responses cause a similar opportunity for
   selection in D. galeata and the hybrid, their responses to selection
   would be different in;the trade-off and in related environments. (C)

Abstract = {{The rate at which parents deliver energy to their brood is an important
   factor in avian reproduction because poor condition caused by
   malnutrition may reduce the offspring's survival to breeding. Models of
   central place foraging predict that nesting parents should optimize
   their prey delivery rate by minimizing travelling distances and by
   selecting patches where the gain per unit cost is high. I investigated
   the allocation of searching time amongst food patches in the home ranges
   of breeding great tits, Pants major, and blue tits P. caeruleus, by
   radiotracking. The density of locations in individual trees was
   positively correlated with prey biomass within trees and negatively with
   the distance of the trees from the nest. These two factors explained
   52\% of the variance in the allocation of the birds' search time. In
   rich patches, food was reduced considerably within 20 m of the nests;
   and the birds' travelling distances increased significantly during the
   nestling period. In parallel to foraging selectively in rich resources
   near the nest, the birds continually sampled the trees in their
   territory. The average surplus search time due to resource exploration
   was 1.52 times (range 1.25-1.99) the expected search time if the birds
   had exclusively used the most profitable patch. Despite considerable
   effort in patch sampling, the overall search time per unit prey was 30\%
   better than expected by an equal use of trees. The results suggest that

Abstract = {{Sex-specific predation on adult individuals is often predicted by
   different behaviour in males and females resulting from different
   reproductive strategies and social systems. High predation pressure and
   the need for biparental care are considered a possible ecological basis
   for the evolution of monogamy, the most puzzling social system in
   mammals. In species where adults and offspring are vulnerable to the
   same predators, males and females-may protect their offspring to
   different extents because of conflicting demands of investment in
   current and future offspring. I present the first empirical data on age-
   and sex-specific predation pressure by top predators on a monogamous
   rodent and the sex-specific behavioural responses of the prey species to
   different rates of predation. During an annual predation peak, only
   offspring and adult males were killed but no females. Whereas males and
   females travelled similar distances at night before the period of high
   predation on offspring, males moved further during this period. At the
   same time, males and females increased their distance from their
   offspring but males stayed closer to them than females. As a
   consequence, the distance between the members of the pair increased
   during the predation peak. The males' behaviour could lead to their
   encountering predators more frequently which would reduce survival
   prospects. The different behaviour of males and females provides
   empirical evidence that males invest in the welfare of current offspring
   at the cost of higher predation risk whereas females protect their
   residual reproductive value. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of

Number = {{6}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The question of whether caloric restriction (CR) is hermetic is
   addressed in terms of two common definitions of the term. In terms of
   the older definition, i.e., a growth-stimulatory effect when lower doses
   of a compound which resulted in growth inhibition at higher doses, CR is
   better characterized as a co-hormetic (i.e., a paradigm which at
   relatively ``low doses,{''} in combination with some stimulus, will
   evince increased growth (proliferation) and at higher ``doses{''} will
   inhibit this increased proliferation) rather than a hermetic agent.
   Mechanisms such as cellular selection of cellular subpopulations,
   increases in receptor efficiency, and preservation of cellular
   proliferative potential can interact with agents and produce increased
   growth as long as the CR is not too severe.
   In terms of a broader definition, i.e., nonmonotonic dose-response
   behavior of a compound for any adverse response, CR appears to be
   hermetic, both as a result of body weight (BW) loss and other potential
   mechanisms. The impact of changes in BW, or frank CR, can be considered
   a component of every test for hormesis, and is thus capable for
   interaction with any other agent. The changes that BW loss (or CR)
   induce are so profound that any aspect of an agent's action -
   metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics - can modulate the
   response of an organism to an agent. Similarly, other effects of a
   chemical that induce BW loss, e.g., physical activity or temperature
   dysregulation, can also induce dose-response curves that appear
   hermetic. The interaction of the hermetic agents of BW loss and CR can
   influence agent tests.
   Controlling these factors may make it possible to dissect the key
   components of a hermetic response. In addition, the effects of CR or BW
   loss appear to extrapolate well across species {[}Colman R, Kemnitz JW.
   Aging experiments using nonhuman primates. In: Yu BP (Ed), Methods in
   Aging Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1999, pp. 249-267]. Thus
   there is some reason to believe that these hermetic factors may be
   important for humans, and may already be a factor for tests of adverse
   agents already conducted in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Damage by herbivorous spider mites induces plants to produce volatiles
   that attract predatory mites that consume the spider mites. A clear
   attraction to volatiles from Lima bean plants infested with the spider
   mite Tetranychus urticae has been consistently reported during more than
   15 years for the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis. We have
   monitored the response to volatiles from spider-mite infested Lima bran
   plants for a laboratory population of the predatory mite from 1991 to
   1995 on a regular basis. A reduction in the level of attraction in the
   laboratory population of P. persimilis was recorded in mid-1992. The
   attraction of the laboratory population was weaker than that of a
   commercial population in the latter part of 1992, but the responses of
   these two populations were similarly weak in 1994 and 1995. Therefore, a
   behavioral change has also occurred in this commercial population.
   Experiments were carried out to address the potential causes of this
   change in attraction. The attraction of predators from a commercial
   population with a strong response decreased after being reared in our
   laboratory. Within a predator population with a low degree of
   attraction, strongly responding predators were present and they could be
   isolated on the basis of their behavior: predators that stayed on
   spider-mite infested plants in the rearing set-up had a strong
   attraction, while predators that had dispersed from the rearing set-up
   were not attracted to prey-infested bean plants. From our laboratory
   population with a low degree of attraction, isofemale lines were
   initiated and maintained for more than 20 generations. All isofemale
   lines exhibited a consistently strong attraction to spider mite-induced
   plant volatiles, similar to the attraction recorded for several
   populations in the past 15 years. Neither in a population with a strong
   attraction nor in two with a weak attraction was the response of the
   predators affected by a starvation period of 1-3 hr. Based on these
   results, possible causes for the observed reduction in predator
   attraction to spider mite-induced bran volatiles are discussed. The
   predatory mite P. persimilis is a cornerstone of biological control in
   many crops worldwide. Therefore. the change in foraging behavior
   recorded in this predator may have serious consequences for biological
   control of spider mites.}},

Abstract = {{An individual-based model of copepod behavioral responses to vertically
   patchy food was developed. It was hypothesized that a decrease in step
   length inversely proportional to the concentration of food
   (area-restricted search) would result in aggregation of the copepods
   within food patches, and a high value of food eaten/distance traveled.
   The performance of the copepods using the step-length reduction behavior
   was compared with two control behaviors. Copepods were allowed to forage
   through simulated distributions, and other distributions based on a
   high-resolution, field-sampled, vertical profile of fluorescence. The
   step-length reduction behavior led to higher values of food
   eaten/distance traveled, due to a significant portion (>30\% at times)
   of the population that did extremely well compared with the others, in
   both the theoretical and real field-sampled distributions. The
   step-length reduction behavior also led to higher spatial correlation
   between the food and the copepods. This strategy should allow some
   copepods to bypass local food maxima, where they might not meet their
   daily feeding requirements, and reach the area of highest food
   concentration within the water column. Copepods foraging within
   smoothed,versions of the field profiles received little benefit from the

   mixed-sex groups, made up of food-deprived and nonfood-deprived adults

   2). In these diffusions, knowledge of a route to a feeder could spread

   carrot pieces for the next 20 min. Previous research had shown a
   correlation between the rate of food transfer in both directions across
   female-female dyads. The present study confirmed this result.
   Reciprocity across dyads can be explained, however, by symmetry in
   affiliative and tolerant tendencies between two individuals, provided
   these tendencies determine food sharing. The present study was designed
   to exclude this symmetry-based explanation by testing each pair (N=16)
   of adult females on six separate occasions. There existed a significant
   covariation across tests of sharing in both dyadic directions, a result
   unexplained by relationship symmetry. Moreover, control procedures (i.e.
   testing of a food possessor without a partner, or testing of two
   individuals with the same food or two different foods at the same time)
   indicated that behaviour during food trials is not fully explained by
   mutual attraction or aversion. The monkeys take the quality of their own
   and the partner's food into account, and possessors limit transfers of
   high-quality foods. Instead of a symmetry-based reciprocity explanation,
   a mediating role of memory is suggested, and a mirroring of social
   attitude between partners. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Life-history theory predicts that differences in reproductive effort and
   residual reproductive value among species should result in differences
   in the level of risk that parents are willing to tolerate to themselves
   versus their offspring. Specifically, highly fecund and shorter-lived
   species are expected to place greater value in current offspring than
   themselves, whereas less fecund and longer-lived species are expected to
   place greater value in their own survival and future breeding
   opportunities. Here, we test the prediction that parental investment
   decisions are correlated with life histories by comparing risk-taking
   behaviour in two species of nuthatch that differ in reproductive effort:
   the white-breasted nuthatch, Sitta carolinensis (more fecund, lower
   survival) and the red-breasted nuthatch, S. canadensis (less fecund,
   higher survival). We experimentally manipulated stage-specific predation
   risk by presenting models of an adult predator (hawk) and an egg
   predator (wren) and measured the willingness of males to feed incubating
   females on the nest. We found that both species of nuthatch responded to
   predators by increasing the length of time between visits and aborting
   more visits to the nest. However, as predicted by their life histories,
   S. carolinensis displayed a significantly stronger response to the egg
   predator, whereas S. canadensis responded more strongly to the adult
   predator. Thus, species can differ in their willingness to tolerate risk
   to themselves and their young, and such differences appear to be related
   to differences in investment in current reproduction and the probability
   of future survival. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Most herbivorous arthropods are specialists that feed on one or a few
   related plant species. To understand why this is so, both mechanistic
   and functional studies have been carried out, predominantly restricted
   to bitrophic aspects. Host-selection behaviour of herbivorous arthropods
   has been intensively studied and this has provided ample evidence for
   the role of secondary plant chemicals as source of information in
   behavioural decisions of herbivores. Many evolutionary studies have
   regarded co-evolution between plants and herbivores to explain the
   diversity of secondary plant chemicals and host specialisation of
   herbivores. However, many cases remain unexplained where: herbivores
   select host plants that are suboptimal in terms of fitness returns. A
   stimulating paper by Bernays and Graham {[}(1988) Ecology 69, 886-892)]
   has initiated a discussion on the need of a multitrophic perspective to
   understand the evolution of host-plant specialisation by herbivorous
   arthropods. However, this has hardly resulted in ecological studies on
   host-selection behaviour that take a multitrophic perspective. Yet,
   evidence is accumulating that constitutive and induced infochemicals
   from natural enemies and competitors can affect herbivore behaviour.
   These cues may constitute important information on fitness prospects,
   just as plant cues can do. In this paper I selectively review how
   information from organisms at different trophic levels varies in space
   and time and how herbivores can integratively exploit this information
   during host selection. In doing so, research areas are identified that
   are likely to provide important new insights to explain several of the
   questions in herbivore host selection that remain unanswered so far.
   These research areas are at the interface of evolutionary ecology,
   behavioural ecology and chemical ecology. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{1. Daphnia magna reproduced at a smaller size (body mass) when exposed

   2. The total egg mass for first reproduction was the same in both

   11\% higher in daphniids exposed to fish-kairomone. This difference was
   about the same for low and high food concentrations (0.5 or 1.5 mgC
   l(-1)).
   3. Although egg mass was the same, triglyceride (TAG) content of the egg
   material was significantly lower when daphniids were exposed to
   fish-kairomones for both food concentrations.
   4. The TAG content of the clutch was lowered to the extent that the TAG
   proportion in the clutch in relation to the somatic mass of the animal
   was the same for animals treated with fish-kairomone and controls (5\%
   of body mass at first reproduction).
   5. The lower TAG content per clutch resulted in a lower quality of the
   individual egg in daphniids exposed to fish-kairomone. The resulting
   higher susceptibility to starvation under low food conditions is a
   substantial cost of the plastic response to fish-kairomones.
   6. This cost may set a limit on the plastic response in resource

Title = {{Predicting mortality in novel environments: tests and sensitivity of a

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{564-588}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. In order to assess the future impact of a proposed development or
   evaluate the cost effectiveness of proposed mitigating measures,
   ecologists must be able to provide accurate predictions under new
   environmental conditions. The difficulty with predicting to new
   circumstances is that often there is no way of knowing whether the
   empirical relationships upon which models are based will hold under the
   new conditions, and so predictions are of uncertain accuracy.
   2. We present a model, based on the optimality approach of behavioural
   ecology, that is designed to overcome this problem. The model's central
   assumption is that each individual within a population always behaves in
   order to maximize its fitness. The model follows the optimal decisions
   of each individual within a population and predicts population mortality
   rate from the survival consequences of these decisions. Such
   behaviour-based models should provide a reliable means of predicting to
   new circumstances because, even if conditions change greatly, the basis
   of predictions - fitness maximization - will not.
   3. The model was parameterized and tested for a shorebird, the
   oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus. Development aimed to minimize the
   difference between predicted and observed overwinter starvation rates of
   juveniles, immatures and adults during the model calibration years of
   1976-80. The model was tested by comparing its predicted starvation
   rates with the observed rates for another sample of years during
   1980-91, when the oystercatcher population was larger than in the model
   calibration years. It predicted the observed density-dependent increase
   in mortality rate in these years, outside the conditions for which it
   was parameterized.
   4. The predicted overwinter mortality rate was based on generally
   realistic behaviour of oystercatchers within the model population. The
   two submodels that predicted the interference-free intake rates and the
   numbers and densities of birds on the different mussel Mytilus edulis
   beds at low water did so with good precision. The model also predicted
   reasonably well (i) the stage of the winter at which the birds starved;
   (ii) the relative mass of birds using different feeding methods; (iii)
   the number of minutes birds spent feeding on mussels at low water during
   both the night and day; and (iv) the dates at which birds supplemented
   their low tide intake of mussels by also feeding on supplementary prey
   in fields while mussel beds were unavailable over the high water period.
   5. A sensitivity analysis showed that the model's predictive ability
   depended on virtually all of its parameters. However, the importance of
   different parameters varied considerably. In particular, variation in
   gross energetic parameters had a greater influence on predictions than
   variations in behavioural parameters. In accord with this, much of the
   model's predictive power was retained when a detailed foraging submodel
   was replaced with a simple functional response relating intake rate to
   mussel biomass. The behavioural parameters were not irrelevant, however,
   as these were the basis of predictions.
   6. Although we applied the model to oystercatchers, the general
   principle on which it is based applies widely. We list the key
   parameters that need to be measured in order to apply the model to other
   systems, estimate the time scales involved and describe the types of
   environmental changes that can be modelled. For example, in the case of
   estuaries, the model can be used to predict the impact of habitat loss,
   changes in the intensity or method of shellfishing, or changes in the
   frequency of human disturbance.
   7. We conclude that behaviour-based models provide a good basis for
   predicting how demographic parameters, and thus population size, would
   be affected by novel environments. The key reason for this is that, by
   being based on optimal decision rules, animals in these models are
   likely to respond to environmental changes in the same way as real ones
   would.}},

   influenced by grass height. In addition to grass height, other factors

   long term trends in group size changes are effected by food availability

Abstract = {{Animals commonly approach (i.e. `inspect') potential predators.
   Glowlight tetras, Hemigrammus erythrozonus, have previously been shown
   to inspect the combined chemical and visual cues originating from novel
   predators and to modify their inspection (approach) behaviour depending
   upon the predator's diet. We conducted two experiments to determine
   whether tetras would inspect the chemical cues of injured prey or the
   dietary cues of a novel predator in the absence of any visual cues.
   Shoals of glowlight tetras were exposed to either distilled water
   (control) or the skin extract of swordtail (lacking ostariophysan alarm
   pheromones) or the skin extract of tetra (with alarm pheromones). There
   was no significant difference in the frequency of predator inspection
   behaviour towards swordtail or tetra skin extract compared to the
   distilled water controls. In the second experiment, we exposed shoals of
   tetras to either distilled water or the odour of Jack Dempsey cichlids,
   Cichlasoma octofasciatum, which had been food deprived, or fed a diet of
   swordtails or tetras. There was no significant difference in the
   frequency of predator inspection behaviour towards the odour of the
   starved cichlids and the odour of the fed cichlids in either of the two
   diet treatments. However, when tetras were exposed to the odour of
   cichlids fed tetras, they took significantly longer to initiate an
   inspection visit, remained further from the source of the chemical cues
   and inspected in smaller groups, compared with the odour of a starved
   cichlid or a cichlid fed swordtails. These data strongly suggest that
   tetras will inspect chemical cues alone, but only if the cue contains

Abstract = {{Despite warning labels and increases in evidence of the adverse effects

   Cigarette smoking has been linked to increased prenatal mortality,
   increased incidence of SIDS, reductions in birth weight, and disruptions

   established the causal relationship between nicotine and adverse
   developmental outcome. The present study examines the behavioral effects
   of nicotine exposure in the rat during the third trimester equivalent of
   the human brain growth spurt, a period of rapid development of the
   cholinergic systems and a period during which the CNS is particularly
   vulnerable to a number of insults. Sprague-Dawley rat pups were exposed
   to nicotine (6.0 mg/kg/day) from postnatal days (PD) 4-9 via an
   artificial rearing procedure. This procedure ensures that observed
   effects are not due to nutritional deficits. Two control groups were

   control group. Activity level was measured on PD 18-19. Nicotine-exposed
   subjects were significantly overactive compared to both control groups,
   which did not differ significantly from one another. This behavioral
   alteration was observed in the absence of nicotine-induced body weight

Abstract = {{Subordinates often have to wait for dominants to obtain food. As a
   result, their foraging success should be less predictable and they
   should therefore maintain a higher level of energy reserves compared
   with dominants. A corollary of this prediction is that subordinates
   should gain mass earlier in the day and maintain higher mass than
   dominants. We tested these predictions with captive Carolina chickadees.
   In two different experiments tone where birds were given ad libitum
   access to food and the other with food access limited to 60 min/day), we
   formed social flocks of two previously unfamiliar birds and compared
   their energy management (body fat and food caches) while they were in
   the flock with energy management when housed alone. Results from both
   experiments failed to support the predictions. Of all the parameters of
   body mass and food caching we measured only the following results were
   significant: (1) On the ad libitum food schedule, both subordinates and
   dominants accumulated more mass over the day when in a flock compared
   with when they were solitary, and there were no differences in mass gain
   between dominants and subordinates. (2) When analysed separately,
   dominants showed a higher evening mass in the flock compared with the
   solitary condition, a trend that runs opposite to the prediction. Our
   results suggest that when in favourable foraging conditions, social
   interactions might cause dominant and subordinate birds to accumulate
   more energy reserves as a result of competition. On the other hand, if
   food supply is limited, both dominants and subordinates may be forced to
   maintain similar fat reserves as an insurance against increased risk of

Abstract = {{Predators may control the impact of herbivores on their plant resources

   effects of a predator and auditory cues indicating its presence on the
   rare of tree seedling (Acer rubrum, Betula lenta) consumption bq meadow
   voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus). The first of our experiments involved
   introduction of a stoat (Microtus pennsylvanicus) into an enclosed vole
   population and the second a playback of recordings of vole distress
   calls, movements of a stoat and its. vocalizations. In both experiments
   we manipulated vegetation cover and the availability of Food next to the
   experimental seedlings to assess the effects of microhabitat under the
   different risk situations. The results of the first unreplicated
   experiment suggested an increased rate of seedling predation in the
   presence of the stoat. Consistent with these results, the playback of
   predator sounds in the second replicated experiment caused an increased
   rate of seedling predation compared to control plots with no recordings.
   A mon ed circle around a seedling station, representing increased risk
   of predation on the voles. decreased seedling consumption. This effect
   was modest in the playback treatment. We suggest the results to be due
   to displacement behavior by time voles exposed to prolonged risk and
   conflicting demands of foraging and avoiding predators. Alternatively.
   as suggested by the model of Lima and Bednekoff, prolonged risk of
   predation forced the voles to decrease their levels of vigilance during
   low-risk playback breaks. The modest inhibitory effect of cover removal
   on seedling predation in time playback treatment is consistent with this
   interpretation. The results confirm recent evidence for trophic cascades
   mediated by behavioral interactions between predator and prey. They are
   novel in suggesting that the presence of predation risk can increase the
   inhibitory effects of consumers on their resources.}},

Abstract = {{It is expected that through flexibility in behaviour, flock living birds
   respond to the asymmetries in resource access derived from dominance
   relationships. We analysed the microhabitat use of willow tits in winter
   flocks and assessed possible factors which shape habitat segregation
   between adults and juveniles in different temperature regimes. When
   foraging in mild conditions (ambient temperature > 0 degreesC), flocks
   split up into subgroups with adults foraging in inner parts of trees
   more often than juveniles. However, no differences were recorded in the
   vertical position occupied in trees. In harsh conditions (< -
   4<degrees>C), flocks re-united and juveniles further moved to outer
   parts of trees, increasing horizontal segregation between age classes.
   In mild conditions, vigilance behaviour was not related to the position
   of birds in trees, but in harsh conditions, scanning frequency was
   higher in outer parts of trees only for adults. In mild weather,
   juvenile position in trees was associated with body size and mass. The
   foraging microhabitat segregation detected in harsh conditions fits the
   age-related hoarding distribution previously described in the same
   population. This supports the hypothesis that hoarded food is important
   in determining future foraging habitat use. Adult preference and
   intraspecific competition for safer or richer inner parts of trees as
   foraging sites during harsh conditions seems to determine the habitat
   segregation between adults and juveniles. Furthermore, we suggest that
   in mild weather, when foraging in the absence of adults, juveniles
   balance the costs of using a potentially dangerous microhabitat with the
   benefits of building energetically cheap and large food reserves through
   hoarding. The expected patterns of microhabitat segregation may differ
   in parids, depending on whether predation risk or other factors such as
   food availability are the main factors controlling habitat quality.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. The attention deficit syndrome is one of the commonest
   behavior disorders of infancy, although it is considerably
   underestimated. Development. The aetiology of attention deficit syndrome
   is multifactorial since genetic, environmental nutritional and
   psychosocial factors have been found to be associated with its
   development. Diagnosis depends mainly on the identification of behavior
   changes especially of inattention, impulsiveness and hyperactivity: it
   should be made at home and at school and based on the exclusion of
   severe organic and neurological disorders which also present initially
   with similar characteristics. Electrophysiological studies may be useful
   since multiple electroencephalographic changes have been reported, as
   have prolonged latency of III and V waves of brain stem evoked
   potentials. The best management requires educational therapy combined
   with controlled medical treatment. Use of stimulants should be carefully
   considered and the tricyclic drugs are preferably the first
   pharmacological option. Conclusions. Current findings regarding the
   repercussions of attention deficit syndrome in adults shows the need for
   early diagnosis and treatment of the condition so as to avoid severe
   personality disorders including antisocial and criminal behavior. It is
   essential that the parents and the child himself understand the

Abstract = {{Females of the shield bug Parastrachia japonensis Scott progressively
   provision nymph-containing nests with drupes of the host tree, Schoepfia
   jasminodora (Olicaceae: Rosidae: Santales). The majority of nests are
   5-15 m from the host tree, a distance thought to have been a major
   impetus for the occurrence of provisioning in this species. However, the
   function of provisioning is not well understood. We carried out two
   field experiments to determine whether provisioning is nutritionally
   important and whether it affords protection against predation.
   Development of nymphs was significantly delayed and their survival was
   low in the absence of provisioning, even when nests were within the area
   of ground on to which the drupes fell, apparently because of the poor
   quality of the majority of the drupes. Selective provisioning of
   good-quality drupes by female P. japonensis, a semelparous species, was
   thus necessary for young nymphs to obtain enough food for their
   development. Furthermore, even without a female in attendance, having
   drupes in the nest significantly reduced early mortality in the presence
   of a predator. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Gambusia hubbsi populations occur in a variety of fresh and
   brackish-water habitats on Andros, Bahamas. These include shallow water
   sites (tidal creeks, lakes, roadside ditches), and blueholes (vertical
   solution caves). In some blueholes G. hubbsi is the only species
   present, in others it co-occurs with other species, principal among
   these is a predator, Eleotris pisonis. By contrast to blueholes, shallow
   water sites have highly variable temperature and depth. In addition,
   they are frequented by avian piscivores and may be occasionally occupied
   by piscivores such as Eleotris. We sampled 10 shallow water sites, 14
   blueholes where Eleotris is absent and 12 blueholes where Eleotris
   co-occurs with G. hubbsi. We measured and compared variation in female
   body size, fecundity, and reproductive investment among these three
   habitats. The observed patterns of life history variation are only
   partially in accord with expectations from theory regarding the effects
   of predation and seasonality on life history variation. Samples from
   populations that colonized a series of man-made trenches (Well Fields),
   a set of introductions into that habitat, and changes in life history
   traits of lab-raised females from three blueholes, suggest that the

   reflects differences in food availability among habitats, and
   imperfectly reflects the potential phenotypic variability of this

Abstract = {{Abundantly fed Euplotes versatilis n. sp. undergo unequal fissions
   yielding opisthes definitely larger than proters and larger than

   become predatory or cannibalistic. Starvation induces the reversion to
   the small phenotype, by means of both unequal fissions yielding smaller
   opisths and physiological reorganizations. These size variations are
   associated with extensive variations of the dorsal argyrome pattern, the
   taxonomic value of which is therefore poor. The largest cells exhibit
   supernumerary ventral cirri and dorsal kineties.
   A somewhat similar phenotypic plasticity is known in E. balteatus and at
   a lesser degree in E. focardii. The latter shares with E. versatilis an
   uncommon asymmetrical mode of conjugation. The three species are assumed
   to be phylogenetically close and adapted to frequent and unpredictable
   variations of food availability.
   From a morphogenetical point of view, the occurrence of unequal cell
   fission in these species is assumed to be related to some genetically
   modified integration of cellular growth with the other components of the

Abstract = {{The begging displays used by altricial nestling birds to solicit care
   from parents include vigorous movements and loud calling. These begging
   signals have attracted considerable interest, mainly because their
   intensity seems excessive for the function of transmitting information
   about nestling need to parents. However, how information on need is
   encoded in the various components of the signal, especially its acoustic
   components, is poorly understood. We examined how begging calls of large
   and small nestling tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor, changed during a
   short period of food deprivation and cooling, as a first step in
   determining the role that various call characteristics played in
   advertising nestling need. In contrast to previous studies, we examined
   several call variables, and related them not only to need for food but
   also need for warmth. When nestlings were deprived of food, their calls
   increased in rate and length. Large nestlings also increased the
   amplitude of their calls. When nestlings were cooled during food
   deprivation, they decreased the frequency of their calls and their call
   rate. The latter trend was especially evident in small nestlings. Our
   results suggest that begging calls carry information not only on the
   overall hunger level of broods, as emphasized in previous studies, but
   also on the size, hunger and thermal need of individual nestlings.

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-28}},
Abstract = {{This review of sow welfare addresses all aspects of housing for adult
   female pigs, including the issue of piglet welfare during lactation. It
   puts the issue of sow welfare in perspective by briefly outlining
   different approaches to the scientific assessment of welfare, the
   `feelings, preference, nature, and the functional or homeostasis'
   approaches. We believe the last approach currently offers science the
   best assessment of welfare and is the approach that is utilised in this
   review. It involves comparing housing or husbandry systems and risks to
   welfare on the basis of relative changes in biological (behavioural and
   physiological) responses and corresponding decreases in fitness (growth
   rate, reproductive performance, or health/injury/immunology).
   The review discusses the following areas: (i) housing of individually
   housed pregnant pigs, with subsections on tethers, stalls, reproductive
   performance, exercise, and new stall designs; conventional, alternative,
   and outdoor group housing with subsections on aggression, electronic
   feeding stations, ecoshelters, and other alternative group housing
   designs; and other issues, such as lameness, culling, straw and other
   substrates, diet and hunger, quality of stockpeople, and housing around
   mating including oestrus detection and mating; and (ii) farrowing and
   lactating pigs with subsections on farrowing crates and alternative
   farrowing systems, stress around farrowing and during lactation,
   maternal behaviour and piglet survival, and sow and piglet injury and
   lameness.
   Conclusions and recommendations arising from the review include the need
   for public education to provide an informed consumer base that will
   result in some consensus on welfare issues among diverse interest groups
   and the need for industry education that results in better animal
   welfare and a sustainable industry. Some specific research
   recommendations include space allowance and the duration of housing for
   individually housed pigs, welfare issues of breeding sows in
   echoshelters, piglet mortality in alternative systems, aggression in
   conventional and large groups, bedding, and hunger.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing the risk of predation is an important feature of the feeding

   the colony. We investigated the response of Argentine ants, Linepithema
   humile, to different kinds of disturbance while workers foraged on food
   of differing quality. The behaviour of disturbed individuals was
   influenced by group size, by the behaviour of nearby nestmates and by
   how much food had already been consumed. When in large groups, workers
   were less likely to leave the foraging arena and resumed feeding more
   rapidly. This response was even more marked among workers whose gasters
   were only partially replete. However, individuals took more time to
   resume feeding and became more likely to run away from a food source
   when greater numbers of ants were disturbed. These influences may allow
   foraging groups to maximise food intake while minimising the mortality
   of workers.}},

Abstract = {{The provisioning parameters, breeding success, adult mass, and survival
   of yellow-nosed albatrosses were studied over 7 successive years at
   Amsterdam Island, southern Indian Ocean. We examined the ability of this
   long-lived seabird to adjust its breeding effort under different
   environmental conditions and the fitness consequences in terms of
   survival and quality of offspring produced. Provisioning rate and adult
   mass varied extensively between years, and the lo lowest and highest
   values were associated with sea surface temperature anomalies. When
   waters around the island were colder, adults were in good condition and
   brought large meals at short intervals, whereas warmer waters resulted
   in lower provisioning rates, lower adult mass, and lighter chicks at
   fledging. Adult survival and fledging success were not affected by sea
   surface temperature anomalies. Yellow-nosed albatrosses appear to be
   unable to adjust their breeding effort every season, and their
   differential breeding investment probably primarily reflects different
   levels of food availability. Yellow-nosed albatrosses are able to
   regulate their provisioning behavior according to the nutritional status
   of their chick only when conditions are favorable. Birds appear to
   invest primarily in their own future maintenance rather than in
   provisioning. They have a wide safety margin in body mass that limits
   mortality risks during good years as well as during poor years.
   Hoc-ever, during unfavorable seasons adults continue to provision chicks
   that have a poor prospect of survival to breeding, without additional
   survival costs for the parents. Favorable seasons therefore have a high
   value in terms of fitness because of the high quality of the chick
   produced. We suggest that understanding hew long-lived animals optimize
   their provisioning behavior and lifetime reproduction can only be
   achieved through studies encompassing several contrasted seasons.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{71-83}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{The Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) is the dominant paradigm in predicting
   patch use and numerous tests support its qualitative predictions.
   Quantitative tests under complex foraging situations could be expected
   to be more variable in their support because the MVT assumes behavior
   maximizes only net energy-intake rate. However across a survey of 26
   studies, foragers rather consistently ``erred{''} in staying too long in
   patches. Such a consistent direction to the errors suggests that the
   simplifying assumptions of the MVT introduce a systematic bias rather
   than just imprecision. Therefore, I simulated patch use as a
   state-dependent response to physiological state, travel cost, predation
   risk, prey densities, and fitness currencies other than net-rate
   maximization (e.g., maximizing survival, reproductive investment, or
   mating opportunities). State-dependent behavior consistently results in
   longer patch residence times than predicted by the MVT or another
   foraging model, the minimize mu /g rule, and these rules fail to closely
   approximate the best behavioral strategy over a wide range of
   conditions. Because patch residence times increase with state-dependent
   behavior, this also predicts mass regulation below maximum energy
   capacities without direct mass-specific costs. Finally, qualitative
   behavioral predictions from the MVT about giving-up densities in patches
   and the effects of travel costs are often inconsistent with
   state-dependent behavior. Thus in order to accurately predict patch
   exploitation patterns, the model highlights the need to: (1) consider
   predator behavior (sit-and-wait versus actively foraging); (2) identify
   activities that can occur simultaneously to foraging (i.e., mate search
   or parental care); and (3) specify the range of nutritional states
   likely in foraging animals. Future predictive models of patch use should
   explicitly consider these parameters.}},

   l(-1), though some species are able to survive at oxygen concentrations
   as low as 0.07 mg l(-1). Physiological studies indicate that survival of
   these more tolerant species is facilitated by anaerobic respiration in
   the oxygen-depleted waters followed by upward vertical migration into
   oxygenated waters to repay the oxygen debt. Microzooplankton, which tend
   to be more common than macrozooplankton in regions with extremely
   reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations, are also capable of anaerobic
   respiration since some have been found in anoxic waters. Episodic
   periods of hypoxia/anoxia are becoming more common in coastal waters.
   The impact of hypoxia/anoxia, however, on estuarine and coastal
   zooplankton has received little attention yet micro- and mesozooplankton
   are important elements in marine food webs. Copepods in particular
   constitute a critical component of the diet of larval fish in these

Pages = {{177-192}},
Abstract = {{Dispersal polymorphisms are known from many terrestrial organisms that
   inhabit fluctuating environments, but they are not well-recognized among
   marine invertebrates. An unusual form of variation was found in the
   settlement behavior of lecithotrophic larvae of the mollusc Alderia
   modesta (Loven, 1844) that markedly altered the dispersal potential of
   sibling larvae. Most clutches contained, in variable proportions, larvae
   that spontaneously metamorphosed in the egg mass or within 2 d of
   hatching, and larvae that delayed metamorphosis until encountering the
   obligate adult food, the yellow-green alga Vaucheria longicaulis. The
   proportion of larvae undergoing spontaneous metamorphosis within a
   clutch was highly variable, ranging from 0 to 90 \%, and was unrelated
   to adult size. The proportion of intracapsular metamorphosis was also
   variable, ranging from 0 to 32\%. The percentage of spontaneous
   metamorphosis per clutch was phenotypically plastic: when adults were
   starved, there was a significant tendency for each successive clutch to
   have a lower percentage of spontaneous metamorphosis, thus increasing
   the dispersal potential of the offspring. The decrease in spontaneous
   metamorphosis was significant after only 24 h of starvation. There was
   no significant increase in the cumulative level of spontaneous
   metamorphosis after the 2nd day post-hatching, but larval mortality
   increased as a linear function after the 5th day. Most larvae that did
   not spontaneously settle in the first 2 d delayed metamorphosis until
   they were exposed to the adult host alga, V; longicaulis. When 2 d old
   larvae were exposed to 17 species of macroalgae and sediment from the
   adult habitat, only V. longicaulis induced significant metamorphosis
   (93.3 +/- 6.7 \%); all other species of algae and field sediment induced
   no metamorphosis or low levels (0-9 \%) that were not significantly
   higher than sea water controls. There was no difference in the
   settlement specificity of 2 and 9 d old larvae when tested against 2
   different algae, nor in their ability to complete metamorphosis. The
   high initial percentage of spontaneous metamorphosis reduces the
   dispersal potential of some larvae in each clutch relative to their
   siblings that delay metamorphosis until stimulated by V. longicaulis;
   this settlement dimorphism represents a novel bet-hedging strategy among
   marine invertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{Several factors appear to affect vertical HIV-1 transmission, dependent
   mainly on characteristics of the mother (extent of immunodeficiency,
   co-infections, risk behaviour, nutritional status, immune response,
   genetical make-up), but also if the virus (phenotype, tropism) and,
   possibly, of the child (genetical make-up). This complex situation is
   compounded by the fact that the virus may have the whole gestation
   period, apart from variable periods between membrane rupture and birth
   and the breast-feeding period, to pass from the mother to the infant. It
   seems probable that an extensive interplay of all factors occurs, and
   that some factors may be more important during specific periods and
   other factors in other periods. Factors predominant in protection
   against in utero transmission may be less important for peri-natal
   transmission, and probably quite different from those that predominantly
   affect transmission by mothers milk. For instance, cytotoxic T
   lymphocytes will probably be unable to exert any effect during
   breast-feeding, while neutralizing antibodies will be unable to protect
   transmission by HIV transmitted through infected cells. Furthermore,
   some responses may be capable of controlling transmission of determined
   virus types, while being inadequate for controlling others. As occurence
   of mixed infections and recombination of HIV-1 types is a known fact, it
   does not appear possible to prevent vertical HIV-1 transmission by
   reinforcing just one of the factors, and probably a general strategy
   including all known factors must be used. Recent reports have brought
   information on vertical HIV-1 transmission in a variety of research
   fields, which will have to be considered in conjunction as background

Abstract = {{Animals utilise a wide range of regulatory systems to control the
   conditions within their bodies or homeostasis. These regulatory systems
   control for example, body temperature, nutritional state, water balance,
   social interactions and fear and these systems react to environmental
   and endogenous stimuli so as to correct. or prevent displacements from
   the optimal range. The behavioural and physiological responses utilised
   by the animal are usually proportional to the challenge to homeostasis.
   The stress response commences with the central nervous system perceiving
   a potential challenge to homeostasis. Once the central nervous system
   perceives a threat, it develops a biological response or defence that
   consists of some combination of the four general biological defence
   responses: behavioural responses, responses of the autonomic nervous
   system, responses of the neuroendocrine system and responses of the
   immune system. Although biological regulation is occurring constantly,
   adaptation is not always possible and when homeostasis fails, there are
   biological costs for the animal, which may include growth and
   reproductive failure, injury, disease as a consequence of
   immunosuppression or even death. While animal comfort is not strictly
   defined in the scientific literature, an appropriate definition of
   comfort that is utilised in this review is a dictionary definition, ``at
   ease in body and mind{''}.
   With the likely trend to greater intensification of grassland
   production, there are a number of factors that will affect animal
   comfort. Both group size and space allowance are key features of the
   social environment that may affect animal comfort, while the nature of
   human contact is an important factor, which through fear, may also
   affect animal comfort. Thermal stressors can have significant impact on
   animal comfort with cold around parturition being a serious problem for
   the offspring and heat having adverse consequences for adult animal
   production and welfare. The concerns for animal comfort over husbandry
   procedures include practices ranging from simple interventions such as
   shearing that involve challenges including restraint, close human
   contact and isolation to more complex surgical interventions such as
   tail docking and castration that may include additional challenges such
   as acute and chronic pain, as well as short-term production depressions.
   Others issues include risks associated with animal biotechnologies,
   including simple manipulations such as twinning to more complex
   transgenic manipulations.}},

Title = {{Bioenergetics and nutrition of Mississippi Valley population Canada
   geese during winter and migration}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2001}},

Pages = {{1-65}},

Abstract = {{Survival and reproduction of northern-nesting geese are potentially
   affected by body condition during the non-breeding season. Body
   condition is presumed to be determined by the quantity of food available
   to geese during autumn, winter, and spring migration. However, food
   resources likely do not limit populations that exploit agricultural
   systems. Other factors such as hunting, refuge management, diet quality,
   weather may affect survival and reproduction. We studied time-energy
   budgets, food intake, and body condition to determine how Canada geese
   (Branta canadensis interior) of the Mississippi Valley Population (MVP)
   acquire and utilize energy and nutrients during autumn, winter, and
   spring migration during 1984-1989.
   Abundant food and behavioral flexibility allowed MVP Canada geese to
   exist on a high nutritional plane. Food intake was sufficient to meet or
   exceed daily energy and protein requirements except during winter. High
   energy, low protein diets fueled deposition of large lipid reserves, and
   were adequate to meet protein requirements during autumn in east-central
   Wisconsin. Late migrant geese that spent autumn in east-central
   Wisconsin expended more energy (x = 583 kcal/day) yet deposited more
   lipid (x = 4.51 g) compared to early migrants that spent autumn in
   southern Illinois (x = 526 kcal/day, x = 151 g lipid) during 1984 and
   1985. Both groups averaged 4.5 hr feeding/day during autumn and consumed
   similar quantities (dry mass) of food (x = 187-190 g/day). However, late
   migrants consumed a high energy (x = 3.67 kcal/g) low protein (x = 12\%)
   diet comprised mostly of corn (x = 81\%) during autumn in east-central
   Wisconsin. Early migrants consumed a lower energy (x = 2.99 kcal/g) but
   higher protein (24\%) diet that consisted mostly of green forages (x =
   24\% dry mass) in soybeans (x = 28\%) in southern Illinois.
   Wintering geese consumed a high energy (x = 3.49 kcal/g) diet with
   intermediate protein content (x = 19\%). Corn (x = 58\%) and soybeans (x
   = 22\%) comprised most of dry matter intake during winter in southern
   Illinois when daily energy expenditure averaged 536 kcal/day. However
   food intake declined (x = 152 g food/ day) during winter when geese
   averaged 3.5 hr feeding/day. Variation in crop food energy relative to
   population energy requirements on 2 southern Illinois refuges did not
   impact body condition during 1984-1989. Nutrient reserves contributed
   minimally (<1-6\%) to meeting daily energy requirements, so geese left
   winter refuges with more lipid and similar protein masses compared to
   early autumn.
   Geese exhibited a wide range of behavioral adaptation to spatial and
   temporal variation in food resources and nutritional requirements. Late
   migrants entered winter with larger energy reserves than early migrants
   during 1984-1989. Although early and late migrants were sympatric in
   southern Illinois during winter, they converged to similar levels of
   body condition by the end of winter during 1986-1989. Late migrants
   apparently used stored energy to reduce food intake, possibly to
   minimize mortality during winter. Early migrants apparently minimized
   exposure to hunting by feeding almost entirely within refuges during
   autumn. With smaller energy reserves, early migrants maintained higher
   levels of energy intake to maintain body condition after autumn,
   possibly increasing mortality risk during winter. We expected more
   similar trends in body condition between early and late migrant Canada
   geese, and more consistent losses of nutrient reserves each year if
   winter weight declines were driven by an endogenous physiological
   rhythm. We see no reason to invoke an endogenously driven physiological
   mechanism to explain winter weight losses in MVP Canada geese. Without
   controlled metabolic experiments, we prefer the simpler and more
   plausible explanation that winter weight declines result from
   facultative adjustments of feeding behavior to weather conditions, food
   availability, and pre-winter nutrient reserves. Overwinter survival
   should be enhanced by an energetic strategy that balances potential
   benefits and risks of feeding in relation to the size of remaining
   nutrient reserves. Decline of the early migrant tradition during the
   1990's suggests that the energetic strategy of late migrants is more
   suited to recent harvest and refuge management regimes.
   Adults deposited 73\% (females) and 28\% (males) of their spring protein
   reserves while migrating between southern Illinois and east-central
   Wisconsin. Spring lipid reserves were acquired mostly (84\% in females,
   92\% in males) during a 4-5 week staging period in east-central
   Wisconsin. Juveniles deposited 41-51\% of lipid reserves and 80-91\% of
   protein between southern Illinois and east-central Wisconsin. Feeding
   time (x = 5.8 hr/day), and food intake (x = 263 g/day) increased during
   spring-staging when lipid reserves more than doubled. Spring-staging
   geese consumed a moderate energy (x = 3.25 kcal/g) low protein (x =
   13\%) diet that was more evenly composed of corn (x = 50\%), wild seeds
   and rootstocks (x = 21\%), and green forages (x = 27\%) compared to
   autumn and winter.
   Deposition of nutrient reserves was neither time- nor resource-limited
   during spring migration. Thus, food resources likely did not limit
   reproduction of MVP Canada geese under the conditions we observed during
   1984-1989. Shallow wetland and moist soil habitats can be enhanced on
   southern Illinois refuges to benefit a wider diversity of
   wetland-dependent species and provide nutritional resources for geese
   without compromising energy available to support wintering populations.
   However, geese still need an abundant source of energy during autumn and
   winter, particularly when foraging opportunities are restricted by
   inclement weather or hunting. Food restriction on winter refuges during
   long and late-closing hunting seasons in the 1990's may have contributed
   to long-term changes in autumn migration patterns and wintering
   traditions in southern Illinois. Forage and non-crop foods are essential
   sources of protein and other nutrients during all seasons. but are
   especially important during spring migration. Shallow wetlands and
   lowland pastures on private lands in central Illinois and east-central
   Wisconsin are critical sources of non-crop foods that provide essential
   nutrients that geese use to complete the nesting cycle. Thus,
   reproduction could be impaired in the future if changing land use and
   farming practices reduce availability of moist soil and lowland pasture
   habitats.}},

Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{How do different levels of sibling competition affect nestling growth
   strategies? We investigated this through the effect of different levels
   of per capita feeding rate on the average growth rate of nestlings and
   on individual growth strategies within broods. To manipulate sibling
   competition, we transferred marsh tit nestlings between nests creating
   broods with fewer (reduced) or more (enlarged) nestlings than
   originally. Mean mass decreased as brood size, and thus sibling
   competition, increased. This was due to a large difference in mass
   between the smallest young in each brood. The mass of the largest young
   did not differ significantly between the broods. In reduced broods, the
   largest and smallest nestlings had equal mass, whereas in enlarged
   broods the difference was large. In contrast, wing length close to
   fledging did not differ between the experimental broods. We conclude
   that the growth of the wing has priority over general increase in size.
   This depends on the risk of starving for nestlings unable to leave the
   nest when their most dominant sibling leaves. Thus, low intake rates
   induce a trade-off in the growth of different structures, leading
   subdominant nestlings to divert proportionally more resources to wing
   length growth at the expense of general size. Subdominant nestlings are
   thus facing both a food constraint, depending on parental feeding rate
   and number of dominant siblings, and a time constraint, depending on the
   growth rate of the largest sibling. Hence, to fledge successfully,
   subdominant nestlings will leave the nest at suboptimal masses with a
   likely increase in postfledging mortality. (C) 2001 The Association for

Abstract = {{Over the last three decades, many studies have attempted to explain
   forager diets by using optimal diet theory (ODT). Despite some obvious
   successes, the utility of this theory remains controversial. We reviewed
   the results of 134 studies of optimal diet theory to test hypotheses on
   factors that can explain variation in the ability of ODT to predict
   diets and diet shifts in response to changes in prey availability. Our
   major conclusion is that while ODT has generally worked well for
   foragers that feed on immobile prey, the theory often failed to predict
   the diets of foragers that attack mobile prey. We found only mixed
   support for the hypothesis that the theory works better when the study
   scenario more closely fits the assumptions of the model. Contrary to our
   a priori predictions, forager types (invertebrate versus ectothermic
   vertebrate versus endothermic vertebrate) did not differ in their
   likelihood of corroborating ODT. Two explanations for why optimal diet
   theory does not work well with mobile prey are that studies on mobile
   prey often lack information on key parameters that are required to
   rigorously test ODT, and that with mobile prey, variations among prey in
   vulnerability (encounter rate and capture success) are often more
   important than variation in predator active choice in determining
   predator diets. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{To evaluate the effects of larval environment on postmetamorphic
   performance in the spadefoot toad, Spea hammondii, larvae were reared at
   one of two densities, creating groups of small and large terrestrial
   juveniles. These terrestrial juveniles were reared, either individually
   in the laboratory or in groups in outdoor tanks, at high and low food
   levels until they were 1 yr old. Larger terrestrial juveniles had higher
   probabilities of survival to 1 yr of age than smaller juveniles. Larval
   density did not strongly affect the maximum postmetamorphic growth rate
   of metamorphs. Body mass differences resulting from larval environment
   were maintained or slightly increased over the first year of terrestrial
   growth. The only exception occurred among males receiving high food
   after metamorphosis in both the laboratory and outdoor tanks; here the
   size differences disappeared. Larval environment did not influence the
   proportion of males reaching maturity in their first year. No females
   matured in their first year; this difference in the rate of maturation
   in males and females is consistent with published field studies. In
   outdoor tanks, males from the high-density larval treatment were active
   on the surface more often than those from the low-density larval
   treatment. These results are in general agreement with previous studies
   that have suggested that small size at metamorphosis is associated with
   lower adult fitness, in this case through lower survival and smaller
   body sizes. However, the results of this study suggest that the extent
   to which larval environment can influence subsequent terrestrial
   characteristics, such as growth and behavior, may vary with sex and
   terrestrial food availability.}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{61-80}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Leporids have long been known to reingest soft faeces. However, it was
   recently found that they regularly reingest hard faeces, too. During the
   daytime, both soft and hard faeces are defecated and all of the faeces
   are reingested. Excreted at night are the hard faeces, which are
   normally discarded but reingested in starvation. The separation
   mechanism in the proximal colon, which diverts fine particles into the
   caecum and thus only passes large food particles, produces hard faeces.
   When the mechanism ceases acting, fermented caecal materials are
   excreted as soft faeces. The reingestion of soft faeces, rich in
   vitamins and microbial proteins. is physiologically imperative. Hard
   faeces are basically a refuse, but their thorough mastication at
   reingestion reduces poorly digestible large particles to fine ones good
   fur fermentation. The regular reingestion of daytime hard faeces thus
   promotes food digestibility. The temporary use of night-time hard faeces
   allows leporids to do without food for some time. It thus gives leporids
   behavioural flexibility and thereby an ecological advantage. Reingestion
   is also known in other small- to medium-sized herbivores, which are all
   caecal fermenters. Morphological differentiation between faeces is
   reported only in larger species, but all ingested faeces are found to be
   richer in nutrients than discarded ones. Thus a separation mechanism is
   probably present in all reingesting species. Reingestion activity is
   deeply related to other behavioural and physiological traits of small
   mammalian herbivores, hence its study is important to understanding of
   their ecology and biology. Leporids are the largest of the reingesting
   species except for the semi-aquatic Coypu, and reingestion by leporids
   is certainly the most sophisticated. This development of a
   reingestion-involved digestive system has probably brought them to their
   present niche, as terrestrial medium-sized generalist mammalian
   herbivores, and consequently made their characteristic hide-and-run
   lifeforms by exposing them to a strong predation pressure.}},

   near 13 nests from close to hatching until close to independence during

   controls and received no supplemental food. We compared the following
   variables at treatment and control nests: (1) adult female mass, (2)
   nestling mass and size, (3) female nest attendance, and (4) juvenile
   survival. Following supplemental feeding, adult females from treatment
   nests were heavier than their control counterparts, and remained closer
   to the nest during the latter part of the nestling period and throughout
   the postpledging period. Nestlings from supplemented nests were
   significantly heavier than those from unsupplemented nests, but results

Abstract = {{I manipulated food availability in juvenile and adult fishing spiders
   (Dolomedes triton) to test two hypotheses for sexual cannibalism. The
   adaptive foraging hypothesis posits that sexual cannibalism is an
   economic, adaptive foraging strategy on the part of the adult female. In
   contrast, the aggressive-spillover hypothesis suggests that
   precopulatory sexual cannibalism is misplaced aggression favoured in
   previous life-history phases. Several results indicated support for the
   adaptive foraging hypothesis. First, increased adult food availability
   produced marginally nonsignificant fecundity benefits in female's first
   egg sacs and highly significant fecundity benefits in female's second
   egg sacs. Second, while consumption of a male did not result in more
   offspring in either egg sac, it did significantly increase the
   probability a female would successfully hatch an egg sac. Finally,
   mating trials revealed mixed support for the adaptive foraging
   hypothesis as, for the most part, female mating behaviour (attack or
   mate) was not determined by the adaptive value a male represented (food
   item or sperm donor). Specifically, the likelihood of it precopulatory
   attack was not determined by male size, date (an indirect estimate of
   male availability)or female nutrient load. However, mated females did
   tend to attack courting males more often than virgin females. The
   aggressive-spillover hypothesis was supported by several findings. For
   juveniles, food availability had a significant positive effect on fixed
   female size (cephalothorax area at final moult) which, in turn, had a
   significant positive effect on fecundity. Thus, the spillover
   hypothesis' assertion that strong fecundity selection acts on juvenile
   feeding and fixed adult size was supported. The possibility that the
   spillover and adaptive foraging hypotheses are not mutually exclusive is
   discussed, especially in light of the presence of high levels of sexual
   cannibalism both before and after mating. (C) 2001 The Association for

Abstract = {{Wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, frequently hunt and share meat.
   Despite widespread interest and considerable study, continued
   controversy exists regarding the factors that influence chimpanzee
   hunting decisions and meat sharing. Three hypotheses invoke the
   importance of ecological, reproductive and social factors. A nutritional
   shortfall hypothesis suggests that chimpanzees hunt to compensate for
   seasonal shortages in food availability. A second hypothesis argues that
   male chimpanzees hunt to obtain meat that they swap for matings. A third
   hypothesis proposes that males use meat as a social-tool to develop and
   maintain alliances with other males. We tested these hypotheses using
   observations of an unusually large community of chimpanzees at Ngogo in
   Kibale National Park, Uganda. Results did not support the nutritional
   shortfall or meat-for-sex hypotheses. The Ngogo chimpanzees hunted
   primarily during times of food abundance rather than scarcity. The
   presence of oestrous females did not predict the tendency of chimpanzees
   to hunt. Furthermore, meat-for-sex exchanges occurred infrequently, and
   males did not gain a mating advantage through sharing meat. Additional
   observations were consistent with the male social bonding hypothesis. At
   Ngogo, male chimpanzees were likely to hunt when accompanied by other
   males. Males shared meat nonrandomly and reciprocally among themselves,
   and males exchanged meat for agonistic support. Although several factors
   are likely to affect chimpanzee hunting decisions and meat sharing,
   these results indicate that primary causes will not be found through
   invoking simple energetic or reproductive considerations. (C) 2001 The

Abstract = {{Pairing patterns in monogamous birds are thought to be the consequence
   of mutual mate choice by males and females for characters linked to
   individual quality in the opposite sex. Although this may result in
   assortative pairing for a single character, there may be no simple match
   between male and female phenotype if the traits linked to individual
   quality are sex specific. For instance, in several passerine species,
   females tend to select males on the basis of territory quality or
   characters that may reflect health or vigour, whereas males benefit from
   pairing with females in good condition that breed early because early
   breeding increases reproductive success. We investigated pairing
   patterns in an urban population of the sexually dimorphic European
   blackbird in relation to bill colour in males and body condition in
   females, over a 3-year period. Females breeding early were in
   significantly better condition than those breeding late. The number of
   breeding attempts per season was significantly positively correlated
   with female condition, while the number of fledglings reared by a female
   in a breeding season was positively correlated with the number of
   breeding attempts, independently of female condition. Bill colour varied
   in males and was related to body weight, although not to condition.
   Female condition was correlated with male bill colour within pairs, with
   males showing more orange bills being paired to females in better
   condition. We discuss the observed pairing pattern in relation to
   individual or territory quality and to the constraints and costs

Abstract = {{Isolated individuals of most species are thought to be at a higher risk

   However, supporting evidence remains scant. As part of a broader study
   of grey-cheeked mangabey, Lophocebus albigena, dispersal in Kibale
   National Park, Uganda between October 1996 to February 1999, we
   investigated starvation and mortality risks within a sample of 27
   radiotagged mangabey males. Each male was contacted on average three
   times a week to collect data on spatial relations, habitat use, activity
   patterns and fates. We assessed risks by comparing data from `isolated'
   (greater than or equal to 200 m from the group) males with data from
   `within-group' males. We assessed starvation risks by comparing
   proportions of time spent in feeding, foraging and moving, comparing
   rates of movement during focal samples, and comparing proportions of
   time that males spent in different habitat types and canopy levels. We
   assessed mortality risks by comparing scanning rates and mortality
   events of within-group and isolated males. Isolated males spent
   significantly more time scanning, but we could detect no other
   significant differences in time allocated to different activities by the
   two categories of males. Nor could we detect differences between
   within-group and isolated males in the use of habitat types and canopy
   levels. At least three of five established mortality events involved
   males known to be isolated from groups. Given that males were found
   isolated only 11\% of the time, it is estimated that isolated males were
   at least 12 times as likely to die as within-group males. These results
   suggest that dispersing males may not face increased risk of starvation,
   but are at higher risk of mortality (primarily through predation by
   eagles) than nondispersing males. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {{We describe a stochastic model of an animal exploring and foraging
   within an uncertain environment. Behaviour is determined not by an
   optimizing algorithm but by fuzzy systems using linguistic rules derived
   from the information primacy hypothesis which stresses the importance of
   continual information gathering under conditions of uncertainty. In the
   model, the animal's hunger increases steadily over time and is reduced
   by visiting locations that may contain varying amounts of food.
   Uncertainty arises from three sources: (1) location novelty or
   ambiguity, that is, the animal is uncertain whether it has visited the
   same location before; (2) variation in the amounts of food in a given
   location; and (3) the recency of information concerning these two
   aspects of a given location. In complex and changing environments fresh
   information is likely to be more accurate than old information and
   consequently our model gives most weight to recently gathered
   information. All sources of uncertainty are reduced by visiting
   locations and gathering fresh information. The model is successful in
   simulating results from experiments investigating such phenomena as:
   spontaneous alternation; patrolling; the effects of hunger on the

Abstract = {{Using an automatic identification and weighing system, we investigated
   changes in adult body mass in relation to reproductive behaviour during
   courtship and incubation in free-living king penguins. Despite stressful
   nutritional conditions and variability of fast length, the majority of
   pairs incubated successfully by accumulating large body reserves before
   fasting, which provided flexibility in fasting strategies. Our data
   indicate a low body mass during fasting below which males either delayed
   or stopped breeding: (1) at 12 kg, the mate interruped courtship to
   replenish his body reserves at sea before re-engaging in courtship; and
   (2) when body mass dropped to 9 kg during incubation, the male deserted
   the egg. The behavioural decision to go to sea was not controlled by the
   time spent fasting, but by the amount of body reserves. In deserting
   males, the depletion of body reserves during incubation before relief by
   the females was due to a lower stored energy ( - 2 kg) at the onset of
   courtship compared with successful males. Unsuccessful males weighed
   only 12 kg when they started to court, and consequently had no safety
   margin that allowed them to wait for a delayed female. The unusual
   depletion of body reserves of male breeders caused only 3\% of
   incubation attempts to fail. Compared with successful pairs, their
   female partners gained less body mass at sea ( - 40 g/day) and made a
   slightly longer foraging trip (+5 days). We suggest that the deserting
   males had risked breeding with the lowest fasting safety margin
   possible, rather than breeding later that year. However, the low body
   mass at desertion did not affect the penguins' survival or their feeding
   capacity, and therefore did not compromise another breeding attempt

Abstract = {{Increasing fruit and vegetable consumption reduces risk factors for

   chronic diseases. These foodstuffs contain relatively high levels of
   beneficial phytochemicals (plant-derived, biologically active compounds)
   among which the preventative activity of antioxidants are most
   well-known and well-documented. Since small fruit typically contain high
   levels of antioxidants, increasing their incorporation in the diet is a
   laudable goal. Media reports of medical studies pertaining to dietary
   intake and national education initiatives such as the USDA's Food Guide
   Pyramid and the 5 A Day-for Better Health program have successfully
   raised public awareness of the health benefits of increased fruit and
   vegetable consumption, but, as of yet, may not have altered dietary
   habits. The factors influencing food choice are complex and
   interrelated. They include: sensory preference, physiological factors
   (pre- and postingestion), age, gender, lifestyle, behavior, personality,
   education, income, social attitudes about diet and health, ethnicity and
   tradition, religious beliefs, social pressures, marketing pressures,
   available product information and knowledge (labeling, media coverage,
   etc.) or self-identity beliefs. Some of these factors offer
   opportunities for increasing fruit and vegetable consumption while
   others present challenges. With respect to small fruit, food choice
   factors that tend to increase consumption include public awareness of
   these products as being beneficial to health and longevity and their
   image as highly desirable, dessert-like commodities with exquisite
   flavors. The main factors that deter increased small fruit consumption
   include their relatively high price per serving and their relative
   perishability which affects cost, ease of transport and availability.
   Strategies to capitalize on small fruits' positive attributes and

Abstract = {{Most established risk factors for chronic disease incidence and
   mortality from cancer, such as cigarette smoke, alcohol drinking,
   occupational and environmental hazards and dietary factors, have been
   shown to vary in their importance in terms of relative risk. In studies
   which addressed the individual level of behaviour, but also coping and
   self-regulation, a strong modifying effect of long-lasting hopelessness
   and helplessness has been found to depend on personality. Autonomy and
   healthful self-regulation have been defined as the regulation of
   behaviour in those activities which are carried out in the physical and
   social environment and lead to stimulated feeling, pleasure, perception
   of inner and social security and competence. Persons with such
   well-regulated behaviour are capable of coping wit sources of
   listlessness, uncertainty and instability. Those individuals showing a
   well-regulated behaviour arrive at a psycho-neuro-physiological basis
   for better competence and defence against health hazards.
   The capability determined by the degree of self-regulation is measured
   with different instruments. The experience with a questionnaire for the
   assessment of self-regulation, its quantification and predictive value
   is presented here. The method of study is by prospective approach, which
   permits the demonstration of causal associations (promotion,
   co-causality) and facilitates the experimental approach through
   intervention. A causal association is likely if the effect of a modifier
   is not only found in a prospective (observational) follow-up but also if
   the (experimental) intervention shows an effect. The method of
   intervention by stimulation of self-regulation is the autonomy training
   developed by Grossarth-Maticek. Using several examples presenting the
   method, the modifying effect is shown by referring to four risk factors.
   If the risk factors are associated with an inhibited self-regulation,
   then the effect in terms of disease and pathological outcome is
   stronger. This was shown with the hazardous effects of smoking, alcohol
   drinking and dietary malnutrition as well as with automobile exhaust. It
   may be important, for example, whether a person feels self-determined
   when driving a car for hours but does not need to consume
   ethanol-containing drinks for feeling well. One's own capability to
   regulate well over time apparently modulates functions of the body and
   hence modifies the effects of physical factors. In epidemiological
   studies, which assess mostly only exogenous factors (so called
   established risk factors) this evidence has to be considered by
   including the pertinent data on the relevant questions in each field
   study.}},

Abstract = {{Passerines maintain low levels of fat in winter even though larger fat
   reserves would provide better insurance against starvation. This is
   believed to be a result of predation risk and/or metabolic expenditure
   increasing with the amount of fat carried. Recent empirical studies
   indicate that the effect of increased mass on predation risk is small,
   but the effect on metabolic expenditure is large. Using dynamic
   modelling, I investigated how mass-dependent costs affect the pattern of
   fat gain. I found that increases in metabolic expenditure were
   sufficient to explain strong regulation of the level of fat, but that
   increases in direct predation risk cannot be excluded. A plausible
   explanation for the increase in metabolic expenditure is if the extra
   weight is compensated for by a parallel gain in flight muscle. Such
   compensation means that an increase in instantaneous predation risk can
   be avoided, but that costs depending on an increase in energy intake may
   occur instead. For example more time spent foraging increases exposure
   to predators, Hence, one form of predation risk (impaired ability to
   escape from an attacking predator) may be traded for another (more time
   spent foraging). This will be beneficial if this extended foraging is
   not risky, whereas failure to compensate for the extra mass would mean
   the risk of being caught by a predator increasing considerably. Besides
   the widely recognized trade-off between starvation and predation, this
   means that there may also be a trade-off between different forms of
   predation in wintering birds. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{We studied the selection response of the freshwater grazing zooplankter,

   Distinct genotypes of D. galeata were hatched from diapausing eggs
   extracted from three time horizons in the sediments of Lake Constance,
   Europe, covering the period 1962 to 1997, a time of change in both the
   prevalence of planktonic cyanobacteria and levels of phosphorus
   pollution. We assessed whether the grazers evolved to become more
   resistant to dietary cyanobacteria by exposing genetically distinct
   clones to two diets, one composed only of the nutritious green alga,
   Scenedesmus obliquus (good food), and the other a mixture of S. obliquus
   and the toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa (poor food),

   We evaluated evolutionary change in the Daphnia population using an
   analysis of reaction norms based on relative (log-transformed) changes
   in g(j). Log(g(j)) is a measure of the proportional effect of dietary
   cyanobacteria on other fitness components of the Daphnia phenotype. For
   comparison, we also analyze absolute (i.e., nontransformed) changes in
   g(i) and discuss the interpretations of the two approaches. Statistical
   results using a general linear model demonstrate a significant effect of
   genotype (showing differences in g(j) among genotypes), a significant
   genotype X food-type interaction (showing differences in phenotypic
   plasticity among genotypes), and, in the case of log-transformed data, a
   significant sediment-genotype-age X food-type interaction. The latter
   shows that phenotypic plasticity evolved over the period studied.
   Two constraints act on response to selection in the D. galeata-Lake
   Constance system. First, g(j) on a diet containing poor food is highly
   correlated with g(j) on a diet of good food, thus evolving resistance
   also meant evolving an increase in g(j) on both diets. Second, because
   genotypes with a high g(j) also grow to a large adult body size, which
   in turn increases Daphnia vulnerability to fish predation, we suggest
   that selection only acted to favor genotypes possessing a high potential
   gj after cyanobacteria became prevalent. The presence of cyanobacteria
   depressed realized g(j) and led to animals of small adult body size even
   if their genotypes had the potential for high g(j) and large size. With
   realized g(j) reduced, genotypes with an inherently high value could be
   selected even in the presence of predatory fish. The joint action of
   selection by dietary cyanobacteria and vulnerability to fish predation
   provides an explanation for the observed evolution of resistance to poor
   food through reduced phenotypic plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{As the obesity epidemic escalates, increasing numbers of patients
   present with serious comorbidities related to excess body weight.
   Obesity should be recognized and treated as a primary medical condition
   that is progressive, chronic, and relapsing. Effective treatment of
   obesity has been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk factors and
   comorbid conditions. Physician involvement is necessary for medical
   assessment, management, counseling, and coordination of
   multidisciplinary obesity treatment. Obese patients who receive
   counseling and weight management from physicians are significantly more
   likely to undertake weight management programs than those who do not.
   Obesity treatment guidelines and materials are available from various
   health organizations. A comprehensive weight management program must
   include dietary adjustments, increased physical activity, and behavioral
   modification. Nutritional modifications should take into account the
   diet's energy content, composition, and suitability for the individual
   patient. The physical activity component should be safe and practical,
   including aerobic activity, strength training, and increased daily
   lifestyle activities. Various behavioral strategies enable the patient
   to make lifestyle changes that will promote weight loss and management.
   Adjunct therapies may serve to sup-L port lifestyle modifications in
   severe or resistant cases of obesity. Models for multidisciplinary care
   vary depending on whether they are designed for an individual medical
   practice or as part of the health care services of a larger facility.
   Lifestyle changes for healthy weight management must be permanently
   incorporated into a patient's daily lifestyle to reduce obesity and its
   associated health risks. Such intervention is necessary if the growing
   epidemic of obesity is to be slowed and reversed.}},

Abstract = {{We analysed the effects of forest fragmentation on the flock structure
   of insectivorous forest passerines (Parus, Aegithalos, Certhia, Regulus,
   etc.), and on the anti-predator behaviour and energy management of blue
   tits in these flocks. We surveyed flocks in Central Spain during two
   winters. Flocks in fragments comprised fewer individuals and species
   than flocks in unfragmented forests. The most abundant species in forest
   flocks (blue tit, Parus caeruleus, and firecrest, Regulus ignicapillus)
   were also the most abundant in fragments, while the rarest species in
   the area never occurred in small woodlots. We investigated how
   fragmentation and related changes in flock structure affect
   anti-predator behaviour of blue tits, a widely distributed species in
   the area. In fragments but not in forests, blue tits increased scanning
   rates with decreasing flock size. Vigilance was relaxed when great tits,
   Parus major, were abundant as flock mates, suggesting that the absence
   of this dominant species in fragments could intensify anti-predator
   behaviour of blue tits. Blue tits enhanced anti-predator behaviour in
   the second winter parallel to an increase in the abundance of raptors.
   This behavioural change was stronger in fragments, where blue tits
   foraged deeper in the canopy and increased scanning and hopping rates.
   Under increased predation risk, birds are expected to reduce body mass
   to improve predator avoidance. On average, blue tits weighed similar in
   fragments and forests the second winter. However, they accumulated fat
   along the day in-fragments only, and adjusted body mass to body size
   more closely in that habitat type. This suggests that blue tits
   perceived fragments as unpredictable habitats where fattening would help
   avoid starvation, but also as dangerous sites where overweight would
   further increase the risk of predation. In summary, our results. support
   that fragmentation affects individual behaviour of blue tits, and show
   the potential of behavioural approaches to unravel how different species
   face the advancing fragmentation of their habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Plant morphology is dramatically influenced by environmental signals.
   The growth and development of the root system is an excellent example of
   this developmental plasticity. Both the number and placement of lateral
   roots are highly responsive to nutritional cues. This indicates that
   there must be a signal transduction pathway that interprets complex
   environmental conditions and makes the ``decision{''} to form a lateral
   root at a particular time and place. Lateral roots originate from
   differentiated cells in adult tissues. These cells must reenter the cell
   cycle, proliferate, and redifferentiate to produce all of the cell types
   that make up a new organ. Almost nothing is known about how lateral root
   initiation is regulated or coordinated with growth conditions. Here, we
   report a novel growth assay that allows this regulatory mechanism to be
   dissected in Arabidopsis. When Arabidopsis seedlings are grown on
   nutrient media with a high sucrose to nitrogen ratio, lateral root
   initiation is dramatically repressed. Auxin localization appears to be a
   key factor in this nutrient-mediated repression of lateral root
   initiation. We have isolated a mutant, lateral root initiation 1 (lin1),
   that overcomes the repressive conditions. This mutant produces a highly
   branched root system on media with high sucrose to nitrogen ratios. The
   lin1 phenotype is specific to these growth conditions, suggesting that
   the lin1 gene is involved in coordinating lateral root initiation with
   nutritional cues. Therefore, these studies provide novel insights into
   the mechanisms that regulate the earliest steps in lateral root
   initiation and that coordinate plant development with the environment.}},

Abstract = {{The polygyny threshold model states that secondary females gain benefits
   from high territory quality that outweigh the costs of sharing a male.
   We aimed to test this prediction using the dusky warbler as a model
   species. We first showed that neither the shifted sex ratio hypothesis
   nor the no-cost models were likely to apply to our study. Secondary
   females settled in territories of higher quality (high food abundance,
   low predator density) and had a nonsignificantly higher reproductive
   success than simultaneously settling monogamous females. However, there
   were strong indications that these two groups of females differed
   intrinsically. Secondary females were older than late monogamous
   females, and while they replaced lost clutches more often, they also
   suffered from a nonsignificantly higher winter mortality. Consequently,
   it was impossible to tell whether differences in reproductive success
   were caused by differences in territory quality or in female qualities.
   Our study suggests that female choice may also depend on characteristics
   that are specific to the individual, and may therefore be more
   sophisticated than allowed for in traditional polygyny models. In other
   words, the polygyny threshold may be not the same for all individuals.
   We suggest that prior breeding experience may help older females to
   profit more from the benefits and to suffer less from the costs of

Volume = {{51}},

Abstract = {{The threat-sensitivity hypothesis predicts that prey individuals will
   increase antipredator behaviors as apparent predator risk increases. An
   implicit assumption of the threat-sensitivity hypothesis is that
   predator risk is additive. In other words, all characteristics of a
   predator that indicate risk should contribute in an additive way to
   determine the degree of risk-sensitive behavior. We tested this
   assumption in the laboratory by presenting live predators (green
   sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus) to groups of western mosquitofish (Gambusia
   affinis). We examined effects of predator diet, hunger level, and size
   on predator avoidance and inspection behavior of mosquitofish. Both
   predator diet and predator hunger level were significant and additive
   determinants of distance maintained from a predator, resulting in a
   graded response to combinations of these predator cues. In contrast,
   whereas predator diet was the most important determinant of general
   avoidance distances, predator hunger level was more important in
   determining mosquitofish vertical distribution and inspection behavior.
   Thus, the relationship between predator cue and the antipredator
   behavior that it elicits is dependent on which cues and behaviors are
   examined. Our data suggest that during risky behaviors, such as predator
   inspection, mosquitofish rely mainly on visual cues (behavior
   differences between hungry and satiated predators), whereas general
   avoidance behavior is determined by additive responses from visual and

Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{353-370}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Given the current global epidemic of obesity there is a demand for new
   antiobesity drugs to overcome the problem. Many pharmacological agents
   reduce food intake and significantly decrease body mass when
   administered to animals but affect feeding behaviour in a profoundly
   different way indicating the variety of biological mechanisms by which
   such agents act (appetite verses non-appetite). More limited clinical
   data demonstrates that some of the same drugs produce decreases in food
   intake and weight loss in humans. A few of these drugs do so by
   modifying the functioning of the appetite system as measured by
   subjective changes in feelings of hunger and fullness (indices of
   satiety). These drugs that modify the daily flux of appetite could be
   considered as `appetite suppressants' with clinical potential as
   anti-obesity agents. Drugs that can be considered suitable candidates
   for appetite suppressants are agents that enhance peripherally satiety
   peptide systems (such as CCK, Bombesin/GRP, Enterostatin and GLP-1),
   alter the CNS levels of various hypothalamic neuropeptides (NPY,
   Galanin, Orexin, CART and Melanocortins) or monoamine neurotransmitters
   (such as serotonin, nor-adrenaline and possibly dopamine). Recently, the
   hormone leptin has become regarded as a key hormonal signal linking
   adipose tissue status with a number of key central nervous system
   circuits (NPY, CART, CRF, Melanocortins and possibly Orexins). This
   tonic system may also provide drug targets for the control of appetite.
   Any changes induced by a potential appetite suppressant should be
   considered in terms of the (i) psychological experience and behavioural
   expression of appetite, (ii) metabolism and peripheral physiology, and
   (iii) functioning of CNS neural pathways. In humans, such modulation of
   appetite will involve changes in total caloric consumption, subjective
   changes in feelings of hunger and fullness, preferences for specific
   food items, and general macronutrient preferences. These may be
   expressed behaviourally as changes in meal patterns, snacking behaviour
   and food choice. Within the next 20 years it is certain that clinicians
   will have a new range of anti-obesity compounds available to choose
   from. Such novel compounds may act on a single component of the appetite
   system or target a combination of these components detailed in this
   review. Such compounds used in combination with life style changes and
   dietary intervention may be critical in dealing with the rising world
   epidemic of obesity.}},

Abstract = {{In Australia, colorectal, prostate and breast cancers are the most
   frequently occurring cancers in our society, a pattern that is quite
   different from that of underdeveloped countries. While diet is largely
   responsible for these differences, technological advances mean that the
   solutions can be viewed as systematic, financial, lifestyle or
   technological. They range from those that require self-discipline and
   care for personal well-being through to those that are seemingly a quick
   technological fix that will work in spite of an unhealthy lifestyle.
   There are three main approaches available for prevention of these
   cancers: dietary lifestyle, chemoprevention and screening. It has been
   estimated that the potential for prevention by a healthy dietary
   lifestyle is excellent and might reduce the burden of breast, prostate
   and colorectal cancer by 33-55\%, 10-20\% and 66-75\%, respectively.
   This should be safe and inexpensive and have collateral benefit such as
   reduced cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. But, population
   compliance with more plant-based, less calorie dense foods is uncertain,
   the most healthy are likely to be the most compliant and evidence for
   effectiveness when interventional programs are undertaken is
   disappointing. It is not clear how dependable the dietary approach would
   be where inherited genetic factors determine risk for one of these
   cancers. Chemoprevention, the administration of natural or synthetic
   agents that delay, slow down or inhibit the process of tumorigenesis,
   are still under development and study. Hormone receptor modulators for
   breast and derivatives of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for
   colorectal cancers seem to have most promise and may reduce tumour
   incidence or death by as much as 50\%. These agents are simpler to
   comply with than changing dietary lifestyle and they are more potent,
   hence they may be of particular value in high-risk settings. But they
   are likely to be more costly and run the risk of adverse effects with
   few collateral benefits. Screening, or the testing of an individual for
   a disease when that individual does not have any symptoms or signs
   suggesting that the disease is present, aims to prevent or delay the
   development of the cancer. Screening impacts on mortality more so than
   on incidence, reducing colorectal cancer mortality in the range 15-60\%
   and breast cancer mortality by 23-37\%. Screening has the advantage of
   being effective in high-risk as well as average-risk groups and is an
   `easy' solution for the person who elects not to follow a healthy
   dietary lifestyle. Nonetheless, it is expensive, demanding on resources,
   provides no collateral benefits and does not have the same potential to
   reduce incidence of disease as does the dietary approach. With these
   Western cancers, we are fortunate that there are options for prevention.
   At least choices are available and some will suite certain circumstances
   and personalities more than others.}},

Abstract = {{Birds species, like plants and other animals are facing an unprecedented
   decline. About 11\% of bird species are threatened with extinction.
   Captive breeding as a conservation tool can be used as a substitute for
   wild populations in research and education, to provide demographic and
   genetic reservoirs for reinforcing or founding wild populations, and as
   a last resort for species that have no immediate opportunity for
   survival in nature, Candidates for captive propagation are zoos, private
   breeders, state agencies, conservation foundations and research centres
   within or outside of universities. The problems in managing endangered
   species have motivated conservation biologists to conduct research in
   many disciplines such as behaviour, physiology, endocrinology, genetics,
   husbandry, nutrition and veterinary medicine. In addition, an increasing
   number of techniques for increasing reproductive success, improving
   genetic management and enhancing reintroduction success have been
   employed. Breeding success has been improved by improved knowledge of
   factors that trigger reproduction and stimulate replacement clutches, as
   well as by improvements in artificial incubation and artificial
   insemination. Assuming that the correct social behaviour group is
   constituted and the animals start to breed, genetic problems are likely
   to occur in species with only a few remaining individuals. Once numbers
   are low, genetic variability is reduced and this brings about diminished
   ability to respond to environmental change. Recent advances in molecular
   genetics have enabled studies in taxonomy to be carried out in order to
   determine species, subspecies and population boundaries. They have also
   contributed to the theoretical development of small population genetics
   and demographics aimed at improving ex-situ population management,
   Captive birds are often hand-reared, but since many behaviours are
   acquired from the parents, or by experience in the wild, artificial
   rearing by hand could affect the survival potential of released animals.
   In order to prevent imprinting on humans and other detrimental effects
   of hand-rearing techniques, parents, foster-parents, puppets or costumes
   have been used to rear chicks. Finally, recent developments in research
   on training programmes to find food, to fly, to avoid specific dangers,
   or to recognise and to avoid predators, appear to have substantially
   increased release success in reintroduction programmes.}},

Abstract = {{Costs of reproduction are fundamental trade-offs shaping the evolution
   of life histories. There has been much interest, discussion and
   controversy about the nature and type of reproductive costs. The
   manipulation of reproductive effort (e.g. brood size manipulation) may
   alter not only life-history traits such as future adult survival rate
   and future reproductive effort, but also behavioural decisions affecting
   recapture/resighting and dispersal probabilities. We argue that many
   previous studies of the costs of reproduction may have erroneously
   concluded the existence or non-existence of such costs because of their
   use of local return rates to assess survival. In this paper, we take
   advantage of the modern multistate capture-recapture methods to
   highlight how the accurate assessment of the costs of reproduction
   requires incorporating not only recapture probability, but also
   behavioural `state' variables, for example dispersal status and cur rent
   reproductive investment. The inclusion of state-dependent decisions can
   radically alter the conclusions drawn regarding the costs of
   reproduction on future survival or reproductive investment. We
   illustrate this point by re-analysing data collected to address the
   question of the costs of reproduction in the collared flycatcher and the
   great tit. We discuss in some detail the methodological issues and

   tridactyla) suggested that the reproductive success of conspecifics (or
   some social cor relate) could be one important factor likely to affect
   dispersal and recruitment. By dispersing from patches where the local
   reproductive success was low and recruiting to patches where the local
   reproductive success was high, individual birds could track
   spatio-temporal variations in the quality of breeding patches (the
   quality of breeding patches can be affected by different factors, such
   as food availability, the presence of predators or ectoparasites, which
   can vary in space and time at different scales). Such an observational
   study may nevertheless have confounded the role of conspecific
   reproductive success with the effect of a cor related factor (e. g. the
   local activities of a predator). In other words, individuals may have
   been influenced directly by the factor responsible for the low local
   reproductive success or indirectly by the low success of their
   neighbours. Thus, an experimental approach was needed to address this
   question. Estimates of demographic parameters (other than reproductive
   success) and studies of the response of marked individuals to changes in
   their environment usually face problems associated with variability in
   the probability of detecting individuals and with non-independence among
   events occur ring on a local scale. Further, very few studies on
   dispersal have attempted to address the causal nature of relationships
   by experimentally manipulating factors. Here we present an experiment
   designed to test for an effect of local reproductive success of
   conspecifics on behavioural decisions of individuals regarding dispersal
   and recruitment. The experiment was carried out on Kittiwakes within a
   large seabird colony in northern Norway. It involved (i) the colour
   banding of several hundreds of birds; (ii) the manipulation
   (increase/decrease) of the local reproductive success of breeding groups
   on cliffpatches; and (iii) the detailed survey of attendance and
   activities of birds on these patches. It also involved the manipulation
   of the nest content of marked individuals breeding within these patches
   (individuals failing at the egg stage were expected to respond in terms
   of dispersal to the success of their neighbours). This allowed us to
   test whether a lower local reproductive success would lower (1) the
   attendance of breeders at the end of the breeding season; (2) the
   presence of prospecting birds; and (3) the proportion of failed breeders
   that came back to breed on the same patch the year after. In this paper,
   we discuss how we dealt with (I) the use of return rates to infer
   differences in dispersal rates; (II) the trade-off between sample sizes
   and local treatment levels; and (III) potential differences in detection
   probabilities among locations. We also present some results to
   illustrate the design and implementation of the experiment.}},

Journal = {{REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{349-371}},
Abstract = {{In many fish species, some individuals are diurnal while others are
   nocturnal. Sometimes, the same individual can be diurnal at first and
   then switch to nocturnalism, or vice-versa. This review examines the
   factors that are associated with such plasticity. It covers the
   breakdown of activity rhythms during migration, spawning, and the
   parental phase; reversals of activity patterns during ontogeny or from
   one season to the next; effects of light intensity, temperature,
   predation risk, shoal size, food availability, and intraspecific
   competition. Case studies featuring goldfish (Carassius auratus), golden
   shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), lake chub (Couesius plumbeus),
   salmonids, sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), and parental sticklebacks
   and cichlids illustrate some of these influences. It is argued that most
   species have a circadian system but that having such a system does not
   necessarily imply strict diurnalism or nocturnalism. Rigidity of
   activity phase seems more common in species, mostly marine, that display
   behavioral sleep, and for these animals the circadian clock can help
   maintain the integrity of the sleep period and ensure that its
   occurrence takes place at that time of day to which the animal's sensory
   equipment is not as well adapted. However, in other fishes, mostly from
   freshwater habitats, the circadian clock seems to be used mainly for
   anticipation of daily events such as the arrival of day, night, or food,
   and possibly for other abilities such as time-place learning and sun
   compass orientation, rather than for strict control of activity phase.
   In these species, various considerations relating to foraging success
   and predation risk may determine whether the animal is diurnal or
   nocturnal at any particular time and place.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of the research presented here was to examine phenotypic
   plasticity exhibited by three morphotypes of the common Caribbean sponge
   Anthosigmella varians (Duchassaing \& Michelotti). We were interested in
   examining the biotic (and, to a lesser extent, abiotic) factors
   responsible for branch production in this species. We also tested the
   hypothesis that the skeleton may serve an anti-predator function in this
   sponge, focusing on vertebrate fish predators (i.e., angelfish) in this
   work. In transplant and caging experiments. unprotected forma varians
   replicates were immediately consumed by angelfish, while caged
   replicates persisted on the reef for several months. These findings
   support the hypothesis that predators (and not wave energy) restrict
   forma varians to lagoonal habitats. Branch production was not observed
   in A. varians forma incrustans when sponges were protected from
   predators or placed in predator-free, low-wave-energy environments. It
   is not clear from our work whether forma incrustans is capable of
   producing branches (i.e., whether branch production is a plastic trait
   in this morph). Additional field experiments demonstrated that A.
   varians forma varians increased spicule concentrations. compared to
   uninjured sponges, in response to artificial predation events, and A.
   varians forma rigida reduced spicule concentrations, compared to uncaged
   controls, when protected from predators. These findings indicate that
   spicule concentration is a plastic morphological trait that can be
   induced by damage, and that A. varians may be able to reduce spicule
   concentrations when environmental conditions change (e.g., in the
   absence of predators). The potential significance of inducible defenses
   and structural anti-predator defenses in sponges is discussed in
   relation to recent work on sponge chemical defenses.}},

Volume = {{83}},

Pages = {{370-385}},

Abstract = {{In disturbance ecology there is a tension between ecological and
   evolutionary viewpoints, because while disturbances often cause
   mortality in populations (an ecological effect), populations may also
   evolve mechanisms that ameliorate mortality risk (an evolutionary
   effect). Flash floods cause high mortality in the juvenile aquatic stage
   of desert stream insects, but these ecological effects may be mitigated
   by the evolution of life-history strategies that allow the terrestrial
   adult stage to avoid floods. Life-history theory predicts that, to
   balance trade-offs between juvenile growth and mortality risk from
   floods, (1) most individuals should emerge before the peak of the flood
   season, (2) optimal body size at emergence should decline as flood
   probability increases, and (3) a second decline in body size at
   emergence should occur as the reproductive season ends. These
   predictions were tested with data on body mass at and timing of
   emergence of the caddisfly Phylloicus aeneus measured in three montane
   Chihuahuan Desert (Arizona, USA) streams over two years. P. aeneus that
   had not reached the adult stage were eliminated from site-years that
   experienced flash floods, suggesting that timing of emergence is an
   important fitness component. On average 86\% of emergence occurred
   before the long-term (similar to100 yr) mean arrival date of the first
   seasonal flood, supporting prediction 1. The presence of two consecutive
   declines in body mass at emergence in most site-years was congruent with
   predictions 2 and 3. To test whether the two declines were associated
   with increasing flood probability and end of the reproductive season,
   respectively, maximum-likelihood methods were used to compare five
   body-size models: a null model that contains no parameters related to
   flood regime or reproductive season, a seasonal model that incorporates
   a reproductive time constraint, and three disturbance models that
   incorporate both reproductive time constraints and flood dynamics. The
   disturbance models outperformed the other models, suggesting that at
   least some of the body-mass pattern was influenced by flood dynamics.
   The timing of the first flood of the season was the most important
   determinant of observed emergence patterns. Overall, this study
   demonstrates that aquatic insects can compensate for flash floods by
   using state-dependent emergence strategies that are synchronized with
   long-term flood dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Man has a major impact on marine environments through exploitation of

   food availability and predation risk in both target and nontarget
   species. Responses to selection can be observed at two levels. First, at
   the community level, some species may suffer more from effects of
   harvesting than others; some may even increase in abundance. Responses
   by species to exploitation are associated with their life histories. In
   particular, species with late maturation at large size and with low
   population growth rate tend to undergo more pronounced declines than
   early-maturing species with rapid growth. Second, the phenotypic
   composition within species may also change. If phenotypic variability
   has a genetic basis, then fisheries-induced selection can result in
   evolutionary change in life-history traits influencing sustainable

Abstract = {{Fisheries managers have often suggested that survival of trout during
   the winter is a major factor affecting population densities in many
   stream ecosystems in the Rocky Mountains. In Wyoming, trout population
   reductions from fall to spring in excess of 90\% have been documented in
   some reservoir tailwaters. Though biologists have surmised that these
   reductions were the result of either mortality or emigration from some
   river sections, the specific mechanisms have not been defined and the
   factors leading to the trout loss are unknown. This is a review of four
   studies that were conducted or funded between 1991 and 1998 by the
   Wyoming Game and Fish Department to understand the extent of overwinter
   losses, identify some of the mechanisms leading to those conditions and
   develop management strategies to help avoid those impacts. Winter
   studies were conducted on tailwater fisheries in the Green, North
   Platte, Bighorn and Shoshone rivers to document trout population
   dynamics, assess physical habitat availability, evaluate trout movement
   and habitat selection, and understand the relationships between food
   availability and bioenergetic relationships. Results indicate that
   winter trout losses are extreme in some years, that trout movement and
   habitat selection are affected by supercooled flows, and that mortality
   is probably not directly due to starvation. The combination of
   physiological impairment with frequently altered habitat availability
   probably leads to indirect mortality from predators and other factors.

   efficiency (body flexibility and size). Data on benthos assemblages and

   different macrohabitat types (e.g. pools, runs and riffles) of two
   Pyrenean streams demonstrated that: (i) decrease in torrential flow

   invertebrates (e.g. those living in exposed microhabitats and with a

Abstract = {{Anuran larvae exhibit high levels of phenotypic plasticity in growth and
   developmental rates in response to variation in temperature and food
   availability. We tested the hypothesis that alteration of developmental
   pathways during the aquatic larval stage should affect the
   postmetamorphic performance of the Iberian painted frog (Discoglossus
   galganoi). We exposed tadpoles to different temperatures and food types
   (animal- vs. plant-based diets) to induce variation in the length of the
   larval period and body size at metamorphosis. In this species, larval
   period varied with temperature but was unaffected by diet composition.
   In contrast, size at metamorphosis was shaped by the interaction between
   food quality and temperature; tadpoles fed on an animal-based diet
   became bulkier metamorphs than those fed on plant-based food at high
   (22degreesC) but not at low (12degreesC) temperature. Body condition of
   newly metamorphosed frogs was unrelated to the temperature or food type
   experienced during the premetamorphic stage. Frogs maintained at high
   temperature during the larval period showed reduced jumping ability,
   especially when fed on the plant-based diet. However, when considering
   size-independent jumping ability, cold-reared individuals exhibited the
   lowest performance, and herbivores reared at 17degreesC the highest.
   Cold-reared (12degreesC) frogs accumulated larger amounts of energy
   reserves than individuals raised at 17degreesC or 22degreesC. This was
   still the case after correction for differences in body mass, thus
   indicating some size-independent effect of developmental temperature.
   Despite the higher lipid content of the carnivorous diet, the
   differences in energy reserves between herbivores and carnivores were
   relatively weak and associated with differences in body size. These
   results suggest that the consequences of environmental variation in the
   larval habitat can extend to the terrestrial phase and influence
   juvenile growth and survival.}},

Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{The chick-a-dee call of the avian genus Poecile is a structurally
   complex vocal system because it possesses a set of simple rules that
   governs how the notes of the call are ordered, and variable numbers of
   each of the note types strung together can generate an extraordinary
   number of unique calls. Whereas it has been hypothesized that
   chick-a-dee calls with different notes may convey different information,
   no experimental evidence has been offered in support of the hypothesis.
   Previously published studies suggested that flock members use
   chick-a-dee calls in the context of moving to or from a feeding site.
   Here, we tested Carolina chickadees' responses to playbacks of
   chick-a-dee calls that differed in note composition. Playbacks were
   conducted in the field in the context of a novel food source. Our pilot
   data had indicated that chick-a-dee calls with relatively large numbers
   of `C' notes were given by birds on their first contact with a novel
   seed stand. In the present study, we found that chickadees flew in close
   to the playback speaker and subsequently took seed from a seed stand
   more often during playbacks of chick-a-dee calls containing C notes than
   chick-a-dee calls not containing C notes or than control playbacks.
   Vocal responses of chickadees to the playbacks also differed in relation
   to the particular vocal signal being played back. These results indicate
   that receivers respond differently to chick-a-dee calls containing
   different compositions of note types and represent a first step to link
   variation in note composition and ordering in these calls to possible
   meanings. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{959-966}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The costs of singing in birds are poorly understood. One potential type
   of cost is a metabolic cost of singing. Previous studies have measured
   short-term changes in oxygen consumption associated with bouts of
   vocalizations, with equivocal results. In this study, I used an
   alternative approach to measuring the metabolic cost of singing, by
   measuring overnight loss of body mass, in male common nightingales,
   Luscinia megarhynchos, singing at night at different rates. Nightingales
   were shown not to forage at night. They reached a higher mass at dusk
   prior to singing more at night, and lost more mass overnight when dusk
   mass and overnight song rate were high. These results show that singing
   at night is associated with increased overnight consumption of body
   reserves, which represents a significant metabolic cost of singing at
   night. However, the correlation between dusk mass and overnight song
   rate makes it impossible to determine whether these costs arise from the
   energetic costs of the singing itself, or from the metabolic costs of
   the additional body reserves laid down at dusk on nights when song rate
   was high. There are also likely to be costs associated with accumulating
   and carrying these extra body reserves during daylight, as well as other
   potential costs of singing such as an increased risk of predation. These
   results are consistent with those models of signalling in biology that
   predict or assume that honest signals are costly. (C) 2002 The

Abstract = {{Animals living in environments of different quality will have different
   expectations of their future reproductive success and survival. This may
   affect the individual's risk-taking behaviour as manifest in the cost of
   predation. We investigated the foraging behaviour of starlings, Sturnus
   vulgaris, when perceived predation risk varied between patches.
   Short-term food availability varied between treatments and long-term
   differences in perceptions of environmental quality varied between
   groups of individuals. This corresponds to variation in the three
   components of the cost of predation (P): the predation risk (p); the
   change in reproductive value with energy gain (partial
   derivativeF/partial derivativee); and the reproductive value or fitness
   factor (F). The birds showed that they experienced a higher cost of
   predation while using the risky food patches (mu component) and in the
   high food treatment (partial derivativeF/partial derivativee component).
   Furthermore, birds from a high-reward habitat revealed a higher P than
   birds from a poor habitat (F component). The results show that the costs
   of predation are possible to tease apart by using behavioural
   indicators. The method presented allows measurement of fitness prospects
   of individuals, which may have consequences for conservation, for
   example, to identify low-quality habitat. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{(O)bjective: To explain an apparently paradoxical pattern wherein
   sufferers of restrictive anorexia nervosa exhibit both rigorous
   self-restraint and episodic impulsivity. Method: The experimental,

   having once constituted fitness-enhancing responses to resource
   scarcity. It is suggested that an evolved psychological mechanism
   calibrates the individual's sensitivity to risk in light of future
   prospects. Self-injurious behaviors are explicable as misfirings of such

Abstract = {{Background: Little is known as to whether or not the seven personality
   dimensions of Cloninger's theory, particularly the three character
   dimensions newly included in the theory, are independent of the states
   of depression. Methods: One hundred and eight patients with major
   depression filled out the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI)
   before and after a 16-week antidepressant treatment. Results: The level
   of depression, as assessed by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression,
   was correlated positively to the harm avoidance score and negatively to
   the self-directedness and cooperativeness scores. During the treatment,
   the scores on these three dimensions significantly changed toward normal
   values in treatment-responders, but were stable in
   treatment-nonresponders. The changes in these dimensions were
   significantly explained by the change in the depression severity during
   treatment. Scores on novelty seeking, reward dependence, persistence,
   and self-transcendence were not correlated significantly to the level of
   depression and did not change significantly during the treatment in
   either treatment-responders or nonresponders. Limitations: The changes
   in the TCI scores during treatment in this study may reflect a
   non-specific tendency for the scores to change on retest. Conclusions:
   The results suggest that a depressive state can significantly affect
   assessments of harm avoidance, self-directedness, and cooperativeness in
   major depression. The administration of the TCI during a depressive
   episode may elevate the HA score, and may lower the SD and C scores.
   These findings highlight the importance of considering the state of
   depression before drawing conclusions about the TCI personality traits,

Abstract = {{Background: This article selectively reviews the biological bases of
   antisocial and aggressive behavior in children with a focus on low
   autonomic functioning, prefrontal deficits, and early health factors.
   Results: Low resting heart rate is thought to be the best-replicated
   biological correlate of antisocial and aggressive behavior in child and
   adolescent populations and may reflect reduced noradrenergic functioning
   and a fearless, stimulation-seeking temperament. Evidence from
   neuropsychological, neurological, and brain imaging studies converges on
   the conclusion that prefrontal structural and functional deficits are
   related to antisocial, aggressive behavior throughout the lifespan. A
   prefrontal dysfunction theory of antisocial behavior is advanced. This
   argues that social and executive function demands of late adolescence
   overload the late developing prefrontal cortex, giving rise to
   prefrontal dysfunction and a lack of inhibitory control over antisocial,
   violent behavior that peaks at this age. Birth complications and minor
   physical anomalies are selectively associated with later violent
   behavior, especially when combined with adverse psychosocial risk
   factors for violence. Cigarette smoking during pregnancy may increase
   the risk for antisocial and violent behavior in later life by disrupting
   noradrenergic functioning and enhancement of cholinergic receptors that
   inhibit cardiac functioning. Malnutrition during pregnancy is associated
   with later antisocial behavior and may be mediated by protein
   deficiency. Conclusions: It is argued that early health intervention and
   prevention studies may provide the most effective way of reversing
   biological deficits that predispose to antisocial and aggressive
   behavior in children and adults.}},

   The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine the major

   80 was recruited from two East Coast sites of the Women's Health
   Initiative. All the women were participating in the dietary modification
   arm of WHI, had received the same dietary instruction, and were in the
   maintenance phase of the intervention. The women were classified by
   nutritionists as adherent or nonadherent to a diet limiting fat intake
   to <20\% of total calories. Focus groups and telephone interviews were
   conducted, and textual data were coded and sorted using content analysis
   techniques within the four categories of the Stimuli-Organismic
   Factors-Response Repertoire-Consequences (SORC) behavioral model.
   Frequencies of responses within categories were tabulated and compared

   complementary foods, particularly as the distance between the foods
   increased. We manipulated the nutritional composition {[}protein (p) and

   gregarious insects (i.e., they concentrated their feeding mainly on one
   dish). However, results also demonstrated that for both phases fidelity
   to a particular food dish increased as the distance between the dishes
   increased, and that the number of switches between dishes decreased with
   increasing distance. In the smallest arenas, though, gregarious nymphs
   switched more frequently between the two food dishes than solitarious

Abstract = {{Since early history, human beings have been closely exposed to several
   types of traumatic events. Although modern societies have developed a
   more acceptable kind of convivence these traumatic events have become
   increasingly present in the everyday life of any individual in
   underdeveloped societies. This is due to extended problems, like a lower
   income pet, capita, which gives rise to such conducts as violent
   robbery, kidnapping, or murder. Similarly, family desintegration is a
   likely factor leading to the development of interfamily violence, and
   illegal substances traffic and abuse; even weather phenomena (e.g., ``El
   Nino{''}) may trigger a higher incidence of PTSD given the suffering
   brought about by hurricanes or tornados.
   At the Fourth Consensus Group International Meeting on Depression and
   Anxiety, held in Montecatini, Italy, in April 1999, PTSD was regarded as
   the main issue, because of its high prevalence, social impact, and
   financial burden on society. For these reasons, it represents an
   enormous public health problem in both underdeveloped and developed
   countries, During the last three decades, biological guidelines for PTSD
   have been studied and proposed, together with the development of new
   effective treatments.
   Epidemiological studies allow us to calculate the rates of specific
   disorders and their impact on the community and health system. The
   prevalence of the exposure to traumatic events themselves is an
   important part of PTSD study. Recent epidemiological studies have shown
   that about 40 to 90\% individuals from adult community samples have been
   exposed to a traumatic event. Prevalence life rates of PTSD vary from 5
   to 15\% in developed countries. Nowadays, 4 to 6\% of the population
   presents PTSD symptoms, considering only the worst traumatic event (8,
   9, 13, 20, 29, 32, 39).
   In the last two decades, PTSD is an anxiety disorder which has Called
   the attention in research and clinical areas due to several reasons. One
   Of these is that the rates of violence have had a dramatic increase all
   over the world; another one is the identification of their subdiagnosis
   in several places.
   However, not everyone who has been exposed to a traumatic event develops
   PTSD. Several risk factors increase the possibility of its expression
   and chronicity - for instance, to experience the event at early life
   stages, multiple traumatic events, their severity, gender experiencing
   the event, personal stress - and behavior, or psychological problems
   history, comorbid psychopathology, parents' PTSD history,, or subsequent
   exposure to reactivant environmental events.
   Likewise, risk factors can be classified according to the person
   involved and the traumatic event experienced (19, 22). In this sense,
   different studies have shown women have a higher risk than men to
   develop PTSD, in spite of men having an increased exposure to traumatic
   events (13, 20, 37). The psycho-biological development level is
   important when a traumatic event appears, since it has been demonstrated
   that age is a significative factor to develop PTSD: traumatic events in
   childhood have been associated with a higher risk of PTSD and more
   severe symptoms (10). The clinical course of PTSD is often chronic, with
   only 50\% of the patients recovering within two years after the
   incident. Most of those unable tu recover will still show symptoms 15
   years later (32).
   The situation in underdeveloped countries is particularly interesting,
   since traumatic events frequently associated with long wars, hunger,
   politic opression, and sectary violence seem to make PTSD more chronic
   and the profile of its symptoms more complex and disabling than in
   developed countries (21, 23, 38, 45, 46).
   PTSD has a relevant impact on different areas of life, as is revealed
   fur instance in its enormous social costs. Generally, individuals who
   suffer PTSD earn a lower income, present high scholar failure rates, and
   more interpersonal problems compared tu the overall population. In
   addition, the age of onset of the mental disorders has a predictive
   value over educational, birth, marriage, and economic accomplishments
   (8, 23, 24, 27, 28, 30, 32).
   A research conducted among the overall American population estimated
   that 38\% of the individuals with PTSD received some form of treatment
   during a given year. The reason more commonly reported by the remaining
   62\% to refuse getting medical attention was that they did not think
   they had any problem at all (3 1). Often, the traumatic reaction adapts
   over several years and becomes part of the individual's coping style.
   People at risk of PTSD commonly ask for medical help early, but do not
   do so in the psychiatric area. Finally, PTSD brings about less
   stigmatization compared to another psychiatric disorders, because their
   symptoms are considered as natural consequences of a severe traumatic
   event (32).
   Apparently, the presence of psychiatric disorders other than PTSD is the
   rule rather than the exception. According to clinical and general
   populations studies, between 50-90\% of PTSD patients show comorbid
   psychiatric disorders (14-18, 33, 42, 43). PTSD is frequently associated
   with comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as High Depressive Disorder
   (HDD), Anguish Disorder (AD), Social Phobia (SP), Generalized Anxiety
   Disorder, Substance Use Disorder -mostly alcohol- (SUD), Personality,
   Disorders (PD) (e.g., borderline, avoidance, antisocial), and
   Dissociative Disorders (4, 5, 9, 29, 32, 48).
   In brief, the relevance of PTSD study becomes clear due to several
   aspects, Apparently, PTSD is more common than it is thought so. The life
   prevalence of PTSD among the general population is about 8 to 9\%, and
   women have a higher risk to develop PTSD (22). Also, PTSD is more
   frequent after certain kinds of traumatic events (e.g., rape), not
   considering in this case the survivor's gender (29).
   This discussion is divided in two parts. In this first article we will
   analyze some general aspects like the introduction of this disorder in
   the American classification, together with its definition, epidemiology,
   clinic course, effect on the individual's general functioning, and
   comorbidity, with different psychiatric disorders.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we tested the hypothesis that baseline corticosterone
   levels increase with a change from constant to variable feeding
   schedules. Captive red knots, Calidris canutus, were presented with food
   that was either available during the same time each day (constant) or
   starting at variable times during the day. Food intake rates, frequency
   of aggressive interactions, and baseline levels of corticosterone were
   measured. In the majority of cases, red knots showed higher plasma
   corticosterone concentrations during feeding schedules that were
   irregular than when food was available at consistent times. These
   findings are supported by a previous study that showed that red knots
   take a long time to adjust to the newly offered, predictable conditions
   of their aviary environment. The frequency of conflicts in the different
   groups and (size-corrected) body mass were not correlated with average
   corticosterone level. The results are examined in the light of
   literature showing that increases in corticosterone in response to
   acute, unpredictable events mediate behavioral responses such as
   increased explorative behavior and memory. For red knots that have to
   find their food on the temperate-zone mudflats in Western Europe, an
   increased circulating corticosterone level may be adaptive during
   periods when the patchily distribution of buried bivalves and the

   across the 2-y period for most of the girls. The girls who ate large
   amounts of snack foods in the absence of hunger at 5 and 7 y of age were
   4.6 times as likely to be overweight at both ages. Parents' reports of
   restricting their daughter's access to foods at age 5 y predicted girls'
   eating in the absence of hunger at age 7 y, even when the girls' weight
   status and eating in the absence of hunger at age 5 y were controlled
   for.
   Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence that young girls'
   eating in the absence of hunger may represent a stable phenotypic
   behavior of young overweight girls. In addition, these findings are
   consistent with previous work indicating that parents' restrictive
   feeding practices may contribute to this behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Populations in nature face a number of factors that can alter their
   traits and subsequent performance. Predation is one factor that can have
   widespread effects on the mean trait value in a prey population because
   predators can impact prey traits through a number of processes.
   Predators can directly induce prey phenotypes through visual and
   chemical cues, predators can indirectly alter prey phenotypes by
   thinning the prey population (thereby reducing competition), and
   predators can cause selection on prey phenotypes through nonrandom
   killing. Ecologists are beginning to understand each of these three
   processes in isolation, but these processes act on prey phenotypes
   simultaneously, and we lack information on the relative importance of
   these processes in determining the final phenotype of prey.
   I used a system of gray treefrog tadpoles (Hyla versicolor) and
   dragonfly predators (Anax longipes) to determine the separate and
   combined impacts of induction, thinning, and selection on the behavior,
   morphology, and growth of tadpoles reared in aquatic mesocosms. Using
   combinations of hand thinning, cues emitted from caged predators, and
   lethal predators, I demonstrated that the impact of lethal predators on
   growth was mediated primarily through thinning, the impact on morphology
   was primarily through induction, and the impact on behavior was affected
   similarly through thinning and induction. Surprisingly, while we know
   from numerous studies that the dragonflies kill tadpoles nonrandomly,
   selection did not have a significant impact on the final phenotypes of
   the tadpoles. This work appears to be the first study that identifies
   the relative magnitudes of the three predatory processes on a suite of
   prey phenotypes. The three processes can have opposing or supporting
   effects, the relative magnitudes of which likely differ among systems,
   illustrating why we often observe contradictory results when we examine
   the impact of lethal predators on prey phenotypes. Thus, it is important
   that we identify the mechanisms underlying the outcomes of predation,
   rather than simply observing the outcomes and then inferring which
   processes are responsible.}},

Abstract = {{1. Ecological influences on social organization can best be measured by
   comparing populations of a socially variable species living in different

   2. In total, 161 individually identified oribi were observed at five
   sites along an ecological gradient through dry and rainy seasons.
   Behavioural observations and ecological data were used to test the
   relative influence of forage abundance and quality, habitat structure
   and predation pressure on female dispersion and male social behaviour.
   3. Of nine ecological variables that were quantified, forage abundance
   and quality accounted best for variation in female dispersion among and
   within study populations. Specifically, female oribi formed larger
   groups and had smaller ranges where dry season forage was relatively
   abundant and low in fibre.
   4. Male territorial behaviour differed among sites and was related to
   female home range size. Males were most active in territory maintenance
   where females had small home ranges, and males defended a female rather
   than a territory where females ranged widely.
   5. These results show that variation in social organization among oribi

Abstract = {{Shared parental care resulting from brood amalgamation is often
   considered beneficial to parents. However, the benefit of grouping (a
   decline in individual vigilance despite an increase in collective
   vigilance, with a concomitant increase in individual feeding time) has
   not been evoked as a factor promoting shared care. Eider females,
   Somateria mollissima, are subject to substantial energetic costs during
   breeding, and sometimes share brood-rearing duties. We compared the
   activity budgets and feeding behaviour of lone tenders and multifemale
   tenders. We also measured the collective vigilance of multifemale
   tenders and examined whether the coordination of feeding activity among
   females changes with time. As expected, the proportion of time spent
   feeding increased, and the proportion of time spent vigilant decreased,
   as the number of females attending the brood increased. None the less,
   the collective vigilance of multifemale tenders was at least 20\% higher
   than the vigilance of lone tenders. Furthermore, multifemale tending
   allowed females to feed more optimally, as dive duration increased with
   the number of females tending the brood. The level of parental
   investment by individual females after hatching of the eggs is therefore
   related to the number of tending females and, based on previous work, a
   female's body condition when the eggs hatch is also logically connected
   with the number of tending females. Whether females sharing brood care
   on a permanent basis coordinate their feeding activity, so as to
   increase the potential protection of ducklings against predation,
   remains equivocal. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{72}},

Abstract = {{We artificially invaded a set of small islands with the large lizard
   Leiocephalus carinatus to determine effects on food-web elements
   including an intermediate predator, the lizard Anolis sagrei; the latter
   was previously found to have major, mostly direct effects on web
   spiders, as well as detectable indirect effects on aerial arthropods
   (including parasitoids) and leaf damage. In addition to these food-web
   elements, we monitored ground-surface arthropods; they are expected to
   be affected directly; as well as indirectly via A. sagrei, by L.
   carinatus. Five islands were randomly selected for invasion while six
   others served as controls. In addition, four islands without A. sagrei
   were monitored to determine the natural state of the sagrei-free food
   web. We also monitored a variety of A. sagrei's traits, from behavioral
   through physiological and demographic to morphological, to elucidate the
   mechanisms whereby L. carinatus might affect the smaller lizard and to
   evaluate trait-mediated as well as density-mediated effects.
   Comparison of unmanipulated islands with and without A. sagrei showed
   that A. sagrei appeared to be affecting web-spider density and
   diversity, numbers of small aerial arthropods, number of large
   ground-surface arthropods, and two types of leaf damage, scars and
   mines. All effects were negative save one: Small aerial arthropods were
   more abundant with A. sagrei; this variable and parasitoid abundance
   were negatively related to web-spider density, implicating an indirect
   effect pathway from A. sagrei via web spiders.
   Introduction of L. carinatus had major and immediate effects on A.
   sagrei density and perch height; effects on perch diameter, percentage
   hatchlings, and the width of the body,size distribution followed over
   time. Behavioral shifts in habitat use continued to the end of the
   experiment, after changes in population density had mostly leveled off.
   Adult-male body condition became poorer after introduction of L.
   carinatus. Among islands, percentage use of the ground was correlated
   negatively with percentage vegetated area of the island and positively
   with premanipulation relative hindlimb length. We hypothesize that
   longer-legged individuals do better on the ground because they are
   faster there. Conditional evidence for an increase in adult-male
   relative hindlimb length suggested that, when the ground-inhabiting L.
   carinatus was introduced, such individuals were differentially able to
   escape predation.
   Introduction of L. carinatus significantly reversed A. sagrei's effect
   on number of species and density of web, spiders but had no other major
   effects on lower level food-web elements. Thus, a relatively
   short-chained (two links) effect, with a relatively strong second link
   (A. sagrei on spiders), showed the greatest indirect effect of the
   manipulation. Another potentially strong indirect effect, that on large
   ground-surface arthropods, did not occur, possibly because of
   compensatory (direct) predation by L. carinatus. Thus presence of
   omnivory may also be relevant to whether reversal of effects occurs.
   Although most A. sagrei effects were not reversed in the time available
   for the experiment, this may be typical, as natural L. carinatus
   colonizations can dwindle away to extinction over about the same time
   span, producing at best only short-term indirect effects.
   Population-density estimates from other sites and comparisons to other
   experimental studies suggest that, in general, predators on Anolis may
   have erratic effects in space and time.}},

Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{447-452}},

Abstract = {{Foraging decisions may reflect a trade-off between food intake and
   safety and can also be influenced by the animal's internal state.
   Foraging in the web-building spider Stegodyphus lineatus depends on a
   capture web associated with a retreat (the nest). The relocation of
   nests, including the take-over of conspecific nests, may be viewed as a
   foraing decision, which depends on risk of exposure, cost of silk
   production and hunger state. We investigated a possible state-dependent
   trade-off in nest site choice of S. lineatus spiderlings. The
   philopatric nature of S. lineatus implies a high risk of encounters with
   potentially cannibalistic conspecifics and a potential loss of inclusive
   fitness because encountered conspecifics are likely to be kin. To test
   for state dependence of foraging decisions, we compared preferences of
   well-fed and hungry spiders for their own nests and those of siblings
   and nonsiblings. We expected satiated spiders to prefer their own to
   conspecific nests and hungry spiders to choose the risky option of a
   conspecific nest. Since S. lineatus is less aggressive towards kin, we
   tested the ability of spiders to discriminate kin by silk-bound cues.
   Because of this reduced aggression, preference for kin nests should be
   safer than preference for nonkin nests. A strong preference for
   self-nests demonstrated self-recognition in well-fed spiders. However,
   neither well-fed nor hungry spiders discriminated between nests of
   siblings and nonsiblings. Well-fed spiders preferred self-nests to empty
   chambers, but showed no discrimination between nonself-nests and empty
   chambers. Hungry spiders showed a reduced preference for self-nests,
   suggesting that hunger elicits a more risky foraging strategy. A
   tendency of hungry spiders to adopt the nests of conspecific spiders may
   reflect a silk-saving strategy. We conclude that S. lineatus spiders
   show state-dependent decision making in nest site selection. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The interactions between humans and the ocean are significant, and
   necessitate more comprehensive study on an international scale. The
   world's oceans provide great health benefits to humans ranging from food
   and nutritional resources, to recreational opportunities and new
   treatments for human disease. However, recently, human health effects
   from exposure to substances present in the marine ecosystem such as
   synthetic organic chemicals (e.g., chlorobiphenyls, chlorinated dioxins
   and some industrial solvents), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
   metals (both introduced and anthropogenic), marine toxins, and pathogens
   have been recorded and are of great concern. This paper reviews our
   state of knowledge of the interactions between oceans and human health
   and proposes indicators and a research strategy to investigate and
   monitor these relationships more closely. Four approaches to gathering
   information on indicators included here are: biomarkers; cellular
   pathology; physiological and behavioural responses; and changes in
   populations. All hold the potential to enhance our understanding of
   marine environmental quality and far-reaching effects on human health.
   Monitoring systems that include the rapid assessment of contaminants in
   the ecosystem and subsequent risk to human populations, with appropriate
   internationally distributed data bases, need to be developed and
   validated. Such tools would provide early detection of potential
   environmental threats, and enhance the ability to prevent human illness.}},

Abstract = {{Among the most important trade-offs in life history evolution is whether
   to grow larger at the cost of longer development time, or to develop
   more rapidly at the cost of reduced size. For insect herbivores,
   resolution of this trade-off is thought to be strongly influenced by
   feeding ecology and mortality risks. In contrast, how these factors
   might affect the developmental strategies of third trophic level
   organisms, like parasitoid wasps, is less understood. To address this
   question, we compared the development of larval endoparasitoids in the
   families Ichneumonidae and Braconidae that parasitize larval stage
   herbivores in the order Lepidoptera. The campoplegine ichneumonid
   Venturia canescens parasitized concealed hosts and exhibited a
   developmental strategy that favored progeny size over development time.
   In contrast, the closely related ichneumonid Campoletis sonorensis
   parasitized exposed hosts and exhibited the opposite strategy of
   favoring rapid development time over size. The microgastrine braconid
   Microplitis croceipes attacks partially concealed hosts and showed
   evidence of a trade-off between maximizing body size and minimizing
   development times. These results suggested that parasitoids attacking
   apparent, foliar-feeding hosts may favor rapid development time over
   size while parasitoids that attack concealed hosts favor size over
   development time. A broader survey of the literature supported the
   trends found in our experimental studies. The braconids and ichneumonids
   examined in this study also exhibit distinct differences in larval
   feeding and pupation behavior. These developmental traits did not appear
   to affect the size-development time continuum. However, these traits may
   affect the size range of hosts that larval endoparasitoids can
   successfully exploit.}},

   role in determining whether a female will re-investigate a self-marked

   2. Females of the insect predator Orius sauteri avoided areas where the

Abstract = {{Larvae of the salamander Hynobius retardatus have two distinct morphs:
   normal and broad-headed, cannibal morphs. We performed three experiments
   to differentiate among the following hypotheses: The broad-headed morph
   is induced to allow: (1) feeding on nutritious conspecifics; (2)
   exclusion of strong competitors for food or space; or (3) feeding on
   large, tough prey when smaller prey items are unavailable. When newly
   hatched larvae were reared with a heterospecific, Rana pirica (an anuran
   amphibian) tadpoles, the broad-headed morph was induced more frequently
   compared with those reared with conspecifics. The phenotype expressed
   depended on the size of the tadpoles: The broad-headed morph occurred
   more frequently with small and the normal morph with large tadpoles.
   Metamorphosis occurred sooner in larvae fed conspecifics compared with
   those fed heterospecific tadpoles, and the mean growth rate of larvae
   fed conspecifics was significantly faster than that of those fed
   tadpoles, suggesting that the heterospecific tadpoles were less
   nutritive than the conspecifics. These results do not support the
   hypotheses that the broad-headed morph evolved for consuming
   conspecifics because of their better balance of nutrients or for
   excluding strong competitors for food or space. We tentatively conclude
   that the morph evolved to eat large, tough prey, including both
   conspecifics and heterospecific tadpoles. Because H. retardatus usually
   spawns very early in the spring in small ponds partially covered with
   ice and snow, newly hatched larvae may starve from the lack of proper
   food owing to extremely low water temperatures. Thus, the broad-headed
   morph of H. retardatus may represent a cold-habitat adaptation to
   overcome the severe circumstance when the only food items available are
   relatively large conspecifics or heterospecific tadpoles.}},

Abstract = {{1. Anurans exhibit high levels of growth-mediated phenotypic plasticity
   in age and size at metamorphosis. Although temperature and food quality
   exert a strong influence on larval growth, little is known about the
   interacting effects of these factors on age and size at metamorphosis.
   2. Plasticity in growth rates, maximum larval mass, mass loss, larval
   period and size at metamorphosis was examined in Iberian Painted Frogs
   (Discoglossus galganoi Capula, Nascetti, Lanza, Bullini \& Crespo 1985)
   under different combinations of temperature and diet quality.
   3. Temperature and diet had strong effects on the maximum size reached
   by tadpoles throughout the premetamorphic stages. Larval body mass
   varied inversely with temperature. The effect of diet depended on
   temperature; larvae fed on a `carnivorous' diet (rich in protein and
   lipids) achieved a larger size than larvae offered an `herbivorous' diet

   4. Larval period was insensitive to diet composition, and varied only
   with temperature. Primarily the interacting effects of food quality and
   temperature affected size at metamorphosis. Size at metamorphosis varied
   inversely with temperature under the plant- and the animal-based diets.
   However, the carnivorous diet resulted in bigger metamorphs at 17 and 22
   degreesC, but did not influence final mass at 12 degreesC. Maximum size
   over the larval period explained most of the variation in mass loss
   after the premetamorphic growing phase.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the ability of the water flea, Daphnia, to adapt the
   size and structure of its filtering apparatus as a response to
   experimentally increased biomass of inedible filamentous and colonial
   cyanobacteria in a large in situ enclosure experiment. Predator-induced
   phenotypic plasticity in Daphnia has been extensively documented, but
   only a small number of studies have focused on morphological changes
   induced by food quantity and quality. Here we show that Daphnia
   responded to increased biomass of inedible phytoplankton in its
   environment by enlarging the area and the mesh size of its filtering
   apparatus. These observations suggest that Daphnia responds to increased
   concentrations of inedible particles in the same fashion as it does in a
   very low food environment. In our study, daphnids exposed to a high
   biomass of inedible algae, in fertilized enclosures, had significantly
   larger (12-15\%) filter screens attached to their third and fourth limbs
   in comparison to daphnids exposed to a low biomass of inedible algae.
   The mesh size also increased in the same conditions. These results
   suggest that daphnids used their phenotypic plasticity to respond to
   changes in their food quality and quantity. By using this strategy,
   daphnids can maximize their food uptake and hence compensate for the
   scarcity of suitable food encountered in very oligotrophic conditions or
   even in eutrophic conditions when phytoplankton communities are
   dominated by large inedible species.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{677-683}},

Abstract = {{Under predation risk, prey may prioritize antipredator behaviours and
   sacrifice feeding. However, energetically constrained animals may choose
   to sacrifice or change antipredator responses and accept relatively
   greater risk in order to secure food. In this last case, the
   antipredator tactics chosen must balance safety and feeding in such a
   way that costs are minimized and benefits maximized. We studied the
   antipredator behaviour of pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris)
   (Hemiptera: Aphididae) subjected to different periods of food
   deprivation, against the parasitoid Aphidius ervi (Hymenoptera:
   Braconidae). As the energetic internal stress of aphids increased, the
   predominant antipredator response changed from walking away and dropping
   to kicking behaviour, and parasitization avoidance decreased.
   Parasitoids did not show preference between food-deprived and
   nonfood-deprived aphids. Dropping and walking away reduced
   parasitization from 50 to 33\%. These results support the hypothesis
   that the antipredator behaviour of an aphid changes as a function of
   internal stress. By performing less costly behaviour such as kicking
   under energetically constrained conditions, aphids seem to minimize
   their probability of energy shortfall. Given that aphid antipredator
   behaviour is a function of nutritional state, its occurrence under
   natural conditions may match host quality spatial distribution. (C) 2002

   connections to predator-induced plasticity}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{523-540}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Phenotypically plastic responses to environmental change are typically
   compartmentalized by the type of environmental cues that cause the
   induction (e.g., temperature, light), but different types of
   environmentally induced responses might very well be related to each
   other. I used a number of experiments to document competitor-induced
   behavior and morphology in wood frog tadpoles (Rana sylvatica), to
   quantify how competitor-induced changes affected subsequent competitive
   ability, and to investigate the cues responsible for the
   competitor-induced response. Competitors induced wood frogs to increase
   their activity and generally develop larger bodies and smaller tails.
   Further, wood frogs were able to discriminate between intraspecific and
   interspecific competitors. Whereas behavioral responses to competitors
   are well documented, the widespread morphological responses are a new
   discovery; these responses are particularly intriguing because they are
   in the opposite direction of predator-induced responses in tadpoles. The
   competitor-induced phenotypes are not simply an allometric effect, but
   appear to be adaptive responses to competitors; competitor-induced wood
   frogs experienced higher relative growth rates than noninduced wood
   frogs in subsequent performance trials, but past studies suggest that
   the competitor-induced phenotype should experience higher predation
   risk. When responding to competition, wood frogs were not responding
   only to reduced food. They were able to sense changes in both the per
   capita food levels and changes in density (per unit volume) that were
   independent of per capita food level. Thus, these animals have an
   amazing ability to sense changes in their environments and respond in
   very precise ways.
   When one considers competitor-induced responses in light of past studies
   on predator-induced phenotypes in larval anurans, one sees that
   predator-induced traits provide individuals with increased predator
   resistance but decreased competitive ability, whereas competitor-induced
   traits provide individuals with increased competitive ability but
   decreased predator resistance. This suggests that predator- and
   competitor-induced plasticity have evolved an intricate link that
   presents a trade-off between competitive ability and predator resistance
   ability. This trade-off is common across species and makes sense in
   light of the environments in which wood frogs live, ranging from ponds
   with high densities of predators and few tadpoles competing to ponds
   with few predators and extremely high densities of tadpoles competing.
   Further, there is evidence that this type of plasticity trade-off might
   be quite common in other phenotypically plastic taxa.}},

Abstract = {{In an uncertain world, animals face both unexpected opportunities and
   danger. Such outcomes can select for two potential strategies:
   collecting information to reduce uncertainty, or insuring against it. We
   investigate the relative value of information and insurance (energy
   reserves) under starvation risk by offering model foragers a choice
   between constant and varying food sources over finite foraging bouts. We
   show that sampling the variable option (choosing it when it is not
   expected to be good) should decline both with lower reserves and late in
   foraging bouts; in order to be able to reap the reduction in uncertainty
   associated with exploiting a variable resource effectively, foragers
   must be able to afford and compensate for an initial increase in the
   risk of an energetic shortfall associated with choosing the option when
   it is bad. Consequently, expected exploitation of the varying option
   increases as it becomes less variable, and when the overall risk of
   energetic shortfall is reduced. In addition, little activity on the
   variable alternative is expected until reserves are built up early in a
   foraging bout. This indicates that gathering information is a luxury
   while insurance is a necessity, at least when foraging on stochastic and
   variable food under the risk of starvation.}},

Abstract = {{One method proposed for moderating the negative effects of habitat
   isolation is the preservation or restoration of linear landscape
   elements that structurally link isolated habitat remnants. An
   understanding of how animals react to landscape elements and move
   through the landscape is vital for species management and theory
   development. To achieve this understanding, detailed information on
   movement rates and specific movement behavior of individual animals in
   different ecosystems is essential. In an experimental study, we
   investigated whether individuals of Roesel's bush-cricket ( Metrioptera
   roeseli) prefer to use corridors or move over the matrix when they leave
   a habitat patch. We examined whether movement rates and movement angles
   in corridors and matrix differed and whether individuals showed
   edge-avoidance behavior. Differences in these behaviors were analyzed in
   relation to the softness of habitat edges. We found that approximately
   30\% more individuals used the corridor than would be expected if
   dispersal behavior was random. All individuals using the corridor as a
   dispersal route moved to the end of the corridor and into the
   surrounding habitat, which is 1000\% more than would be expected if
   dispersal was random. The edge type ( hard or soft) did not influence
   whether individuals moved through corridors or the matrix. Individuals
   that moved through the corridor moved straighter but slower than
   individuals that moved over the matrix. A higher movement rate over the
   matrix than through corridors may be explained by an increased risk of
   predation, starvation, or dehydration in the open habitat causing
   individuals to move more quickly toward the higher vegetation. Our
   results suggest that individuals avoid the edge and the matrix and that
   the corridor is a preferred alternative for dispersal. We conclude that
   for this species, and probably other similar species of Orthoptera,
   linear elements in the form of corridors have a positive influence on
   the individual's dispersal through the landscape. This demonstrates the
   value of corridors in reducing the negative effect of habitat
   fragmentation on the persistence of local species.}},

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{The response of foraging animals to human disturbance can be considered
   as a trade-off between the increased perceived predation risk of
   tolerating disturbance and the increased starvation risk of not feeding
   and avoiding disturbance. We show how the response of overwintering
   oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus to disturbance is related to their
   starvation risk of avoiding disturbance. As winter progresses,
   oystercatcher energy requirements increase and their feeding conditions
   deteriorate. To survive they spend longer feeding and so have less spare
   time in which to compensate for disturbance. Later in winter, birds
   approach a disturbance source more closely and return more quickly after
   a disturbance. Their behavioural response to disturbance is less when
   they are having more difficulty surviving and hence their starvation
   risk of avoiding disturbance is greater. These results have implications
   for studies which assume that a larger behavioural response means that a
   species is more vulnerable to disturbance. The opposite may be true. To
   more fully understand the impact of disturbance, studies should measure
   both behavioural responses and the ease with which animals are meeting
   their requirements. Conservation effort should be directed towards
   species which need to spend a high proportion of their time feeding, but
   still have a large response to disturbance.}},

Title = {{Infant mental health, new evidence}},
Journal = {{SALUD MENTAL}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{59-67}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article describes infant mental health from two perspectives: why
   it is relevant and how to implement interventions, including preventive
   ones. Topics covered are based on evidence available in scientific
   literature. The first section addresses areas that justify the
   importance assigned to infants and their emotional well-being. One of
   them deals with new information about brain development. Recent
   available information emphasizes the crucial role of
   sensory/experiential input for the development of the brain in terms of
   determining the formation of new synapses, influencing cell migration
   and the ``pruning{''} of refined and dedicated neuronal pathways.
   Experiences (exposure to language, contingent responses by the
   caregiver, motion in space) influence the development of the brain.
   Also, negative and anxiety provoking events as well as psychological
   trauma cause a negative outcome through this effect. Prolonged and/or
   severe trauma has been shown to influence negatively the functioning of
   the limbic system and the capacity of the child to feel empathy and/or
   compassion, to regulate emotions and to learn new information.
   New evidence is reviewed from longitudinal research. Several studies
   have demonstrated that it is possible to ``trace back{''} which elements
   are necessary during early childhood, to put a child at a high risk of
   becoming a criminal or severe offender. These include attributes in the
   child him or herself (restlessness, impulsiveness, lack of fear)
   together with a history of maltreatment and chronically adverse
   experiences. Excessive shyness is another fairly persistent trait from
   early infancy to adulthood. Since these ``risk factors{''} are known,
   particular children could he targeted for early intervention programs.
   A follow up study conducted by some of the authors with infants seen in
   a mental health clinic and followed up to age four, indicates that the
   strongest predictor of the outcome and functioning of the child at age
   four is not the severity or type of problems for which the child was
   originally evaluated. The strongest predictor was the quality of
   parenting and parenting behaviors of the caregivers as assessed during
   infancy. This finding suggests the importance of helping parents as
   early as possible to cope with infant problems in a benign and sensitive
   way, before negative circles of interaction are entrenched and spiral
   into an ongoing negative relationship.
   Together with the studies of risk, those focusing on resilience are
   summarized. Knowing which traits or experiences are protective against
   psychopathology is crucial, in order to promote their flourishing in
   early childhood. Studies with children at high psychosocial risk from
   Kauai, Hawaii as well as with children from other groups in the world
   converge in describing resilient traits in early childhood: an easy
   temperament, a ``social orientation{''}, sense of humor, attractiveness
   and the ability to communicate with others, as well as intelligence.
   Several experiences are protective, such as having few separations from
   the mother and having had a sibling when the index child was at least
   three years old. This knowledge can be used to promote resilient
   features in children and to develop interventions for those at most
   risk.
   Epidemiological evidence suggests that infancy disturbances are not
   rare, but frequent (15 to 20\% of the population). Studies of the
   prevalence of problems like feeding and sleeping disturbances, excessive
   crying and disruptive behavior in infancy point in this direction. This
   justifies the need for early recognition and identification,
   particularly when they are severe. Excessive crying increases the risk
   of the child being abused or shaken; likewise sleep disturbance is
   associated with irritability and hyperactive behavior in the infant.
   Parents who are deprived of sleep are prone to be more negative and to
   feel exhausted. Eating disturbances can be associated with failure to
   thrive. Early malnutrition has been associated with hypertension in
   middle age, as well as with a higher risk of coronary disease. Maternal
   depression and domestic violence are rampant in the perinatal period.
   Maternal depression is associated with more crying and sleeping problems
   in infancy, and hyperactivity and negative behavior in the school age
   child.
   The findings of a survey in a ``well-baby clinic{''} (health
   surveillance clinic) conducted by some of the authors concur in the
   finding that parents are worried about their baby's behavior in all
   these areas and that they readily identify the problems, when asked.
   Furthermore, their worries are justified. This is in sharp contrast with
   the tendency in most pediatric settings to ``wait and see{''} hoping
   that problems in the baby will be solved by themselves.
   The second part of the review focuses on two issues: techniques of
   clinical intervention and preventive strategies and their results. There
   is scant scientific evidence on the efficacy of parent infant
   psychotherapies. Techniques vary widely in their content and their focus
   or target population. Strategies like brief parent-infant psychotherapy
   and the therapeutic consultation are framed psychodynamically and focus
   on the transgenerational transmission of ``fantasmatic{''} interactions
   and projections placed on the infant. These appear more suitable for
   families that are relatively healthier and lacking massive stressors. On
   the other side of the spectrum, techniques such as interactive guidance
   and infant-parent psychotherapy are designed for families under more
   stress, and when the parent child relationship is very negative.
   These strategies are used with ``unreachable families{''}.
   Interactive guidance attempts to focus on what the parents are doing
   well through a videotaped feedback given to them, and gradually
   expanding their repertoire of sensitive and empathic behaviors towards
   the baby. Infant-parent psychotherapy is long term and involves
   interventions that are non traditional, like psychotherapy at home,
   practical help to the parents, and the promotion of a long term
   relationship of trust between the caregivers and the therapist. The
   focus is to achieve a ``corrective attachment experience{''} in the
   parents, which will in turn render them more sensitive and responsive
   towards their baby. Multimodal and flexible techniques are advocated in
   order to tailor the intervention to the particular needs and style of
   each family
   Finally, evidence on the effectiveness of various prevention programs is
   reviewed. These are grouped according to the timing of the intervention,
   from pregnancy to toddlerhood. Evidence suggests that improving marital
   communication and promoting conflict resolution before the baby is born
   may enhance maternal sensitivity and lead to a more secure attachment in
   the infant. There is research on interventions in the perinatal period.
   These include having psychosocial support during the delivery process.
   In addition, ``bonding{''} between newborn and mother (without undue
   intrusion by health care personnel) has positive effects. This involves
   skin to skin contact and early breast-feeding. These simple
   interventions have been shown to promote maternal sensitivity, more
   patience and less behavioral difficulties several months later. The mere
   demonstration of the abilities of the newborn, his or her uniqueness and
   preferences as well as an observation of the baby's perceptual
   abilities, is associated with long term positive behavioral effects. All
   this points to the importance of conducting an intervention during a
   ``sensitive period{''}. Several meta-analytic studies on home visitation
   conclude that these programs are most effective if the intervention has
   a clear focus, is brief and practical help and advice are given to the
   parents on site. 13 7 contrast, with families having a high risk of
   abusing their child, home visitations are the only hopeful strategy so
   far. In this case, home visitation should be long-term and also focused
   on specific problem solving with parents and suggestion of alternative
   strategies of behavior management with the child. In families under
   considerable stress home visitation, together with the opportunity to
   have positive experiences for the infant, in the form of a good day care
   setting, also have a lasting and beneficial effect several years later,
   in terms of better academic performance, reduced psychopathology and
   better parent child relationships.}},

   personality. How can a syndrome that reduces fertility-- and sometimes
   leads to death-- spread so easily? and why is there heritable variance
   for some of the risk factors? Evolutionary models postulate that
   anorexia is a set of coordinated responses to stress that, for other
   mammals and in our own evolutionary past, led to increased survival and
   reproductive success. According to these models, the ``epidemic{''} of
   anorexia that we now see is a ``modern pathology{''}-- an adaptation
   that, due to changes in our environment, has ``gone awry{''} and become
   maladaptive. Changes in both the nutritional environment and the social
   environment of Western culture have led to increased triggering of this
   once-adaptive syndrome, with risk-factors mapping onto social and
   personality features that would have been relevant in our evolutionary
   past. In particular, the triggering role of social stressors related to
   female competition suggests that anorexia may be a symptom of social
   manipulation, and that the low fertility of anorectics may be the result
   of an adaptive strategy of more dominant women to decrease the success
   of their reproductive competitors.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To validate the concept of parent-reported picky eating
   using objective, laboratory-based measures and to identify both child
   and parental precursors and concomitants of picky eating. Method: One
   hundred thirty-five infants were monitored from birth to 5.5 years.
   Behavioral measures of picky eating were obtained from standardized
   feedings at ages 3-5 and 5,5 years in the laboratory and at home. Child
   precursors were measures of infant sucking behavior; parental precursors
   were disinhibition of eating, restrained eating, body dissatisfaction,
   and body mass index. Parentally reported attitudes and behaviors thought
   to be related to pickiness and parental concomitants were taken from the
   Stanford,Feeding Questionnaire. Child Temperament was assessed by the
   Children's Behavior Questionnaire. Results: Picky eaters ate fewer foods
   and were especially more likely to avoid vegetables. Picky girls
   decreased their caloric intake between ages 3.5 and 5-5, whereas all
   other children increased their caloric intake. None of the included
   parental precursors was significantly related to pickiness. Picky eaters
   demonstrated a different sucking pattern with fewer sucks per feeding
   session at weeks 2 and 4. Finally, picky children displayed more
   parent-reported negative affect than nonpicky children. Conclusions:
   Parentally reported picky eating Is associated with a consistent pattern
   of inhibited and selective eating beginning in infancy.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiological research has emphasized that adolescence is associated
   with some temperamental and behavioral traits that are typical of this
   age and that might substantially contribute to both psychological and
   psychobiological vulnerability. The contribution of the important
   developmental rearrangements in neurobiological and
   neuroendocrinological processes has received surprisingly little
   investigation. The present review summarizes recent work in animal
   models, indicating that adolescent rodents exhibit marked peculiarities
   in their spontaneous behavioral repertoire. When compared to adults,
   adolescents show an unbalanced and `extremes-oriented' behavior,
   consisting of an increased novelty seeking, together with decreased
   novelty-induced stress and anxiety, an increased risk-taking behavior in
   the plus-maze, as well as elevated levels of impulsivity and
   restlessness. Age-related discontinuities in the function of
   monoaminergic systems, which are a main target of abused drugs, can
   perhaps account for such a profile. In particular, a peculiar function
   within reward-related dopaminergic brain pathways actually seems to
   underlie the search for novel and rewarding sensations, as well as
   changes in the magnitude of psychostimulant effects. The role played by
   early epigenetic factors in the shaping of novelty-seeking behavior of
   adolescent and adult rodents are also reviewed. Two examples are
   considered, namely, subtle variations in the hormonal milieu as a
   function of intrauterine position and precocious or delayed maturation
   of nutritional independence as a function of changes in time of weaning.
   As for spontaneous drug consumption, a prominent vulnerability to the
   oral intake of nicotine during early adolescence is reported. In
   conclusion, adolescence in rodents may represent a suitable animal model
   with enough face- and construct-validity. Actually, this model is able
   to show behavioral features that resemble those found in human
   adolescents, including vulnerability to the consumption of psychoactive
   drugs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Basic research has revealed that the chemical sensory world of children
   is different from that of adults, as evidenced by their heightened
   preferences for sweet and salty tastes. However, little is known about
   the ontogeny of sour taste preferences, despite the growing market of
   extreme sour candies. The present study investigated whether the level
   of sourness most preferred in a food matrix and the ability to
   discriminate differences in sour intensity differed between 5- to
   9-year-old children and their mothers, by using a rank-by-elimination
   procedure embedded in the context of a game. Mothers also completed a
   variety of questionnaires and children were asked several questions to
   assess whether children's temperament and food preferences and habits
   related to sour preferences. The results indicated that, although every
   mother and all but two of the children (92\%) were able to rank the
   gelatins from most to least sour, more than one-third (35\%) of the
   children, but virtually none of the adults, preferred the high levels of
   sour taste (0.25 M citric acid) in gelatin. Those children who preferred
   the extreme sour tastes wore significantly less food neophobic (P <
   0.05) and tended to experience a greater variety of fruits when compared
   with the remaining children (P = 0.11). Moreover, the children's
   preference for sour tastes generalized to other foods, such as candies
   and lemons, as reported by both children and mothers. These findings are
   the first experimental evidence to demonstrate that sour taste
   preferences are heightened during childhood and that such preferences
   are related to children's food habits and preferences. Further research
   is needed to unfold the relationship between the level of sour taste
   preferred and the actual consumption of sour-tasting foods and flavors
   in children.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Decreased food intake is an important risk factor for
   malnutrition, which is highly prevalent among geriatric patients. The
   emotional nature of the hospitalization experience and the complex
   organizational setting involved in meal production and delivery services
   in institutions increase the risk for decreased food intake. Everyday
   emotions are known to have a particularly strong influence on
   decision-making and behavior in the elderly, and have also been shown,
   in younger populations, to influence food intake and its psychological
   antecedents, such as quality perception and satisfaction judgments. The
   objective of this paper is to study the direct impact of elderly
   patients' everyday emotions on food intake and their indirect effects
   mediated by quality perceptions and satisfaction judgments.
   Methods. Thirty patients (20 women, 10 men, 65-92 age range) in a
   geriatric rehabilitation unit were observed on repeated meal episodes
   (average of 46 care episodes per patient) where they provided
   self-reports for emotions (positive emotions, anger, anxiety, and mild
   depressed feelings), perceived meal quality, and satisfaction. Food
   intake was measured in terms of energy and protein content.
   Results. The impact on food intake was favorable, and both direct and
   indirect for positive emotions, direct and negative for anxiety, direct
   and positive for mild depressed feelings, and indirect and negative for
   anger. Indirect effects were mediated by quality perception judgments
   but not by satisfaction, which was not significantly related to food
   intake.
   Conclusion. Results suggest that, given their impact on food intake,
   measuring and monitoring patients' everyday emotions may be an important
   innovative strategy to improve food intake of elderly patients in
   institutions.}},

Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{311-316}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral responses of prey to their predators can critically alter
   community dynamics. Whether or not a prey responds, clearly depends on
   the effectiveness of that response. The effectiveness on the other hand
   is predicted to depend on predator behavior. Actively searching
   predators can render the behavioral responses in their prey ineffective.
   Nevertheless, most studies investigating the optimal reaction of prey
   treated predators as immobile elements of the environment. I
   experimentally manipulated activity of poolfrog (Rana lessonae) tadpoles
   by keeping them at low and high food levels, and exposed them to three
   species of invertebrate predators (Aeshna cyanea, Anax imperator, and
   Dytiscus marginalis), whose activity also was manipulated through
   different food levels. Satiated, less active predators were more likely
   to kill hungry, more active tadpoles, but hungry predators killed hungry
   and satiated tadpoles about equally often. This result suggests that
   reducing their activity is a more effective strategy for tadpoles if the
   predators themselves are less active. On the other hand, against hungry,
   highly motivated predators, the behavioral avoidance strategies were
   essentially ineffective. Antipredator behavior is generally thought to
   stabilize the dynamics of predator-prey systems. The results presented
   here, however, suggest that the community dynamical consequences of
   antipredator behavior also critically depend on decisions made by
   predators.}},

Abstract = {{Perfectionism is a dimension which has been studied very little as a
   separate entity. It is not even considered as a nosological factor. No
   classification of the medical sciences underlines its importance other
   than to speak of a personality trait, of an aspect, or of a parameter.
   Nevertheless, perfectionism is related to multiple disorders such as
   depression (18, 20, 36), suicide (8, 16, 55), nutritional problems (11,
   28), anxiety (3), obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (53), social
   phobia (2), as well as insomnia (46). Certain authors stress the
   possible role of perfectionism in the development or the persistence of
   a substantial number of these disorders (7, 22, 38). Given these facts,
   it is all the easier to understand the interest shown by clinicians and
   researchers in the subject. Better detection and evaluation of its
   impact on behaviour is important in putting therapies in place (6,53).
   Relationships between perfectionism and fear of failure have been
   approached (21, 51, 54). Correlations between perfectionism and high
   levels of state and trait anxiety have been demonstrated (23). The
   evaluation of perfectionism has been dealt with very little. Some
   questionnaires devote a sub-category to it, such as the Eating Disorder
   Inventory and the Irrational Beliefs Test. However, recently, it has
   been recognized that perfectionism is a multidimensional construct. Two
   Multidimensional Perfectionism Scales have been developed and
   investigated in relative isolation. Frost, Marten, Lahart and Rosenblate
   defined perfectionism as the setting of excessively high standards for
   performance associated with critical self-evaluation. Six dimensions are
   described: concern over making mistakes, high personal standards,
   parental expectations, parental criticism, doubt about quality of
   performance and organization. Internal consistency and validity have
   been established (25, 26). Hewitt and Flett (30, 31, 33, 35) have
   developed another approach where three dimensions of perfectionism are
   described: SOP (Self Oriented Perfectionism) related to high standards
   and self criticism, SPP (Socially Prescribed Perfectionism) related to
   the need of approval from others and fear of negative evaluation, OOP
   (Other-Oriented Perfectionism) reflecting a tendency to set high
   expectations for others and to evaluate them in a demanding way; this
   component is related, especially for males, to self-esteem, hostility
   and authoritarianism. Validity and internal consistency have been
   established too (30, 31, 35). The Frost and al's Multidimensional
   Perfectionism Scale and the Hewitt and Flett's scales are closely
   associated, except concerning the OOP. Because this component could
   provide new information, we have chosen the second scale, referring to
   the French translation and validation of Labrecque (45). EMP is the
   French name of MPS; it is a self-report questionnaire of 45 questions,
   in fact three subscales of 15 items rated on a 7-point Likert-type
   scale. MPS was administered to 617 first year students at the university
   of Liege (table II). Differences are considered according to gender and
   experience of failure ie the fact of repeating an academic year. We
   realized a component analysis with promax rotation. Among the different
   possibilities offered by the scree-test the choice of a 4 factor
   solution stresses the original structure: SOP (14 items), SPP (12
   items), OOP (9 items) and anti OOP (10 items); the last one is
   additional but allows for respecting semantics and saturation of the
   items. The first aim of confirming validity and internal consistency is
   satisfactory.
   In other respects the multidimensional structure of the concept leads to
   consideration of a positive, adaptive perfectionism and a more negative
   perfectionism, facilitating psychopathology (59, 60, 61). So it seems
   interesting to compare the different components of MPS in order to find
   an eventual sex-failure effect. The evaluation of perfectionism is
   obvious, considering it as a personality trait, but it can be used also
   in taking into account stress and its impact, for instance that of
   academic performance (29, 37, 39, 58). Conferring on MPS more pertinence
   in gender differentiation and failure evaluation is an other goal of
   this research. Through the particular choice of statistical results, sex
   and sex-failure effects can be demonstrated: a MANOVA underlines sex
   effect (lambda de Wilks = 0.96, p = 0.001) and sex-failure effect ( de
   Wilks = 0.98, p = 0.05). Structure of MPS is different in four groups
   (FE: women with failure, FnE women without failure, ME: men with
   failure, MnE : men without failure). ANOVA show differences of MPS3,
   MPS1 and MPS2.Far more promising is the use of the LISREL method
   allowing for the construction of a coherent model of relationships
   between some dimensions of MPS and Test-Anxiety, approached here with
   THEE (test d'habilete aux etudes et a leur evaluation) French
   abbreviated version (49) of TASTE (Test for Ability to Study and
   Evaluation). In fact according to the literature of fear of failure,
   girls score higher on anxiety and procrastination but less on
   self-confidence. The structural model shows different pathways, more
   especially between SPP (socially prescribed perfectionism), T2 (sense of
   incompetence) and T1 (anxiety). SOP (self oriented perfectionism) and
   SPP (socially prescribed perfectionism) by girls are very much
   correlated; it seems that they are more subjected to society and its
   exigencies of studying but consequently they are more at risk of anxiety
   and a sense of incompetence. SOP (self oriented perfectionism) by boys
   functions more indiscriminately of SPP (socially prescribed
   perfectionism) and is negatively correlated with self-incompetence; boys
   are more self-confident but they usually procrastinate more probably
   because failure expectancies would be particularly harmful for their
   self-esteem; consequently, failure should be related to something else
   than their own capacity; this maybe an explanation of the high rate of
   male dropouts and failure in the first year at the university of Liege;
   also a factor explaining the female domination at the university. In the
   same way the first choice of studies is moving towards shorter and less
   difficult orientation (46). In case of failure the model is very similar
   according to gender: SOP (self oriented perfectionism) and T1 (anxiety)
   are directly connected; SOP and SPP are in this case better correlated
   by boys but the path between SPP, sense of incompetence and anxiety is
   less significant than in girls. In conclusion, providing some
   modifications according to semantics, the choice of a four factor
   solution allows for confirmation of the original structure of MPS and
   for internal consistency. The different components of MPS vary according
   to gender: SOP and more OOP discriminate men and women; SPP allows for
   differentiating women with failure. A structural model enhances the role
   of perfectionism in the cognitive and behavioural contexts; for instance
   it clarifies its action on fear of failure and success rates according
   to gender.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: FRESH START is a randomized controlled trial that will test
   whether a personally tailored, distance-medicine-based program will
   increase exercise and fruit and vegetable consumption, and decrease fat
   intake of individuals recently diagnosed with breast or prostate cancer.
   Methods: Early-stage breast and prostate cancer cases (N = 530) will be
   identified within 9 months of diagnosis from hospital cancer registries
   and large oncologic practices throughout the United States. These
   individuals will be sent a letter of invitation and screened for
   eligibility. After a baseline telephone interview, participants will be
   randomized into one of two arms that receive materials aimed at
   increasing exercise and fruit and vegetable intake, and decreasing
   dietary fat: 1) an experimental arm that receives a workbook and a
   series of six 4-page newsletters delivered every 7 wk and personally
   tailored on type of cancer, cancer coping style, race, age,
   self-efficacy, stage of readiness, and barriers and/or progress toward
   goal behavior (i.e., greater than or equal to 30 min of exercise at
   least 5 d(.)wk(-1), greater than or equal to 5 servings of vegetables
   and fruit per day, and less than or equal to 30\% of calories from fat);
   or 2) a control arm that receives a series of nontailored health
   brochures. Follow-up interviews scheduled 1 and 2 yr postbaseline will
   determine short- and long-term efficacy and the effects of the
   interventions on other endpoints (quality of life, perceived health,
   etc.). Factors, such as gender, race, and social support, also will be
   explored to determine potential interactions with program efficacy.
   Conclusion: Given the growing number of cancer survivors,
   distance-medicine-based interventions addressing multiple behaviors and
   targeting this high-risk group have the potential to make a positive and
   broad public health impact.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of phenotypic plasticity typically focus on traits in single
   ontogenetic stages. However, plastic responses can be induced in
   multiple ontogenetic stages and traits induced early in ontogeny may
   have lasting effects. We examined how gray treefrog larvae altered their
   morphology in four different larval environments and whether different
   larval environments affected the survival, growth, development, and
   morphology of juvenile frogs at metamorphosis. We then reared these
   juveniles in terrestrial environments under high and low intraspecific
   competition to determine whether the initial differences in traits at
   metamorphosis affected subsequent survival and growth, whether the
   initial phenotypic differences converged over time, and whether
   competition in the terrestrial environment induced further phenotypic
   changes. Larval and juvenile environments both affected treefrog traits.
   Larval predators induced relatively deep tail fins and short bodies, but
   there was no impact on larval development. In contrast, larval
   competitors induced relatively short tails and long bodies, reduced
   larval growth, and slowed larval development. At metamorphosis, larval
   predators had no effect on juvenile growth or relative morphology while
   larval competitors produced juveniles that were smaller and possessed
   relatively shorter limbs and shorter bodies. After 1 month of
   terrestrial competition among the juvenile frogs, the initial
   differences in juvenile morphology did not converge. There were no
   differences in growth due to larval treatment but there were differences
   in survival. Individuals that experienced low competition as tadpoles
   experienced near perfect survival as juvenile frogs but individuals that
   experienced high competition as tadpoles suffered an 18\% decrease in
   survival as juvenile frogs. There were also morphological responses to
   juvenile competition, but these changes appear to be due, at least in
   part, to allometric effects. Collectively, these results demonstrate
   that larval environments can have profound impacts on the traits and
   fitness of organisms later in ontogeny.}},

Abstract = {{The ``mainstream{''} evolutionary psychology model is currently under
   criticism from scientists of other persuasions wanting to expand the
   model or to make it more realistic in various ways. We argue that
   focusing on the environment as if it consisted only of social (or
   sociocultural) factors gives too limited a perspective if evolutionary
   approaches are to understand the behavior of modern humans. Taking the
   case of violence. we argue that numerous novel environmental factors of
   nutritional and physical-chemical origin should be considered as
   relevant proximate factors. The common thesis presented here is that
   several aspects of the biotic or abiotic environment are able to change
   brain chemistry, thus predisposing individuals to violence and
   aggression in given contexts, In the past. aggressive behavior has had a
   number of useful Junctions that were of particular importance to our
   ancestors' survival and reproduction. However some of the conditions in
   our novel environment, which either lowered the threshold for aggression
   or released such behavior in contexts which were adaptive in our
   evolutionary past, no longer apply. It is high time evolutionary
   approaches to violence are expanded to include the possibilities that
   violence may be triggered by nutritionally depleted foods, reactive
   hypoglycemia caused by habitual intake of foods with a high glycemic
   index (GI). food allergies/intolerances and exposure to new

Abstract = {{Although group living can confer benefits to individuals in terms of
   reduced predation risk and enhanced foraging success, it may also be
   associated with costs, such as increased competition for food. The
   nutritional state of an individual could therefore affect its readiness
   to join or remain in groups. We investigated the shoaling behaviour of
   banded killifish by following marked individuals, whose nutritional
   state had been experimentally manipulated, and recording their shoaling
   behaviour in a field enclosure containing unmarked conspecifics.
   Overall, food-deprived fish spent more time alone, and therefore less
   time shoaling, than well-fed individuals. When shoaling, however,
   food-deprived fish were not found in smaller shoals than well-fed
   conspecifics. Furthermore, they did not show a greater latency to shoal
   initially. Having joined a shoal, however, food-deprived fish left
   shoals more frequently to be alone than fed fish. Rates of change in the
   membership size of shoals occupied by either well-fed or food-deprived
   fish did not differ. We conclude that nutritional state seems to affect
   an individual's decision to continue shoaling once an association has
   been made. This study is the first to investigate experimentally
   state-dependent changes in the size of social groups in fish under field

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{State dependence is thought to be an important factor in resource
   allocation decisions, particularly in those decisions relating to
   parental care. Incubation behaviour is a costly part of avian parental
   care, and therefore likely to depend on the parent's body condition. We
   manipulated the body condition of zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata,
   during incubation by using prelaying diets of different protein content,
   and induced birds to lay a similar number of eggs. We tested the
   hypothesis that birds in better body condition would invest more in
   incubation than birds in poorer condition when incubating on the same
   diet. Females that had received a high-protein prelaying diet lost more
   body mass than those that had received a low-protein diet. They also
   increased the length of their incubation bouts between early and middle
   incubation, whereas females that had received a low-protein prelaying
   diet increased bout length only between middle and late incubation.
   There were no differences between males from the two diet groups, and
   males were responsible for a lesser proportion of incubation than
   females. These results indicate that incubation behaviour is state
   dependent in female zebra finches, and that birds of different body
   condition adopt different incubation strategies. We found no differences
   in incubation duration and hatching success between the two incubation
   strategies in captivity, but the potential risk of nest predation in the
   wild may differ. We suggest that only females in good condition can
   afford to adopt a strategy of increasing bout length early in
   incubation; females in poorer condition first have to recover their body
   condition after having produced a clutch. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Elucidating the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up forces in
   communities of phytophagus insects has been a major historical focus.
   Current consensus is that both forces play a role, but it is poorly
   known if these forces act differently on herbivores in the same
   assemblage and what factors underlie this variation. Using manipulative
   experiments with an assemblage of sap-feeding phytophagous insects (six
   species of plant-hoppers, leafhoppers, and heteropteran bugs) inhabiting
   intertidal Spartina marshes, we examined the association between
   herbivore behavior, risk of predation, and ultimately the relative
   impact of top-down (wolf spider predation) and bottom-up (host-plant
   nutrition) factors on the population density of each sap-feeding
   herbivore.
   A factorial experiment on open Spartina islets in the field (two levels
   of plant nutrition crossed with two levels of spider predation) showed
   that bottom-up and top-down manipulations differentially affected the
   various sap-feeders. Overall, bottom-up effects dominated in this
   sap-feeder community, whereby the density of all six sap-feeders
   increased when the nitrogen content of Spartina was elevated. By
   contrast, wolf-spider addition significantly suppressed populations of
   only the Prokelisia species and had little impact on the other four
   sap-feeder species in the community. Functional-response experiments and
   behavioral studies revealed that certain species (Prokelisia
   planthoppers) were at much higher risk of attack by wolf spiders than
   other sap-feeders in the assemblage and that risk of predation was
   associated with a species' particular ``escape/defensive behavior.{''}
   Moreover, risk of spider predation was roughly linked to the strength of
   top-down impacts in the field, because species with ineffective escape
   behaviors and a high risk of spider attack (Prokelisia planthoppers)
   were the only sap-feeders whose populations were suppressed by spider
   predation in the field. Thus, specific behavioral characteristics of the
   sap-feeders on Spartina influenced risk of predation and the relative
   strength of top-down and bottom-up impacts on their population dynamics.
   Notably, all herbivores in this system were positively influenced by
   elevated plant nutrition, only the common sap-feeder species (Prokelisia
   planthoppers) were adversely affected by spider predation, and it was
   the rarer sap-feeders in the assemblage that were least impacted by
   predation. These results call into question the overall pervasiveness of
   top-down forces and underscore the primacy of basal resources in
   structuring this community of phytophagous insects.}},

Abstract = {{Bisphenol A (BPA) is an environmental estrogen with potentially averse

   vehicle was administered orally to mother rats from mating to pups'
   weaning, at a concentration (0.040 mg/kg) within the range of human
   exposure. The offspring of both sexes were tested at adolescence
   (postnatal days 35-45) for novelty preference (experiment 1). After a
   3-day familiarization to one side of a two-chamber apparatus, on day 4
   rats were allowed to freely explore the whole apparatus. BPA-exposed
   females spent significantly less time than did controls in. exploration
   of the novel side (i.e., increased neophobia), whereas no effect was
   found in the male group. At adulthood, the same animals were food
   deprived and tested for profiles of impulsive behavior (experiment 2),
   in operant chambers provided with two nose-poking holes (delivering
   either five or one food pellet). After the establishment of a baseline
   preference for the large reinforcer, a delay was introduced before the
   delivery of the five food pellets, which was progressively increased
   each day (10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 80, 100 sec). As expected, all animals
   exhibited a progressive shift toward the immediate but smaller
   reinforcer. A reduced level of impulsive behavior (i.e., a shift to the
   right in the intolerance-delay curve) was evidenced in BPA-treated rats.
   The frequency of inadequate responding (during the length of the delay)
   also provided a measure of restless behavior. Interestingly, the profile
   of BPA-treated males was feminized, strongly resembling that of control
   females. Animals were then tested (experiment 3) for the response to an
   amphetamine challenge (I mg/kg, subcutaneously). The drug-induced
   increment activity was significantly less marked in BPA-treated male
   rats compared with controls. These findings provide clear indirect
   evidence of long-term alterations in brain monoaminergic function after
   perinatal BPA exposure. This may be a cause for concern for public
   health, confirming that exposure to a weak environmental estrogen in the
   period of sexual differentiation of the brain can influence adult
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate factors promoting monogamy, we studied the reproductive
   behaviour and ecology of the monogamous Caribbean cleaner goby at two
   sites near St Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. We assessed mate fidelity and
   the amount of time required to acquire a new mate in experimentally
   widowed males and females. We also measured behavioural responses of
   pair members and single females to experimentally introduced conspecific
   intruders of both sexes. Finally, we evaluated the distribution of
   suitable habitat relative to existing goby territories. We found that
   pairs often separated due to males abandoning females and moving to a
   new territory, that most widowed fish soon acquired a new mate, and that
   there was strong aggression towards large same-sex intruders. We also
   found an abundance of suitable, unoccupied habitat. We conclude that
   pairs are maintained by intrasexual aggression that is related to both
   mate availability and other resources, such as high-quality, food-rich
   cleaning stations. Combined with observations of frequent pair
   separation, interterritory male movement, and relatively rapid remating

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1035-1044}},

Abstract = {{As foraging becomes more unpredictable animals should increase their
   body reserves to reduce the risk of starvation. However, any increases
   in reserves may increase the risk of predation because extra mass
   probably compromises escape ability. Because of differences in foraging
   ability not all individuals will be affected in the same way by changes
   in foraging conditions. Relatively poor foragers will have more
   unpredictable foraging success for any given availability of food and
   therefore should carry larger body reserves. The mass-dependent
   predation hypothesis then predicts a negative correlation between levels
   of body reserves and foraging ability, although this may be modified by
   state-dependent compensation. I measured foraging rates and body masses
   of wintering European blackbirds, Turdus merula. Individuals with the
   lowest foraging rates had the largest gain in mass for the winter and
   had relatively high mass overall, independently of age and sex. That
   foraging rate determined mass rather than the reverse was demonstrated
   because foraging rate was independent of daily and seasonal mass change.
   Foraging rate within the experimental system was also independent of
   predation risk (as measured by distance from protective cover) and so
   the relation between mass and foraging rate was unlikely to have been
   confounded by any changes in vigilance to compensate for increased
   mass-dependent predation risk. The results suggest that blackbirds with
   high relative foraging rates have lower body reserves during the winter.
   Therefore there is probably a direct link between overwinter condition
   and fitness at least in blackbirds. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Nestling birds face a dilemma: they can increase parental provisioning
   by begging more intensively, but by doing so may also increase their
   risk of predation. Nestlings could deal with this dilemma by reducing
   begging intensity after parents have warned them of a nearby predator.
   We therefore tested experimentally whether nestling scrubwrens,
   Sericornis frontalis, increase begging intensity with hunger but reduce
   it after adult alarm calls. Single 5- and 8-day-old nestlings were
   temporarily taken into the laboratory for playback experiments. Over a
   90-min period of food deprivation we simulated parental visits every 10
   min by playing back adult feeding calls. Hungrier nestlings begged
   louder and longer to simulated parental visits, but contrary to
   expectation did not beg less if they had previously heard playback of
   alarm calls, and even begged to the alarm calls themselves. The results
   were similar for both `mobbing' and `flee' alarm calls. Nestlings also
   gave distinctive calls in the 10-min interval between simulated parental
   visits, and the number of these calls increased with hunger and after
   playback of alarm calls. We suggest that nestlings acquire the ability
   to respond appropriately to alarm calls late in the nestling period and
   that therefore parents might be selected to avoid alarm calling when
   defending young nestlings. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on

Abstract = {{Background: Certain aspects of the personality may be associated with

   to examine the familiality of the 7 scales of the Temperament and

   genetic vulnerability to develop depression.
   Methods: Probands with depression and their nearest-aged siblings from
   Wales were compared with healthy control probands and their nearest-aged
   siblings on the TCI and measures of depressed mood.
   Results: All 7 scales of the TO were familial, and scores on 6 of the
   scales were similar to US population scores. However, the Welsh
   subjects' scores on the self-transcendence scale were markedly lower
   than the US mean, suggesting strong cultural or national influences on
   this measure. Harm avoidance scores were substantially influenced by
   current and past depression, but this scale also showed stable traitlike
   characteristics that are likely related to the genetic vulnerability to
   depression. Novelty seeking and self-directedness were also partly
   state-dependent and were negatively correlated with low mood; high
   scorers may be resilient to the development of depression. High reward
   dependence may also protect against the development of depression and is
   unrelated to mood state. The cooperativeness, persistence, and
   self-transcendence scales appear to have a limited relationship with the
   development of depression.
   Conclusions: Harm avoidance, reward dependence, novelty seeking, and
   self-directedness have traitlike characteristics that are related to the
   familiality of depression. Cooperativeness, self-transcendence, and
   persistence are also familial, but this appears to be unrelated to

   living examples provide accounts of how medicinal plants were obtained
   by observing the behaviour of animals. Animals too learn about the
   details of self-medication by watching each other. To date, perhaps the
   most striking scientific studies of animal self-medication have been
   made on the African great apes. The great ape diet is often rich in
   plants containing secondary compounds of non-nutritional, sometimes
   toxic, value that suggest medicinal benefit from their ingestion.
   Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), bonobos (Pan paniscus) and gorillas
   (Gorilla gorilla) are known to swallow whole and defecate intact leaves.
   The habit has been shown to be a physical means of purging intestinal
   parasites. Chimpanzees and man co-existing in sub-Saharan Africa are
   also known to ingest the bitter pith of Vernonia amygdalina for the
   control of intestinal nematode infections. Phytochemical studies have
   demonstrated a wide array of biologically-active properties in this
   medicinal plant species. In light of the growing resistance of parasites
   and pathogens to synthetic drugs, the study of animal self-medication
   and ethno-medicine offers a novel line of investigation to provide
   ecologically-sound methods for the treatment of parasites using
   plant-based medicines in populations and their livestock living in the
   tropics.}},

Abstract = {{Whole grains are important dietary constituents as they provide a
   plethora of nutrients and protective chemicals that may have synergistic
   actions in promoting health. Regular consumption of wholegrain foods has
   been associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases such as
   CHD and certain cancers, although their exact role in disease prevention
   is not yet fully elucidated. Studies reporting levels of whole grain
   consumption reveal that those subjects who include higher levels of
   whole grain foods in their diets also have many other favourable dietary
   and lifestyle practices. While the actions of these practices and whole
   grains may not be mutually exclusive, these variables do not appear to
   explain the reduction in risk of disease observed for high-whole grain
   consumers. Actual whole grain consumption levels are extremely low and
   many practical barriers exist to consumer uptake of these foods.
   Effective communication of the whole grain health message is an
   important strategy to increase awareness of the importance of whole
   grains in the diet. Increasing the variety and availability of
   acceptable wholegrain foods is also important. Whole grain consumption
   at breakfast can have an important impact on total daily nutrient
   intakes. This simple dietary modification is potentially relatively easy
   to achieve and could greatly contribute to increased whole grain intake
   for many individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Behaviours or traits associated with aggression and communication may
   increase an animal's conspicuousness to predators or parasitoids. Most
   examples of this come from instances of aggression or communication
   within a species. We tested whether interspecific encounters between
   ants enhance the host location success of a parasitoid (Diptera:
   Phoridae) that attacks ants in the genus Linepithema. At food resources
   recruited to by Linepithema, parasitoid discovery rates were lower when
   Linepithema was alone than when other ant species were present. In
   experimentally controlled encounters, parasitoid discovery rates were
   elevated when Linepithema confronted an ant species that elicited use of
   chemicals, but not when it confronted an ant species that primarily
   elicited physical aggression. These results indicate that phorid
   parasitoids of Linepithema use the ant's chemicals as host location
   cues. Because Linepithema is known to abandon food resources in the
   presence of its phorid parasitoids, its use of chemicals during
   interspecific encounters may diminish its competitive success when
   phorids are nearby. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf or The

   schools (predominant age 12-16 years) in three distinct socioeconomic
   areas of Zhejiang province, eastern China.
   Results: Data were obtained for 4197 participants. No significant

Title = {{Eating disorders and personality.}},
Journal = {{SALUD MENTAL}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Eating disorders are characterized by severe disturbances in eating
   behavior. This section includes two specific diagnoses: anorexia nervosa
   (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). AN is characterized by the refusal to
   maintain a minimally normal body weight. There are two subtypes: the
   restricting type (RAN) and the binge-eating/purging type (BPAN).
   BN is characterized by repeated episodes of binge eating followed by
   inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting;
   misuse of laxatives, diuretics or other medications; fasting, or
   excessive exercise. Disturbances in body shape and weight perception are
   an essential feature of both diagnoses.
   Studies of AN among females in late adolescence and early adulthood have
   found a prevalence rate between 0.5\%-1.0\% in the general population.
   In recent decades, the incidence appears to increase.
   The prevalence of BN among adolescent and young adult females is
   approximately 1\%-3\%; the rate of occurrence of this disorder in males
   is approximately one-tenth of that in females.
   The argument for the study of the personality in the eating disorders is
   based in the observation of specific patterns of behaviors: in BN, a low
   tolerance for frustration and a peer impulse control; on AN,
   inflexibility and the need for having a severe control.
   Psychometric studies have consistently linked AN to a cluster of
   moderately heritable personality and temperamental traits, specifically:
   obsessionality, perfectionism, and harm avoidance.
   In this regard, it has been speculated that phenotype similarities
   between these traits of the anorexic's dietary restrain may be based
   upon shared genetic and environmental factors. While such traits may be
   exaggerated by starvation, their persistence after recovery supports the
   speculation that such traits may be risk factors for AN, rather than
   merely consequences of the disorder.
   Several analogies between eating disorders and depression, borderline
   personality, and obsessive-compulsive personality traits have been
   found. Nevertheless, it is very difficult to detect a single personality
   disturbance related to eating disorders.
   The presence of personality disorders in patients with eating disorders
   goes from 53\% to 93\%, and it has been observed that the presence of
   one or more personality disorders is more frequent in eating disorders
   than in the general population, but still more present in BN patients
   with a previous history of AN.
   Different studies in eating disorders patients had shown the presence of
   obsessive traits in approximately 27\% to 61\%, shy and dependence in
   21\% to 48\%, and anxiety in 51\% to 64\% of the cases. Several studies
   had concluded that the predominant personality traits in eating
   disorders (69\% to 87\%) are a combination of obsessive traits,
   inhibition, and conformism.
   It has been described that almost 30\% of the patients present obsessive
   personality traits and it has been demonstrated that the RAN presents a
   lower psychiatry comorbidity compared to any other eating disorder, even
   though these patients are more isolated and do not accept hunger
   sensations or distress.
   The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), Eysenck
   Personality Questionnaire (Eysenck) and Temperament and Character
   Inventory (TCI) had been used to rate personality traits of patients
   diagnosed with eating disorders.
   It has been found that social phobia disorder was more frequent in AN
   patients (14\%-16\%), followed by the dependent disorder (5\%-10\%), and
   finally, the obsessive-compulsive disorder (6\% to 7\%).
   It has been described that 30\% of the patients have an obsessive
   personality. In fact, there are clinical similitudes between obsessive
   personality and eating disorders with restrictive behaviors. It is more
   common to detect several personality disorders in patients with BPAN
   while patients with RAN suffer of more anxiety and isolation.
   Typically, individuals with BN are within the normal weight range,
   although some may be slightly under or overweight. The disorder is
   uncommon among moderately and morbidly obese individuals. There is an
   increased frequency of depressive symptoms or mood disorders (43.5\%),
   particularly dysthymic disorder and major depressive disorder. There may
   be also an increased frequency of anxiety symptoms or anxiety disorders
   (69\%). Substance abuse, or dependence (18.5\%), particularly involving
   alcohol and stimulants, occurs in about one-third of the individuals
   with BN. Probably between one-third and one-half of the individuals with
   BN also have personality features that meet the criteria for one or more
   personality disorders, specially the borderline personality disorder.
   Several clinical personality instruments agree to characterize BN
   patients as impulsive persons with a high sensibility toward
   interpersonal relationships with low self-esteem, unpredictable
   behaviors, aggressiveness, and poor impulse control.
   In conclusion, there are several personality risk factors for anorexia
   nervosa and bulimia nervosa, some of which are shared with other
   psychiatric disorders. Factors that increase the likelihood of
   impulsivity seem to have more influence for bulimia nervosa than for
   anorexia nervosa. perfectionism and negative self-evaluation appear to
   be particularly common and characteristic of both caring disorders.
   However, while anorexia nervosa patients might have a higher
   persistence, bulimia nervosa patients seem to have an impulsive
   temperament. According to the conceptual model proposed by Cloninger,
   both anorexia and bulimia present lower scores in the self-directness
   dimension.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral adaptations and the underlying neural plasticity may not
   simply result from peripheral information conveyed by sensory inputs.
   Central neuronal networks often spontaneously generate neuronal activity
   patterns that may also contribute to sensorimotor integration and
   behavioral adaptations. The present study explored a novel form of
   sensory-induced plasticity by which the resulting changes in motor
   output depend essentially on the preexisting functional state of an
   identified neuron of an endogenously active central network. In the
   isolated lobster stomatogastric nervous system, electrical stimulation
   of a mechanosensory nerve transiently inactivated rhythmic spike
   bursting in the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the pyloric motor
   pattern-generating network. Repeated sensory nerve stimulation gradually
   and long-lastingly strengthened the bursting of the LP neuron to the
   detriment of sensory-elicited inactivation. This strengthening of
   pyloric-timed rhythmic activity was enhanced by experimental
   depolarization of the neuron. Conversely, when the LP neuron was
   hyperpolarized, the same sensory stimulation paradigm now gradually
   increased the susceptibility of the pyloric-timed bursting of the
   network neuron to sensory-elicited inactivation. Modulation of
   depolarization-activated and hyperpolarization-activated ionic
   conductances that underlie the intrinsic bursting properties of the LP
   neuron may contribute via differential voltage-dependent recruitment and
   effects to the respective adaptive processes. These data therefore
   suggest a novel state-dependent mechanism by which an endogenously
   active central network can decrease or increase its responsiveness to
   the same sensory input.}},

Abstract = {{1. Although parasitoids are used widely as a biological models for
   understanding the evolution of animal behaviour, most studies have been
   constrained to the laboratory. The dearth of field studies has been
   compounded by the almost complete ignorance of the physiological
   parameters involved in foraging and dispersal, in particular of the
   energetic constraints imposed by resource limitation.
   2. We estimated the dynamics of carbohydrates and lipids reserves of
   Venturia canescen s (Gravenhorst) females by releasing individuals of
   known nutritional status in a natural environment and recapturing them
   using host-containing traps. The recapture rate was around 30\%. These
   results were compared with the reserves of caged animals kept under
   different experimental conditions (freshly emerged, starved to death,
   fed ad libitum and partially starved). Wild animals were also sampled in
   order to estimate the resource levels of the local population.
   3. The results show that: (i) wasps are able to maintain a nearly
   constant level of energy over an extended foraging period; (ii) V.
   canescens takes sugars in the field; and (iii) the lipid reserves
   accumulated during the larval life may be limiting as lipogenesis does
   not take place in adults even under conditions of high sugar
   availability.
   4. These results demonstrate that wasps can forage for hosts and food
   and disperse in this habitat for hours and days without running into a
   severe risk of energy limitation.}},

Abstract = {{I Because of the large numbers within a colony and their aggressive
   nature, red wood ants (Formica rufa group) have a potential to greatly
   influence the cold-temperate forest ecosystem. Wood ants are omnivorous
   and hunt in trees as well as on the forest floor.
   2 A field experiment in a mixed forest in central Sweden was carried out
   to examine (i) the foraging behaviour of wood ants on the forest floor
   and (ii) the impact of increased numbers of wood ants on the soil fauna.
   The foraging behaviour of wood ants was manipulated by excluding the
   ants from their food resources in the tree canopy, with the intention to
   increase ant activity on the forest floor. To estimate this activity,
   the number of trees with foraging ants, the numbers of ants going to and
   from their nests and the prey carried by home-running wood ants were
   determined during the summer period. Pitfall traps were placed in the
   soil to determine effects on mobile soil invertebrates.
   3 When excluded from local trees, wood ants searched other trees further
   away from the nests rather than searching more intensively for prey on
   the forest floor. By contrast to the initial hypothesis, more
   soil-living prey were caught by ants in the control plots than in the
   plots where the local trees were not accessible to the wood ants. The
   proportion of soil-living to tree-living prey tended to be greater in
   the control plots.
   4 In the treated plots (no access to the trees), wood ants had a
   negative effect on the activity of Linyphiidae spiders. There was little
   effect of wood ants on other soil invertebrates.
   5 This study suggests that the role of wood ants as top predators in the
   forest soil food-web in central Sweden is limited.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of metabolic load and 12 h of food deprivation on the
   behavioural and physiological responses toward novel food were examined
   in dairy cows provided with 4 kg of carrots as novel food and observed
   using video for the initial 10 min. In Experiment 1, effects of 12 It of
   food deprivation were tested using dairy cows provided with 4 kg of
   carrots as novel food after 0 It versus 12 h of food deprivation (N =
   22). Food deprivation did not affect the approach-avoidance behaviour
   toward novel food but led to increased attempts to steal usual food from
   neighbours (P < 0.05) as well as decreased self-grooming (P = 0.05). In
   Experiment 11, effects of milking frequency and energy density in the
   food on behavioural and physiological responses toward novel food were
   examined in a 2 x 2 factorial experiment (N = 40). The two factors were:
   (a) milking frequency: milked twice daily (04:30 and 15:30 h) (2) versus
   three daily milkings (04:30, 12:45 and 21:30 h) (3); and (b) energy
   density in the food after calving: low (25\% concentrates) (L) versus
   high (75\% concentrates) (H). An extra daily milking affected the
   approach-avoidance behaviour of the cows-as shown by reduced time spend
   away from the novel food (P = 0.01) and reduced frequency of sniffing
   the novel food (P < 0.05). Low energy density in the food led to
   increased time spent away (P = 0.07), increased latency to eat novel
   food (P < 0.05), decreased food intake (P = 0.09) and a higher
   proportion of cows performing self grooming (P < 0.05). Provision of
   novel food did not affect the plasma concentration of cortisol sampled
   at I = 0, 10 and 20 min after food provision, and no differences were
   found between treatments. In conclusion, 12 h of food deprivation did
   not affect behavioural responses toward novel food in dairy cows,
   suggesting that this test of behavioural responses toward novelty is
   rather insensitive toward day-to-day changes in eating motivation. Low
   energy density in sthe daily ration and increased milking frequency
   affected the behavioural, but not the adrenocortical responses toward
   novelty but there was no evidence for a simple relationship between the
   energy balance of dairy cows and their responses toward novel food. (C)

Abstract = {{During courtship and mating, males of some invertebrate predators risk
   being killed and consumed by females, who in turn can obtain a foraging
   benefit from feeding on males. In these invertebrates, the sex ratio at
   the end of the mating season is usually female biased, probably due to
   sexual cannibalism and other sources of male mortality. Thus, at the end
   of the mating season males can be a limited resource to females as both
   mates and prey. Because of the high risk incurred when approaching
   females, males should show mate choice. To date there are little data on
   the costs and benefits of sexual cannibalism in natural populations. For
   one month we followed the mating patterns of 60 late-maturing
   Mediterranean tarantula, Lycosa tarentula L., females in a desert
   grassland population. The later a female matured, the shorter was her
   cohabitation time with males and the lower her probability of cohabiting
   with a male at all, suggesting that late-maturing females may be limited
   in their access to males as mates. At the end of the mating season,
   nonsexually cannibalistic late-maturing females also had poorer body
   conditions than did both sexually cannibalistic late-maturing females
   and early-maturing females, suggesting that late-maturing females may be
   also limited in their access to males as food. Females had higher mating
   success if they were smaller or in better condition (better fed). This
   pattern may reflect either male choice, or the possibility that small,
   well-fed females have higher mating success because they are less

Abstract = {{Introduced species usually fail to establish, but when they succeed, may
   undergo character release and rapid evolutionary divergence in novel
   environments. We collected brown anoles (Anolis sagrei: Lacertilia:
   Iguanidae) from a single Florida population and released them onto two
   ecologically different dredgespoil islands in central Florida (forested
   and non-forested) and measured differences in population growth,
   individual growth, body size, and condition over four years. The
   population on the non-forested island expanded twice as fast as the
   forested island population and reached a density of ca. 12,000 lizards
   ha(-1) and a biomass of ca. 43.3 kg ha(-1), among the largest values
   recorded for non-aggregated terrestrial vertebrates. First-year progeny
   grew larger than their surviving parents on both islands, indicating
   character release occurred in early stages of both invasions. However,
   in subsequent years, lizards become larger on the forested island, but
   smaller on the non-forested island. Body condition declined over time on
   both islands, but the effect was most dramatic on the non-forested
   island. Lizards on the forested island had the lowest survival rates and
   highest tail autotomy frequencies. These results were attributed to
   differences in abiotic and biotic conditions on the two islands. Brown
   anoles are generally larger on islands where they have been introduced
   than on their native Caribbean islands, and are much larger on mainlands
   than on islands, indicating character release occurred at larger
   geographic scales as well. Habitat influences the morphology of
   introduced species possessing the ability to rapidly adapt to local
   conditions, presenting invasive species managers the `moving targets'.}},

Abstract = {{While there are many examples of people who live for 100 years or more
   with little evidence of a decline in brain function, many others are not
   so fortunate and experience a neurodegenerative disorder, such as
   Alzheimer disease or Parkinson disease. Although an increasing number of
   genetic factors that may affect the risk for neurodegenerative disorders
   are being identified, emerging findings suggest that dietary factors
   play major roles in determining whether the brain ages successfully or
   experiences a neurodegenerative disorder. Dietary factors may interact
   with disease-causing or predisposing genes in molecular cascades that
   either promote or prevent the degeneration of neurons. Epidemiologic
   findings suggest that high-calorie diets and folic acid deficiency
   increase the risk for Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease; studies
   of animal models of these disorders have shown that dietary restriction
   (reduced calorie intake or intermittent fasting) and dietary
   supplementation with folic acid can reduce neuronal damage and improve
   behavioral outcome. Animal studies have shown that the beneficial
   effects of dietary restriction on the brain result in part from
   increased production of neurotrophic factors and cytoprotective protein
   chaperones in neurons. By keeping homocysteine levels low, folic acid
   can protect cerebral vessels and prevent the accumulation of DNA damage
   in neurons caused by oxidative stress and facilitated by homocysteine.
   Although additional studies are required in humans, the emerging data
   suggest that high-calorie diets and elevated homocysteine levels may
   render the brain vulnerable to age-related neurodegenerative disorders,
   particularly in persons with a genetic predisposition to such disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The nucleus accumbens (NAc) subserves behaviors governed by natural
   rewards, i.e., feeding or exploration, and has been implicated in
   control of prepulse inhibition (PPI), a measure of sensorimotor gating.
   The present study sought to determine whether a tonic stimulation of
   adenosine A(2A) receptors in the rat NAc is involved in control of
   spontaneous locomotor activity, feeding behavior, and PPI. To this end,
   bilateral microinfusions of a prodrug (MSX-3) (3 mug and 5 mug in 1 mul
   per side) of the selective A(2A) receptor antagonist MSX-2 or vehicle (1
   mul per side) were administered into the NAc. Results show that blockade
   of intra-NAc adenosine A(2A) receptors by a high (5 mug), but not by a
   low (3 mug), dose of MSX-3 increased locomotor activity in an open
   field, reduced food intake, and delayed intake onset in food-deprived
   rats examined in a test cage with standard laboratory chow. Furthermore,
   PPI was significantly disrupted after intra-NAc infusion of 5 mug, but
   not 3 mug, MSX-3. These findings suggest that locomotor activity as well
   as intact PPI and feeding behavior rely on tonic activation of intra-NAc
   A(2A) receptors. The data add further support to the view that adenosine

Abstract = {{Most social foragers must search for food while avoiding predators.
   Group-foraging nutmeg mannikins engaged in a producer-scrounger game
   search for their own food (play producer) by hopping with the head down
   and search for others' food discoveries (play scrounger) by hopping with
   the head up. If the scrounger tactic is compatible with antipredatory
   vigilance, then an increase in antipredatory vigilance should lead to
   the detection of more joining opportunities, and hence to more joining
   by foragers. We tested this prediction as well as the extent to which
   stationary birds use head up exclusively for antipredatory purposes and
   hopping birds use head up for foraging purposes only. We observed three
   flocks of nutmeg mannikins searching for hidden clumps of food in an
   indoor aviary. We used a 2 x 2 factorial design in which both the
   distance to a safe refuge and the food distribution were manipulated.
   The use of head up by stationary and eating birds increased
   significantly with increased distance to cover. Distance to cover,
   however, had no effect on the use of the scrounger tactic or on the
   level of joining. We found no evidence of compatibility between the
   scrounger tactic and antipredatory vigilance. Our results provide the
   first unambiguous evidence for the existence of two distinct and
   incompatible patterns of vigilance for predators and for conspecifics.

Abstract = {{I developed two versions of the twin threshold model (TTM) to assess
   risk-sensitive foraging decisions by rufous hummingbirds. The model
   incorporates energy thresholds for both starvation and reproduction and
   assesses how three reward distributions with a common mean but different
   levels of variance interact with these critical thresholds to determine
   fitness. Fitness, a combination of survival and reproduction, is
   influenced by both the amount of variance in the distributions and the
   relative position of the common mean between the thresholds. The model
   predicts that risk-intermediate foraging is often the optimal policy,
   and that risk aversion is favoured as the common mean of the
   distributions approaches the starvation threshold, whereas risk
   preference is favoured as the common mean approaches the reproduction
   threshold. Tests with free-living hummingbirds supported these
   predictions. Hummingbirds were presented with three distributions of
   nectar rewards that had a common mean but Nil, Moderate or High levels
   of variance. Birds preferred intermediate levels of variance (Moderate)
   when presented with all three rewards simultaneously, and became more
   risk-averse as the mean of the distributions was decreased but more
   risk-prone as the mean was increased. Birds preferred Nil when it was
   paired with Moderate or with High, but preferred Moderate in the
   presence of Nil and High together. This reversal of preference is a
   violation of regularity, conventionally interpreted as irrational choice
   behaviour. I provide an alternative version of the TTM demonstrating
   that violations of regularity can occur when relative instead of
   absolute evaluation mechanisms are used. (C) 2003 The Association for

Abstract = {{Organisms in nature are both proximate (operating by rules of thumb) and
   adapted (the rules influenced by natural selection). We introduce new
   methods that can be used to study in silico versions of organisms
   behaving according to proximate adapted rules. Our approach goes beyond
   neural networks and offers an alternative to optimization methods. It is
   based on the idea that organisms receive signals from the environment,
   that the signals are modified by internal (state-dependent) factors to
   create feelings (which we refer to as hedonic tones), and that
   behavioural processes (decisions) are a response to the hedonic tones.
   We illustrate these ideas through a model of a fish moving in a
   vertically structured environment, subject to predation and competition
   from conspecifics. The fish in our model responds to food, light,
   temperature and conspecifics, without any reference to current or future
   fitness. We use a combination of hedonic modelling to process the
   response, and genetic algorithms to modify the response via natural
   selection, according to internal needs and evolutionary history. We show
   that many different combinations of genes can lead to similar fitnesses,
   so that this approach generates genetic diversity. We compare our
   results with those of a variety of empirical studies and show that our

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In addition to seasonal changes in morphology, physiology and behaviour
   that occur in predictable annual cycles, there are facultative responses
   to unpredictable events known as labile (i.e. short-lived) perturbation
   factors. These rapid behavioural and physiological changes have been
   termed the `emergency life-history stage' and serve to enhance lifetime
   fitness. There are four major components: (1) proactive/reactive coping
   styles for responding to psychosocial stress, predation, and so forth;
   (2) fight-or-flight responses to rapid emergencies such as an attack by
   a predator or sudden severe storm; (3) `take-it-or-leave-it' behavioural
   and physiological responses to longer-term perturbations of the physical
   environment; and (4) sickness behaviour and fever designed to respond to
   infection. Glucocorticosteroids interact with cytokines and with other
   hormones in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal cascade and in the
   autonomic nervous system to initiate and orchestrate the emergency
   life-history stage within minutes to hours. Some traits of the emergency
   life-history stage include: redirection of behaviour from a normal
   life-history stage to increased foraging, irruptive-type migration
   during the day, enhanced restfulness at night, elevated gluconeogenesis,
   and recovery once the perturbation passes. These physiological and
   behavioural changes allow an individual to avoid potential deleterious
   effects of stress that may result from chronically elevated levels of
   circulating glucocorticosteroids over days and weeks. Thus, acute rises
   in glucocorticosteroids following perturbations of the environment may
   serve primarily as `antistress' hormones, potentially allowing
   individuals to avoid chronic stress. Several field studies in diverse
   habitats indicate that individuals in free-living populations show
   elevated circulating levels of corticosteroids when they are in an
   emergency life-history stage. Some simple models based on food
   availability, body condition, social status and life-history stage, may
   allow predictions of sensitivity of the hypothalamopituitary-adrenal
   axis to labile perturbation factors. Although there is now extensive
   evidence for behavioural components of the emergency life-history stage
   in birds, there remains much to be learned about how other vertebrate
   groups, especially fish, cope with perturbations of the environment.
   Because of the unpredictable nature of these perturbations, systematic
   study of behavioural responses to them is not possible and investigators
   need to be `opportunistic'. There is also a growing need to expand our
   knowledge of these phenomena because human disturbance, global climate
   change and pollution are all major perturbations of the environment. How
   vertebrates respond to the unpredictable in general will thus have
   important conservation value for the future. (C) 2003 The Association

Abstract = {{The ability to discriminate between more dangerous and less dangerous
   predators can have serious fitness advantages for fish juveniles. This
   is especially true for hatchery-reared fish young used for stocking,
   because their post-release mortality is often much higher than that of
   wild-born conspecifics. We tested whether two coexisting fish predators
   and their different diets induce innate behavioral responses in
   predator-naive Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) young originating from
   an endangered hatchery-bred population used for re-introductions. We
   predicted the antipredator responses of charr to be stronger towards
   chemical cues of brown trout (Salmo trutta) and pikeperch (Stizostedion
   lucioperca) than towards odorless control water. More pronounced
   antipredator behavior was predicted in treatments with predators fed on
   charr than when their diet consisted of another sympatric salmonid,
   European grayling (Thymallus thymallus), or when they were
   food-deprived. The Arctic charr young showed strong antipredator
   responses in all brown trout treatments, whereas odors of the less
   likely predator pikeperch were avoided with conspecific diet only.
   Freezing was the most sensitive antipredator behavior, as it was
   completely absent in control treatments. We found considerable
   individual variation in the amount and strength of antipredator
   responses. Although almost half of the charr failed to show antipredator
   behavior towards the piscivores, those with the innate ability showed
   highly sensitive recognition of predator odors. Our results indicate
   that the innate antipredator behavior of the juvenile fish is already
   finely tuned to respond specifically to chemical cues from different

Abstract = {{In response to increased exposure to predators when searching for food,
   many prey increase the frequency of antipredator behaviors, potentially
   reducing foraging rate and food intake. Such direct, nonlethal
   interactions between predators and prey resulting in reduced food intake
   can indirectly influence lifecycle development through effects on
   growth, developmental rate, and survival. We investigated the general
   hypothesis that individual performance of a herbivorous insect can be
   negatively affected when exposed to nonlethal predation risk, and that
   the response can be mediated by food quality. This hypothesis was tested
   using the common rangeland grasshopper Ageneotettix deorum with and
   without exposure to common wolf spider predators (Lycosidae, Schizocosa
   spp.) on both untreated natural and fertilized vegetation. All spiders
   were rendered temporarily incapable of direct feeding by restricting
   function of the chelicerae with beeswax. Detectable responses by
   grasshoppers to spiders indicate indirect consequences for lifecycle
   development. Grasshopper performance was measured as hind femur growth,
   duration of nymphal lifecycle stages, and survivorship in a caged field
   experiment conducted over 2 years. Grasshoppers developed faster and
   grew 3-5\% larger when allowed to forage on fertilized vegetation in the
   absence of risk from a spider predator. Failure-time analysis
   illustrated enhanced survival probability in response to elevated food
   quality and the negative effects of grasshopper susceptibility to
   nonlethal predation risk. Performance on food of relatively low, ambient
   quality with no predation risk equaled that of grasshoppers caged with
   high quality vegetation in the presence of a modified spider. Increased
   resource quality can clearly moderate the negative life history
   responses caused by the behavioral modification of grasshoppers when
   exposed to spider predation risk, a compensatory response.}},

Abstract = {{Oxidative stress has been implicated in mechanisms leading to neuronal
   cell injury in various pathological states of the brain. Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) is a progressive disorder with cognitive and memory
   decline, speech loss, personality changes and synapse loss. Many
   approaches have been undertaken to understand AD, but the heterogeneity
   of the etiologic factors makes it difficult to define the clinically
   most important factor determining the onset and progression of the
   disease. However, increasing evidence indicates that factors such as
   oxidative stress and disturbed protein metabolism and their interaction
   in a vicious cycle are central to AD pathogenesis.
   Brains of AD patients undergo many changes, such as disruption of
   protein synthesis and degradation, classically associated with the heat
   shock response, which is one form of stress response. Heat shock
   proteins are proteins serving as molecular chaperones involved in the
   protection of cells from various forms of stress.
   Recently, the involvement of the heme oxygenase (HO) pathway in
   anti-degenerative mechanisms operating in AD has received considerable
   attention, as it has been demonstrated that the expression of HO is
   closely related to that of amyloid precursor protein (APP). HO induction
   occurs together with the induction of other HSPs during various
   physiopathological conditions. The vasoactive molecule carbon monoxide
   and the potent antioxidant bilirubin, products of HO-catalyzed reaction,
   represent a protective system potentially active against brain oxidative
   injury. Given the broad cytoprotective properties of the heat shock
   response there is now strong interest in discovering and developing
   pharmacological agents capable of inducing the heat shock response.
   Increasing interest has been focused on identifying dietary compounds
   that can inhibit, retard or reverse the multi-stage pathophysiological
   events underlying AD pathology. Alzheimer's disease, in fact, involves a
   chronic inflammatory response associated with both brain injury and
   beta-amyloid associated pathology. All of the above evidence suggests
   that stimulation of various repair pathways by mild stress has
   significant effects on delaying the onset of various age-associated
   alterations in cells, tissues and organisms. Spice and herbs contain
   phenolic substances with potent antioxidative and chemopreventive
   properties, and it is generally assumed that the phenol moiety is
   responsible for the antioxidant activity. In particular, curcumin, a
   powerful antioxidant derived from the curry spice turmeric, has emerged
   as a strong inducer of the heat shock response. In light of this
   finding, curcumin supplementation has been recently considered as an
   alternative, nutritional approach to reduce oxidative damage and amyloid
   pathology associated with AD. Here we review the importance of the heme
   oxygenase pathway in brain stress tolerance and its significance as an
   antidegenerative mechanism potentially important in AD pathogenesis.
   These findings have offered new perspectives in medicine and
   pharmacology, as molecules inducing this defense mechanism appear to be
   possible candidates for novel cytoprotective strategies. In particular,
   manipulation of endogenous cellular defense mechanisms such as the heat
   shock response, through nutritional antioxidants or pharmacological
   compounds, represents an innovative approach to therapeutic intervention
   in diseases causing tissue damage, such as neurodegeneration. Consistent
   with this notion, maintenance or recovery of the activity of vitagenes,
   such as the HO gene, conceivably may delay the aging process and
   decrease the occurrence of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial position of young animals within a brood affects their
   survival, so that marginal individuals are at greater risk of predation.
   Spatial brood structuring may be caused by differences in offspring
   size, age, hunger, or active parental manipulation through aggression.
   Nepotistic manipulation of brood structure would confer fitness benefits
   for parents accepting nondescendant young. However, insufficient kin
   recognition has often been considered to preclude such nepotism in
   birds, particularly in precocial waterfowl. We explored the spatial
   structure of ducklings within broods of eiders, Somateria mollissima, a
   seaduck with frequent brood amalgamation. We compared the distribution
   of ducklings of different origin relative to reference females whose
   kinship to the ducklings was known. We also observed female aggression
   towards ducklings, to evaluate the role of parental manipulation of
   brood structure. We found a nonrandom distribution of ducklings within
   broods; a female's own young were on average closer to her than
   unrelated young were. We also found evidence for parental nepotism:
   whether the brood contained unrelated young was the strongest predictor
   of female aggression towards ducklings. The spatial position, hatch
   weight and relative size of ducklings showed no significant correlations
   with each other, suggesting that active parental manipulation may be
   needed to explain the observed spatial structure. Our study conflicts
   with previous anecdotal evidence suggesting that brood amalgamation in
   eiders results in the disintegration of parent-offspring bonds,
   preventing parental exploitation of nondescendant young. It also opens
   up the possibility that the spatial position of ducklings depends on
   their mother's status in the female dominance hierarchy. (C) 2003 The

Abstract = {{1. Agricultural developments over recent decades have had significant
   negative effects on wildlife. Modern European agriculture faces many
   further developments in technology, finances and climate. A framework
   for predicting the consequences of these developments and for informing
   management that mitigates previous depredation of wildlife is essential.
   2. Field trials, monitoring and experimental approaches are all
   invaluable tools for predicting the consequences of proposed
   agricultural practices. However, such trials are time-consuming and
   expensive, with limited spatial and temporal scope. Increasingly, it is
   recognized that predictive modelling using computer simulations is
   essential for assessing the likely impacts of novel management
   practices.
   3. Many agricultural developments are likely to have impacts on the
   availability of food for farmland wildlife. In this paper, we review
   modelling techniques that are available for predicting the consequences
   of changing food supplies for farmland birds, a group already shown to
   be sensitive to agricultural management.
   4. We focus on two broad types of simulation modelling: phenomenological
   approaches (using aggregative responses or full population models), and
   behavioural depletion models (including daily ration and functional
   response approaches). We assess the strengths and weaknesses of each,
   particularly with regard to available data.
   5. We conclude that given the constraints on current information, daily
   ration models probably represent the most useful form of simulation
   modelling for farmland birds. Few phenomenological population models
   link demography explicitly to food supply and collecting data on these
   links should be a priority of autecological studies. More empirical data
   on aggregative and functional responses is needed to identify the
   generality of these functions, and to confront uncertainties in their
   use.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Modelling techniques available for
   predicting the consequences of changing food supply for farmland birds
   have largely outstripped the availability of data required to
   parameterize them. We recommend the best available techniques given
   current constraints on data. Predictive models of biodiversity response
   should be more widely used when considering proposals for agricultural
   developments or agri-environment schemes. Models will provide a basis
   for selecting between competing proposals, whilst their widespread usage
   will both permit more frequent model validation and aid in model
   development.}},

   three HD sessions per week for more than I year in Japan were assessed.
   Patients suffering from problems influencing dietary intake and those
   with malnutrition were excluded. The variances accounted for
   self-efficacy for health-related behavior and avoidance-oriented coping
   (AOC) with stress were assessed by hierarchical multiple regression
   analyses. Results: BUN and SPO4 levels were not significantly (P<.05)
   associated with self-efficacy or AOC. SK levels and IWG were
   significantly (P<.05) associated with self-efficacy and/or AOC. The
   variances of SK levels and IWG accounted for self-efficacy and/or AOC,

   and was measured with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Obesity was
   defined as a body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) of 30 or
   higher. The authors compared risks of depression in obese and
   normal-weight (body mass index 18.5-24.9) persons. Obesity was

Abstract = {{The costs and benefits of group membership vary with the size of groups,
   and individuals are expected to modify their choice of groups in
   response to ecological factors such as food availability and predation
   risk. We experimentally examined context-dependent group size choice in
   a shoaling fish, the banded killifish, Fundulus diaphanus, by using
   nondirectional odour cues to simulate a food source or a successful
   attack by a predator (food or alarm treatments) in the laboratory. Group
   sizes were significantly smaller in the food treatment and larger in the
   alarm treatment than in control trials. When presented with food and
   alarm cues together, fish formed groups that were larger than control
   groups but smaller than those seen with alarm cues alone. These results
   are consistent with theoretical predictions based on the known benefits
   and costs of grouping and with previous laboratory work examining the
   individual shoal choice behaviour of single fish. To examine possible
   mechanisms of group formation, we developed an individual-based model of
   shoaling behaviour in which simulated fish were allowed to modify the
   area over which they interacted with neighbouring individuals. Group
   size distributions produced by the model were a good approximation of
   our experimental data. We suggest that local behavioural interaction
   rules of this type are a potential mechanism by which fish may
   individually adjust grouping behaviour without requiring extensive
   information on the position and movement of all possible shoalmates. (C)

Abstract = {{Background : The prevalence of menstrual pain in Western societies is
   relatively high and has been shown to be related to many factors (e.g.
   age, menarche age, parity, menstrual cycle regularity, cigarette
   smoking, dietary habits). However, less data are available for
   traditional societies, within which there are, presumably, not as many
   potentially disturbing factors that could influence menstrual symptoms
   as in Western societies.
   Aim : The study seeks to determine the prevalence of dysmenorrhoea, and
   the factors related to menstrual pains in women with natural fertility
   (i.e. without hormonal forms of contraception).
   Subjects and methods : 177 non-smoking women between 18 and 45 years of
   age living in one Mayan village (Yaxcaba, Yucatan, Mexico) were the
   subjects of this study. The method of logistic regression was used with
   the dichotomous dependent variable being the presence or absence of
   menstrual pain together with such independent variables as age, age at
   menarche, number of pregnancies, age when giving birth to the first
   child, the weight at interview and BMI.
   Results : The general prevalence of the menstrual pains was 28\%. There
   was only one variable influencing dysmenorrhoea, namely the age at which
   women give birth to their first children. Those mothers who gave birth
   to their first child at an earlier age (at mean age of 19.4 vs 21.1
   years) had a lower prevalence of dysmenorrhoea.
   Conclusion : In the studied traditional society the main factor related
   to menstrual pain was the age at which woman first gave birth. It is
   hypothesized that an earlier start to reproductive life in some way
   decreases the sensitivity of the uterus to prostaglandins.}},

Abstract = {{Milk is a product of animal origin with a very long history of intensive
   quality examination. This history is partly based on the fact that milk
   samples can be rather easily obtained and processed. Quality examination
   regards the organoleptic features of milk as well as characteristics
   like somatic cell count, bacteria count, freezing point decrease,
   butyric acid content and antibiotic residues. Since the payment to the
   farmer of delivered milk is coupled to the levels of these features,
   dairy farmers have put a lot of effort into keeping these levels between
   acceptable standard ranges. Considered retrospectively, it has appeared
   much more difficult to convince farmers about the relationships between
   milk-quality features on the one hand and udder-health disorders or
   public-health risks on the other. In the field, emphasis still has to be
   put on proper treatment duration and procedures with appropriate drugs.
   Udder-health control programmes for the different predominant pathogen
   profiles have been introduced by veterinarians and others for improving
   udder health status by problem solving and preventive action at herd and
   cow level, although with variable success. For this purpose cow-related,
   management-related and cow environment-related risk conditions are
   screened and evaluated. Basically, these programmes address less milk as
   a product itself, but rather the production process where different risk
   conditions exert their effect at different process sites. Udder-health
   programmes focus predominantly on operational farm issues like reduction
   of disease rate, milk-yield increase, reduction of labour and costs,
   increasing productive lifespan of cows, much less on public-health
   issues.
   Yet, the current situation is that the general public and consumers have
   much more influence on quality issues in animal production than ever
   before. Food-safety calamities like BSE, dioxin, VTEC and food poisoning
   have been largely depicted in the media and have evoked a changing
   consumer behaviour towards animal production and products of animal
   origin. Animal-health and animal-welfare issues have become as important
   as public-health and food-safety issues; all come together in a triad
   under the heading of ``quality of animal production{''}. Quality should
   then not only be addressed in the product but also in the production
   process. The risks of a deviating product occur during the production
   process, like the risk of too high a cell count originates from, for
   example, less optimal hygiene, udder infections and management
   deficiencies during day-to-day dairy farming. In several countries
   so-called quality-control programmes are operational or under
   development addressing one or more elements of the triad by good farming
   practice codes, veterinary herd-health programmes, HACCP-based
   approaches or ISO. However, the programme of choice has not been
   developed, validated or published.
   Milk can be a vehicle for the transmission of pathogens from cow to cow
   (for example, during milking), but also from cow to humans (zoonotic
   microorganisms) through raw milk or dairy product. Among the zoonotic
   microorganisms can be named: Mycob. tuberculosis, Brucella abortus,
   Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia sp., VTEC (O157)
   and even possibly Mycob. paratuberculosis. Some of these zoonotic
   microorganisms do not cause signs of disease in the animal, while others
   do. The former agents are hence hard to detect at farm level and
   therefore difficult to treat beforehand. For example, they do not form
   part of a herd-health programme. It may be warranted to develop,
   validate and apply quality-control programmes specifically focusing on
   these microorganisms, not least because, for example at EU level, there
   are directives and regulations addressing areas like consumer
   protection, zoonoses, products of animal origin, hygiene around food
   processing and food products, animal health and welfare status at farm
   level, and the need for transparent farm-production processes with
   demonstrable health status and measures to optimize this status,
   veterinary monitoring and inspection of such status. At this level too
   there are requirements being developed which go beyond the current
   situation and which are linked to a ``license to produce{''}.
   This presentation addresses the different zoonotic agents which can be
   transferred through cows' milk to humans, and proposes an associated
   HACCP-based quality-control programme in support of farm management
   within the setting of developments mentioned, followed by discussion.
   Certain legislation points to the need to discard milk from cows that
   are affected by clinical diseases like gastro-intestinal disorders with
   fever, disorders of the genital tract with vaginal discharge, general
   disease signs and clinically detectable disorders of the udder skin. The
   latter are not addressed in this presentation.}},

Abstract = {{It is now well appreciated that most organisms can alter their
   phenotypes when faced with environmental variation. Decades of empirical
   investigations have documented hundreds of examples of phenotypic
   plasticity, yet most studies have focused on the presence-or absence of
   a single environmental factor. As a result, we know little about how
   organisms respond to-gradients of environmental factors (i.e., threshold
   responses vs. continuous responses), nor do we understand how organisms
   respond to combinations of environmental variables. I examined how
   larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) altered their behavior, morphology,
   and growth in response, to combined gradients of predation and
   competition. Increased predation risk induced lower activity, deeper
   tails, and shorter bodies, which collectively caused slower growth.
   Increased competition caused slower growth which induced higher
   activity, shallower tails, and longer bodies: For both environmental
   gradients, the responses were frequently continuous rather than
   threshold responses. Moreover, predation and competition had interactive
   effects. Responses to predators were always larger under low competition
   than under high competition. Responses to competition were larger under
   low predation risk when predation and competition induced traits in the
   same direction, but larger under high predation risk when predation and
   competition induced traits in opposite directions. The results
   demonstrate that responses to phenotypically plastic traits can be
   fine-tuned to a wide variety of environmental combinations.}},

Abstract = {{The avoidance of surface waters by crustacean zooplankton is a common
   phenomenon both in marine and freshwaters. The contemporary paradigm
   interprets such behavior as an antipredator strategy. However, the
   phenomenon has also been reported in predator-free environments, which
   suggests that other variables may contribute to this depth-selection
   behavior. We investigated the possibility that ultraviolet radiation
   (UVR) could influence the avoidance of surface waters in three
   interconnected lakes differing in their transparency. Each lake was
   sampled 17 or 18 times. In the two most transparent lakes, the
   percentage of the population occurring in the surface layer decreased
   during spring and summer, but this pattern was not observed in the less
   transparent lake. Such differences in the patterns of surface-water
   avoidance were unrelated to the abundance and vertical distribution of
   the dominant planktivores (early stages of galaxiid fishes) as well as
   to temperature and food availability. They were inversely related,
   however, to the average UVR levels within the surface layer. A UV
   avoidance strategy was predicted for the copepod Boeckella gracilipes,
   on account of its low UV tolerance and lack of photoprotective
   compounds. Our results support this prediction and strongly suggest that
   surface avoidance by freshwater Patagonian zooplankton is not just a
   byproduct benefit of an antipredator behavior but is a direct response
   to high UVR levels.}},

   weeks and declined gradually thereafter. IJ became inactive during

   nearly all IJ were active within the first minute of observation and
   remained active for the 20-min observation period. With increasing
   storage time, an increasing proportion of IJ were inactive in the first

Abstract = {{We evaluated differences in larval habitats and life history of three
   species of spadefoot toads, then compared their life histories in a
   common garden study. Our field work defined the selective regime
   encountered by each species. Our Great Basin spadefoot (Spea
   intermontana) bred asynchronously in permanent streams and springs where
   there was no risk of larval mortality due to drying. The water chemistry
   remained fairly stable throughout the larval period. The western
   spadefoot toad, Sp. hammondii, bred fairly synchronously following heavy
   spring rains in temporary pools that remained filled an average of 81 d.
   Fifteen \% of the breeding pools dried completely on or before the day
   the first larvae metamorphosed. The desert spadefoot toad, Scaphiopus
   couchii, bred synchronously after heavy summer showers in very short
   duration pools; 62\% of the breeding pools dried completely on or before
   the day the first larvae metamorphosed. The concentration of ammonium
   nitrogen and CaCO3 increased markedly as the Sp. hammondii and S.
   couchii pools dried. S. couchii attained metamorphosis at a much earlier
   age and smaller size than the other two species. S. couchii also showed
   little variation in the age at metamorphosis but considerable variation
   in the size at metamorphosis, while the other two species varied in both
   age and size. The results identify some variables that could serve as
   cues of pool drying and demonstrate an association between breeding pool
   duration, breeding synchrony, development rate, and larval development.
   Our laboratory study yields information about the genetic basis of the
   differences in development and controlled comparisons of phenotypic
   plasticity. We manipulated food supply to study the plastic response of
   age and size at metamorphosis and hence construct the reaction norm for
   these variables as a function of growth rate. The growth rates ranged
   from below to above those observed in natural populations. As in the
   field, in the lab S. couchii attained metamorphosis at an earlier age
   and smaller size than the other two species. All three species had a
   similarly shaped reaction norm for size(y-axis) and age (x-axis) at
   metamorphosis, which was a concave upward curve. A consequence of this
   shape is that age at metamorphosis changes more readily at low levels of
   food availability and size at metamorphosis changes more readily at high
   levels of food availability. If we restrict our observations to just
   those growth rates that are seen in nature, then S. couchii has almost
   no variation in the age at metamorphosis but considerable variation in
   size at metamorphosis, while the other two species vary in both age and
   size at metamorphosis. All three species increased in size at
   metamorphosis with increased food levels. Our comparative reaction norm
   approach thus demonstrates that S. couchii has adapted to ephemeral
   environments by shifting its growth rate reaction norm so that age at
   metamorphosis is uniformly fast and is not associated with growth rate.
   The realized variation is concentrated in size rather than age at
   metamorphosis.}},

Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{121-130}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the
   family of neurotrophins and promotes diverse effects in neurons
   including development, maintenance of function, synaptic plasticity, and
   survival in different animal models. We present advances in our
   understanding of the genomics of the BDNF gene (bdnf) and its regulation
   by calcium-activated transcription factors, including cAMP response
   element binding protein (CREB) and more recently, nuclear factor kappaB;
   (NF-kappaB) and discuss these findings in the context of neuronal
   plasticity and survival.
   Methods: We used amplified bdnf complementary DNAs (cDNAs) and genomic
   DNA templates for direct sequencing and sequence variant discovery,
   information mining of public databases, and conventional molecular and
   cellular biology approaches to screen bdnf for novel regulatory
   elements, alternatively spliced exons, and functional sequence variants.
   Results: We discovered a candidate NF-kappaB site in promoter 3 of bdnf
   and showned that activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) inotropic
   glutamate receptors increased bdnf expression through an
   NF-kappaB-dependent pathway and extended the finding to show that
   NF-kappaB was required for NMDA neuroprotection in vitro. In addition,
   sequence analysis of bdnf cDNAs from different brain regions predicted
   at least three pre-pro-BDNF protein isoforms, two of which were
   previously unknown. Each isoform differs at the amino terminus and may
   have functional importance.
   Conclusions: Given the central role that BDNF plays in the developing
   and adult nervous system, understanding how BDNF is regulated and how it
   functions will enhance our knowledge of its diverse effects, which may
   lead to more effective treatments for neurodegenerative disorders and
   reveal the role of BDNF in complex phenotypes related to behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Birds are thought to choose nest sites that meet two main functions:

   nearly 70\% of the nests of Kentish plovers, Charadrius alexandrinus,

   be more than 50degreesC during very hot days, thus causing the
   incubating adults to suffer from heat stress. We tested the hypothesis
   that Kentish plovers nest mainly in exposed sites because this may allow
   the incubating birds to detect approaching predators early, and thus to
   reduce predation risk. When we occluded the view that incubating adults
   had from their nests, they took longer to detect approaching predators
   than when the view was unrestricted. Incubating adults were also more
   frequently killed by mammals in covered than in exposed nests. Females
   that nested in covered sites were in lower body condition than those
   nesting in exposed sites, possibly because they were unable to withstand
   the high ambient temperatures in exposed sites. Thus, the benefits of

Abstract = {{This study investigated the degree to which the behavior of a predator
   in the marine environment can be used to indicate the availability of
   prey. It examined this in Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella)
   feeding on krill, with a view to understanding how behavioral choices
   could lead to a nonlinear functional response. The study showed how fur
   seals adjusted their time budgets to maximize the mean rate of energy
   intake in response to varying prey abundance. The behavioral indicator
   of prey abundance was the amount of time spent by fur seals at the
   bottom of dives after adjustment for dive depth. This indicator was well
   correlated with independent measures of prey abundance. The indicator
   was calibrated in terms of net rate of energy intake from information
   about energy expenditures in Antarctic fur seals and was used within the
   framework of optimal foraging theory to examine how female fur seals
   organized their foraging activity within and between bouts. Foraging in
   Antarctic fur seals conformed to many of the predictions from energy
   rate-maximizing behavior. For example, the apparent net rate of energy
   intake by fur seals declined with time spent in a patch, and the rate of
   energy intake on leaving a patch declined as apparent food availability
   in the environment declined. In addition, the time spent in patches
   increased as apparent food availability declined. Antarctic fur seals
   were able to adjust their behavior to track highly variable prey
   distributions and densities. The simple decision about when to leave a
   patch in relation to current environmental prey availability appears to
   be responsible for allowing fur seals to maintain saturation of the
   foraging rate as food density declines.}},

   prey, in the development of inducible defenses by exposing pinewoods
   tree frog (Hyla femoralis) tadpoles to non-lethal dragonfly (Anax

   providing the tadpoles with two food levels intended to provide adequate
   or growth limiting resources. The generalized morphological response of
   H. femoralis tadpoles to predators included the development of bodies
   and tails that were both deeper and shorter, smaller overall body size,
   and increased orange tail fin coloration and black tail outline.
   Metabolites of digestion were sufficient to initiate development of

Abstract = {{Winter is energetically challenging for small herbivores because of
   greater energy requirements for thermogenesis at a time when little
   energy is available. We formulated a model predicting optimal wintering
   body size, accounting for the scaling of both energy expenditure and
   assimilation to body size, and the trade-off between survival benefits
   of a large size and avoiding survival costs of foraging. The model
   predicts that if the energy cost of maintaining a given body mass
   differs between environments, animals should be smaller in the more
   demanding environments, and there should be a negative correlation
   between body mass and daily energy expenditure (DEE) across
   environments. In contrast, if animals adjust their energy intake
   according to variation in survival costs of foraging, there should be a
   positive correlation between body mass and DEE. Decreasing temperature
   always increases equilibrium DEE, but optimal body mass may either
   increase or decrease in colder climates depending on the exact effects

   DEE with doubly labeled water on wintering Microtus agrestis at four
   field sites, we found that DEE was highest at the sites where voles were
   smallest despite a positive correlation between DEE and body mass within

Abstract = {{Predation risk may compromise the ability of animals to acquire and
   maintain body reserves by hindering 14 foraging efficiency and
   increasing physiological stress. Locomotor performance may depend on
   body mass, so losing mass under predation risk could be an adaptive
   response of prey to improve escape ability. We studied individual
   variation in antipredatory behaviour, feeding rate, body mass and escape
   performance in the lacertid lizard Psammodromus algirus. Individuals
   were experimentally exposed to different levels of food availability
   (limited or abundant) and predation risk, represented by reduced refuge
   availability and simulated predator attacks. Predation risk induced
   lizards to reduce conspicuousness behaviourally and to avoid feeding in
   the presence of predators. If food was abundant, alarmed lizards reduced
   feeding rate, losing mass. Lizards supplied with limited food fed at
   near-maximum rates independently of predation risk but lost more mass
   when alarmed; thus, mass losses experienced under predation risk were
   higher than those expected from feeding interruption alone. Although
   body mass of lizards varied between treatments, no component of escape
   performance measured during predator attacks (endurance, speed, escape
   strategy) was affected by treatments or by variations in body mass.
   Thus, the body mass changes were consistent with a trade-off between
   gaining resources and avoiding predators, mediated by hampered foraging
   efficiency and physiological stress. However, improved escape efficiency
   is not required to explain mass reduction upon predator encounters
   beyond that expected from feeding interruption or predation-related
   stress. Therefore, the idea that animals may regulate body reserves in
   relation to performance demands should be reconsidered. (C) 2004 The

Abstract = {{Group feeding animals experience a number of competitive foraging costs

   distinguish between reductions in feeding rates that are caused by
   reduced food availability and physical interactions among foragers from
   those caused by the mere presence of foraging companions that may be
   self-imposed in order to obtain some benefit of group membership.
   Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) reduce their feeding rates when in the
   company of simulated competitors located in an adjacent cage that cannot
   affect the food availability or interact with the forager. In the
   present study, we investigate whether the presence of simulated
   competitors in another species of passerine, nutmeg mannikins (Lonchura

   When feeding in the company of simulated competitors, mannikins spent
   more non-foraging time near them, fed more slowly, reduced travel times
   between patches, reduced their scanning time and pecked more slowly.
   These results provide evidence that simulated competitors induce a
   reduction in pecking rate: behavioural interference. These self-imposed
   responses to competitors may have resulted from attempts to remain close
   to the non-feeding companions. Such self-imposed reductions in feeding
   rates may be a widespread yet generally unrecognised foraging cost to

Abstract = {{Birds selecting a nest site have to find the best compromise between the
   risk of encountering predation, the availability of food near to the
   nest and microclimatic requirements. As the optimal solution of this
   problem will vary with changes in predator abundance, we ask whether
   birds are capable of assessing such changes and of adjusting their
   nest-site choice accordingly. The reproductive success of dusky warblers
   Phylloscopus fuscatus, breeding in a mosaic of bushland and tundra
   habitat in the Russian Far East, varied greatly depending on the
   abundance of a nest predator, the Siberian chipmunk Tamias sibiricus.
   Using artificial nests we analysed which strategies dusky warblers
   should follow to avoid nest predation by chipmunks. We then compared the
   nest sites which dusky warblers actually had chosen in years with very
   high chipmunk densities (1998 and 1999) with those chosen in 1997, when
   chipmunks were almost absent from the study area. We found that safe
   nest-sites were preferred over those offering other advantages
   (microclimate, proximity to food) when the risk of predation was high,
   and we could not detect any confounding factor that might alternatively
   have caused these striking between-year differences. Our study suggests
   that even a short-lived passerine may be capable of choosing its nest
   site according to the actual predation risk. We show that such
   behavioural plasticity can lead to a paradoxical situation where
   better-protected nest-sites (selected in years and areas with high
   risk), on average, suffer greater predation than sites offering low
   safety. Thus, behavioural plasticity, if undetected, may result in
   serious misinterpretation of nest-predation patterns. A review of the
   literature suggests that adaptive plasticity in nest placement may be
   more widespread than is currently recognized.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale. It has been demonstrated that major differences between mice
   of the C57BL/6J and DBA/2J inbred strains for amphetamine-induced place
   conditioning (preference and avoidance, respectively) are evident in
   standard housing conditions but abolished by temporary restricted
   feeding. This gene-experience model may be usefully exploited to dissect
   behavioral phenotypes related to place conditioning induced by addictive
   drugs. Objectives. This study evaluated a number of behavioral
   phenotypes related to amphetamine-induced place preference for strain
   differences (C57BL/6J vs DBA/2J) susceptible to be abolished by
   temporary food restriction. Methods. Mice of the two inbred strains were
   tested for: (1) conditioned taste aversion and place preference induced
   by amphetamine within the same dose-range; (2) preference for a novel
   compartment 24 h after a single exposure to only one of two
   compartments; (3) amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization and
   conditioned hyperactivity; and (4) locomotor activity during exploration
   of a novel environment. Results. The two strains showed consistent taste
   aversion at doses of amphetamine that promoted opposite strain-dependent
   place conditioning. Both strains spent more time exploring the novel
   rather than the known compartment of the place conditioning apparatus.
   Instead, only mice of the C57 strain showed amphetamine-induced
   behavioral sensitization and conditioned hyperactivity. However,
   temporary food restriction did not affect strain differences for these
   phenotypes. Finally, C57 mice were more active than DBA in a novel
   environment and restricted feeding abolished this strain-dependent
   difference. <LF>Conclusions. These results relate individual differences
   for amphetamine-induced place conditioning with locomotor response to
   amphetamine and novelty.}},

Abstract = {{Omega (n)-3 and n-6 fatty acids are important membrane components of
   neurons and immune cells, and related to psychiatric and inflammatory
   diseases. Increased ratio of n-6/n-3 in the blood has been reported in
   depressed patients and in students following stress exposure. The n-3
   fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (ethyl-EPA) suppresses inflammation
   and has antidepressant properties. Interleukin (IL)-1beta can stimulate
   corticosterone secretion, induce anxiety and stress-like behavior and
   inflammatory responses. This study was to evaluate the effect of diets
   enriched with coconut oil, ethyl-EPA and soybean oil on central IL-1beta
   induced stress and anxiety-like behavior, induced changes in the
   concentration of prostaglandin (PG) E2 and corticosterone and the
   release of IL-10. Groups of rats were fed with either 5\% coconut oil
   (as control diet), 0.2\% EPA with 4.8\% coconut oil or 1\% EPA with 4\%
   coconut oil and 5\% soybean oil for 7 weeks. The central administration
   of IL-1beta induced sickness, stress and anxiety-like behavior as
   indicated by a reduction in body weight, decreased time spent, and the
   number of entries, into the open arms of the elevated plus maze and
   decreased exploration and entry into the central zone of the ``open
   field{''} apparatus. IL-1beta also increased PGE2 and corticosterone
   concentrations and decreased the release of IL-10 from leucocytes. Food
   enriched with ethyl-EPA but not soybean oil, significantly attenuated
   most of these changes. These results demonstrate that ethyl-EPA has
   anti-inflammatory, anti-stress and anti-anxiety effects in rats.}},

Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{Many animal species, from arthropods to apes, share food. This paper
   presents a new framework that categorizes nonkin food sharing according
   to two axes: (1) the interval between sharing and receiving the benefits
   of sharing, and (2) the currency units in which benefits accrue to the
   sharer (especially food versus nonfood). Sharers can obtain immediate
   benefits from increased foraging efficiency, predation avoidance, mate
   provisioning, or manipulative mutualism. Reciprocity trade, status
   enhancement and group augmentation can delay benefits. When benefits are
   delayed or when food is exchanged for nonfood benefits, maintaining
   sharing can become more difficult because animals face discounting and
   currency conversion problems. Explanations that involve delayed or
   nonfood benefits may require specialized adaptations to account for
   timing and currency-exchange problems. The immediate, selfish fitness
   benefits that a sharer may gain through by-product or manipulative
   mutualism, however, apply to various food-sharing situations across many
   species and may provide a simpler, more general explanation of sharing.

Abstract = {{Male dispersal from the birth group is common in the majority of social
   mammals, and in many species, males also engage in secondary or breeding
   dispersal following natal emigration. However, the patterns and causes
   of secondary dispersal are poorly understood due to the difficulty in
   following emigrants. Here, we detail the patterns and causation of male
   secondary dispersal in several groups of white-faced capuchins observed
   between 1985 and 2000 in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica.
   Subsequent to natal emigration, which occurs between 2 and 8 years of
   age (median 4.5 years), male white-faced capuchins embark on a life of
   continual movement. Although males of all age classes engage in
   voluntary secondary dispersal, the ways by which males enter groups
   varies according to their age class. Adult males (greater than or equal
   to10 years old) are more likely to enter groups aggressively, and they
   display longer tenure than either subadult males (7-10 years of age) or
   juvenile males (1-7 years of age). Given our finding that adult males
   face the highest risks in terms of aggressive interactions with
   conspecifics, we examined several explanations as to why they continue
   to disperse throughout their lives. Our data best support the intragroup
   mating competition hypothesis for secondary dispersal, whereby males
   move frequently between groups as a means of increasing their
   reproductive opportunities. Males may also engage in frequent secondary
   dispersal to avoid mating with their maturing daughters, although this
   hypothesis was not strongly supported by the current data. Males of all
   age classes displayed very high levels of parallel dispersal, which
   probably serves to offset the high costs of dispersal (predation,
   starvation and/or aggression from conspecifics) and it may also serve as
   a means of retaining kinship among group males. (C) 2004 The Association

Abstract = {{Sensitivity to reward (STR)-a personality trait firmly rooted in the
   neurobiology of the mesolimbic dopamine system-has been strongly
   implicated in the risk for addiction. This construct describes the
   ability to derive pleasure or reward from natural reinforcers like food,
   and from pharmacologic rewards like addictive drugs. Recently experts in
   the field of addiction research have acknowledged that psychomotor
   stimulant drugs are no longer at the heart of all addictions, and that
   brain circuits can also be deranged with natural rewards like food. The
   present study tested a model in which STR was expected to relate
   positively to overeating, which in turn would be associated, with higher
   body weight in woman aged 25-45 years. As predicted, STR was correlated
   positively with measures of emotional overeating. Also, overweight woman
   were significantly more sensitive to reward than those of normal weight.
   Interestingly, however, the obese woman (Body Mass Index > 30) were more
   anhedonic than the overweight woman (Body Mass Index > 25 < 30). These
   findings are discussed in the context of neuroadaptations to
   overactivity of brain reward circuits. Results also indicate that STR
   may serve as a risk factor for overeating and overweight, especially in
   cultures such as ours where palatable, calorically-dense food is
   plentiful. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Apprehension is a behavioral response of a forager to risk of predation
   involving the allocation of the forager's attention away from
   foraging-related tasks and toward predator detection. It, along with
   time allocation, can be used by a forager to manage risk. Apprehension
   should increase, and time allocation should decrease with a forager's
   energetic state (marginal value of energy). We tested these predictions
   on Allenby's gerbils (Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi) by manipulating the
   energetic state of the gerbils through augmentations of millet seeds. We
   also manipulated two risk factors, the microhabitat of the foraging
   patch (bush or open) and the presence of barn owls (Tyto alba). We
   measured apprehension of gerbils using the selectivity of gerbils for
   trays that differed in the distribution of seeds that they contained and
   time allocation using the amount of seeds left behind in trays, the
   giving-up density (GUD). Gerbils harvested 4.6 times more seeds when
   supplemental seeds were available, 17.4\% fewer seeds when owls were
   present, 25.8\% fewer seeds from the open than the bush microhabitat,
   and 19.3\% fewer seeds from trays when seed augmentations were also
   present. With regard to time allocation, gerbils had higher GUDs
   (allocated less time) when risk was higher: in the open microhabitat and
   in the presence of owls. Also, the response of gerbils to owls was
   affected both by the seed augmentation and by microhabitat. With regard
   to apprehension, the gerbils were more apprehensive when extra seeds
   were added. Their level of apprehension changed little in the bush
   microhabitat but increased greatly in the open microhabitat when
   energetic state was manipulated. Thus, gerbils use both time allocation
   and apprehension in response to predators. Changes in the energetic
   state of a forager led to the predicted increase in apprehension
   accordance with Clark's asset protection principle.}},

Abstract = {{A behavioral technique was developed that allowed the onset and recovery
   of tinnitus to be measured in individual rats treated with different
   doses of salicylate. Food-restricted rats were self-trained to lick for
   water during the time between scheduled delivery of food pellets, i.e.,
   schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP). SIP-induced licking was placed under
   stimulus control by administering foot shock if licks occurred when
   sound (one of six stimuli, 40 dB SPL) was present; rats were allowed to
   lick during quiet. After the number of licks-in-quiet (correct response)
   exceeded 90\% of total licks, rats were treated with saline and four
   different doses of salicylate (50,.100, 150 and 350 mg/kg,
   intraperitoneally (i.p.); 2 days). Performance was assessed before,
   during and after treatment. Licks-in-sound remained extremely low with
   saline and all four salicylate doses indicating that the sounds were
   audible under all treatment conditions. Licks-in-quiet remained high
   during the saline control and 50 mg/kg dose of salicylate, behavior
   consistent with the absence of tinnitus. However, licks-in-quiet showed
   a statistically significant decline with the 150 and 350 mg/kg dose,
   behavior consistent with the presence of tinnitus. Licks-in-quiet
   gradually recovered to baseline level 2-3 days following high-dose
   salicylate treatments, behavior consistent with the gradual
   disappearance of tinnitus. The salicylate dose needed to induce tinnitus
   and the length of recovery are consistent with previous reports,
   providing support for the method. The ability to obtain sequential
   estimates of tinnitus-like behavior in an animal after administering a
   tinnitus-inducing agent could aid in understanding the underlying neural
   mechanisms and assessing potential treatments. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.
