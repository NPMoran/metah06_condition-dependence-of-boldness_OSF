abstract={Studies have demonstrated that medication behaviors by insects are much more common than previously thought. Bees, ants, flies, and butterflies can use a wide range of toxic and nutritional compounds to medicate themselves or their genetic kin. Medication occurs either in response to active infection (therapy) or high infection risk (prophylaxis), and can be used to increase resistance or tolerance to infection. While much progress has been made over the last few years, there are also key areas that require in-depth investigation. These include quantifying the costs of medication, especially at the colony level of social insects, and formulating theoretical models that can predict the role of infection risk in driving micro-evolutionary and macro-evolutionary patterns of animal medication behaviors. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Increasingly, evidence is accumulating pointing at a protective role of a healthy diet at decreasing the risk of Alzheimer's disease. To test the effectiveness of nutritional components, the following food-derived compounds: curcumin alone (curcumin), curcumin combined with (−)epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and α-lipoic acid (ALA) (curcumin + EDA), or a combination of EGCG, DHA and ALA (EDA) were assessed in male Tg2576 transgenic mice on amyloid plaque load, amyloid levels (Aβ40/Aβ42, but not oligomers due to tissue limitations), microglial activation and memory using the contextual and cued fear conditioning test. The combination diet EDA, resulted in the strongest reduction of amyloid plaque load in both the cortical (p &lt;.0001) and hippocampal (p &lt;.0001) areas of the Tg2576 mouse brain, along with lower Aβ40/Aβ42 levels in the frontal cortex (p =.000129 and p =.000039, respectively) and Aβ42 levels in the temporal lobe (p =.000082). A curcumin only diet was shown to lower amyloid plaque load (p =.028), but when combined with EGCG, DHA and ALA did not result in further decreases in amyloid plaque load. The EDA combination group showed the most prominent decrease in microglial activation (number of microglia around plaques: p &lt;.05 and p &lt;.0001, respectively, for the cortex and hippocampus). Analysing the hippocampal associated contextual fear conditioning revealed that both the curcumin+EDA (p &lt;.0001) and EDA groups (p =.001) spent increased time on freezing compared to the control group. In addition, the curcumin+EDA group showed a significant increase in time spent freezing compared with the curcumin only group. In the amygdala associated cued test, all mice demonstrated the ability to associate the conditioned stimulus with the unconditioned stimulus as evidenced by a significant increase in freezing behaviour in response to the presentation of the cue (p &lt;.0001). Post-hoc analysis showed that only curcumin+EDA (p &lt;.0001) and EDA groups (p &lt;.0001) developed a significant increase in freezing during the cue presentation. The results from this study show that the combination of EGCG, DHA and ALA (EDA) appeared to have the most potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effect. Our results also demonstrate that interactions between nutraceutical products might result in counterproductive outcomes, highlighting the fact that manufacturers of nutraceuticals containing multiple compounds should be careful not to claim additive or synergistic effects of their combination products in vivo without having tested it in animal models and/or human clinical trials. © 2018},

abstract={Inappropriately high weight in children is a persistent problem in the United States, and physical activity is often reduced in schools due to academic demands. Effective after-school programs could positively impact both physical activity and overweight/obesity, however previous reviews and meta-analyses have indicated minimal effects. Both 4- and 3-day/week versions of a social cognitive theory-driven physical activity/nutrition after-school program were evaluated against unstructured care to assess effects in children (overall Mage = 10.00 years, SD =.80). For changes over 9 months in body mass index (BMI), effects sizes (Cohen's d) were.68,.40, and.07 in the 4-day (n = 70), 3-day (n = 70), and unstructured (n = 50) groups, respectively. Similar patterns of effects were found for changes in free-time physical activity and cardiovascular endurance. Incorporating a theory-based prediction model previously supported in teens through older adults, with and without medical disorders and health-risk factors, improvements in exercise-related self-regulation and self-efficacy, and mood, significantly predicted increased free-time physical activity (R2 =.48). Effects significantly strengthened to R2 =.62 when completion/non-completion of the recommended 300 min/week of physical activity was also accounted for. Change in BMI was inversely related to physical activity change, β=-.14, p &lt;.05. The present evaluation process indicated promising effects, and indicated theory-based targets to foster future program improvements. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Introduction: Changes in unhealthy lifestyles are key elements in the prevention and treatment of obesity and hypertension. Internet-based programs offer great potential for the implementation of evidence-based interventions focused on promoting healthy habits. We evaluate the efficacy of an Internet-based self-administered program (“Living Better”) that addresses people diagnosed as being overweight or having type I obesity and hypertension. Methods: The sample was composed of a total of 106 participants (age Mean = 53; 59 males) from a public hospital in Spain, diagnosed as being overweight or having type I obesity and hypertension and randomized into two groups—the intervention group (IG; Internet-based intervention) and the control group (CG; usual medical treatment). The intervention used cognitive-behavioral strategies and psychoeducation to promote healthy habits. Anthropometric data (i.e., Body Mass Index –BMI-, waist circumference, and hip circumference) and lifestyle/psychological data (i.e., quality of life, physical activity, eating styles, motivation, mood, and self-efficacy) were assessed before and after the intervention, and at 6 and 12-month follow-ups. Results: Significant differences were observed between the IG and the CG in anthropometrical variables after intervention (i.e., BMI and waist circumference), external eating style, and anxiety and stress scores (p < 0.05). Follow-up data showed that changes were maintained in BMI, waist and hip circumference, and external eating in the IG. After receiving the Internet-based treatment, the CG also improved its clinical condition. Discussion: This study demonstrates that the Internet is a viable alternative for the delivery and dissemination of interventions focused on promoting healthy habits, and a totally self-administered intervention can produce long-term positive results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Animals adapt their foraging behavior to variations in food availability and predation risk. In Sweden, brown bears (Ursus arctos) depend on a nearly continuous intake of berries, especially bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus) during late summer and early autumn to fatten up prior to hibernation. This overlaps with the bear hunting season that starts on 21 August. Bilberry occurrence varies across space, as does human-induced mortality risk. Here, we hypothesize that brown bears select for areas with a high probability of bilberry occurrence across a boreal forest ecosystem in Sweden (H1), and that human-induced mortality risk reduces bear selection for bilberries (H2). In addition, we hypothesized that bears that survived the hunting season avoided bilberry areas associated with high risk, whereas bears that were later killed selected more strongly for berries and less against risk prior to the hunting season (H3). To evaluate our hypotheses, we used resource selection functions to contrast bear GPS relocation data (N = 35, 2012–2015) and random positions within the bearś home range with generalized linear mixed effect models against two focal variables: a map predicting bilberry occurrence and a map predicting human-induced mortality risk. We found that bears selected for areas with a high probability of bilberry occurrence (supporting H1), but avoided these areas if they were associated with and high risk of hunting mortality (supporting H2). The killed and surviving bears did not differ in their selection for bilberries, but they did differ in their selection against risk (partially supporting H3). Surviving bears strongly avoided high risk areas, whereas killed bears responded less to risk and selected for high-risk areas with a low probability of bilberry occurrence. This suggests that killed bears selected for other food sources than berries in high risk areas, which exposed them to human hunters. We conclude that bears respond to a landscape of fear during the berry season and that different foraging strategies may have a direct impact on individual mortality during the hunting season. © 2018 Gesellschaft für Ökologie},

abstract={Selenium (Se) is a metalloid of potential interest from both a toxicological and nutritional perspective, having a range of safe intake. The adverse neuro-behavioural effects of Se have been investigated in both humans and fishes, but little is known about its effects on social behaviours or the serotonergic signaling pathway in the brain. In the present study, we investigated the effects of chorionic dietary exposure to Se (as selenomethionine) at different concentrations (control, 2.1, 11.6 or 31.5 μg/g dry wt.) on antipredator avoidance, shoaling behaviour, and social group preferences in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). In addition, we also measured the expression of important genes in the serotonergic pathway that influence social behaviours. After 60 days of exposure, the highest dose (31.5 μg/g dry wt.) caused the highest level of baseline fear behaviour, with fish swimming lower in the water column and in tighter shoals compared to fish in the other treatments. With high levels of baseline fear, these fish did not significantly intensify fear behaviours in response to predation risk in the form of exposure to chemical alarm cues. When individual fish were given an opportunity to shoal with groups of differing sizes (3 vs. 4 individuals), fish exposed to the high dose spent less time with groups in general, and only control fish showed a significant preference for the larger group. In the zebrafish brain, we found significant upregulation in the mRNA expression of serotonin receptors (htr1aa and htr1b), a transporter (slc6a4a), and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (tph2), whereas there was a downregulation of the monoamine oxidase (mao) gene. The results of this study suggest that disruption of serotonergic neurotransmission might have been responsible for Se-induced impairment of antipredator and social behaviour in zebrafish. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={There is increasing evidence that among-individual differences in behaviour are, in part, generated by environmental effects. For example, diet quality can have drastically different effects on behavioural variation depending on whether it acts primarily during ontogeny (i.e. as a permanent environmental effect) or has an immediate effect on trait expression as a consequence of energy intake (i.e. temporary source of variation). Moreover, whether diet quality has a stronger effect on a trait's average expression, its variance or its covariance with other traits, remains unclear. We used a 2 × 2 factorial design crossing life stage (juvenile and adult) and diet quality (low- or high-energy content) to disentangle the effects of developmental and adult diets on the expression of behavioural differences. We tested 281 crickets for their activity levels, responses to predator cues and body mass. Neither developmental diet nor adulthood diet had any effect on population means or on the expression of an activity–antipredator response syndrome, suggesting a genetic basis for this syndrome. We did find evidence for increases in the within-individual variance as a result of exposure to a high-quality diet. However, these increases were only found for antipredator response and body mass. This indicates that diets with higher energy content can increase the potential for behavioural plasticity in antipredator response. In addition to changes in within-individual variation in behaviour, diet quality during development also mediated the links between maturation time and exploratory behaviours. More exploratory crickets matured faster when exposed to the low-quality developmental diet, but this relation was absent in the high-quality diet treatment. Our results show that changes in developmental diet quality can mediate the relationship between life history and behavioural traits later in life. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Exceptional natural phenomena, such as those that occur during a total solar eclipse, provide unique opportunities to study animal behavior outside the naturally evolved context, which can be informative in more general terms. Circumstantial descriptions of abnormal animal behavior during solar eclipses abound, although scientific studies conducted during an eclipse are relatively rare due to inherent logistical difficulties. Here, honey bee foraging and homing behavior were studied during the total solar eclipse of August 21, 2017. In the first experiment, we studied foraging behavior of honey bees during the progression of the solar eclipse and found that the foraging activity drastically decreased but did not completely cease during the totality of the eclipse, in contrast to previous reports of complete cessation. The data indicate that the level of ambient light can largely overrule the internal circadian rhythm of foraging honey bees. Furthermore, colonies with a higher need for foraging decreased their foraging activity less than satiated colonies, consistent with the hypothesis that individual foraging decisions may be influenced by colony state, which affects cost-benefit analyses. In a second experiment, the temporal dynamics of homing of released workers and drones was compared in periods before, during, and after the solar eclipse. During the totality of the eclipse, very few bees arrived back at their hive, while homing before the total eclipse was accelerated, particularly in drones. The results suggest that, while the homing abilities of honey bees are not compromised until the sun is completely eclipsed, they may still interpret the diminishing light as an indicator of deteriorating flight conditions. Our unique study provides some insight into the control of honey bee foraging behavior when external cues and internal circadian rhythms are at odds, lent support to the notion that food deprivation can lead to riskier foraging, and indicated that homing in honey bees is possible even with very small amounts of sunlight. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Behaviour, including personality, informs us about the response of animals towards their changing environment. Despite the widespread occurrence of florivorous insects and the important but often underrated ecological roles that they play, the study of florivore behaviour is neglected relative to that of pollinators and other herbivores. Specifically, we do not know how different personality types can develop among florivores and enable them to persist in habitats with an ephemeral and dynamic availability of food resources. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the following questions: whether the (a) inter-individual differences of exploration and boldness are consistent; (b) inter-population differences of exploration and boldness are consistent; (c) exploration and boldness are correlated. We collected individuals of the polyphagous floriphilic katydid, Phaneroptera brevis from four populations from wasteland sites in Singapore and performed a personality assay conducted in an insectary to investigate the exploratory and boldness levels of the individuals and populations. The major novel finding was that the floriphilic P. brevis katydids exhibit population-level personality types for boldness, but not for exploration. Some katydid individuals were consistently more exploratory and bolder than other individuals. However, contrary to our predictions, we did not find any evidence of behavioural syndromes in the katydid individuals, as the boldness level for individuals was not significantly correlated with exploration for individuals. This suggests that an individual which is more exploratory may not be equally keen to take risks and consume novel food that it encounters. Our findings also suggest that boldness and exploration are linked to ecologically important behaviours, but more studies are needed to better understand population-level personality and how and why natural selection may favour the evolution of personality in certain populations. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Starvation is considered a major cause of non-predatory mortality in zooplankton. Planktonic copepods display behavioral plasticity and small-scale behaviors associated with different foraging strategies that can affect starvation tolerance. However, little is still known about the influence of behavior on starvation tolerance in zooplankton. Here, we experimentally investigated behavioral changes and survival of planktonic copepods (adults and nauplii) with different foraging strategies under prolonged starvation. The behavioral response to starvation varied depending on the foraging strategy. The strict ambusher Oithona nana showed a low and, almost constant, motile activity (relocation jumps, <4% of the time) whereas the feeding-current feeder Temora longicornis swam for most of the time (~100%) without reducing their activity under prolonged starvation. The switching-behavior feeder Acartia tonsa move actively in the presence of food but had a low motile activity in absence of food (~12%) and decreased its motile activity during starvation (from ~12% to 3%). The observed behavioral responses to the absence of food can be broadly classified in terms of motility as: (i) “sit-and-wait” strategy for copepods with low motile activity under starvation (mostly relocation jumps) and (ii) “searching” strategy for copepods with high motility activity (swimming/cruising) under starvation. Median survival time in absence of food increased with increasing copepod body weight and it was ~1.75 fold lower in active feeders (“searching” strategy under starvation) than in ambush and switching-behavior feeders (“sit-and-wait” strategy under starvation). Thus, copepods with foraging strategies linked to a low motility (ambush feeders) and/or with behavioral plasticity to reduce motility in absence of food (switching -behavior feeders) would cope better with resource limitation/fluctuation than some active feeders. We demonstrate that behavioral plasticity and motile activity associated with foraging strategy significantly influences starvation tolerance in planktonic copepods. These results help to quantify the main trade-offs (gain vs costs) of the main zooplankton foraging strategies and emphasize that behavior is a key trait to understand the distribution of planktonic copepods in marine environments depending on trophic conditions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Heterogeneity was explored with I2, stratified analyses, and meta-regression; and publication bias was assessed with funnel plots, Begg's tests, and Egger's tests. Analyses were completed in 2017. Evidence synthesis: From 6,232 articles, a total of 60 studies were identified, including 2 million observations across 111 intervention arms in 11 countries. Food labeling decreased consumer intakes of energy by 6.6% (95% CI= –8.8%, –4.4%, n=31), total fat by 10.6% (95% CI= –17.7%, –3.5%, n=13), and other unhealthy dietary options by 13.0% (95% CI= –25.7%, –0.2%, n=16), while increasing vegetable consumption by 13.5% (95% CI=2.4%, 24.6%, n=5). Evaluating industry responses, labeling decreased product contents of sodium by 8.9% (95% CI= –17.3%, –0.6%, n=4) and artificial trans fat by 64.3% (95% CI= –91.1%, –37.5%, n=3). No significant heterogeneity was identified by label placement or type, duration, labeled product, region, population, voluntary or legislative approaches, combined intervention components, study design, or quality. Evidence for publication bias was not identified. Conclusions: From reviewing 60 intervention studies, food labeling reduces consumer dietary intake of selected nutrients and influences industry practices to reduce product contents of sodium and artificial trans fat. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Animals must respond to the ingestion of food by generating adaptive behaviors, but the role of gut-brain signaling in behavioral regulation is poorly understood. Here, we identify conserved ion channels in an enteric serotonergic neuron that mediate its responses to food ingestion and decipher how these responses drive changes in foraging behavior. We show that the C. elegans serotonergic neuron NSM acts as an enteric sensory neuron that acutely detects food ingestion. We identify the novel and conserved acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) DEL-7 and DEL-3 as NSM-enriched channels required for feeding-dependent NSM activity, which in turn drives slow locomotion while animals feed. Point mutations that alter the DEL-7 channel change NSM dynamics and associated behavioral dynamics of the organism. This study provides causal links between food ingestion, molecular and physiological properties of an enteric serotonergic neuron, and adaptive feeding behaviors, yielding a new view of how enteric neurons control behavior. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Females in diverse vertebrate and invertebrate clades often mate and produce offspring with multiple male partners. Deciphering the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the origins of females producing offspring with multiple sires remains a challenging problem, because a single male can usually provide enough sperm to fertilize all eggs produced by individual females. We tested the hypothesis that having multiple males sire individual clutches is adaptive for female eastern collared lizards, Crotaphytus collaris, by examining both the fitness costs and benefits for females of producing offspring with one versus multiple male partners. We found no support for the hypothesis that females produce offspring with multiple sires to acquire access to higher-quality food resources or refuges. However, hatching success of clutches increased with the number of males that inseminated eggs, which suggests that accepting sperm from multiple males may improve offspring hatching success through one or more mechanisms. Our results also indicate that females producing offspring with multiple male partners gained genetic advantages. Although offspring mortality from clutches sired by one versus multiple males was similar, females producing clutches sired by multiple males had more total offspring that survived to maturity, resulting in a net fitness advantage for these females. Our results suggest that producing offspring with multiple males is adaptive for female collared lizards because it promotes acquisition of several fitness benefits. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={The role of generalist predators in biological control remains controversial as they may not only reduce pest populations but also disrupt biocontrol exerted by other natural enemies. Here, we focus on spiders as a model group of generalist predators. They are among the most abundant and most diverse natural enemies in agroecosystems. We review their functional traits that influence food-web dynamics and pest suppression at organisational levels ranging from individuals to communities. At the individual and population levels, we focus on hunting strategy, body size, life stage, nutritional target, and personality (i.e., consistent inter-individual differences in behaviour). These functional traits determine the spider trophic niches. We also focus on the functional and numerical response to pest densities and on non-consumptive effects of spiders on pests. At the community level, we review multiple-predator effects and effect of alternative prey on pest suppression. Evidence for a key role of spiders in pest suppression is accumulating. Importantly, recent research has highlighted widespread non-consumptive effects and complex intraguild interactions of spiders. A better understanding of these effects is needed to optimize biocontrol services by spiders in agroecosystems. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of adult children’s migration on the smoking behavior of rural parents who are left behind and raise the concern that the rural residents’ increasing tendency to migrate to urban areas in China nowadays could encourage such a behavior. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey and applying propensity score matching method and individual-level fixed effects model, this paper addresses the potential endogeneity issues that may arise between the children’s migration decisions and parental smoking behavior. Findings: This study’s results indicate that rural parents left behind by their emigrant children indeed are more likely to sustain their smoking habit. The validated smoking effect of emigration calls for effective government programs that entail intervention to curb such potentially aggravating health risk, especially among middle-aged and older fathers. Originality/value: This paper is the first to examine the impact of children’s migration on the smoking behavior of left-behind parents in rural households in China. Our findings call for immediate attention to the smoking behavior of older age cohort in China as the scale of rural−urban migration trend is expected to increase. Moreover, given that many countries in Asia, such as India, Vietnam and Indonesia, are confronting similar issues, our findings could provide useful implications for smoking cessation and control policies in those countries. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={We aimed to describe the nutritional and behavioral strategies for rapid weight loss (RWL), investigate the effects of RWL and weight regain in winners and losers, and verify mood state and technical–tactical/time–motion parameters in mixed martial arts. The sample consisted of mixed martial arts athletes after a single real match and was separated into two groups: winners (n = 8; age: 25.4 ± 6.1 years, height: 173.9 ± 0.2 cm, habitual body mass: 89.9 ± 17.3 kg) and losers (n = 7; age: 24.4 ± 6.8 years, height: 178.4 ± 0.9 cm, habitual body mass: 90.8 ± 19.5 kg). Both groups exhibited RWL and weight regain, verified their macronutrient intake, underwent weight and height assessments, and completed two questionnaires (Profile of Mood States and RWL) at (a) 24 hr before weigh-in, (b) weigh-in, (c) postbout, and (d) during a validated time–motion and technical–tactical analysis during the bout. Variance analysis, repeated measures, and a logistic regression analysis were used. The main results showed significant differences between the time points in terms of total caloric intake as well as carbohydrate, protein, and lipid ingestion. Statistical differences in combat analysis were observed between the winners and losers in terms of high-intensity relative time (58 [10–98] s and 32 [1–60] s, respectively), lower limb sequences (3.5 [1.0–7.5] sequences and 1.0 [0.0–1.0] sequences, respectively), and ground and pound actions (2.5 [0.0–4.5] actions and 0.0 [0.0–0.5] actions, respectively), and logistic regression confirmed the importance of high-intensity relative time and lower limb sequences on mixed martial arts performance. RWL and weight regain strategies were related to technical–tactical and time–motion patterns as well as match outcomes. Weight management should be carefully supervised by specialized professionals to reduce health risks and raise competitive performance. © 2019 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

abstract={Research is increasingly documenting a neurobiological basis to violence. This review takes a neurodevelopmental perspective on the very small group of males who grow up to become persistent violent offenders. After outlining six criteria for what constitutes a neurodevelopmental disorder, the extent to which chronic violence meets these definitional criteria is examined, covering the fields of genetics, structural and functional brain imaging, and neuropsychology. Early health risk factors for violence are then outlined, including birth complications, minor physical anomalies, prenatal smoking and alcohol exposure, poor nutrition, lead exposure, and traumatic brain injury. Persistent adult violence is argued to originate in aberrant temperamental behavior in early childhood, to have a stable developmental trajectory, and to be associated with impaired education, social, and occupational functioning. Taken together, it is argued that chronic adult violence meets criterion for being conceptualized as having neurodevelopmental origins and that an important, but not sole, source of neural maldevelopment lies in prenatal and early postnatal risk factors. This review concludes with a recognition of the sociopolitical context within which a neurodevelopmental perspective on chronic violence sits, together with directions for future research, including whether a neurodevelopmental hypothesis is best applied to reactive as opposed to proactive aggression. © 2018 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health},

abstract={Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has a population prevalence of 5%. However, its prevalence is much higher in mental health and substance use treatment settings. It is associated with significant physical and psychiatric morbidity, as well as social, occupational, and legal consequences. Adult ADHD is considered to be a part of the externalizing spectrum with which it shares both homotypic comorbidity and heterotypic continuity across the lifespan. This is attributable to a shared genetic basis, which interacts with environmental risk factors such as nutritional deficiencies and psychosocial adversity to bring about epigenetic changes. This is seen to result in a lag in brain maturation particularly in the areas of the brain related to executive functioning (top-down regulation) such as the prefrontal and cingulate cortices. This delay when coupled with impairments in reward processing, leads to a preference for immediate small rewards and is common to externalizing disorders. Adult ADHD is increasingly understood to not merely be associated with the classically described symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention, but also issues with motivation, emotional recognition and regulation, excessive mind wandering, and behavioral self-regulation. These symptoms are also observed in other disorders which overlap with the externalizing spectrum such as oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, antisocial and borderline personality disorder. It is therefore important to develop both broad-based and specific interventions to be able to target these deficits which can reduce the burden and improve outcomes. © 2019 Indian Journal of Psychiatry.},

abstract={Foraging activity is needed for energy intake but increases the risk of predation, and antipredator behavioural responses, such as reduced activity, generally reduce energy intake. Hence, the mortality and indirect effects of predation risk are dependent on the energy requirements of prey. Torpor, a controlled reduction in resting metabolism and body temperature, is a common energy-saving mechanism of small mammals that enhances their resistance to starvation. Here we test the hypothesis that torpor could also reduce predation risk by compensating for the energetic cost of antipredator behaviours. We measured the foraging behaviour and body temperature of house mice in response to manipulation of perceived predation risk by adjusting levels of ground cover and starvation risk by 24 h food withdrawal every third day. We found that a voluntary reduction in daily food intake in response to lower cover (high predation risk) was matched by the extent of a daily reduction in body temperature. Our study provides the first experimental evidence of a close link between energy-saving torpor responses to starvation risk and behavioural responses to perceived predation risk. By reducing the risk of starvation, torpor can facilitate stronger antipredator behaviours. These results highlight the interplay between the capacity for reducing metabolic energy expenditure, optimal decisions about foraging behaviour and the life-history ecology of prey. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={The length of the reproductive life span, along with the number/frequency/magnitude of reproductive events, quantifies an individual's potential contribution to the next generation. By examining reproductive life span, and distinguishing it from somatic life span, we gain insight into critical aspects of an individual's potential fitness as well as reproductive and somatic senescence. Additionally, differentiating somatic and reproductive life spans can provide insight into the existence of a post-reproductive period and factors that shape its duration. Given the known importance of diet and mating system on resource allocation, I reared individual freshwater snails (Physa acuta) from 22 full-sib families under a 2 × 2 factorial design that crossed mate availability (available [outcrossing] or not [selfing]) and diet (Spirulina or lettuce) and quantified aspects of the entire life history enabling me to distinguish reproductive and somatic life spans, determine the total number of reproductive events, and evaluate how the reproductive rate changes with age. Overall, mated snails experienced shorter reproductive and somatic life spans; a diet of Spirulina also shortened both reproductive and somatic life spans. A post-reproductive period existed in all conditions; its duration was proportional to somatic but not reproductive life span. I evaluate several hypotheses for the existence and duration of the post-reproductive period, including a novel hypothesis that the post-reproductive period may result from an increase in reproductive interval with age. I conclude that the post-reproductive period may be indicative of a randomly timed death occurring as the interval between reproductive events continues to increase. As such, a “post-reproductive” period can be viewed as a by-product of a situation where reproductive senescence outpaces somatic senescence. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Maternal immune activation (MIA) refers to a maternal immune system triggered by infectious or infectious-like stimuli. A cascade of cytokines and immunologic alterations are transmitted to the fetus, resulting in adverse phenotypes most notably in the central nervous system. Epidemiologic studies implicate maternal infections in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, most commonly autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In animal models, MIA causes neurochemical and anatomic changes in the brain that correspond to those found in humans with the disorders. As our understanding of the interactions between environment, genetics, and immune system grows, the role of alternative, noninfectious risk factors, such as prenatal stress, obesity, and the gut microbiome also becomes clearer. This review considers how infectious and noninfectious etiologies activate the maternal immune system. Their impact on fetal programming and neuropsychiatric disorders in offspring is examined in the context of human and animal studies. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={The two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae is an important pest with an exceptionally broad host plant range. This generalist rapidly acclimatizes and adapts to a new host, hereby overcoming nutritional challenges and a novel pallet of constitutive and induced plant defenses. Although recent studies reveal that a broad transcriptomic response upon host plant transfer is associated with a generalist life style in arthropod herbivores, it remains uncertain to what extent these transcriptional changes are general stress responses or host-specific. In the present study, we analyzed and compared the transcriptomic changes that occur in a single T. urticae population upon long-term transfer from Phaseolus vulgaris to a similar, but chemically defended, host (cyanogenic Phaseolus lunatus) and to multiple economically important crops (Glycine max, Gossypium hirsutum, Solanum lycopersicum and Zea mays). These long-term host plant transfers were associated with distinct transcriptomic responses with only a limited overlap in both specificity and directionality, suggestive of a fine-tuned transcriptional plasticity. Nonetheless, analysis at the gene family level uncovered overlapping functional processes, recruiting genes from both well-known and newly discovered detoxification families. Of note, our analyses highlighted a possible detoxification role for Tetranychus-specific short-chain dehydrogenases and single PLAT domain proteins, and manual genome annotation showed that both families are expanded in T. urticae. Our results shed new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the remarkable adaptive potential for host plant use of generalist arthropods and set the stage for functional validation of important players in T. urticae detoxification of plant secondary metabolites. © 2018 Montesinos-López et al.},

abstract={In predator populations, changes in foraging behaviour in response to spatio-temporal variability of prey are expected. Prey depletion might cause trophic niche widening in generalist species, but not in specialists, which are expected to increase their foraging effort without diet shifts. In sympatric species feeding on similar resources, reduced food availability can in-crease interspecific competition and cause trophic niche segregation. To understand these processes, we studied the spatio-temporal variability in diet and niche width in 2 sympatric gull species, the yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis and Audouin's gull Ichthyaetus audouinii, which have experienced exponential growth in recent decades due to an increase in anthropogenic food subsidies. We sampled feathers from chicks of both species in several colonies along the western Mediterranean from 2009 to 2011 and performed stable isotope analysis of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur on these feathers. Bayesian modelling shows that both species displayed opportunistic behaviour if different types of resources were available, but could also narrow their trophic niche if 1 resource was abundant. We also provide evidence of trophic segregation between the 2 gull species, suggesting the occurrence of interspecific competition for food. Our meta-population approach provides a comprehensive view of the trophic ecology and the competitive interactions of these gull species. We emphasize the usefulness of 3-dimensional isotope analyses to correctly assess spatio-temporal variability in trophic behaviour of predator species, revealing differences that would remain hidden in single population studies or when using only the isotopic ratios of 2 elements. © Inter-Research 2018.},

abstract={Although flexibility in behavior is adaptive, this flexibility is limited, and the extent of variation and consistency of a trait could depend on the environment. In this study, we investigated repeatability in risk-taking during feeding among individuals and agonistic interactions among dyads of wild zebrafish, Danio rerio, collected from two habitats that differed in predation and flow regimes. We measured boldness as the latency to emerge from a shelter and feed in the presence of predators. We tested this for each individual from the two populations repeatedly across seven trials. We assessed aggression by subjecting size- and sex-matched pairs of fish to dyadic contests repeatedly across seven trials. Individuals from the high-predation stream population were bolder than individuals from the low-predation stagnant water population. Males were bolder than females, and in the low-predation population, larger individuals took greater risks to feed than smaller individuals. The high-predation stream population showed lower inter- and intraindividual variation in boldness than the low-predation stagnant water population. Further, both populations showed significant repeatability in risk-taking during feeding. The high-predation stream habitat fish were more aggressive than low-predation stagnant-water fish. Male dyads from the low-predation stagnant-water population were significantly more aggressive than female dyads. Most fish from the low-predation stagnant water population did not show aggressive behavior, resulting in low between-dyad but high within-dyad variation in aggression. The difference in behavioral responses between the populations and consistency in these traits within individuals is discussed in the light of confounding role of ecological and state-dependent factors. © 2018 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Flight initiation distance (FID)–the distance at which an individual leaves in response to the approach of a perceived threat–provides a measurement of risk-taking behavior. If individuals optimize their FID, this distance should reflect the point at which the fitness resulting from leaving exceeds the fitness resulting from all other possible decisions. Previous theory of FID has often been aimed at explaining this behavior in foraging individuals. Yet flight initiation in response to approaching threats occurs in a range of contexts that might influence optimal behavior. In breeding individuals, risk-taking decisions that are made at a location of offspring care (e.g., a nest or den) can have significant effects on fitness. Here, we develop a theoretical model of distances at which a parent bird flushes from a nest in response to an approaching threat. We estimate parent fitness with regards to characteristics of the parent (reproductive values, detection distance, and cost of lost parental care cost), the nest (concealment and accessibility), and the approaching predator (detection capability and predation success), developing a dichotomous scenario between staying at the nest or leaving at varying distances. Using a generalized comparison of the benefits of leaving versus staying, we find that increasing costs of lost parental care, probability of predation of the parent due to fleeing, or current reproductive value lead to more instances of staying at the nest. In a complementary approach with specified parameters based on biologically-informed factors that likely influence a predator-prey encounter, we find that increasing the current reproductive value, concealment of the nest, or costs of lost parental care decrease optimal FID and can lead to the parent staying at the nest. Other factors, such as increasing residual reproductive value, predation success, and predator capability of detecting the nest, increase optimal FID with some instances of costs of fleeing being so great that staying becomes an optimal strategy. Our theory provides a framework to explain variation in FID among nesting species and individuals and could provide a foundation for future empirical investigations of risk-taking behavior. © 2018 Dowling, Bonier.

abstract={The obesity epidemic in humans is juxtaposed by observations of passerine birds exhibiting fine-scale body mass regulation. The ecology literature is replete with research into why these animals regulate body weight, citing tradeoffs between competing pressures such as emaciation and predation. Yet studies on the underlying mechanisms of mass regulation in these animals are scarce. Maintaining or decreasing weight could obviously be achieved by limiting food intake. However, there are numerous reasons why an animal may not control ingestion, at least precisely. This Opinion article investigates the plausibility of possible behavioural and physiological mechanisms to adaptively maintain or decrease body mass in birds and other animals. Candidate behavioural mechanisms include exercising and fidgeting, while physiological mechanisms could include reducing digestive efficiency or mitochondrial efficiency. © 2018},

abstract={Background: A predator–prey relationship abounds with variables that might affect the behaviour of either species as it responds to the challenges of the predation game. In a series of experiments, we have studied the behavioural responses of goldfish (prey) and little egrets (predator) when brought together in a large laboratory apparatus – an aviary with three pools of water. To obtain a baseline, we measured their behaviour in an aviary without manipulating any variable (Katz et al., 2010). Because the results of that study suggested that both fish and egrets follow the rules of optimal foraging, we undertook a series of experiments in which we manipulated the number of food patches (Katz et al., 2014a), the number of fish per pool (Katz et al., 2014b; Vijayan et al., 2018a), and the size of goldfish refuges (Vijayan et al., 2018b). In each case, the results supported the hypothesis of optimal behaviour. Mitchell (2018, this issue) makes four predictions about the behaviours of both species as the abundance of fish resources changes in a system such as the aviary. Specifically: (1) Prey should respond very weakly, if at all, to variation in the food ration among patches. (2) The predator should allocate more time to patches with a higher prey-food ration. (3) When moving to another patch, the predator should choose the patch with the higher prey-food ration more often than it would at random. (4) The predator will kill more prey in patches receiving a larger ration of prey-food. Aims: Explore the effect of varying the abundance of fish-food on the behaviours of goldfish and little egrets in the aviary. Determine whether variation in their behaviours agrees with the predictions of Mitchell’s theoretical model. Methods: We used little egrets (the predators) and goldfish (the prey). We conducted experiments in two identical aviaries (7 m diameter). Each aviary contained three separate patches, i.e. three pools (1.52 m diameter, 0.60 m deep, ∼1000 litres), each open to foraging by a single egret in the aviary. A fixed cover (22.75 cm radius) at the centre of each pool provided a refuge for the goldfish. Each pool had 15 fish. We manipulated intraspecific competition by offering three different amounts of goldfish food in an aviary each day: full (1.13 g per day), half (0.56 g per day), and quarter (0.28 g per day) rations. We then observed and recorded the behaviours of both players for 6 hours. Results: Patch-to-patch variation in the food ration had no effect on fish activity. But the egret allocated more time to foraging in the patch where the prey-food ration was highest (1.13 g). When moving to another patch, the egret moved to the patches containing high food rations (1.13 and 0.56 g) rather than the patch with the lowest food ration (0.28 g). And the predator caught significantly fewer goldfish in these poorest patches. Thus all four predictions were validated. © 2018 Zvika Abramsky.},

abstract={Our body not only responds to environmental changes but also anticipates them. The light and dark cycle with the period of about 24 h is a recurring environmental change that determines the diurnal variation in food availability and safety from predators in nature. As a result, the circadian clock is evolved in most animals to align locomotor behaviors and energy metabolism with the light cue. The central circadian clock in mammals is located at the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus in the brain. We here review the molecular and anatomic architecture of the central circadian clock in mammals, describe the experimental and observational evidence that suggests a critical role of the central circadian clock in shaping systemic energy metabolism, and discuss the involvement of endocrine factors, neuropeptides, and the autonomic nervous system in the metabolic functions of the central circadian clock. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2018.},

abstract={Background: Paediatric obesity management remains generalised to dietary and exercise modifications with an underappreciation for the contributions of eating behaviours and appetitive traits in the development of obesity. Objectives: To determine whether treatment-seeking children and adolescents with obesity cluster into phenotypes based on known eating behaviours and appetitive traits (“eating correlates”) and how socio-demographic and clinical characteristics associate with different phenotypes. Methods: A cross-sectional, multi-centre questionnaire was administered between November 2015 and March 2017 examining correlates of eating in children and adolescents attending weight-management programmes in Canada. Latent profile analysis was used to cluster participants based on seven eating correlate scores obtained from questionnaires. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine phenotype differences on socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression models assessed relative risk of specific characteristics associating with a disordered eating phenotype. Results: Participants were 247 children and adolescents (45.3% male, mean BMI z-score = 3.4 ± 1.0 kg/m2) from six paediatric weight management centres in Canada. Seven eating correlates clustered into three distinct phenotypes: (1) loss of control eating, emotional eating, external eating, hyperphagia, impulsivity (“Mixed-Severe”; n = 42, 17%), (2) loss of control eating, emotional eating, external eating, hyperphagia (“Mixed-Moderate”; n = 138, 55.9%), and (3) impulsivity (“Impulsive”; n = 67; 27.1%). Social functioning scores and body esteem were significantly different across groups, with the Mixed-Severe participants having the poorest social functioning and lowest body esteem. Low body esteem indicated a greater risk of being in a multi-correlate group compared to the Impulsive group, while poor social function had a greater risk of clustering in the Mixed-Severe than Impulsive phenotype. Conclusions: Distinct eating phenotypes were found in treatment-seeking children and adolescents with obesity. Empirical evidence is needed, but these data suggest that tailored treatment approaches could be informed by these classifications to improve weight-management outcomes. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine the impact of food-related lifestyle (FRL) and food-related personality traits (FRPTs) on customer satisfaction and loyalty so that sufficient evidence for forming a new pattern of predictors of customer satisfaction and loyalty can be explored. Design/methodology/approach: The research method in this study was the descriptive type and was based on the goal of the applied research methods. Data were collected from 384 sample group consumers of chain stores in the city of Tehran. The hypothesized relationships were tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings: Final results of study showed the significant effects of FRL and FRPT on satisfaction and loyalty of consumers. This indicates that aforementioned variables can create customer satisfaction and loyalty toward food. The research conceptual model was confirmed with goodness of fit. Research limitations/implications: First, the sample consisted of customers who use a wide range of food despite diverse motives and interests. While knowing that costumers’ specific traits about food would have provided a more detailed and comprehensive understanding, conducting research in a set of general food consumer without considering special foods category could be a limitation. Second, and more importantly, since the customer behavior in consumption choices is an unconscious and cognitive process, other factors and domain that are linked to customer satisfaction and loyalty would have been missed. Practical implications: This study shows that understanding the behavioral aspects of food consumption can help food producing companies to adjust their production and specially to foresee changes. Marketers are advised to investigate customer traits to promote customer satisfaction and loyalty effectively. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge in food marketing. Originality/value: The present study offers a unique and valuable insight into a customer’s behavior and deepens customer satisfaction and loyalty by incorporating FRL, food neophobia scale and food involvement scale as independent variables to contribute knowledge in the context of food marketing, and throws some light upon the predictive power of mentioned variables on customer behaviors. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder and the cause of autism is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of socioeconomic, environmental, pregnancy and newborn-related risk factors among children with autism spectrum disorders. This was a population-based case–control study. The study included 55 children with autism spectrum disorder and 55 age and sex matched typically developing normal children (TD) between 3 and 12 years. Several socio-economic factors, environmental factors, pregnancy related, natal, post-natal factors and the first noticed signs by the parents were analyzed. Chi-square test was used to compare nominal variables. For multivariate analysis, forward stepwise logistic regression model was employed to examine the association between autism and the chances that the child develops ASD to assess the odds ratios. Male predominance was observed in the study. Logistic regression model showed statistical significance of the following factors: paternal age greater than 40 years, family history of autism, nutrition during pregnancy, mode of labor, fetal hypoxia, NICU stay and history of breast feeding. In this epidemiological study of autism in Coimbatore city, we found correlation between several environmental factors during fetal development and can be transmitted to succeeding generations, causing atypical behavior phenotypes. The exact exposure magnitude, exposure time in relation to vital developmental periods need to be studied to understand the influence of socioeconomic and environmental factors, which can be improved to prevent ASD-related challenges. © 2018, Belgian Neurological Society.},

abstract={Objectives: This study assessed cat owners’ perceptions of the use of psychoactive medications and alternative products for the treatment of behavioral problems in their cats. Factors that potentially impact these perceptions were explored and discussed. Methods: An online, anonymous, cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess US-based cat owners’ experience with behavior problems of their cats, familiarity with psychoactive medications for treatment of behavior problems and comfort levels using the following products for treatment of feline behavior problems: fast-acting or situational prescription medications, slow-acting or long-term prescription medications, herbal/nutritional supplements, pheromone products and cannabinoid products. Results: Many respondents reported that their cats had behavioral problems, but few had ever sought behavioral help for their cats. Only half were aware of the availability of psychoactive medications for cat behavior problems. Respondents who had personally used a prescription psychoactive medication in the past were more comfortable with giving fast- and slow-acting prescription medications, pheromone products and cannabinoids to their cats than respondents who had never used a prescription psychoactive medication. No difference in comfort level was seen for herbal/nutritional supplements. Overall, owners tended to be more comfortable with the situational vs. long-term medications. Conclusions and relevance: Given the prevalence of feline behavior problems reported in this study, the lack of awareness of either the availability or potential benefits of psychoactive medications for the treatment of feline behavior problems, and the fact that very few owners had ever sought help for behavior problems with their cats, are concerning. These results suggest a missed opportunity for veterinarians to help clients identify, understand and treat feline behavior problems. Many owners appear open to these treatment options for their cats; it is suggested that, when warranted, educating cat owners about the potential benefits and risks of these medications would be of value. © The Author(s) 2018.},

There are mainly two kinds of predation patterns for conifer seed predators, that is, pre-dispersal predation and post-dispersal predation. The process of animal prey on seeds is an important way for the regeneration of tree species. Seeds that evade predators form corresponding defensive strategies, with seed size, nutrition, fiber content, secondary metabolites and so on being generally strategies for seed protection against predators. These defensive strategies will affect the seed predator’s population dynamics and feeding behavior, and may also lead the seed predator to adapt to the seed defense. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the predation mode of seed predator on seeds of conifers in order to better understand the animal feeding behavior in coniferous forest. Meanwhile, studying the conifer seed defense and seed predator’s adaptive strategy will help understand the relationship between plants and animals. © 2018, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Ecology.

abstract={Research studies involving animal experimentation are regulated by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). To this end, the IACUC must integrate the information provided by the investigators of each preclinical study and the veterinarians from the animal facility in order to monitor and approve the process. Using a paper-based system to collect animal health and welfare data is a common, albeit time-consuming practice, prone to transcription and reading errors, not to mention inconvenient for veterinarians and investigators wishing to make timely and collaborative decisions when animal welfare is at risk. We created a web-based monitoring system focused on animal health with the potential to improve animal welfare. The data management system is based on REDCap software, which enables data integration in order to offer a solution for animal welfare assessment. The proposed scheme includes key indicators of general health status, such as environment, physical/nutritional information, and behavioral parameters during animal breeding and experimentation, as important components of animal welfare. In addition, the system facilitates communication of this information among researchers, animal facility staff, and the IACUC. REDCap is available to non-profit organizations, and may be adapted and replicated by institutions interested in and responsible for animal care, and used in research. REDCap is an excellent tool for promoting good practices that benefit experimental animal health. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Early life stress in humans (i.e. maltreatment, violence exposure, loss of a loved one) and in rodents (i.e. disrupted attachment or nesting, electric shock, restraint, predator odor) occurs during critical steps of neural circuit formation. ELS in humans is associated with increased risk for developmental psychopathology, including anxious and depressive phenotypes. The biological mechanisms underlying these potentially persistent maladaptive changes involve long-term epigenetic modifications, which have been suggested to be potentially transmissible to subsequent generations. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that modifies gene expression patterns in response to environmental challenges and influences mutation rates. It remains to be seen whether a functionally relevant fraction of DNA methylation marks can escape genome-wide erasures that occur in primordial germ cells and after fertilization within the zygote. Early life-stress-triggered changes in epigenetic mediated transmission of acquired behavioral traits among humans have been assessed mainly by targeting genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, such as NR3C1 and FKBP5. Recently, researchers examining epigenetic transmission have begun to apply genome-wide approaches. In humans, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) was performed on peripheral samples that were obtained from individuals who were prenatally exposed to the “Dutch Hunger Winter”, resulting in two Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) in INSR and CPTIA genes that were functionally, biologically and technically validated, and significantly associated with birth weights and LDL cholesterol levels in offspring. In rodents, non-genomic intergenerational transmission of anxiety which was associated with differentially methylated enhancers that were putatively involved in lipid signaling and synaptic/neurotransmission in hippocampal granule cells, was discovered also using RRBS. Finally, transgenerational transmission of altered behaviors was associated with sperm-derived microRNAs produced by ELS male mice. The field of epigenetic transmission is just beginning to enter the epigenomic era by using genome-wide analyses. Such approaches remain of strong interest to human studies, first in order to help to assess the relevance of the previous targeted studies, and second to discover new important epigenetic modifications of potential clinical importance. New discoveries may help to assess how transmittable the negative impact of stress may be to offspring. The latter may open doors for future treatments and resilience-promoting interventions, as well as new approaches to treat the effects of childhood trauma before the onset of psychiatric disorder. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Exposure to ultraviolet light is a recognized modifiable risk factor for melanoma. Melanoma patients were more likely to practice sun-protective behaviors after their diagnosis. But it is not known how long these sun-protective behaviors will sustain. We aim to evaluate if sun-protective behaviors and likelihood of recent sunburn differ according to time elapsed since the melanoma diagnosis using the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. Data in the NHANES cycle years 2003-2006 and 2010-2012 were analyzed. The relationship of sun-protective behaviors and likelihood of sunburns with the time since a melanoma diagnosis was evaluated and also adjusted for possible confounding factors such as age, gender, and skin reaction to the sun. A total of 34 participants with previous melanoma provided responses to their current sun-protective behaviors and recent occurrence of sunburns. The control group consisted of 13,871 participants who never had any diagnoses of malignancies. The control and the non-recent diagnosis groups were more likely to have sunburns but less likely to engage in consistent sun-protective behaviors compared to the recent diagnosis group. A multivariate regression model showed a 1.17 increased odds of having a recent sunburn for each additional year elapsed since a melanoma diagnosis ( p = 0.046). In our study, those with a melanoma diagnosis in the non-recent past were more likely to have sunburns and less likely to sun protect. More can definitely be done to educate and cultivate sun-protective behaviors among the U.S. population.},

abstract={Over the past thirty years, since the dawn of metagenomic studies, a completely new (micro) universe was revealed, with the potential to have profound impacts on many aspects of the society. Remarkably, the study of human microbiome provided a new perspective on a myriad of human traits previously regarded as solely (epi-) genetically encoded, such as disease susceptibility, immunological response, and social and nutritional behaviors. In this context, metagenomics has established a powerful framework for understanding the intricate connections between human societies and microbial communities, ultimately allowing for the optimization of both human health and productivity. Thus, we have shifted from the old concept of microbes as harmful organisms to a broader panorama, in which the signal of the relationship between humans and microbes is flexible and directly dependent on our own decisions and practices. In parallel, metagenomics has also been playing a major role in the prospection of "hidden" genetic features and the development of biotechnological applications, through the discovery of novel genes, enzymes, pathways, and bioactive molecules with completely new or improved biochemical functions. Therefore, this review highlights the major milestones over the last three decades of metagenomics, providing insights into both its potentialities and current challenges. © 2018 Luana de Fátima Alves et al.},

abstract={Species should avoid risks to protect accumulated fitness. However, when faced with starvation, organisms may accept risks to enhance future reproductive opportunities. We investigated the effect of starvation on risk-taking behaviour in the common earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris Linnaeus, 1758). Lumbricus terrestris are negatively phototactic annelids that feed on decaying plant matter at the soil surface. Feeding in high-light conditions is a potentially riskier choice, given the threats of visual predators and desiccation. We predicted that starvation in L. terrestris would increase risk-taking behaviour and decrease time taken (latency) to make choices. We manipulated the starvation level of L. terrestris individuals (nonstarved, half-starved, and fully starved) and presented them with a binary foraging choice. Lumbricus terrestris could choose either a low-food and dark condition (low-risk condition) or a high-food and light condition (high-risk condition). We found that starved individuals selected the high-risk condition more often than nonstarved individuals. Starved individuals also had a decreased latency to first choice. Risk-taking did not scale with level of starvation; there was no difference in foraging choice and latency between half-and fully starved individuals. Our results indicate that L. terrestris makes state-dependent foraging choices, providing insight into the importance of fundamental life-history trade-offs in this understudied species. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing.

abstract={Albert J. Stunkard, MD, was an internationally recognized leader and pioneer in the field of obesity and eating disorders research. He was also among the first scientists to study eating phenotypes and early life risk factors for childhood obesity at a time when childhood obesity prevalence rates were still comparatively low. The aim of this review is to highlight select findings from the work of Albert J. Stunkard which significantly advanced our understanding of eating traits of children with a different familial predisposition to obesity and genetic and environmental influences on weight outcomes. Collectively, Stunkard's early work on childhood obesity had a significant impact on the field of ingestive behavior and obesity research in that he was one of the first investigators who pointed to genetic influences underlying behavioral eating traits and child weight status. His work also inspired numerous subsequent investigations on the relative contributions of specific genes (e.g., polymorphisms in the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene) on individual differences in child eating traits (e.g., satiety responsiveness, eating in the absence of hunger) and body weight.},

abstract={Background The idiopathic variety of chronic pancreatitis (CP) in India particularly in Kerala state was earlier called 'tropical pancreatitis' with peculiar features: Early age of onset, severe malnutrition, diabetes and poor prognosis. A change in disease phenotype and behaviour has been observed recently. Objective To review the changing profile of CP in India and examine its relationship with environmental influences and socio-economic development. Methods Relevant studies on CP in India were reviewed along with social and economic parameters in Kerala over the past 4 decades. Results There has been a definite change in the phenotype of CP in India with onset in mid twenties, better nutritional status, and a much better prognosis compared with the reports in 1970s. Genetic susceptibility due to genetic mutations particularly in SPINK1, CFTR, CTRC, and CLDN2/MORC4 genes is the most important factor and not malnutrition or dietary toxins for idiopathic CP suggesting the term 'tropical pancreatitis' is a misnomer. We observed a close relationship between socio-economic development and rising income in Kerala with late onset of disease, nutritional status, and better prognosis of CP. Conclusion Changing profile of CP in India and better understanding of risk factors provide evidence for gene-environmental interactions in its pathobiology. © The Author(s) 2016.},
