Abstract = {{Context: The influence of food and beverage labeling (food labeling) on
   consumer behaviors, industry responses, and health outcomes is not well
   established.
   Evidence acquisition: PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
   Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed. Ten databases were
   searched in 2014 for studies published after 1990 evaluating food
   labeling and consumer purchases/orders, intakes, metabolic risk factors,
   and industry responses. Data extractions were performed independently
   and in duplicate. Studies were pooled using inverse-variance random
   effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was explored with I-2, stratified
   analyses, and meta-regression; and publication bias was assessed with
   funnel plots, Begg's tests, and Egger's tests. Analyses were completed
   in 2017.
   Evidence synthesis: From 6,232 articles, a total of 60 studies were
   identified, including 2 million observations across 111 intervention
   arms in 11 countries. Food labeling decreased consumer intakes of energy
   by 6.6\% (95\% CI= -8.8\%, -4.4\%, n=31), total fat by 10.6\% (95\% CI=
   -17.7\%, -3.5\%, n=13), and other unhealthy dietary options by 13.0\%
   (95\% CI= -25.7\%, -0.2\%, n=16), while increasing vegetable consumption
   by 13.5\% (95\% CI=2.4\%, 24.6\%, n=5). Evaluating industry responses,
   labeling decreased product contents of sodium by 8.9\% (95\% CI=
   -17.3\%, -0.6\%, n=4) and artificial trans fat by 64.3\% (95\% CI=
   -91.1\%, -37.5\%, n=3). No significant heterogeneity was identified by
   label placement or type, duration, labeled product, region, population,
   voluntary or legislative approaches, combined intervention components,
   study design, or quality. Evidence for publication bias was not
   identified.
   Conclusions: From reviewing 60 intervention studies, food labeling
   reduces consumer dietary intake of selected nutrients and influences
   industry practices to reduce product contents of sodium and artificial
   trans fat. (C) 2018 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published

Title = {{Individual- and population-level personalities in a floriphilic katydid}},

Volume = {{125}},

Abstract = {{Behaviour, including personality, informs us about the response of
   animals towards their changing environment. Despite the widespread
   occurrence of florivorous insects and the important but often underrated
   ecological roles that they play, the study of florivore behaviour is
   neglected relative to that of pollinators and other herbivores.
   Specifically, we do not know how different personality types can develop
   among florivores and enable them to persist in habitats with an
   ephemeral and dynamic availability of food resources. To address this
   knowledge gap, we investigated the following questions: whether the (a)
   inter-individual differences of exploration and boldness are consistent;
   (b) inter-population differences of exploration and boldness are
   consistent; (c) exploration and boldness are correlated. We collected
   individuals of the polyphagous floriphilic katydid, Phaneroptera brevis
   from four populations from wasteland sites in Singapore and performed a
   personality assay conducted in an insectary to investigate the
   exploratory and boldness levels of the individuals and populations. The
   major novel finding was that the floriphilic P. brevis katydids exhibit
   population-level personality types for boldness, but not for
   exploration. Some katydid individuals were consistently more exploratory
   and bolder than other individuals. However, contrary to our predictions,
   we did not find any evidence of behavioural syndromes in the katydid
   individuals, as the boldness level for individuals was not significantly
   correlated with exploration for individuals. This suggests that an
   individual which is more exploratory may not be equally keen to take
   risks and consume novel food that it encounters. Our findings also
   suggest that boldness and exploration are linked to ecologically
   important behaviours, but more studies are needed to better understand
   population-level personality and how and why natural selection may
   favour the evolution of personality in certain populations.}},

Title = {{Foraging and homing behavior of honey bees (Apis mellifera) during a
   total solar eclipse}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF NATURE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Exceptional natural phenomena, such as those that occur during a total
   solar eclipse, provide unique opportunities to study animal behavior
   outside the naturally evolved context, which can be informative in more
   general terms. Circumstantial descriptions of abnormal animal behavior
   during solar eclipses abound, although scientific studies conducted
   during an eclipse are relatively rare due to inherent logistical
   difficulties. Here, honey bee foraging and homing behavior were studied
   during the total solar eclipse of August 21, 2017. In the first
   experiment, we studied foraging behavior of honey bees during the
   progression of the solar eclipse and found that the foraging activity
   drastically decreased but did not completely cease during the totality
   of the eclipse, in contrast to previous reports of complete cessation.
   The data indicate that the level of ambient light can largely overrule
   the internal circadian rhythm of foraging honey bees. Furthermore,
   colonies with a higher need for foraging decreased their foraging
   activity less than satiated colonies, consistent with the hypothesis
   that individual foraging decisions may be influenced by colony state,
   which affects cost-benefit analyses. In a second experiment, the
   temporal dynamics of homing of released workers and drones was compared
   in periods before, during, and after the solar eclipse. During the
   totality of the eclipse, very few bees arrived back at their hive, while
   homing before the total eclipse was accelerated, particularly in drones.
   The results suggest that, while the homing abilities of honey bees are
   not compromised until the sun is completely eclipsed, they may still
   interpret the diminishing light as an indicator of deteriorating flight
   conditions. Our unique study provides some insight into the control of
   honey bee foraging behavior when external cues and internal circadian
   rhythms are at odds, lent support to the notion that food deprivation
   can lead to riskier foraging, and indicated that homing in honey bees is
   possible even with very small amounts of sunlight.}},

Journal = {{AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{65-77}},
Abstract = {{Investigating dietary resource utilization and head morphology of
   gape-limited predators can provide a basis for understanding
   interspecific competition and species coexistence. For sympatric
   species, convergence of head morphology can indicate similar prey or
   foraging strategies while divergence can suggest competition, resource
   partitioning or expansion into new habitats. Sexual dimorphism can
   further complicate the head morphology-diet relationship by potentially
   reducing intraspecific competition. To understand the relationship
   between head morphology and diet, we studied three sympatric species,
   the plain-bellied (Nerodia erythrogaster), diamondback (N. rhombifer),
   and northern (N. sipedon) watersnakes in western Kentucky. All three
   species inhabit similar wetlands and feed on amphibians and fishes. The
   anurophagous plain-bellied watersnakes had longer, narrower heads that
   likely allow snakes to capture anuran metamorphs and froglets while
   facilitating movement through dense vegetation. The piscivorous
   diamondback watersnake had a wider head, which would enhance contact
   with prey in this open-mouth forager, and smaller interocular distance,
   resulting in dorsally placed eyes that facilitate seeing fish prey from
   below. The mostly piscivorous northern watersnake had an intermediate,
   generalized head shape, which may reflect the typically wide diet range
   of this species. Head shape did not differ between snake sexes but
   diamondback and northern females had larger heads than males and fed
   more frequently on fishes. The relationship between head morphology and
   diet highlights potential interspecific and intersexual competition and
   aids in the understanding of species coexistence patterns.}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Research is increasingly documenting a neurobiological basis to
   violence. This review takes a neurodevelopmental perspective on the very
   small group of males who grow up to become persistent violent offenders.
   After outlining six criteria for what constitutes a neurodevelopmental
   disorder, the extent to which chronic violence meets these definitional
   criteria is examined, covering the fields of genetics, structural and
   functional brain imaging, and neuropsychology. Early health risk factors
   for violence are then outlined, including birth complications, minor
   physical anomalies, prenatal smoking and alcohol exposure, poor
   nutrition, lead exposure, and traumatic brain injury. Persistent adult
   violence is argued to originate in aberrant temperamental behavior in
   early childhood, to have a stable developmental trajectory, and to be
   associated with impaired education, social, and occupational
   functioning. Taken together, it is argued that chronic adult violence
   meets criterion for being conceptualized as having neurodevelopmental
   origins and that an important, but not sole, source of neural
   maldevelopment lies in prenatal and early postnatal risk factors. This
   review concludes with a recognition of the sociopolitical context within
   which a neurodevelopmental perspective on chronic violence sits,
   together with directions for future research, including whether a
   neurodevelopmental hypothesis is best applied to reactive as opposed to
   proactive aggression.}},

Abstract = {{Dairy cattle breeding has accumulated a valuable data set used for

   modern breeding programs to shorten the generation interval and thus to
   increase genetic progress. New developments in sensor technology have
   the potential to replace former costly data collection systems.
   Furthermore, phenotypes on new traits can be collected cost-efficiently
   on large amounts of animals and used for genetic improvement of these
   traits that could not be addressed so far. Examples are body condition,
   feed intake, feed conversion, and many behaviour traits.
   First analyses show that data from many on-farm sensors are not yet as

Abstract = {{Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has a population
   prevalence of 5\%. However, its prevalence is much higher in mental
   health and substance use treatment settings. It is associated with
   significant physical and psychiatric morbidity, as well as social,
   occupational, and legal consequences. Adult ADHD is considered to be a
   part of the externalizing spectrum with which it shares both homotypic
   comorbidity and heterotypic continuity across the lifespan. This is
   attributable to a shared genetic basis, which interacts with
   environmental risk factors such as nutritional deficiencies and
   psychosocial adversity to bring about epigenetic changes. This is seen
   to result in a lag in brain maturation particularly in the areas of the
   brain related to executive functioning (top-down regulation) such as the
   prefrontal and cingulate cortices. This delay when coupled with
   impairments in reward processing, leads to a preference for immediate
   small rewards and is common to externalizing disorders. Adult ADHD is
   increasingly understood to not merely be associated with the classically
   described symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention, but
   also issues with motivation, emotional recognition and regulation,
   excessive mind wandering, and behavioral self-regulation. These symptoms
   are also observed in other disorders which overlap with the
   externalizing spectrum such as oppositional defiant disorder, conduct
   disorder, antisocial and borderline personality disorder. It is
   therefore important to develop both broad-based and specific
   interventions to be able to target these deficits which can reduce the
   burden and improve outcomes.}},

Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{137-145}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Cognitive processes related to the collection, storage and use of
   information (e.g. learning, memory) contribute to reducing uncertainty
   about the environment and can thus be key to survival and reproduction.
   However, information processing is rarely cost-free, and thus cognitive
   adaptations are expected to be fined-tuned to prevailing ecological and
   social conditions. Models and laboratory experiments underline the
   importance of environmental variability in determining the value of
   information; however, we still know very little on the link between
   environmental variability and cognitive abilities in wild populations.
   Here we outline a series of studies in which we assessed information use
   and learning in conspecifics living along two ecological gradients that
   impact variability of the food supply: elevation and urbanization. While
   low- and high-elevation great tits, Parus major, were found to differ in
   accuracy in a reversal learning task, the difference was in the
   direction opposite to our prediction, with low-elevation birds
   outperforming their high-elevation counterparts. Furthermore, we found
   no relationship between urbanization and spatial memory accuracy in
   black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, despite urban habitats
   being known to harbour more stable food supplies during the winter and,
   thus, potentially providing lower incentive to invest in food hoarding
   and spatial memory. However, as predicted, chickadees in urban habitats
   explored a new environment faster and seemed to rely less heavily on
   social information about novel food patches compared to forest
   chickadees. Our results point to the need to better link predictive
   models with experienced fluctuations in food availability for individual
   foragers and to take into account social as well as ecological variables
   that can impact the value of information and may covary along natural
   gradients of harshness. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{The role of generalist predators in biological control remains

   hunting strategy, body size, life stage, nutritional target, and
   personality (i.e., consistent inter-individual differences in

   We also focus on the functional and numerical response to pest densities
   and on non-consumptive effects of spiders on pests. At the community
   level, we review multiple-predator effects and effect of alternative
   prey on pest suppression. Evidence for a key role of spiders in pest
   suppression is accumulating. Importantly, recent research has

Abstract = {{Programmes that promote dietary behaviour change for the prevention of

   and associated with effectiveness. The purpose of this overview of
   systematic reviews was to examine the characteristics and dietary
   behaviour change outcomes of nutrition interventions among populations
   with or at risk of non-communicable chronic diseases. Systematic reviews
   of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) testing dietary behaviour change
   interventions published between January 2006 and November 2015 were
   identified via searches in Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE and
   PsycINFO. Quality of reviews were appraised using AMSTAR. Dietary
   behaviour change and intervention details were extracted and
   systematically summarised. Fifteen articles met the inclusion criteria.
   Dietary behaviour changes in response to nutrition interventions were
   significant in over half of interventions. Reducing dietary fat and
   increasing fruits and vegetables were the most common behaviour changes.
   The characteristics of nutrition interventions and their relationship to
   effectiveness for dietary behaviour change among chronic disease or
   at-risk populations were reported inconsistently. However, associative
   evidence exists to support more frequent contacts and the use of
   specific behaviour change techniques. No clear relationships were found
   between effectiveness and intervention setting, mode of delivery or
   intervention provider, although some population-specific relationships
   were identified. Interventions that promote long-term maintenance of
   dietary behaviour changes are lacking in the literature. This
   comprehensive umbrella review identifies specific characteristics of
   interventions that are associated with effectiveness in interventions
   that promote dietary behaviour change among different at-risk
   populations. In order to maximise outcomes, public health, health
   promotion and healthcare organisations should consider these results in

Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{54-63}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Understanding ecosystem stability is one of the greatest challenges of
   ecology. Over several decades, it has been shown that allometric scaling
   of biological rates and feeding interactions provide stability to
   complex food web models. Moreover, introducing adaptive responses of
   organisms to environmental changes (e.g. like adaptive foraging that
   enables organisms to adapt their diets depending on resources abundance)
   improved species persistence in food webs. Here, we introduce the
   concept of metabolic adjustment, i.e. the ability of species to slow
   down their metabolic rates when facing starvation and to increase it in
   time of plenty. We study the reactions of such a model to nutrient
   enrichment and the adjustment speed of metabolic rates. We found that
   increasing nutrient enrichment leads to a paradox of enrichment
   (increase in biomasses and oscillation amplitudes and ultimately
   extinction of species) but metabolic adjustment stabilises the system by
   dampening the oscillations. Metabolic adjustment also increases the
   average biomass of the top predator in a tri-trophic food chain. In
   complex food webs, metabolic adjustment has a stabilising effect as it
   promotes species survival by creating a large diversity of metabolic
   rates. However, this stabilising effect is mitigated in enriched
   ecosystems. Phenotypic plasticity of organisms must be considered in
   food web models to better understand the response of organisms to their
   environment. As metabolic rate is central in describing biological
   rates, we must pay attention to its variations to fully understand the
   population dynamics of natural communities.}},

   items). Data processing methods: principal component analysis (the
   internal structure of HRBS), confirmatory factor analysis (the latent
   factor structure of four tested models). Sample: N=1,664 adult
   respondents.
   Results: The HRBS described ten areas of health-related behavior (ten
   extracted factors). All tested models of latent structure showed almost
   identical mathematical and statistical values of the model.
   Conclusion: Health-related behavior includes a set of partial behaviors
   (behavior related to nutrition, addictive substances, movement, and
   physical exercises). An unambiguous latent factor structure has not been
   revealed. An open question remains whether there is one latent factor
   behind all health-related behaviors or whether there are multiple latent
   factors. The use of one or the other model should be deduced from the
   underlying theory and research objectives. To find a reliable model of
   health behavior, it is necessary to include moderators and mediators
   such as personality, attitude, or economic status.}},

Abstract = {{Biological invasions often involve rapid modification of phenotypic
   traits. This is presumably in response to the novel pressures to which
   an invader is exposed, but the proximate basis for those changes remains
   unclear. Phenotypic changes may be generated by environmental factors
   (E), genetic factors (G) or the interaction between these two processes
   (GxE). To explore this issue, we obtained eight clutches of the cane
   toad (Rhinella marina) from three regions across its range of invasion
   within Australia, and raised the offspring under standard conditions
   (diet and/or exercise level manipulations) to clarify the proximate
   underpinnings of geographical divergence in phenotypic traits. Our
   results demonstrate that phenotypic variation among Australian cane toad
   populations is affected by genetics and environment, and an interaction
   between these two processes. Some traits (e.g. sprint distance) differed
   among populations, suggesting a heritable basis. Other traits (e.g.
   relative heart mass) were affected by experimental treatments but not by
   population. Intriguingly, other traits (e.g. body length) were affected
   by interactions between population of origin and experimental
   treatments. The relative importance of G, E and G x E differs among
   traits, but all three mechanisms have contributed to the rapid
   phenotypic divergence observed across the Australian range of invasive
   cane toads.}},

Abstract = {{Renewable forms of energy production can have major societal benefits
   including reduced carbon pollution and decreased dependence on fossil
   fuels but are not without associated costs. For example, habitat
   degradation at renewable energy production sites may affect the
   persistence of wildlife populations. We assessed the effects of wind
   farms in the San Gorgonio Wind Resource Area near Palm Springs,
   California, 2013-2015, on local populations of the side-blotched lizard
   (Uta stansburiana). The side-blotched lizard is a common and ubiquitous
   desert reptile that is a major consumer of invertebrates and, in turn,
   represents a key prey base for many avian, reptilian, and mammalian
   predators. We used spatially explicit capture-recapture methods to
   compare a comprehensive set of population-level vital signs (i.e.,
   abundance, population growth rate, survival, recruitment, body
   condition, age structure, activity area size, movement rates) among
   populations at 4 wind farms and at 5 reference areas. Although our
   models indicate that wind facilities have a weak negative effect on
   side-blotched lizard survival, our overall results suggest that wind
   farms do not substantially influence the demography or behavior of these
   small lizards. Population response to general anthropogenic disturbance
   (quantified as an index of road type and density) was more pronounced,
   with lower population growth rates, adult-skewed age structure, and
   reduced body condition at highly disturbed wind farm and reference
   sites. We therefore conclude that wind-power facilities can support
   healthy populations of side-blotched lizards, indicating that wind
   energy development is compatible with a native Mojave Desert species.
   However, our results show that anthropogenic disturbance, as measured by
   the type and density of roadways, has a negative effect on lizard
   populations, and should be carefully planned whether associated with
   energy development or not. Our study demonstrates a methodological
   approach that can be applied to other species, including those with
   lower tolerances to disturbance, to measure their response to renewable
   energy development. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) use their namesake
   chick-a-dee call for multiple functions, altering the features of the
   call depending on context. For example, duty cycle (the proportion of
   time filled by vocalizations) and fine structure traits (e.g., number of
   D notes) can encode contextual factors, such as predator size and food
   quality. Wilson and Mennill (2011) found that chickadees show stronger
   behavioral responses to playback of chick-a-dee calls with higher duty
   cycles, but not to the number of D notes. That is, independent of the
   number of D notes in a call, but dependent on the overall proportion of
   time filled with vocalization, birds responded more to higher duty cycle
   playback compared to lower duty cycle playback. Here we presented
   chickadees with chick-a-dee calls that contained either two D (referred
   to hereafter as 2 D) notes with a low duty cycle, 2 D notes with a high
   duty cycle, 10 D notes with a high duty cycle, or 2 D notes with a high
   duty cycle but played in reverse (a non-signaling control). We then
   measured ZENK expression in the auditory nuclei where perceptual
   discrimination is thought to occur. Based on the behavioral results of
   Wilson and Mennill, 2011, we predicted we would observe the highest ZENK
   expression in response to forward-playing calls with high duty cycles;
   we predicted we would observe no significant difference in ZENK
   expression between forward-playing high duty cycle playbacks (2 D or 10
   D). We found no significant difference between forward-playing 2 D and
   10 D high duty cycle playbacks. However, contrary to our predictions, we
   did not find any effects of altering the duty cycle or note number

Abstract = {{Regulation of food systems exists to ensure safety and enhance consumer
   confidence in the food which they purchase and consume. However, some
   regulatory systems fail to instil public confidence. In China for
   example, trust in the domestic food system is low as a consequence of
   multiple high-profile food scandals, many of which linked to food fraud.
   Fraud occurs when food is intentionally adulterated for economic gain
   and may, but not always, pose a risk to the safety of food. Food
   authenticity and quality may also be compromised. The focus of this
   research relates to how Chinese consumers perceive food fraud and make
   choices in the absence of trust in regulatory systems. Seven focus
   groups with middle class Chinese participants in tier 1 and 2 cities
   (Beijing, Guangzhou and Chengdu) were conducted to explore attitudes of
   and perception towards food fraud. Infant milk formula, olive oil and
   Scotch whisky were used as prompts for attitudinal and perceptual
   elicitation. The findings indicated that Chinese consumers consider food
   fraud to represent a food hazard that poses a threat to the
   authenticity, quality and reliability of food and increased the risk of
   purchasing and consuming of unsafe food. Consumers were found to rely on
   informal kinship networks as trusted sources of information regarding
   food products' authenticity and safety. Behavioural responses included a
   range of risk relieving strategies to support food purchasing
   judgements, in the perceived absence of regulatory protection, that
   included: pre-purchase and consumption information seeking; the use of
   product attributes as authenticity cues; carefully selected acquisition
   sources; as well as a range of domestically-situated food practices. The
   strategic implications for food companies and policy are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Virgin queens (gynes) exhibit a range of behaviors in order to be

   queens perform less wing vibration and trophallaxis with their workers.
   Furthermore, the treated gynes encounter more harassment (aggression)

   indicate that the behavioral repertoire underlying the queen selection
   process by the stingless bee P. droryana may be seriously affected by
   residual doses of imidacloprid in larval food. As a result, such queens

Abstract = {{There are three non-mutually-exclusive key strategies evolved by gene
   pools to cope with fluctuating food resource availability, including
   evolutionary adaptation, phenotypic plasticity, and migration. We focus
   primarily on evolutionary adaptation and behavioral plasticity, which is
   a type of phenotypic plasticity, resulting in life-history changes as
   ways of dealing with fluctuations in food resource availability. Using
   EcoSim, a predator-prey individual-based model, we compare individuals
   with stable food resources with those in environments where there are
   fluctuating food resources in terms of adaptation through behavioral
   plasticity and evolution. The purpose of our study is to determine
   whether evolution and behavioral plasticity truly play a role in
   adapting to an environment with fluctuating food resources, as well as
   to determine whether there are specific gene divergences between gene
   pools in fluctuating. food resource environments versus gene pools where
   food resources are relatively stable. An important result of our study
   is that individuals in environments that are unstable with respect to
   food resource availability exhibited significant differences in
   behaviors versus those in environments with stable food resources.
   Although behavioral plasticity facilitates a rapid response to unstable
   food conditions, our study revealed the evolution of perceptual traits
   such as vision range in reaction to fluctuating food resources,
   indicating the importance of evolution in adapting to unstable resource
   environments in the long run. Moreover, using decision trees, we found
   that there were significant behavioral gene divergences between
   individuals in environments with fluctuating food resources as opposed
   to individuals in environments with stable food resources. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Organisms can mitigate the effects of long term variation in
   environmental conditions through acclimation, which involves changes in
   various physiological responses. To elucidate the possible effects of
   temperature and food concentrations on acclimation capacity,
   physiological responses of the mussel, Perna viridis, were measured
   after individuals were held for six weeks under varying temperatures and
   food availability. Warm-acclimated mussels experiencing higher food
   levels had significantly greater upper thermal limits than those
   maintained on lower food levels. In contrast, the upper thermal limits
   of cold-acclimated mussels were not affected by food levels. For
   warm-acclimated mussels, differences in upper thermal limits were likely
   due to rapid depletion of energy storage as predicted by Dynamic Energy
   Budget model simulations for P. viridis exposed to lower food levels.
   Clearance rates of cold-acclimated mussels were significantly lower than
   warm-acclimated mussels, regardless of food availability. The impacts of
   lower food acquisition on energy storage, however, could be compensated
   by lower metabolic rates of the cold-acclimated mussels. The
   availability and the ability to acquire food are not, therefore, the
   main drivers differentiating between the upper thermal tolerances of
   cold- and warm-acclimated mussels, but these differences are driven by
   the past thermal history the mussels experienced. The temperature
   tolerance range of P. viridis showed a positive shift to tolerate higher
   temperatures after acclimation. Such flexibility in thermal tolerance
   implies P. viridis has high capacity to acclimate to novel environments,
   which will enhance its future success given its commercial importance as
   an aquaculture species.}},

Abstract = {{The length of the reproductive life span, along with the
   number/frequency/magnitude of reproductive events, quantifies an
   individual's potential contribution to the next generation. By examining
   reproductive life span, and distinguishing it from somatic life span, we
   gain insight into critical aspects of an individual's potential fitness
   as well as reproductive and somatic senescence. Additionally,
   differentiating somatic and reproductive life spans can provide insight
   into the existence of a post-reproductive period and factors that shape
   its duration. Given the known importance of diet and mating system on
   resource allocation, I reared individual freshwater snails (Physa acuta)
   from 22 full-sib families under a 2 x 2 factorial design that crossed
   mate availability (available {[}outcrossing] or not {[}selfing]) and
   diet (Spirulina or lettuce) and quantified aspects of the entire life
   history enabling me to distinguish reproductive and somatic life spans,
   determine the total number of reproductive events, and evaluate how the
   reproductive rate changes with age. Overall, mated snails experienced
   shorter reproductive and somatic life spans; a diet of Spirulina also
   shortened both reproductive and somatic life spans. A post-reproductive
   period existed in all conditions; its duration was proportional to
   somatic but not reproductive life span. I evaluate several hypotheses
   for the existence and duration of the post-reproductive period,
   including a novel hypothesis that the post-reproductive period may
   result from an increase in reproductive interval with age. I conclude
   that the post-reproductive period may be indicative of a randomly timed
   death occurring as the interval between reproductive events continues to
   increase. As such, a ``post-reproductive{''} period can be viewed as a
   by-product of a situation where reproductive senescence outpaces somatic
   senescence.}},

Abstract = {{Recurrent environmental changes often prompt animals to alter their

   tests for effects of rarer disturbance events like fire. Fire can
   dramatically alter plant community structure, with important knock-on

   avoiding burns during the day, but selecting them at night. Elk
   selection for burns was strongest in early summer and the relative
   probability of elk using burns peaked quickly (5 yr post burn) before

Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{11310-11320}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this study was is to determine if estrous expression, as
   measured by an automated activity monitor (AAM), affects timing and
   failure of ovulation of lactating Holstein dairy cows. Cows were
   equipped with 2 AAM, 1 neck-mounted (AAM(c) ) and 1 leg-mounted
   (AAM(L)), by 10 d postpartum and enrolled into the trial when their
   activity crossed the alert threshold on the AAM(c). A total of 850
   episodes of estrus from 293 different cows were used for this study.
   When cows were enrolled, their ovaries were scanned by transrectal
   ultrasonography and gait and body condition scored. Ovaries of cows
   detected in estrus were scanned twice daily for a maximum of 3 d to
   determine the disappearance of the preovulatory follicle (ovulation) and
   the interval from estrus to ovulation was calculated. Physical activity
   data recorded from the AAM were used to determine estrus behavior using
   2 traits: (1) peak activity and (2) duration. Peak activity was only
   available for the AAM(L). Peak activity was defined as the maximum
   activity during an estrus episode. Duration of estrus was defined as the
   time the activity of the cow exceeded threshold values set by the AAM
   software. The AAM(c) correctly identified 87.8\% of the estrus alerts,
   with 12.2\% false positives. The average (+/- standard deviation)
   intervals from activity alert to ovulation were 25.8 +/- 10.2 and 24.7
   +/- 9.3 h for the AAM(c) and AAM(L), respectively. Changes in estrous
   expression were associated with differences in the interval from alert
   to ovulation. Cows with short intervals to ovulation were found to have
   less intense estrous expression than cows with medium and long length
   intervals to ovulation using the AAM(c), whereas using the AAM(L), cows
   with short intervals to ovulation exhibited less intense estrous
   expression than cows with medium but the same as those with long
   intervals to ovulation. Furthermore, irrespective of the AAM, estrus
   events with less estrous expression had increased odds of having a short
   interval to ovulation (below the median of 20 h) when compared with
   those having greater estrous expression (2.6 and 1.9 increased odds for
   the AAM(c) and AAM(L), respectively). Ovulation failure was affected by
   estrous expression because estrus events with greater peak activity or
   longer duration had reduced ovulation failure compared with those with
   less estrous expression (AAM(c) peak activity: 1.9 +/- 1.4 vs. 9.5 +/-
   1.7\%; AAM(L) peak activity: 2.3 +/- 1.4 vs. 6.2 +/- 1.5\%; AAM(c)
   duration: 2.1 +/- 1.4 vs. 8.9 +/- 1.7\%). In addition, cows with more
   estrous expression had greater pregnancy per artificial insemination
   than those with less estrous expression with both the AAM(c) (42.3 +/-
   0.4 vs. 31.7 +/- 0.4\%) and the AAM(L) (43.1 +/- 0.4 vs. 36.3 +/-
   0.4\%). Pregnancy per artificial insemination results were consistent
   even when removing cows that failed to ovulate. In conclusion,
   expression of estrus was highly associated with ovulation timing,
   ovulation failure, and fertility when using 2 different AAM. Cows with
   greater estrous expression have longer intervals from activity alert to
   ovulation, experience less ovulation failure, and have greater pregnancy
   per artificial insemination.}},

Abstract = {{Animals always seek rewards and the related neural basis has been well

   largely unknown, although this is commonly seen in behaviors such as
   predation. Here, we set up a behavioral model of repeated failure in
   reward pursuit (RFRP) in Drosophila larvae. In this model, the larvae
   were repeatedly prevented from reaching attractants such as yeast and
   butyl acetate, before finally abandoning further attempts. After giving
   up, they usually showed a decreased locomotor speed and impaired

   phenotypes of RFRP states. In larvae that had developed RFRP phenotypes,
   the octopamine concentration was greatly elevated, while th mutants
   devoid of octopamine were less likely to develop RFRP phenotypes, and
   octopamine feeding efficiently restored such defects. By down-regulating
   th in different groups of neurons and imaging neuronal activity, neurons
   that regulated the development of RFRP states and the behavioral
   exhibition of RFRP phenotypes were mapped to a small subgroup of
   non-glutamatergic and glutamatergic octopaminergic neurons in the
   central larval brain. Our results establish a model for investigating
   the effect of depriving an expected reward in Drosophila and provide a
   simplified framework for the associated neural basis.}},

Abstract = {{The threat of predation influences decisions made by prey animals and
   alters the way that prey interact with other species in their
   environment. Animals often alter their foraging behaviour in response to
   a predatory threat by increasing or decreasing food consumption or by
   changing their feeding preferences to focus on foods that limit their
   exposure to the threat. Changes in grazing pressure and diet selectivity
   can have significant impacts on the abundance and diversity of the
   prey's food resources. In this study, we examined the indirect effects
   of a predatory fish on macrophyte biomass, mediated by crayfish
   responses to predator odours. Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides,
   Centrarchidae) were housed in flow-through stream mesocosms to produce
   odour cues that initiated a nonconsumptive effect on rusty crayfish
   (Faxonius rusticus, Cambaridae) held in an adjacent section of the
   stream. Crayfish were offered three species of macrophytes (Myriophyllum
   exalbescens, Haloragaceae; Elodea canadensis, Hydrocharitaceae; Chara
   spp., Characeae) and were allowed to graze for 48 hr. Consumption of
   each plant species was measured by weighing the plant samples before and
   after every trial. The plant samples were further analysed for total
   phenolic content using the Folin-Ciocalteu method. Foraging and shelter
   use behaviours were quantified by analysis of video recordings for time
   spent foraging in the mesocosm and time spent in the shelter zone of the
   mesocosm. Crayfish consumed greater quantities of macrophyte tissue when
   predator cues were present, and this result was unexpected and is
   contrary to most observations in the literature. When threatened, the
   crayfish also showed a preference for two of the macrophyte species,
   which did not exist in trials without bass odour. This could be due to
   differences in total phenolic content among the three plant species
   tested. The results provide evidence for a strong indirect effect of
   predatory fish on the macrophyte community mediated by changes in
   crayfish behaviour under threat. Crayfish act as keystone species in
   stream ecosystems; thus, changes in their foraging behaviour and dietary
   preferences caused by exposure to predator odour cues could have
   important effects on macrophyte communities in lotic systems.}},

Volume = {{208}},
Pages = {{42-48}},

Abstract = {{Plasticity in life-history traits and behaviors allows organisms to
   track spatial environmental variation, such as that resulting from a
   latitudinal gradient. In estuaries, hydrological patterns can vary
   greatly with latitude, causing variable habitat use patterns across a
   species range. For Common Snook (Centropomus undecimalis) a large
   euryhaline fish, seasonal movements between the open estuary and
   freshwater reaches of rivers have been documented. We hypothesized that
   the timing of river use by Snook would be driven primarily by the
   magnitude of freshwater inflow, except at the northern limit of its
   range where lethal water temperatures may be a stronger influence. Data
   from electrofishing studies (20122016) conducted in rivers associated
   with four estuaries along a latitudinal gradient in western Florida were
   compared for seasonal differences in Snook abundance using negative
   binomial regression. In rivers of southwestern Florida (those in
   Everglades and Charlotte Harbor), Snook abundances increased three-fold
   during the time of year when surface waters inundating floodplains
   recede and force prey into the main stems of rivers. These
   hydrologically driven processes, and surges in Snook abundance, occurred
   during spring in the Everglades and fall in rivers of Charlotte Harbor.
   In Tampa Bay rivers, which have less freshwater inflow than the rivers
   farther south, Snook abundance differed little between seasons. In
   spring-fed rivers north of Tampa Bay, Snook abundances in fall and
   winter were twice those of spring and summer; stable water temperatures
   were thought to provide thermal refuge at the northernmost range of
   Snook. This work illustrates how the timing of habitat use by a species,
   and the underlying reasons, can differ greatly among sites. It also
   demonstrates the value of cross-site comparisons in providing for a more
   complete understanding of how a species uses available habitats across
   its range.}},

Volume = {{167}},
Pages = {{78-81}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to establish a minimally invasive rumenostomy
   technique in sheep. Five 8-month old male sheep underwent exploratory
   laparoscopy using two 10-mm portals. The trocars were inserted in the
   paralombar fossa of the animals using thee technique of Hasson. During
   the examination, the rumen was visualized and grasped with a babcock
   forceps then brought near to the second portal and, simultaneously, the
   abdomen was deflated. Using a scalpel blade, a puncture incision was
   made in the rumen, through which a Foley Catheter (5 mL, 2-Way, 18
   Fr/Ch, 6.0 mm) was inserted. After the cuff was inflated, a purse-string
   suture was performed around the catheter, penetrating only the serous
   layer of the rumen. Then two cruciate sutures were applied for
   rumenopexy. Finally, the muscle layer was synthesized, followed by skin
   suture, with two horizontal mattress sutures lateral to the catheter. A
   single dose of 20 mg/kg of oxytetracycline was administered and, if
   necessary, rescue analgesia with 5 mg/kg of tramadol. Ruminal fluid was
   collected daily to test the viability of the catheter, and wound healing
   around the surgical wound was evaluated. Surgical time and
   trans-surgical complications were recorded and post-surgical pain was
   also assessed, using a behavioral scale. After 65 days, the animals were
   sent to the slaughterhouse where carcass analysis was performed, mainly
   observing the place where the Foley Catheter was placed. All animals
   presented satisfactory recovery, and no need for analgesia at any time.
   Throughout the entire period, there was no extravasation of rumenal
   fluid through the surgical wound, not even when the catheter was
   removed. This study shows that the minimally invasive technique of
   rumenostomy performed was efficient, with extremely advantageous
   results, both in the execution of the technique and well-being of the
   animals. It may be still very important for nutritional and
   digestibility studies, as well as for relapsing tympani therapy.}},

Abstract = {{According to climate science, ocean warming is one of the current and
   future greatest threats to coastal ecosystems. Projection scenarios for
   the end of this century show that tropical intertidal ecosystems are
   particularly at risk. In this study we optimized and tested a holistic
   method for bio-monitoring present and projected thermal pressure in such
   ecosystems, in order to assess organism vulnerability to ocean warming.
   Several species representative of different animal groups (fish,
   crustaceans and gastropods) were collected from the field and subjected
   to an experimental trial for 28 days, testing two temperatures: control
   (present seawater summer temperature) and elevated temperature (+3
   degrees C, projected seawater temperature anomaly for 2100). Muscle
   samples were collected weekly to quantify several biomarkers of: i)
   macromolecular damage (protein unfolding and denaturation, and lipid
   peroxidation), ii) reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers (antioxidant
   enzymes), and iii) body condition (energy reserves and body mass). These
   biomarkers were combined in integrated biomarker response (IBR) indices,
   either in three separate stress response categories (as previously
   defined) or in a unique combined analysis of overall physiological
   performance. Both approaches suggest that temperature affected IBRs,
   with increasing temperatures significantly impairing the overall health
   of individuals. Biomarkers of lower levels of biological organization
   indicated deleterious effects of temperature, whereas biomarkers of
   higher levels suggested maintenance of performance after chronic
   exposure. Overall indices combining the estimates of biomarkers across
   levels of biological organization are essential to predict the
   vulnerability of species, or populations, to climate warming. Such
   indices may assist managers and stakeholders in the establishment of
   monitoring programs and environmental policies toward the conservation
   of fragile coastal systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   distance in nesting birds}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Flight initiation distance (FID)-the distance at which an individual
   leaves in response to the approach of a perceived threat-provides a
   measurement of risk-taking behavior. If individuals optimize their FID,
   this distance should reflect the point at which the fitness resulting
   from leaving exceeds the fitness resulting from all other possible
   decisions. Previous theory of FID has often been aimed at explaining
   this behavior in foraging individuals. Yet flight initiation in response
   to approaching threats occurs in a range of contexts that might
   influence optimal behavior. In breeding individuals, risk-taking
   decisions that are made at a location of offspring care (e.g., a nest or
   den) can have significant effects on fitness. Here, we develop a
   theoretical model of distances at which a parent bird flushes from a
   nest in response to an approaching threat. We estimate parent fitness
   with regards to characteristics of the parent (reproductive values,
   detection distance, and cost of lost parental care cost), the nest
   (concealment and accessibility), and the approaching predator (detection
   capability and predation success), developing a dichotomous scenario
   between staying at the nest or leaving at varying distances. Using a
   generalized comparison of the benefits of leaving versus staying, we
   find that increasing costs of lost parental care, probability of
   predation of the parent due to fleeing, or current reproductive value
   lead to more instances of staying at the nest. In a complementary
   approach with specified parameters based on biologically-informed
   factors that likely influence a predator-prey encounter, we find that
   increasing the current reproductive value, concealment of the nest, or
   costs of lost parental care decrease optimal FID and can lead to the
   parent staying at the nest. Other factors, such as increasing residual
   reproductive value, predation success, and predator capability of
   detecting the nest, increase optimal FID with some instances of costs of
   fleeing being so great that staying becomes an optimal strategy. Our
   theory provides a framework to explain variation in FID among nesting
   species and individuals and could provide a foundation for future
   empirical investigations of risk-taking behavior.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{606}},
Pages = {{201-214}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In predator populations, changes in foraging behaviour in response to
   spatio-temporal variability of prey are expected. Prey depletion might
   cause trophic niche widening in generalist species, but not in
   specialists, which are expected to increase their foraging effort
   without diet shifts. In sympatric species feeding on similar resources,
   reduced food availability can increase interspecific competition and
   cause trophic niche segregation. To understand these processes, we
   studied the spatio-temporal variability in diet and niche width in 2
   sympatric gull species, the yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis and
   Audouin's gull Ichthyaetus audouinii, which have experienced exponential
   growth in recent decades due to an increase in anthropogenic food
   subsidies. We sampled feathers from chicks of both species in several
   colonies along the western Mediterranean from 2009 to 2011 and performed
   stable isotope analysis of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur on these
   feathers. Bayesian modelling shows that both species displayed
   opportunistic behaviour if different types of resources were available,
   but could also narrow their trophic niche if 1 resource was abundant. We
   also provide evidence of trophic segregation between the 2 gull species,
   suggesting the occurrence of interspecific competition for food. Our
   meta-population approach provides a comprehensive view of the trophic
   ecology and the competitive interactions of these gull species. We
   emphasize the usefulness of 3-dimensional isotope analyses to correctly
   assess spatio-temporal variability in trophic behaviour of predator
   species, revealing differences that would remain hidden in single
   population studies or when using only the isotopic ratios of 2 elements.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and automated vehicles can contribute to
   reduce traffic congestion and accidents. Recently, an on-road study has
   shown that drivers may prefer to deactivate full-range ACC when closing
   in on a slower leader and to overrule it by pressing the gas pedal a few
   seconds after the activation of the system. Notwithstanding the
   influence of these control transitions on driver behaviour, a
   theoretical framework explaining driver decisions to transfer control
   and to regulate the target speed in full-range ACC is currently missing.
   This research develops a modelling framework describing the underlying
   decision making process of drivers with full-range ACC at an operational
   level, grounded on Risk Allostasis Theory (RAT). Based on this theory, a
   driver will choose to resume manual control or to regulate the ACC
   target speed if its perceived level of risk feeling and task difficulty
   falls outside the range considered acceptable to maintain the system
   active. The feeling of risk and task difficulty evaluation is formulated
   as a generalized ordered probit model with random thresholds, which vary
   between drivers and within drivers over time. The ACC system state
   choices are formulated as logit models and the ACC target speed
   regulations as regression models, in which correlations between system
   state choices and target speed regulations are captured explicitly. This
   continuous-discrete choice model framework is able to address
   interdependencies across drivers' decisions in terms of causality,
   unobserved driver characteristics, and state dependency, and to capture
   inconsistencies in drivers' decision making that might be caused by
   human factors.
   The model was estimated using a dataset collected in an on-road
   experiment with full range ACC. The results reveal that driver decisions
   to resume manual control and to regulate the target speed in full-range
   ACC can be interpreted based on the RAT. The model can be used to
   forecast driver response to a driving assistance system that adapts its
   settings to prevent control transitions while guaranteeing safety and
   comfort. The model can also be implemented into a microscopic traffic
   flow simulation to evaluate the impact of ACC on traffic flow efficiency
   and safety accounting for control transitions and target speed
   regulations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The article considers the creative dialogue between Platonov and Gorky.
   It is established that Platonov's interest in Gorky's personality and
   work was manifested in a review of the play in 1921. It turns out that
   this review was written in the context of Platonov's series of articles
   on hydration, which he considered the main condition for overcoming
   hunger. This circumstance gives grounds to put forward a hypothesis that
   Platonov knew about the activities of Gorky as the initiator of the
   committee for helping the hungry and the organizer of this assistance
   abroad. This gives grounds for the conclusion that in 1921 the writers
   were active participants in the program of real assistance to the
   starving, and Platonov devoted several years to this activity (the
   period from 1921 to 1926).
   The reasons for the differences between Platonov and Gorky in
   understanding the goals and tasks of Soviet literature and the work of
   the Soviet writer are elucidated. The difference in positions was
   manifested in Gorky's ambiguous play ``High Voltage{''}, which was not
   published in the Gorky's almanac and was not staged in the theater,
   although it is one of the vertices of the innovative dramaturgy of
   Platonov.}},

Abstract = {{Laying hens housed in free-range systems have access to an outdoor
   range, and individual hens within a flock differ in their ranging
   behaviour. Whether there is a link between ranging and laying hen
   welfare remains unclear. We analysed the relationships between ranging
   by individual hens on a commercial free-range layer farm and
   behavioural, physiological and health measures of animal welfare. We
   hypothesised that hens that access the range more will be (1) less
   fearful in general and in response to novelty and humans, (2) have
   better health in terms of physical body condition and (3) have a reduced
   physiological stress response to behavioural tests of fear and health
   assessments than hens that use the range less. Using radio frequency
   identification tracking across two flocks, we recorded individual hens'
   frequency, duration and consistency of ranging. We also assessed how far
   hens ventured into the range based on three zones: 0 to 2.4, 2.4 to 11.4
   or >11.4 m from the shed. We assessed hen welfare using a variety of
   measures including: tonic immobility, open field, novel object, human
   approach, and human avoidance (HAV) behavioural tests; stress-induced
   plasma corticosterone response and faecal glucocorticoid metabolites;
   live weight, comb colour, and beak, plumage, footpad, and keel bone
   condition. Range use was positively correlated with plasma
   corticosterone response, faecal glucocorticoid metabolites, and greater
   flight distance during HAV. Hens that used the range more, moved towards
   rather than away from the novel object more often than hens that ranged
   less. Distance ranged from the shed was significantly associated with
   comb colour and beak condition, in that hens with darker combs and more
   intact beaks ranged further. Overall the findings suggest that there is
   no strong link between outdoor range usage and laying hen welfare.
   Alternatively, it may be that hens that differed in their ranging
   behaviour showed few differences in measures of welfare because
   free-range systems provide hens with adequate choice to cope with their

   Effects of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation with Different Nutritional and

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{We examined the food preference of Chinese mitten crabs, Eriocheir
   sinensis (H. Milne Edwards, 1853), under food shortage, habitat choice
   in the presence of predators, and cannibalistic behavior by comparing
   their response to the popular culture plant Elodea nuttallii and the
   structurally more complex Myriophyllum verticillatum L. in a series of
   mesocosm experiments. Mitten crabs were found to consume and thus reduce
   the biomass of Elodea, whereas no negative impact on Myriophyllum
   biomass was recorded. In the absence of adult crabs, juveniles preferred
   to settle in Elodea habitats (appearance frequency among the plants:
   64.2 +/- 5.9\%) but selected for Myriophyllum instead when adult crabs
   were present (appearance frequency among the plants: 59.5 +/- 4.9\%).
   The mortality rate of mitten crabs in the absence of plant shelter was
   higher under food shortage, primarily due to cannibalism. The proportion
   of molting crabs dying in the structurally more complex Myriophyllum
   habitats was significantly lower than in the less complex Elodea
   habitats, indicating that Myriophyllum provides better protection from
   cannibalistic behavior, likely due to its structurally more complex
   canopy. Stable isotope analyses of crab samples revealed a trophic shift
   in both delta C-13 and delta N-15 (Delta delta C-13: 2.2-4.0 parts per
   thousand; Delta delta N-15: 1.5-2.8 parts per thousand) during the
   experimental period. Significant positive correlations between body mass
   and delta C-13 and delta N-15 were recorded, suggesting that
   cannibalistic feeding might further increase crab growth and lead to
   ontogenetic increases in trophic position with increasing size. Our
   study overall demonstrates that a combination of submerged aquatic
   vegetation functioning as a highly suitable food with other less
   palatable plant species acting as efficient refuges against predators
   may be the optimal method of plant stocking in mitten crab aquacultures
   to ensure both high crab growth and a high survival rate.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. - Gastrostomy is a method of reference in the renutrition of
   malnourished elderly people. However, only few physicians use an enteral
   nutrition. The aim of this study was to analyze the representations and
   practices of physicians about gastrostomy in patients above 70
   years-old, and to identify difficulties encountered in decision making
   in geriatrics.
   Materials ans methods. - This study was a qualitative research based on
   individual, semi-directed interviews.
   Results. - Ten physicians, geriatrics and palliative care, were
   interviewed. Their theoretical knowledge followed French and European
   recommendations in terms of indication, contra-indication and
   surveillance of risk factors for gastrostomy. Physicians had a
   pejorative representation of gastrostomy. It depended on the
   representation of the ``food{''}, which is specific, according to the
   personality, the design of care and sociocultural references.
   Difficulties encountered by physicians in decision-making were related
   to lack of training, lack of experience and influence of individual
   representations. Decision-making required a global and personalized
   evaluation of each patient. To make a decision, physician considered the
   patient's opinion first.
   Conclusion. - Awareness of one's own representations can improve
   support. Methods to improve geriatric practice about gastrostomy are:
   training physicians, analysis of complex cases, formalizing
   multidisciplinary meetings and conducting collegiality ethical

Pages = {{10711-10721}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Fishing gears are designed to exploit the natural behaviors of fish, and
   the concern that fishing may cause evolution of behavioral traits has
   been receiving increasing attention. The first intuitive expectation is
   that fishing causes evolution toward reduced boldness because it
   selectively removes actively foraging individuals due to their higher
   encounter rate and vulnerability to typical gear. However, life-history
   theory predicts that fishing, through shortened life span, favors
   accelerated life histories, potentially leading to increased foraging
   and its frequent correlate, boldness. Additionally, individuals with
   accelerated life histories mature younger and at a smaller size and
   therefore spend more of their life at a smaller size where mortality is
   higher. This life-history evolution may prohibit increases in
   risk-taking behavior and boldness, thus selecting for reduced
   risk-taking and boldness. Here, we aim to clarify which of these three
   selective patterns ends up being dominant. We study how
   behavior-selective fishing affects the optimal behavioral and
   life-history traits using a state-dependent dynamic programming model.
   Different gear types were modeled as being selective for foraging or
   hiding/resting individuals along a continuous axis, including
   unselective fishing. Compared with unselective harvesting, gears
   targeting hiding/resting individuals led toward evolution of increased
   foraging rates and elevated natural mortality rate, while targeting
   foraging individuals led to evolution of decreased foraging rates and
   lower natural mortality rate. Interestingly, changes were predicted for
   traits difficult to observe in the wild (natural mortality and behavior)
   whereas the more regularly observed traits (length-at-age, age at
   maturity, and reproductive investment) showed only little sensitivity to
   the behavioral selectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The impact of cognitive-behavioral strategies and clinical
   factors on diet change during cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is not well
   studied. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of

   Methods: We retrospectively examined the effects of clinical factors and
   goal-setting facilitated by case managers on diet scores and weight loss
   in 629 consecutive patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
   enrolled in our CR program between 2014 and 2016. The Rate Your Plate
   (RYP) diet score was used to measure diet quality at baseline and
   discharge. Logistic regression modeling was used to identify predictors
   of diet score change in a subsample with goal-setting data (n = 615).
   Analysis of variance was conducted in the subset with complete weight
   data (n = 584) to compare weight loss between those who improved their
   RYP scores versus those who did not.
   Results: Participants were 27.9\% female, with a mean age of 63.4 11.5
   y. The average body mass index at baseline was 30.3 +/- 6.8, and 51.7\%
   reported diet change and/or weight loss as a goal. After an average of
   33 CR sessions, 27.3\% improved their RYP scores by at least 1 risk
   category (mean score, 54.0 +/- 9.0 vs 58.2 +/- 7.3, P < .001) and the
   average weight loss was 1.5 +/- 2.9 kg (P < .001). After logistic

Abstract = {{Although flexibility in behavior is adaptive, this flexibility is

   in risk-taking during feeding among individuals and agonistic
   interactions among dyads of wild zebrafish, Danio rerio, collected from
   two habitats that differed in predation and flow regimes. We measured
   boldness as the latency to emerge from a shelter and feed in the
   presence of predators. We tested this for each individual from the two
   populations repeatedly across seven trials. We assessed aggression by
   subjecting size- and sex-matched pairs of fish to dyadic contests
   repeatedly across seven trials. Individuals from the high-predation
   stream population were bolder than individuals from the low-predation
   stagnant water population. Males were bolder than females, and in the
   low-predation population, larger individuals took greater risks to feed
   than smaller individuals. The high-predation stream population showed
   lower inter- and intraindividual variation in boldness than the
   low-predation stagnant water population. Further, both populations

Abstract = {{Species should avoid risks to protect accumulated fitness. However, when
   faced with starvation, organisms may accept risks to enhance future
   reproductive opportunities. We investigated the effect of starvation on
   risk-taking behaviour in the common earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris
   Linnaeus, 1758). Lumbrictis terrestris are negatively phototactic
   annelids that feed on decaying plant matter at the soil surface. Feeding
   in high-light conditions is a potentially riskier choice, given the
   threats of visual predators and desiccation. We predicted that
   starvation in L terrestris would increase risk-taking behaviour and
   decrease time taken (latency) to make choices. We manipulated the
   starvation level of L. terrestris individuals (nonstarved, half-starved,
   and fully starved) and presented them with a binary foraging choice.
   Lumbricus terrestris could choose either a low-food and dark condition
   (low-risk condition) or a high-food and light condition (high-risk
   condition). We found that starved individuals selected the high-risk
   condition more often than nonstarved individuals. Starved individuals
   also had a decreased latency to first choice. Risk-taking did not scale
   with level of starvation; there was no difference in foraging choice and
   latency between half- and fully starved individuals. Our results
   indicate that L terrestris makes state-dependent foraging choices,
   providing insight into the importance of fundamental life-history
   trade-offs in this understudied species.}},

Volume = {{145}},
Pages = {{107-115}},

Abstract = {{The balance between resource acquisition and risk avoidance should vary
   according to personality type, with potential knock-on effects for
   fitness. Although previous studies have suggested a link between
   boldness and fitness components, little evidence is available on the
   behavioural mechanisms mediating this relationship in the wild. Because
   habitat use is the outcome of the trade-off between the costs and
   benefits associated with using each habitat type, we evaluated
   between-individual differences in habitat use of 64 GPS-collared female
   roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, using multinomial logit mixed models. To
   investigate whether deer differed in their habitat use tactics in
   relation to their personality type and their annual reproductive
   success, we assessed the link between individual habitat use patterns,
   boldness (measured as the strength of behavioural responsiveness to
   handling) and annual reproductive success (measured by the
   presence/absence of fawns at heel during autumn). Although daily and
   seasonal variations in the risk-resource landscapes clearly drove
   patterns of habitat use, individuals adopted contrasting habitat use
   tactics depending on their position along the shy-bold gradient and
   their reproductive status. Shy individuals occupied safer woodland more
   frequently, even at night when risk is lower. In contrast, bold
   individuals were better able to exploit rich open habitats. When this
   included mature autumn crops, these females weaned more offspring.
   Finally, irrespective of personality type, females that used meadows
   more often also achieved higher annual reproductive success. Overall, we
   demonstrate that individuals express divergent habitat use tactics as a
   function of their ability to avoid exposure to risk and their annual
   reproductive success. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal

   of competing models of roost emergence times}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{145}},
Pages = {{161-170}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Temperate-zone bats likely feed in an environment with few dangerous
   nocturnal predators, suggesting a life largely free of the antipredator
   trade-offs faced by most other animals. Such bats may, however,
   encounter dangerous diurnal raptors with an early start to their nightly
   feeding, and thus may face predation-related trade-offs in deciding when
   to emerge from a daytime roost. Non-predator-related factors could also
   come into play in this nightly decision. We used an
   information-theoretic approach to examine which combination of a wide
   range of variables exerts the greatest influence over emergence times
   from maternity roosts in a population of Indiana bats, Myotis sodalis,
   covering a 12-year period. Our competing statistical models were based
   on two broad environmental influences on emergence times: predators and
   physical (meteorological and astronomical) variables. The
   best-performing model included most of the variables associated with
   antipredator trade-offs, assuming that bats emerging before or near
   sunset experience a foraging benefit and a substantial risk of predation
   by diurnal raptors. Accordingly, state-dependent behaviour was apparent,
   with emergence beginning earlier during the more energetically demanding
   portion of the reproductive cycle. During lactation (the most demanding
   period), about 20\% of emergence events began before sunset, compared to
   only 5\% during colony formation. Earlier emergence was also associated
   with high cloud cover (darker conditions), larger roost populations and
   roosts located deep into the forest. Moonlight at sunset, however, was
   absent from the best-supported model and had no apparent influence on
   emergence times. Overall, the emergence behaviour of our species is
   consistent with a trade-off between energetic needs and predation risk,
   most likely due to the temporal overlap of early emergences with the
   activity period of diurnal raptors. This behaviour may be more common
   than expected in temperate-zone bats. (C) 2018 The Association for the

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A ``landscape of fear{''} (LOF) is a map that describes continuous
   spatial variation in an animal's perception of predation risk. The
   relief on this map reflects, for example, places that an animal avoids
   to minimize risk. Although the LOF concept is a potentially unifying
   theme in ecology that is often invoked to explain the ecological and
   conservation significance of fear, little is known about the daily
   dynamics of an LOF. Despite theory and data to the contrary,
   investigators often assume, implicitly or explicitly, that an LOF is a
   static consequence of a predator's mere presence within an ecosystem. We
   tested the prediction that an LOF in a large-scale, free-living system
   is a highly dynamic map with ``peaks{''} and ``valleys{''} that
   alternate across the diel (24-h) cycle in response to daily lulls in
   predator activity. We did so with extensive data from the case study of
   Yellowstone elk (Cervus elaphus) and wolves (Canis lupus) that was the
   original basis for the LOF concept. We quantified the elk LOF, defined
   here as spatial allocation of time away from risky places and times,
   across nearly 1,000-km(2) of northern Yellowstone National Park and
   found that it fluctuated with the crepuscular activity pattern of
   wolves, enabling elk to use risky places during wolf downtimes. This may
   help explain evidence that wolf predation risk has no effect on elk
   stress levels, body condition, pregnancy, or herbivory. The ability of
   free-living animals to adaptively allocate habitat use across periods of
   high and low predator activity within the diel cycle is an
   underappreciated aspect of animal behavior that helps explain why strong
   antipredator responses may trigger weak ecological effects, and why an
   LOF may have less conceptual and practical importance than direct
   killing.}},

Abstract = {{There are several cases of insular animal species exhibiting dramatic
   differences in body size when compared with mainland counterparts. Such
   pronounced morphological changes can arise from divergent selection via
   differing resource availability, competition or predation pressure. Past
   studies have not been able to demonstrate a reversal of these
   morphological changes when populations are removed from their island
   situation. This study examines the body size response of populations of
   the Barrow Island dwarf' subspecies of golden bandicoot (Isoodon auratus
   barrowensis: Ramsay, 1887) following translocation to an island and
   mainland site within their former range. Skeletal and mass measurements,
   body condition and fecundity of released animals and their offspring
   were compared to data from the source population. When comparing
   bandicoots born at translocation sites to source populations, males were
   significantly larger in skeletal size and mass, females were also
   significantly larger and exhibited higher reproductive output (number,
   frequency and average mass of pouch young). These effects occurred in a
   gradient according to environmental conditions, where animals were
   smallest and least productive at the densely populated source site,
   larger and more productive on a nearby island, and largest and most
   productive at a mainland site with some nutritional supplementation.
   These changes in skeletal size, mass and fecundity took place in the
   first 1-4 generations (18months post-release), suggesting that the
   response is not explained by natural selection. We posit that the small
   size of golden bandicoots on Barrow Island (315.8 +/- 4.2g, this study,
   cf 569.4 +/- 19.3g, mainland) is not a genotypic response to selective
   pressures, but rather a reversible phenotypic response to more
   favourable environmental conditions. A reduction in competitive
   pressures appeared to allow bandicoots to grow to a larger size and
   mass, and allow greater reproductive output. Ecological processes
   relating to resource limitation appear to drive island dwarfism' in
   I.auratus, and may apply to other insular species with morphological
   differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{Foraging is a three-stage process during which animals visit patches,
   consume food and quit. Foraging theory exploring relative patch quality
   has mostly focused on patch use and quitting decisions, ignoring the
   first crucial step for any forager: finding food. Yet, the decision to
   visit a patch is just as important as the decision to quit, as quitting
   theories can only be used if animals visit patches in the first place.
   Therefore, to better understand the foraging process and predict its
   outcomes, it is necessary to explore its three stages together. We used
   the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) as a model to
   investigate foraging decisions in response to food varying in quality.
   In particular, we tested whether patch nutritional quality affected the
   following: (1) patch visits; (2) behaviours at the patch during a
   foraging visit; and (3) patch quitting decisions (quantified using
   giving up densityGUD). Free-ranging possums were presented with diets
   varying in nitrogen content and concomitantly volatile organic compound
   (VOC) composition at feeding stations in the wild. We found that possums
   were able to distinguish between different quality foods from afar,
   despite the location of the diets changed daily. Possums used VOC (i.e.
   odour cues) emitted by the diets to find and select patches from a
   distance. High-quality diets with higher protein and lower fibre were
   visited more often and for longer. Possums spent more time foraging on
   diets high in nutritional content, resulting in lower GUDs. Our study
   provides important quantitative evidence that foraging efficiency plays
   out during all the three stages of the foraging process (i.e. visit,
   consume and quit), and demonstrates the significance of considering all
   these stages together in future studies and foraging models. Sensory
   cues such as food odours play a critical role in helping foragers,
   including mammalian herbivores, find high-quality food. This allows
   foragers to make quick, accurate and important decisions about food
   patches well before patch quitting decisions come into play.}},

Abstract = {{While biomedical researchers have long appreciated the influence of
   maternally derived glucocorticoids (GCs) on offspring phenotype,
   ecologists have only recently begun exploring its impact in wild
   animals. Interpreting biomedical findings within an ecological context
   has posited that maternal stress, mediated by elevations of maternal
   GCs, may play an adaptive role preparing offspring for a stressful or
   rigorous environment. Yet, the influence of maternal stress on offspring
   phenotype has been little studied in wild animals. We experimentally
   elevated GCs to ecologically relevant levels (mimicking increases in
   maternal stress hormones following a nonlethal predator encounter, a
   heat challenge, or a chasing or confinement stressor) in female eastern
   fence lizards Sceloporus undulatus during gestation. We tested the
   hypothesis that maternally derived stress hormones themselves are
   sufficient to alter offspring phenotype. Specifically, we examined the
   effects of experimentally elevated maternal GCs on fitness-relevant
   traits of the mother, her eggs and her subsequent offspring. We found
   that daily maternal GC elevation: (a) increased maternal antipredator
   behaviours and postlaying glucose levels; (b) had no effect on egg
   morphology or caloric value, but altered yolk hormone (elevated GC) and
   nutrient content; and (c) altered offspring phenotype including
   stress-relevant physiology, morphology and behaviour. These findings
   reveal that maternally derived GCs alone can alter offspring phenotype
   in a wild animal, changes that may be mediated via maternal behaviour,
   and egg hormone and nutrient content. Understanding the ecological
   consequences of these effects under different environmental conditions
   will be critical for determining the adaptive significance of elevated
   maternal GCs for offspring.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how threatened wildlife can coexist with humans over the
   long term is a central issue in conservation and wildlife management.
   Komodo National Park in Eastern Indonesia, harbors the largest extant
   populations of the endemic Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis).
   Consistent with global trends, this species is expected to be
   increasingly exposed to human activities and in particular growing
   ecotourism activities. Here we comprehensively evaluated how human
   activities affected individual and population level attributes of Komodo
   dragons. We compared Komodo dragons phenotypic (behaviour, body size,
   and body condition) and demographic (age structure, sex ratio, survival,
   and density) responses to variation in human activities across national
   park. Komodo dragons were found to exhibit pronounced responses to high
   human activity level relative to sites with low and negligible human
   activities. Komodo dragons exposed to ecotourism exhibited significantly
   less wariness, larger body mass, better body condition, and higher
   survival. These results are entirely consistent with ecotourism
   activities that provided Komodo dragons with long-term and substantial
   nutritional subsidies as a consequence of feeding and human food refuse.
   However, we also noted the potential negative consequences of altered
   behaviour and adult-biased populations in ecotourism areas which may
   influence demographic processes through intraspecific competition or
   predation. To address this issue, we recommend that three management
   strategies to be implemented in future include: (1) removal of
   human-mediated nutritional subsidies, (2) alternative ecotourism, and
   (3) spatial regulation of ecotourism. Furthermore, we advocate the
   development of approaches to achieve a socio-ecological
   sustainabilitythat benefits both people and wildlife conservation.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing interest in the behavioural and life history
   mechanisms that allow animal species to cope with rapidly expanding
   urban habitats, which impose frequent proximity to humans. A particular
   case of behavioral bottleneck (i.e. conflicting interests) faced by
   animals in urban environments is how they will modulate the defence of
   their offspring against the potential danger represented by humans, an
   aspect that has received scarce research attention. We examined the nest
   defense against humans by a dense breeding population of a raptor, the
   Black Kite Milvus migrans, within the megacity of Delhi (India). Here,
   kites live on a diet dominated by human waste and meat offered through
   religiously motivated bird feeding practices. Nest defense levels
   increased with the number of offspring, and with the progression of the
   breeding season. Defense also intensified close to ritual-feeding areas
   and with increasing human waste in the streets, suggesting synergistic
   effects of food availability, parental investment, personality-boldness
   and habituation to humans, with consequent attenuation of fear. Thus,
   the behavioural response to a perceived threat reflected the spatial
   mosaic of activity of humans in the city streets, their cultural
   practices of ritual-feeding, and their waste-management. For synurbic
   species, at the higher-end spectrum of adaptation to an urban life,
   human cultural practices and attitudes may well be the most defining
   dimensions of their urban niche. Our results suggest that, after initial
   urban colonization, animals may continue to adapt to the typically
   complex, heterogeneous environments of cities through fine-grained
   behavioural adjustments to human practices and activities.}},

Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundMediterranean diet (MD) interventions are demonstrated to
   significantly reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk but are typically
   resource intensive and delivered by health professionals. There is
   considerable interest to develop interventions that target sustained
   dietary behaviour change and that are feasible to scale-up for wider
   public health benefit. The aim of this paper is to describe the process
   used to develop a peer support intervention to encourage dietary
   behaviour change towards a MD in non-Mediterranean adults at high CVD
   risk.MethodsThe Medical Research Council (MRC) and Behaviour Change
   Wheel (BCW) frameworks and the COM-B (Capability, Opportunity,
   Motivation, Behaviour) theoretical model were used to guide the
   intervention development process. We used a combination of evidence
   synthesis and qualitative research with the target population, health
   professionals, and community health personnel to develop the
   intervention over three main stages: (1) we identified the evidence base
   and selected dietary behaviours that needed to change, (2) we developed
   a theoretical basis for how the intervention might encourage behaviour
   change towards a MD and selected intervention functions that could drive
   the desired MD behaviour change, and (3) we defined the intervention
   content and modelled outcomes.ResultsA theory-based, culturally
   tailored, peer support intervention was developed to specifically target
   behaviour change towards a MD in the target population. The intervention
   was a group-based program delivered by trained peer volunteers over
   12-months, and incorporated strategies to enhance social support,
   self-efficacy, problem-solving, knowledge, and attitudes to address
   identified barriers to adopting a MD from the COM-B
   analysis.ConclusionsThe MRC and BCW frameworks provided a systematic and
   complementary process for development of a theory-based peer support
   intervention to encourage dietary behaviour change towards a MD in
   non-Mediterranean adults at high CVD risk. The next step is to evaluate
   feasibility, acceptability, and diet behaviour change outcomes in
   response to the peer support intervention (change towards a MD and
   nutrient biomarkers) using a randomized controlled trial design.}},

   during and after fires?}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 11}},
Abstract = {{Although wildfires are increasing globally, available information on how
   mammals respond behaviourally and physiologically to fires is scant.
   Despite a large number of ecological studies, often examining animal
   diversity and abundance before and after fires, the reasons as to why
   some species perform better than others remain obscure. We examine how
   especially small mammals, which generally have high rates of energy
   expenditure and food requirements, deal with fires and post-fire
   conditions. We evaluate whether mammalian torpor, characterised by
   substantial reductions in body temperature, metabolic rate and water
   loss, plays a functional role in survival of mammals impacted by fires.
   Importantly, torpor permits small mammals to reduce their activity and
   foraging, and to survive on limited food. Torpid small mammals
   (marsupials and bats) can respond to smoke and arouse from torpor, which
   provides them with the possibility to evade direct exposure to fire,
   although their response is often slowed when ambient temperature is low.
   Post-fire conditions increase expression of torpor with a concomitant
   decrease in activity for free-ranging echidnas and small forest-dwelling
   marsupials, in response to reduced cover and reduced availability of
   terrestrial insects. Presence of charcoal and ash increases torpor use
   by captive small marsupials beyond food restriction alone, likely in
   anticipation of detrimental post-fire conditions. Interestingly,
   although volant bats use torpor on every day after fires, they respond
   by decreasing torpor duration, and increasing activity, perhaps because
   of the decrease in clutter and increase in foraging opportunities due to
   an increase in aerial insects. Our summary shows that torpor is an
   important tool for post-fire survival and, although the physiological
   and behavioural responses of small mammals to fire are complex, they
   seem to reflect energetic requirements and mode of foraging. We make
   recommendations on the conditions during management burns that are least
   likely to impact hetero-thermic mammals.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive disturbances often predate characteristic motor dysfunction in
   individuals with Huntington's disease (HD) and place an increasing
   burden on the HD patients and caregivers with the progression of the
   disorder. Therefore, application of maximally translational cognitive
   tests to animal models of HD is imperative for the development of
   treatments that could alleviate cognitive decline in human patients.
   Here, we examined the performance of the Q175 mouse knock-in model of HD
   in the touch screen version of the paired associates learning (PAL)
   task. We found that 10-11-month-old heterozygous Q175 mice had severely
   attenuated learning curve in the PAL task, which was conceptually
   similar to previously documented impaired performance of individuals
   with HD in the PAL task of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test
   Automated Battery (CANTAB). Besides high rate of errors in PAL task,
   Q175 mice exhibited considerably lower responding rate than age-matched
   wild-type (WT) animals. Our examination of effortful operant responding
   during fixed ratio (FR) and progressive ratio (PR) reinforcement
   schedules in a separate cohort of similar age confirmed slower and
   unselective performance of mutant animals, as observed during PAL task,
   but suggested that motivation to work for nutritional reward in the
   touch screen setting was similar in Q175 and WT mice. We also
   demonstrated that pronounced sensorimotor disturbances in Q175 mice can
   be detected at early touch screen testing stages, (e.g., during ``Punish
   Incorrect{''} phase of operant pretraining), so we propose that shorter
   test routines may be utilised for more expedient studies of treatments
   aimed at the rescue of HD-related phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Managing the nonlethal effects of disturbance on wildlife populations
   has been a long-term goal for decision makers, managers, and ecologists,
   and assessment of these effects is currently required by European Union
   and United States legislation. However, robust assessment of these
   effects is challenging. The management of human activities that have
   nonlethal effects on wildlife is a specific example of a fundamental
   ecological problem: how to understand the population-level consequences
   of changes in the behavior or physiology of individual animals that are
   caused by external stressors. In this study, we review recent
   applications of a conceptual framework for assessing and predicting
   these consequences for marine mammal populations. We explore the range
   of models that can be used to formalize the approach and we identify
   critical research gaps. We also provide a decision tree that can be used

   Synthesis and applications: The implementation of this framework has
   moved the focus of discussion of the management of nonlethal
   disturbances on marine mammal populations away from a rhetorical debate
   about defining negligible impact and toward a quantitative understanding
   of long-term population-level effects. Here we demonstrate the
   framework's general applicability to other marine and terrestrial
   systems and show how it can support integrated modeling of the proximate

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{As food safety has attracted the widespread attention of society, the
   quality safety of agricultural products has become an important part of
   food safety and also confronts multiple challenges. In fact, the safe
   use of veterinary drugs in the production process has become one of
   important guarantees for the quality safety of agricultural products.
   It's of great significance to regulate the breeding farmers' safe use of
   veterinary drugs and to create a safe and healthy production environment
   for agricultural products. A field survey of individual and large-scale
   swine breeding farmers in four typical provinces including Henan,
   Shandong, Jiangxi and Guizhou generated 397 questionnaires. This field
   survey conducted the internal and external classification of breeding
   farmers' safe use of veterinary drugs and defined the breeding farmers'
   safe use of veterinary drugs in the light of dosage, type and
   standardized operation of veterinary drugs. Based on Lewin's behavior
   theory, the survey used the structural equation modeling method to
   systematically examine the generation path of breeding farmers' safe use
   of veterinary drugs. The comprehensive analysis reveals that breeding
   farmers' knowledge about veterinary drugs, the attitudes toward the
   government supervision and the market environment of breeding activities
   all exert some effects on breeding farmers' use of veterinary drugs.
   Some suggestions and countermeasures for breeding farmers' safe use of
   veterinary drugs are provided as follows: First, more efforts should be
   pumped into publicity and instruction so that breeding farmers can have
   a better understanding of veterinary drugs. Second, preferential
   policies should be formulated to encourage the breeding farmers'
   participation in the industrial organizations of swine breeding farmers,
   and advocate the industrial organizations' active provision of different
   technical trainings. Third, the communication and cooperation platform
   should be created among breeding farmers, slaughter and processing
   plants and supermarkets, the poultry insurance market should be
   regulated, and the insurance purchase process should be improved.
   Fourth, when more subsidies for harm-free and environment-friendly
   veterinary drugs are provided, more serious punishments should be
   imposed on the unsafe use of veterinary drugs to offer policy support
   for the breeding farmers' standardized use of veterinary drugs.}},

Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{1. Understanding the spatial structure of individual variation is
   critical to assessing the mechanisms and scale of species-level
   ecological and evolutionary responses. But the continuity and complexity
   of streams can make it difficult to discern spatial structure, and data
   on individual variation spanning spatial scales are rare.
   2. Our goal was to objectively resolve the scale of ecological and
   evolutionary processes affecting the salamander Gyrinophilus
   porphyriticus by testing for spatial structure in individual variation
   across a headwater stream network. We used 3 years of spatially explicit
   capture mark recapture data from four headwater streams in the Hubbard
   Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA, to test for individual
   variation in survival at three scales: (a) among c. 2-km(2) watersheds,
   (b) in 500-m downstream and upstream reaches within watersheds and (c)
   in riffle and pool habitats along reaches. We also tested for
   corresponding spatial variation in individual body condition and
   morphology to gain insight on the causes and implications of variation
   in survival.
   3. Survival of G. porphyriticus larvae was constant among watersheds,
   but differed by reach and habitat. Larval survival was higher in
   upstream reaches than downstream reaches, matching the distribution of
   predatory brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), which were restricted to
   down-stream reaches. Larval survival was also higher in pools than
   riffles. Survival of G. porphyriticus adults was constant at all scales.
   4. Larval body condition was higher in downstream reaches than upstream
   reaches. Both larvae and adults differed in morphology at the habitat
   scale: individuals in pools had longer limbs than individuals in
   riffles.
   5. Negative covariation in larval survival and body condition at the
   reach scale suggests that there is a trade-off between fitness and
   proximate performance along streams. The surprising differences between
   habitats in survival and morphology show the potential for fine-scale
   ecology evolution interactions in streams, potentially driven by
   differences in flow and gradient conditions in riffles and pools.
   6. Our results suggest that the larval stage is key to understanding
   individual, population and community-level processes affecting G.
   porphyriticus. More broadly, this research provides a novel empirical
   link between traditional studies of fine-scale ecological complexity in
   streams and recent studies showing consistent spatial dynamics at the
   network scale. By documenting differences in survival, body condition
   and morphology at reach and habitat scales, we hope this work shows the
   feasibility and value of spatially explicit approaches to species-level
   ecological and evolutionary questions in streams.}},

Abstract = {{The obesity epidemic in humans is juxtaposed by observations of
   passerine birds exhibiting fine-scale body mass regulation. The ecology
   literature is replete with research into why these animals regulate body
   weight, citing tradeoffs between competing pressures such as emaciation
   and predation. Yet studies on the underlying mechanisms of mass
   regulation in these animals are scarce. Maintaining or decreasing weight
   is obviously achieved by limiting food intake. However, there are
   numerous reasons why an animal may not control ingestion precisely. This

Abstract = {{Behavioural flexibility, the ability to adjust behaviour to
   environmental change by adapting existing skills to novel situations, is
   key to coping with, for example, complex social interactions, seasonal
   changes in food availability or detecting predators. We tested the tree
   skink, Egernia striolata, a family-living skink from eastern Australia,
   in a set-shifting paradigm of eight colour/shape discriminations
   including reversals, an intradimensional acquisition of a new
   colour/shape and extradimensional shift from colour to shape (and vice
   versa). Skinks could learn to discriminate between colour/shape pairs
   and reverse this initial stimuluse-reward association; however, they
   showed no significant decrease in the probability of making a correct
   choice in the extradimensional shift suggesting that they did not form
   an attentional set. Subjects appear to have learnt each stage as a new
   problem instead of generalizing stimuli into specific dimensions (set
   formation). In conclusion, tree skinks solved a discrimination reversal
   by focusing their attention towards visual stimuli and flexibly
   adjusting their choice behaviour accordingly. These lizards learned to
   use multidimensional visual stimuli to find a food reward but did not
   generalize stimuli into dimensions. Furthermore, this study is the first
   to test for set shifting in a lizard species and thereby allows us to
   extend set-shifting theory to a new taxon for comparison with primates,
   rodents, a bird and a turtle. (c) 2018 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) fertilization is a common agricultural practice, which, by
   increasing the quality of plants, also enhances their nutritional
   suitability for insect herbivores, creating the possibility of a cascade
   of N across trophic levels, from plant to herbivore to predator. We
   manipulated the quality of cucumber plants by fertilizing them with
   three different N rates (110, 160, and 210 ppm), which represented low,
   medium, and high N levels, respectively. Colonies of Aphis gossypii
   Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae) were then reared on these plants and used
   as prey for adult Hippodamia variegate (Goeze) (Coleoptera:
   Coccinellidae) in experiments that characterized the predator's foraging
   behavior and functional response to different aphid densities. The
   nutritional content of plants and aphids was also measured. As N
   fertilization increased, so did the nutrient content (total energy) of
   aphids and this resulted in declining rates of aphid consumption by
   beetles at higher aphid densities. Females in the 110 N treatment, and
   males in all treatments, responded to aphids with a type II functional
   response (decelerating consumption at higher densities), but females in
   the 160 and 210 ppm N treatments exhibited a type III response
   (consuming a declining proportion of available aphids at high
   densities). Beetles fed aphids from the 110 N treatment consumed more
   prey in both assays than did those fed aphids from the 210 N treatment.
   Beetle searching time, handling time, and duration of digestive pauses
   all increased at high levels of N fertilization, especially for
   females.The results indicate that heavy N fertilization can increase
   prey nutritional quality to the point where it alters predator foraging
   and feeding behavior, resulting in slower rates of prey consumption and
   longer prey handling times.}},

Abstract = {{Sensor-based technologies are becoming increasingly available and can be
   used to automatically gather long-term data about animal behaviour. With
   this information, it is possible to assess the circadian rhythm of
   activity and monitor its response to internal and external factors.
   Identifying irregularities in this rhythm may indicate animal health and
   welfare issues. The aim of this study was to collect sensor-based
   general activity and investigate circadian rhythm of this activity to
   identify the changes due to weather influences that act on these
   parameters throughout the year; to identify the differences between
   individuals; and to assess links between general activity and circadian
   rhythm of activity with sheep body weight change. In total, 29 Scottish
   Blackface ewes of different ages and body condition scores were used.
   The animals were monitored for four consecutive weeks in each of four
   seasonal periods, in extensive systems on Scottish upland pastures, and
   without human handling during study periods. Accelerometer-integrated
   collars were fitted to the animals to collect motion index continuously
   every minute. These data were used to calculate the percentage of cyclic
   behaviour that was harmonic/synchronized with the environment (over 24 h
   period), as Degree of Functional Coupling (DFC). The DFC was shown
   within rolling seven-day periods. Low DFCs indicate low synchronization.
   Weather data were collected daily. Random regression models were used to
   assess between-individual variation. During the winter period, the level
   of the DFC for the activity of nineteen ewes lowered in response to a
   period of high level of precipitation combined with low winter
   temperatures. However, four ewes exhibited a lower level of variation in
   the DFC values, showing that there were differences between individuals
   in regard to their response to the precipitation level. The overall mean
   of the DFC for the general activity was highest in autumn (95.4\%, P <
   0.001), however, it did not differ between summer and spring
   (respectively 90.2\% and 88.1\%, P > 0.05), but was significantly lower
   during the winter (81.7\%, P < 0.001) compared with summer and autumn.
   Over the spring and summer, variation in DFC was a good estimator of
   body weight gain. It was concluded that the assessment of circadian
   rhythms of general activity using the DFC-parameter allows a better
   understanding of sheep responses to weather influences, compared to the
   evaluation of general activity alone. The random regression model method
   was effective in identifying animals that deviated positively or
   negatively from population responses.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Hoarding behaviour (storing food for a later use) has evolved to reduce
   starvation risk when resources are scarce. Different age and sex classes
   often show differences in foraging due to experience, skills or life
   history strategy, but such differences in hoarding under
   spatio-temporally varying environmental conditions have rarely been
   studied in the wild. We studied hoarding behaviour of Eurasian pygmy
   owls (Glaucidium passerinum) during 2003-2016 in western Finland, where
   the abundance of their main prey (voles) fluctuates in three-year
   population cycles. In 14years, 1056 food stores were found during the
   hoarding season (Oct-Dec) and 330 pygmy owls were trapped at these
   stores. The number of stores per individual did not vary in relation to
   age, sex or vole abundance. Adults (+1-year old) had their stores
   farther apart than yearlings. Both the number of stores per year and the
   biomass of stored prey items increased with vole abundance. Females and
   yearlings had larger and heavier stores than males and adults,
   respectively. The same individuals stored more food as yearlings than as
   adults. These sex- and age-differences in hoarding indicate that it is
   not constrained by experience or skills. It rather seems that
   less-experienced yearlings rely more on stored food than adults. Females
   may need more food due to their larger size and need to accumulate
   energy reserves before reproduction. A detailed knowledge of age- and
   sex-related differences in hoarding behaviour under fluctuating
   abundances of main foods is fundamental to better understand a
   population response to climate change and forest management.Significance
   statementThe hoarding behaviour of animals has evolved to cope with the
   problem of food limitation. On the basis of 14-year data from pygmy
   owls, we show that the number of stores per year and the biomass of prey
   items per store increased with vole abundance in the environment. Adults
   had stores farther apart than yearlings, and females and yearlings
   stored more prey items and biomass compared to males and adults,
   respectively. These results indicate that hoarding behaviour responds to
   the available main prey abundance and varies with traits such as age and
   sex. Because different age and sex classes might respond differently to
   variation in food abundance, due to habitat alterations or climate
   change, a detailed knowledge of hoarding behaviour can be of particular
   importance to understand changes in body condition, reproductive success
   and survival of pygmy owls under changing climate and management of
   boreal forest.}},

Abstract = {{Predation by the crown-of-thorns seastar (CoTS; Acanthaster sp.) is a
   pervasive stressor attributing to the decline of coral reefs. These
   outbreaks are suggested to be linked to eutrophy-driven recruitment
   pulses, where increased nutrients enhance larval success. CoTS larvae,
   however, are tolerant of oligotrophic conditions typical of tropical
   ecosystems and outbreaks occur in regions isolated from eutrophy,
   highlighting the resilience of these larvae to oligotrophic conditions.
   Here, we test the hypothesis that CoTS larvae associate with bacterial
   communities that are dynamic across an oligotrophic-eutrophic continuum
   and are specific to each feeding regime. Our analysis of the CoTS larval
   microbiome suggests that CoTS larvae associate with a bacterial
   community distinct from the environmental microbiota and that this
   community experiences a community-level shift in response to
   differential feeding that is maintained over development. Symbioses with
   a diverse and dynamic, and a potentially phototrophic, bacterial
   community may contribute to resilience of CoTS larvae that enable the
   success of CoTS and, perhaps, other tropical marine larvae in
   oligotrophic seas.}},

Pages = {{136-143}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Ability to identify familiar foods is a major driver of animal feeding
   behavior Animals show preference for familiar foods over novel ones,
   presumably to avoid poisonous substances and better support their growth
   and reproduction. However, we do not know how their feeding behavior is
   affected when the familiar food is inferior to a novel food with regards
   to its palatability and nutritional properties. We tested the hypothesis
   that feeding preference is determined by specific food characteristics
   rather than food familiarity with fast-growing soil dwelling nematodes.
   Two sequential experiments were designed to test the feeding behavior of
   soil bacterial feeding nematodes (Mesorhabditis sp. and Acrobeloides
   sp.) resulting from familiar food recognition, including a 6-months
   training period to develop their food familiarity and a feeding
   experiment to test their food preference for five bacterial species.
   Nematodes showed clear preference for specific food sources, which were
   not necessarily the familiar food. Their feeding behavior was not
   affected by food familiarity, but correlated highly with bacterial
   traits such as cell size, growth rates, and water content. We conclude
   that nematode feeding behavior was controlled by food specificity rather
   than familiarity. We further suggest that physiological factors,
   possibly the physical size and presence of chemical receptors in the
   buccal cavity, allow nematodes to rapidly assess their food supply and
   switch from a familiar food to a preferred, novel food that is easier to
   ingest and better suited to support their growth and reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{The pseudoscorpion Paratemnoides nidificator is a generalist predator
   that captures large arthropods that live on tree trunks. Few
   pseudoscorpions species show some degree of sociality. We investigated
   how colonies of the pseudoscorpion P. nidificator adjust their
   cooperative capture behavior under a situation of changing prey types as
   a simulation of variation in prey availability. We hypothesized that
   colonies would be more efficient at prey capture under repeated exposure
   to the same prey, and that the change in the availability of prey would
   be followed by new behavioral adjustments to adequately exploit the new
   prey. Eight experimental colonies housed in the laboratory received
   repetitions of three different ant species as prey. The number of
   pseudoscorpions attacking the prey, the number of behavioral acts, and
   the time expended subduing prey were evaluated as measures of prey
   capture performance, in relation to repetitive exposure to the same prey
   and also in relation to prey type changes. However, only individuals'
   recruitment significantly responded to prey type exposure. Prey capture
   behavior was heterogeneous among colonies, resulting in highly variable
   behavioral responses. Colonies showed a tendency toward increasing
   capture success through repeated prey type exposure. However, 50\% of
   the colonies were unable to capture the new prey type and died of
   starvation. Although it is a generalist predator, prey capture behavior
   could depend on different coordination components for subduing and
   handling large prey. Therefore, changes in prey availability could cause
   the attenuation of a cooperative relationship in some colonies, making
   them more prone to failure during capture.}},

   changes induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and to
   assess behavioral and neurochemical changes that predict depressive-like

   were exposed to CUMS with several stressors (cold, heat, starvation, and

   At the end of treatment, in vivo behavioral tests (open field,
   aggression, forced swimming, mating, light/dark box, male fertility
   evaluation, sucrose preference, weight evaluation) and ex vivo analyses
   (dopamine and serotonin levels) were performed. Using this CUMS model,
   we obtained results that contribute to the construction of a depressive

   corresponding to depressive symptoms, such as immobility in the forced
   swimming test, less exploration in the light/dark test, changes in
   mating behavior, changes in the aggressiveness test, reduced sucrose
   preference, and weight-loss, in addition to a significant reduction in
   the levels of serotonin and dopamine when compared to the control group.
   Fluoxetine was used in our study as a positive control to demonstrate
   that CUMS-induced depressive-like behaviors in flies can be reversed by
   antidepressants. In conclusion, male Drosophila melanogaster exposed to

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Urban habitats present new ecological and evolutionary challenges for
   animals. Noise and infrastructure often change behavior and community
   composition, with potential physical costs such as decreased condition.
   However, the underlying mechanisms driving these patterns are virtually
   unknown. One potential driver of condition within a species is the
   diversity of the gut microbiome. Here, we investigate how the urban
   habitat affects the gut microbiome of White-crowned Sparrows
   (Zonotrichia leucophrys) males using spatial analyses of land cover
   (impervious, scrub, grass, and trees) at the regional level and
   territory level in urban San Francisco, CA and nearby rural Point Reyes,
   California. We hypothesized that urbanization of habitats affects gut
   microbial composition and diversity, potentially through direct effects
   on diet and/or indirect environmental effects. We measured gut microbial
   community diversity from 16s rRNA sequences amplified from cloacal
   swabs. We find that the urban and rural male gut microbiomes are
   significantly different, such that the urban gut microbiome is more
   diverse than the rural gut microbiome. This relationship may be due to
   more variable land cover types in urban habitats as compared to rural
   habitats, which are mainly composed of native scrub. We do not find
   support for regional impervious cover affecting the gut microbiome, but
   the more precise territory level analyses show that higher tree cover
   correlates with increased alpha diversity and impervious cover
   correlates with relative abundances of gut microbial taxa (Unifrac beta
   diversity). Although some studies show that gut diversity affects
   physiology, our measures of body condition do not indicate a strong
   relationship. Our results highlight how changes in the landscape may
   affect the gut microbiome of animals in an ever-urbanizing world, and
   provide a baseline for future studies of how anthropogenic change
   affects communities at multiple levels.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional and other maladaptive eating behaviors develop in response to
   a diversity of triggers, from psychological stress to the endless
   external cues in our modern food environment. While the standard
   approach to food-and weight-related concerns has been weight-loss
   through dietary restriction, these interventions have produced little
   long-term benefit, and may be counterproductive. A growing understanding
   of the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that underpin habit
   formation may explain why this approach has largely failed, and pave the
   way for a new generation of non-pharmacologic interventions. Here, we
   first review how modern food environments interact with human biology to
   promote reward-related eating through associative learning, i.e.,
   operant conditioning. We also review how operant conditioning (positive
   and negative reinforcement) cultivates habit-based reward-related
   eating, and how current diet paradigms may not directly target such
   eating. Further, we describe how mindfulness training that targets
   reward-based learning may constitute an appropriate intervention to
   rewire the learning process around eating. We conclude with examples
   that illustrate how teaching patients to tap into and act on intrinsic
   (e.g., enjoying healthy eating, not overeating, and self-compassion)
   rather than extrinsic reward mechanisms (e.g., weighing oneself), is a
   promising new direction in improving individuals' relationship with

   significant factors in a variety of pathologies. Research into the
   individual nutrient-sensitivities of the HBP, AMPK, and mTOR pathways
   has revealed a complex regulatory dynamic, where their unique responses
   to macromolecule levels coordinate cell behavior. Importantly,
   cross-talk between these pathways fine-tunes the cellular response to
   nutrients. Strong evidence demonstrates that AMPK negatively regulates
   the mTOR pathway, but O-GlcNAcylation of AMPK lowers enzymatic activity
   and promotes growth. On the other hand, AMPK can phosphorylate OGT
   leading to changes in OGT function. Complex sets of interactions between
   the HBP, AMPK, and mTOR pathways integrate nutritional signals to
   respond to changes in the environment. In particular, examining these
   relationships using systems biology approaches might prove a useful
   method of exploring the complex nature of cell signaling. Overall,
   understanding the complex interactions of these nutrient pathways will
   provide novel mechanistic information into how nutrients influence
   health and disease.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Economically disadvantaged families receive care in both
   clinical and community settings, but this care is rarely coordinated and
   can result in conflicting educational messaging. WEE Baby Care is a
   pragmatic randomized clinical trial evaluating a patient-centered
   responsive parenting (RP) intervention that uses health information
   technology (HIT) strategies to coordinate care between pediatric primary
   care providers (PCPs) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
   Women, Infant and Children (WIC) community nutritionists to prevent
   rapid weight gain from birth to 6 months. It is hypothesized that data
   integration and coordination will improve consistency in RP messaging
   and parent self-efficacy, promoting shared decision making and infant
   self-regulation, to reduce infant rapid weight gain from birth to 6
   months.
   Methods/design: Two hundred and ninety mothers and their full-term
   newborns will be recruited and randomized to the ``RP intervention{''}
   or ``standard care control{''} groups. The RP intervention includes: 1)
   parenting and nutrition education developed using the American Academy
   of Pediatrics Healthy Active Living for Families curriculum in
   conjunction with portions of a previously tested RP curriculum delivered
   by trained pediatric PCPs and WIC nutritionists during regularly
   scheduled appointments; 2) parent-reported data using the Early Healthy
   Lifestyles (EHL) risk assessment tool; and 3) data integration into
   child's electronic health records with display and documentation
   features to inform counseling and coordinate care between pediatric PCPs
   and WIC nutritionists. The primary study outcome is rapid infant weight
   gain from birth to 6 months derived from sex-specific World Health
   Organization adjusted weight-for-age z-scores. Additional outcomes
   include care coordination, messaging consistency, parenting behaviors
   (e.g., food to soothe), self-efficacy, and infant sleep health. Infant
   temperament and parent depression will be explored as moderators of RP
   effects on infant outcomes.
   Discussion: This pragmatic patient-centered RP intervention integrates
   and coordinates care across clinical and community sectors, potentially
   offering a fundamental change in the delivery of pediatric care for
   prevention and health promotion. Findings from this trial can inform
   large scale dissemination of obesity prevention programs.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal nutrition impacts fetal development, and may play a role in

   maternal dietary protein during pregnancy on the brain neurochemistry
   and behavior of offspring. We focused specifically on the serotonin
   system, the 5-HT1A receptor and the responsivity of offspring as adults
   to stress. Dams were fed either a low protein diet (10\% protein by
   weight) or isocaloric control diet (20\% protein by weight). The low
   protein diet did not alter maternal food intake and body weight, or
   litter size and the average birth weight of male or female littermates.
   5 HT1A receptor function, as measured by quantitative autoradiography of
   8-OH-DPAT (1 mu M)-stimulated {[}S-35]GTP gamma S binding, was markedly
   reduced in hippocampus of weanling female, but not male offspring
   (postnatal day, PND 21) of dams fed the low protein diet. The number of
   serotonergic cell bodies in the rostral raphe, and 5-HT metabolism in
   the limbic system of weanling offspring was not altered by maternal low
   protein diet. The deficit in hippocampal 5-HT1A receptor function
   observed in weanling female offspring persisted into adulthood (PND
   112), and was accompanied by an increased sensitivity to stress,
   specifically increased immobility during a 15-minute forced swim
   challenge and increased anorexia following 30-minute restraint (PND
   97-100). The present work begins to uncover important future directions
   for understanding the early developmental origins of resilience to

Abstract = {{Folic acid, a B vitamin, is vital for early neurodevelopment and is well
   known for its protective effect against neural tube defects. Various
   national health agencies worldwide recommend that women of childbearing
   age take approximately 0.4 to 1 mg of supplemental folic acid daily to
   reduce the risk of neural tube defects in offspring. Several countries
   have tried to promote folic acid intake through mandatory fortification
   programs to reduce neural tube defects. Supplementation combined with
   mandatory fortification of foods has led to high levels of folic acid
   and related metabolites in women of childbearing age. Recent studies
   have reported that oversupplementation, defined as exceeding either the
   recommended dietary allowance or the upper limit of the daily reference
   intake of folic acid, may have negative effects on human health. This
   review examines whether maternal oversupplementation with folic acid
   affects the neurodevelopment of offspring. Data from animal studies
   suggest there are behavioral, morphological, and molecular changes in

Abstract = {{Chemical cues from predators (kairomones) are used by many aquatic and
   terrestrial animals when deciding on behavioral responses to predation
   threats. These responses may also be affected by the animal's
   physiological state (e.g., nutrition level, parasitism, or prior
   injury), which could alter normal responses to kairomones. In this
   study, we examined effects of leg autotomy (the voluntary sacrifice of a
   leg) on subsequent responses to predator chemical cues in females of the
   riparian-zone wolf spider Pardosa valens. In a fully-crossed design,
   spiders with all legs intact or with one leg removed were exposed to one
   of two cue treatments for 90min: a control (no predator cue) or one with
   chemical cues (silk and excreta) from a larger sympatric wolf spider,
   Rabidosa santrita. We then introduced an R. santrita into each
   container, and recorded subsequent survival of P. valens. Survivorship
   was significantly higher for individuals previously exposed to predator
   cues than for those in the control group; however, autotomy had no
   effect on survivorship, which was similar for both intact and
   autotomized spiders in both the predator-cue and control treatments. In
   addition, although P. valens were more likely to be found off the
   substrate than on it when the predator was added in each of the four
   treatment pairings, this initial position did not influence
   survivorship. These results therefore indicate that P. valens can
   behaviorally respond to predator kairomones in ways that reduce their
   risk of predation, but that this response is unaffected by the prior
   sacrifice of a leg.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic landscapes and soundscapes impose strong selective
   pressures on a number of species, which can manifest in changes in

   success. However, few studies have examined survival rates, a major
   component of fitness, across urban landscapes and soundscapes.
   White-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys) persist in both urban
   and rural landscapes and change their behavior in response to the
   soundscape. We color-banded adult white-crowned sparrows and collected
   noise levels on their territories in the urban San Francisco Bay Area
   and adjacent rural Point Reyes National Seashore in California. We
   collected mark-encounter data on territorial males from 2014 to 2017.
   Using the Program MARK, we tested the effects of habitat (urban/rural)
   and territory noise level on annual survival rates and body condition.
   We predicted that survival and body condition would be lower in urban
   habitats and decrease with increasing background noise level on
   territories. We found that survival estimates vary according to year,
   and males in urban landscapes have higher survival. Noise levels best
   predict body condition, such that soundscape negatively correlates with
   male body condition. Taken together, the urban landscape and soundscape
   shape the survival and health of birds in and near cities.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is regarded as one of the major concerns of the 21st
   Century, with mean temperatures expected to increase by about 3 degrees
   C over the next 100 years. Species responses to climate change are not
   consistent, with some species apparently able to respond more quickly
   than others, thus producing changes in community structure. One
   increasingly common observation is that species at lower trophic levels
   respond more quickly to change in climate than species at higher levels.
   This can result in, for example, the timing of a predator's peak food
   requirements being separated in time from the point at which their prey
   is most available. It has been suggested that this creates an additional
   risk for the persistence of species at high trophic levels as the
   climate alters; there is an alternative possibility - that predators may
   change their diets in response to changing prey availability. Models of
   diet choice make several predictions, for example they suggest that
   whether a predator includes a secondary prey into its diet depends on
   the availability of the primary prey and not on characteristics of the
   secondary prey. By switching between one prey type and another, a
   predator population may be able to persist in a particular location
   longer than they would otherwise. Using a simple demonstration model we
   show that this idea is theoretically plausible.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{8894-8907}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{When prey are differentially affected by intra and interspecific
   competition, the cooccurrence of multiple prey species alters the per
   capita availability of food for a particular prey species which could
   alter how prey respond to the threat of predation, and hence the
   overall-effect of predators. We conducted an experiment to examine the
   extent to which the nonconsumptive and overall effect of predatory water
   bugs on snail and tadpole traits (performance and morphology) depended
   on whether tadpoles and snails cooccurred. Tadpoles and snails differed
   in their relative susceptibility to intraspecific and interspecific
   competition, and predators affected both prey species via consumptive
   and nonconsumptive mechanisms. Furthermore, the overall effect of
   predators often depended on whether another prey species was present.
   The reasoning for why the overall effect of predators depended on
   whether prey species cooccurred, however, differed for each of the
   response variables. Predators affected snail body growth via
   nonconsumptive mechanisms, but the change in the overall effect of
   predators on snail body growth was attributable to how snails responded
   to competition in the absence of predators, rather than a change in how
   snails responded to the threat of predation. Predators did not affect
   tadpole body growth via nonconsumptive mechanisms, but the greater
   vulnerability of competitively superior prey (snails) to predators
   increased the strength of consumptive mechanisms (and hence the overall
   effect) through which predators affected tadpole growth. Predators
   affected tadpole morphology via nonconsumptive mechanisms, but the
   greater propensity for predators to kill competitively superior prey
   (snails) enhanced the ability of tadpoles to alter their morphology in
   response to the threat of predation by creating an environment where
   tadpoles had a higher per capita supply of food available to invest in
   the development of morphological defenses. Our work indicates that the
   mechanisms through which predators affect prey depends on the other
   members of the community.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{445-452}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified
   several genes associated with obesity. The mechanisms through which
   these genes affect body weight are not fully characterized. Recent
   studies suggest that eating behavior (EB) traits could be involved, but
   only a few EB traits were investigated.
   Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether genetic
   susceptibility to obesity is mediated by EB traits (cognitive restraint,
   disinhibition, hunger) and their subscales. We hypothesized that EB
   traits, and their subscales, partly mediate this association.
   Design: Adult individuals (n = 768) who participated in the Quebec
   Family Study were included in this cross-sectional study. A genetic risk
   score (GRS) of obesity was calculated based on the 97 genetic variants
   recently identified in a GWAS meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI). EB
   traits and their subscales were assessed with the use of the
   Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire. Regression analyses with age and sex
   as covariates were used to investigate the associations between GRS, EB
   traits, BMI, and WC and whether the association between GRS and obesity
   is mediated by EB traits, which represents the indirect effect of GRS on
   obesity.
   Results: The GRS of obesity was positively associated with BMI (beta =
   0.19 +/- 0.04, P < 0.0001) and WC (beta = 0.46 +/- 0.10, P < 0.0001).
   Regression analyses also revealed that the association between GRS of
   obesity and BMI was partly mediated by disinhibition and susceptibility
   to hunger (beta(indirect) = 0.09 +/- 0.03, P = 0.0007, and
   beta(indirect) = 0.04 +/- 0.02, P = 0.02, respectively). Habitual and
   situational susceptibility to disinhibition (beta(indirect) = 0.08 +/-
   0.03, P = 0.002 and beta(indirect) = 0.05 +/- 0.02, P = 0.003,
   respectively) as well as internal and external locus of hunger
   (beta(indirect) = 0.03 +/- 0.02, P = 0.03 for both) were also found to
   mediate the association between GRS of obesity and BMI. The same trends
   were observed with WC.
   Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that the genetic
   susceptibility to obesity is partly mediated through undesirable EB
   traits, which suggests that they could be targeted in obesity treatment
   and prevention.}},

Abstract = {{Individual vigilance against threats typically decreases with group

   vigilance levels overall and also respond differently to variation in
   group size. We investigated individual variation in vigilance and its
   patterns of plasticity in flocks of House Sparrows (Passer domesticus

   and used multiple observations of the same individuals (n = 14) in
   flocks of different sizes over two consecutive months. The typical
   decline in vigilance with flock size occurred at the population level.
   Controlling for food density, flock size, time of year, and sex, we
   documented consistent individual differences in various measurements of
   vigilance. Plasticity of vigilance adjustments to variation in flock
   size occurred for the frequency of high vigilance postures. Male House
   Sparrows with larger bibs, which signal higher dominance status, tended
   to spend less time vigilant and obtained food at a higher rate,
   supporting a state-dependent explanation for the origin of individual
   vigilance profiles. Individual differences can contribute to explaining

Abstract = {{Epigenetic approaches to human health have received growing attention in
   the past two decades. They allow to view the development of human
   organisms as plastic, i.e. as open to influences from the social and
   material environment such as nutrition, stress, and trauma. This has
   lent new credence to approaches in biomedicine that aim to draw
   attention to the importance of development for later life health. Some
   scholars in the social sciences and humanities have welcomed such
   approaches as a departure from genecentric perspectives and as an
   opportunity for highlighting the social and political determinants of
   health and illness. Others have warned that they might lead to new forms
   of biological reductionisms and determinisms. In this article, we
   explore how research on developmental plasticity addresses and
   articulates global health disparities, specifically in the context of
   postcolonial India. We discuss two prominent approaches from the field
   of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) that build on
   epigenetic perspectives on health and illness and view different global
   rates of disease susceptibility as the result of developmental
   processes: first, the `mismatch paradigm' by Peter Gluckman and Mark
   Hanson and second, the `metabolic ghetto' concept by Jonathan Wells. We
   highlight how both approaches render historical and social factors
   meaningful for the development of global health disparities, but
   emphasize how they at the same time remain prone to determinisms and
   reductionisms reminiscent of a gene-centric perspective. DOHaD actors
   themselves are critical of these tendencies, and in conclusion we
   explore novel opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations enabled
   by this critical potential.}},

   more exploratory root morphology in nitrate deficient condition. In

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{143}},
Pages = {{93-104}},

Abstract = {{Small birds overwintering in cold climates must meet the daily challenge
   of accumulating sufficient energy reserves throughout the day to ensure
   overnight survival. Theoretical work suggests that risk of starvation is
   a major force shaping optimal daily foraging routines. Animals are
   predicted to adjust how they distribute their daily foraging activity in
   relation to environmental harshness, which largely determines the risk
   of starvation. Here, we used radiofrequency identification
   (RFID)-enabled bird feeders to test whether mountain chickadees, Poecile
   gambeli - small, resident, food-caching birds - exhibited different
   daily foraging routines in harsher (higher elevation) versus milder
   (lower elevation) environments in the Sierra Nevada. In addition, we
   assessed foraging routines between four different periods of the
   nonbreeding season ranging from autumn (milder conditions) to winter and
   early spring (harsher conditions) and to late spring (milder
   conditions). We also tested whether individual variation in spatial
   cognition associated with food caching, which represents a more reliable
   food source that can be expected to lower risk of starvation, is
   associated with differences in daily foraging routines. Chickadees from
   both elevations distributed their daily foraging efforts differently
   throughout the nonbreeding season, consistent with theoretical
   predictions for milder and harsher conditions. Differences between
   chickadees from high and low elevations were especially pronounced
   during harsher winter periods, with chickadees from high elevations
   showing a bimodal daily routine, while low-elevation birds showed an
   inverted U-shaped daily routine, with most foraging during the middle of
   the day. Finally, significant differences in daily routines were
   associated with variation in spatial learning and memory performance.
   Overall, our study shows that daily foraging routines are consistent
   with risk of starvation under different degrees of environmental
   harshness, whether across nonbreeding seasons or between elevations, and
   that perception of harshness may be associated with cognitive abilities.

Abstract = {{Previous studies in animal models and humans have shown that exposure to
   nutritional deficiencies in the perinatal period increases the risk of
   psychiatric disease. Less well understood is how such effects are
   modulated by the combination of genetic background and parent-of-origin
   (PO). To explore this, we exposed female mice from 20 Collaborative
   Cross (CC) strains to protein deficient, vitamin D deficient, methyl
   donor enriched or standard diet during the perinatal period. These CC
   females were then crossed to a male from a different CC strain to
   produce reciprocal F1 hybrid females comprising 10 distinct genetic
   backgrounds. The adult F1 females were then tested in the open field,
   light/dark, stress-induced hyperthermia, forced swim and restraint
   stress assays. Our experimental design allowed us to estimate effects of
   genetic background, perinatal diet, PO and their interactions on
   behavior. Genetic background significantly affected all assessed
   phenotypes. Perinatal diet exposure interacted with genetic background
   to affect body weight, basal body temperature, anxiety-like behavior and
   stress response. In 8 of 9 genetic backgrounds, PO effects were observed
   on multiple phenotypes. Additionally, we identified a small number of
   diet-by-PO effects on body weight, stress response, anxiety- and
   depressive-like behavior. Our data show that rodent behaviors that model
   psychiatric disorders are affected by genetic background, PO and
   perinatal diet, as well as interactions among these factors.}},

   ground squirrel}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Personality traits overlap in behavioral syndromes that are assumed to
   be related to physiology and life history traits, shaping pace-of-life
   syndromes. Boldness and explorative behavior are frequently associated
   with higher parasite loads, increased resource acquisition, less
   efficient antipredator behavior, and reduced survival (e.g., through
   predation). We explored how personality is related to these biological
   traits using an invasive species-Atlantoxerus getulus in Fuerteventura
   island-as a model system with reduced parasitism and low predation
   pressure. We used breath rate during handling, open field tests, and
   escape trials to test for the existence of interindividual differences
   in boldness, explorative behavior, and escape speed, respectively. We
   also tested whether the personality traits were related and formed
   behavioral syndromes in A. getulus. At the same time, we explored how
   personality is related to ectoparasite load, body condition, and
   survival in the species. We found strong between-individual differences
   in breath rate, readiness to get in the open field arena, and escape
   speed. We found a behavioral syndrome, linking open field entrance and
   escape speed, in A. getulus. However, personality was not related to
   parasite load or body condition and survival was higher for bolder
   individuals. As a whole, our results suggest reduced parasites and
   predator pressures on Fuerteventura may have potentially neutralized the
   typical drawbacks of a fast pace-of-life in the introduced population of
   A. getulus.
   Significance statement
   Research on the interactions of animal personality with other ecological
   and evolutionary factors, such as parasitism and selection gradients,
   has yielded some intriguing perspectives about many ecological and
   evolutionary processes. However, our understanding of the
   eco-evolutionary consequences of animal personality and how it interacts
   with other relevant biological processes is still limited. Invasive
   species often experience specific ecological conditions that can allow
   testing of the general assumptions related to animal personality. The
   present contribution explores if and how personality traits are related
   to key ecological and evolutionary factors, such as parasitism and
   survival, in the context of an invasive population subjected to reduced
   parasite and predation pressure. Unlike other studies conducted under
   different ecological contexts, our results suggest Barbary ground
   squirrels from the assessed population with fast pace-of-life syndromes
   have higher survival chances than their counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple diversification rate shifts explain uneven clade richness in

   trait-dependent diversification approaches to investigate the

   some association between both dietary specialization and body mass, as
   well as between habitat specialization with relative tail lengths using
   phylogenetic analyses of variance. However, there was no significant
   association between diversification rates with the evolution of these
   traits in muroid rodents. We also show that several of the
   state-dependent diversification approaches are highly susceptible to
   Type I error-a result that is in accordance with recent criticisms of
   these methods. Finally, we discuss several potential causes for the lack

Abstract = {{While many studies document effects of elevated pCO(2) on coastal
   organisms, the environmental variability characteristic of coastal
   regions is often not directly tested. We tested for effects of elevated
   pCO(2) on the valve gaping activity of adult eastern oysters
   (Crassostrea virginica) in response to acute heat shock that can occur
   in nearshore shallow coastal waters. In two consecutive experimental
   trials, oysters (n = 4) wired with Hall Effect biosensors (that measured
   valve gaping at one-second intervals) were exposed for 10 days at six
   different pCO(2) treatments spanning a range currently observed in
   nearshore coastal regions, and predicted under near-future ocean
   acidification. After the 10-day acclimation period, oysters from each
   pCO(2) treatment were exposed to a 3-h heat shock assay (11-12 -> 30
   degrees C) and valve gaping activity was monitored continuously. During
   the heat shock assays, valve gaping activity increased with increasing
   temperature and then ceased when temperature was reduced back to 11-12
   degrees C; however, these valve gaping rate increases during heat shock
   were not characteristic of overly-stressed oysters. Exposure to elevated
   pCO(2) had no effect on the valve gaping response of oysters to acute
   heat shock. Our results suggest that the valve gaping responses of adult
   eastern oysters to acute temperature increases are unaffected by
   short-term elevations in seawater pCO(2). Future studies incorporating
   the roles of local adaptation, food availability, and direct functional
   consequences of valve gaping (e.g. physiological rates, predator

Abstract = {{The potential impact of carabid predation on dispersing Bombina
   variegala metamorphs was studied in the field at the Schmidtenhohe
   (Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany) and performing experimental trials in
   the laboratory. At least four carabid species were demonstrated to feed
   on metamorphs, with Carabus violaceus and Pterostichus niger mainly
   preying on the smallest individuals, and Abax parallelepipedus and
   Harpalus rufipes indiscriminately attacking smaller and larger
   individuals. Predation rates were mostly low (5-15\% of metamorphs)
   despite of high prey densities (8(3) metamorphs per m(2)), but hungry
   beetles consumed up to 60\% within five days. Plasticity in the timing
   of metamorphosis (about two months) and in the size at metamorphosis
   (11-19 mm) observed in the field seemed to reflect mainly the
   variability in the spawning date and of aquatic environment during the
   tadpole development. Still, the tendency of metamorphs to be become
   larger on average towards the end of the metamorphosis period reduced
   their risk of being predated because the abundance of potential carabid
   predators did neither vary among habitat types crossed by dispersing
   metamorphs nor during the period of metamorphosis. Consequently,
   informed conservation management of endangered B. variegata populations
   should focus on larval habitats producing large-sized metamorphs to
   reduce loss of metamorphs by size-assortative carabid predation.}},

Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{AUG 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Most studies on food choice have been focussing on the
   individual level but familial aspects may also play an important role.
   This paper reports of a novel study that will focus on the familial
   aspects of the formation of food choice among men and women aged 50-70
   years by recruiting spouses and siblings (NutriAct Family Study; NFS).
   Methods: Data is collected prospectively via repeatedly applied
   web-based questionnaires over the next years. The recruitment for the
   NFS started in October 2016. Participants are recruited based on an
   index person who is actively participating in the European Prospective
   Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam study. This index
   person was asked to invite the spouse, a sibling or an in-law. If a set
   of family members agreed to participate, access to individualized
   web-based questionnaires assessing dietary intake, other health related
   lifestyle habits, eating behaviour, food responsiveness, personality,
   self-regulation, socio-economic status and socio-cultural values was
   provided. In the first phase of the NSF, recruitment rates were
   monitored in detail and participants' comments were analysed in order to
   improve the feasibility of procedures and instruments.
   Discussion: Until August 4th 2017, 4783 EPIC-Participants were contacted
   by mail of which 446 persons recruited 2 to 5 family members (including
   themselves) resulting in 1032 participants, of whom 82\% had started
   answering or already completed the questionnaires. Of the 4337 remaining
   EPIC-participants who had been contacted, 1040 (24\%) did not respond at
   all, and 3297 (76\%) responded but declined, in 51\% of the cases
   because of the request to recruit at least 2 family members in the
   respective age range. The developed recruitment procedures and web-based
   methods of data collection are capable to generate the required study
   population including the data on individual and inter-personal
   determinants which will be linkable to food choice. The information on
   familial links among the study participants will show the role of
   familial traits in midlife for the adoption of food choices supporting
   healthy aging.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Climate-driven increases in spring temperatures are expected to result
   in higher prey availability earlier in the breeding season for
   insectivorous birds breeding in wetland habitats. Predation during the
   incubation phase is a major cause of nesting failure in open-nesting
   altricial birds such as the Eurasian reed warbler. The nest predation
   rate in this species has recently been shown to be substantially reduced
   under conditions of experimentally elevated invertebrate prey
   availability. Food availability near the nest may be an important
   determinant of adult incubation and nest defence behaviours during the
   incubation period. We used two experimental studies to compare
   incubation behaviour and nest defence in food-supplemented and
   unsupplemented adult Eurasian reed warblers during the incubation phase.
   In the first study we measured nest defence behavioural responses to a
   taxidermic mount of a native predator (stoat Mustela erminea). In the
   second study we used temperature loggers installed in nests to measure
   breaks in incubation as a measure of nest vulnerability.
   Food-supplemented birds responded aggressively to the presence of a
   predator more quickly than those in the unsupplemented group, suggesting
   they are closer to their nest and can more quickly detect a predator in
   the vicinity. Food-supplemented birds also had shorter breaks in
   incubation (both in terms of maximum and mean off-bout durations),
   presumably because they were foraging for shorter periods or over
   shorter distances from the nest. This study therefore identifies the
   behavioural mechanisms by which changes in food availability may lead to
   changes in nest survival and thus breeding productivity, in open-nesting
   insectivorous birds.}},

Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{144-148}},
Month = {{AUG-SEP}},
Abstract = {{Cannibalism has been observed occasionally in a limited number of
   different animal species, but the underlying mechanisms that foster this
   behavior are mostly unknown. Here we show that mosquito (Culex pipiens)
   larvae show this behavior towards conspecifics under certain conditions.
   Cannibalism was only observed in 4th instar larvae and only in response
   to starvation. Well fed animals never showed any cannibalistic behavior.
   Starvation induced cannibalism of Culex 4th instar was predominantly
   directed towards 3rd instars rather than to 1st or 2nd instar larvae.
   Specific mandibular structures of these larvae enable this cannibalistic
   behavior. We could show that treatment with the biogenic amine
   octopamine, which is known to be involved in the control of starvation
   and aggression, increased the rate of cannibalism of food-deprived 4th
   instar larvae significantly. Incubation with the octopamine receptor
   antagonist phentolamine suppressed this cannibalistic behavior.
   Moreover, octopamine not only increased the rate of cannibalism, it also
   induced a shift towards smaller prey. A role of octopamine in this
   starvation induced behavior was further supported by direct measurements
   of the total content of this important neuroactive compound. Taken
   together, we could show that 4th instar mosquito larvae showed
   cannibalistic behavior after starvation and that this behavior
   apparently depends on octopamine.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{49-57}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Thermoregulatory behaviours are of great importance for ectotherms
   buffering against the impact of temperature extremes. Such behaviours
   bring not only benefits but also organism level costs such as decreased
   food availability and foraging efficiency and thus lead to energetic
   costs and metabolic consequences. However, there remains an important
   gap in our knowledge to link thermoregulatory behaviour to population
   level ecological consequences. Aphids, as ectothermic invertebrates, can
   escape from thermal extremes by either dropping off the plant they are
   on or moving to suitable microclimates. Here we used the English grain
   aphid, Sitobion avenae, as a model system to test the hypothesis that
   aphids may behaviourally avoid heat stress while also altering their
   microhabitat utilization leading to demographic consequences. We found
   that heat stress drove the aphids to leave their host plant; this
   reduction in host plant residence was associated with increasing leaf
   temperatures indicating that aphids exhibit thermoregulatory behaviour
   to escape heat stress. Specifically, we found that behavioural
   thermoregulation made the aphids disperse and redistribute themselves
   within different microclimates and thus led to changes in microhabitat
   utilization. We also discovered that leaving the host plant during
   behavioural thermoregulation resulted in a considerable decrease in
   aphids' survival probability due to their inefficient relocation to
   other plants and increased risk of starvation. Finally, we found that
   the aphids' thermoregulatory behaviour prevented heat stress while
   concurrently resulting in decreased survival and reproduction. Together,
   these findings support our hypothesis that behavioural thermoregulation
   alters microhabitat utilization and demographic rates in aphids. This
   study highlights the importance of behavioural thermoregulation and its
   ecological consequences and has important implications for understanding
   population responses in the context of current climate change. (C) 2018

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{95-100}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Animals are able to modify their behaviour in response to changes in
   their internal and environmental state. The asset protection principle
   predicts that an animal's risk-taking behaviour should vary as a result
   of its residual reproductive value (RRV); animals with greater RRV would
   incur a greater cost if injured or killed and should therefore take
   fewer risks than those with low RRV. Despite the intuitive appeal of
   this hypothesis, few studies have effectively separated the effects of
   RRV on behaviour from those of age. We addressed this weakness in the
   widely invoked hypothesis by measuring the risk-taking behaviour of
   female Australian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, at various
   points in the animal's lifetime. We found significant effects of age on
   risk-taking behaviour: older females emerged from a shelter sooner after
   a simulated predation threat and exhibited greater mobility in an open
   arena. Importantly, there was also a significant marginal effect of RRV
   on risk-taking behaviour. Females with lower RRV displayed greater
   levels of risk taking than females with high RRV. Our results thereby
   offer support for the asset protection principle as an explanation for
   state-dependent variation in risk-taking behaviour. (C) 2018 The

Abstract = {{Melanin-based coloration is associated with aspects of phenotype,

   between melanin coloration and territoriality differed in urban and
   rural habitats. In rural sparrows, territoriality was negatively
   correlated with spotting area, while in urban sparrows territoriality
   was positively associated with spotting darkness. Regardless of habitat,
   males with more extensive spotting increased testosterone secretion more
   in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone administration and males
   with darker spotting had greater handling restraint-induced release of
   corticosterone. This suggests that plumage coloration is associated with
   underlying physiology, but the relationship between coloration and
   behaviour may shift between habitats. (C) 2018 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Regulation of mass in small birds is based on simultaneously minimizing
   starvation and predation risk, but the mechanisms birds use to assess
   starvation risk are still debated. While we know that birds anticipate
   periods of unpredictable food availability/energy expenditure (e.g. the
   winter and night) by increasing their fat reserves, we do not know
   whether this anticipation involves learning. This study investigated
   whether birds could learn to use a light cue that predicted a period of
   food unavailability, to adaptively regulate their foraging and/or body
   weight. Sixteen captive starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, were subjected to
   42 days of an irregular schedule of food deprivation that involved
   depriving them of food for 5 h on 20 pseudorandomly chosen days. Birds
   were randomly allocated to two treatment groups for which a 30 min
   period of reduced ambient light either provided perfect information
   (Predictable) or no information (Unpredictable) about upcoming food
   deprivation. Both groups of birds increased their dawn body mass over
   the period of the experiment, consistent with a response to
   unpredictable food deprivation. However, no differences in either
   foraging behaviour or dawn body mass emerged between the groups,
   suggesting that the Predictable birds were unable to learn to use the
   light cue to initiate anticipatory foraging ahead of food deprivation.
   Furthermore, both groups immediately decreased their foraging behaviour
   in response to the onset of the light cue, suggesting that starlings do
   not have an evolved anticipatory foraging response to low light levels.
   Further work is needed to test alternative cues and designs before any
   general conclusions can be drawn regarding the flexibility of
   anticipatory foraging. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Early life stressors can impair song in songbirds by negatively
   impacting brain development and subsequent learning. Even in species in
   which only males sing, early life stressors might also impact female
   behavior and its underlying neural mechanisms, but fewer studies have
   examined this possibility. We manipulated brood size in zebra finches to
   simultaneously examine the effects of developmental stress on male song
   learning and female behavioral and neural response to song. Although
   adult male HVC volume was unaffected, we found that males from larger
   broods imitated tutor song less accurately. In females, early condition
   did not affect the direction of song preference: all females preferred
   tutor song over unfamiliar song in an operant test. However, treatment
   did affect the magnitude of behavioral response to song: females from
   larger broods responded less during song preference trials. This
   difference in activity level did not reflect boldness per se, as a
   separate measure of this trait did not differ with brood size.
   Additionally, in females we found a treatment effect on expression of
   the immediate early gene ZENK in response to tutor song in brain regions
   involved in song perception (dNCM) and social motivation (LSc.vl, BSTm,
   TnA), but not in a region implicated in song memory (CMM). These results
   are consistent with the hypothesis that developmental stressors that
   impair song learning in male zebra finches also influence perceptual
   and/or motivational processes in females. However, our results suggest
   that the learning of tutor song by females is robust to disturbance by
   developmental stress. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Background/objectives Previous studies have shown that the temperament
   traits are related to risk factors for chronic diseases, which could be
   partly explained by lifestyle habits. However, little is known whether
   temperament traits associate with diet. The aim of this study was to
   examine the cross-sectional associations between temperament traits and
   the whole diet.
   Subjects/methods We studied 1668 men and women, aged 56-70, from the
   Helsinki Birth Cohort Study. Temperament was measured using the
   Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire. Information on diet was
   collected by a validated 128-item food frequency questionnaire. The
   associations of temperament traits; novelty seeking (NS), harm avoidance
   (HA), reward dependence (RD), and persistence (P), with diet were tested
   by linear regression analysis.
   Results After adjustment for potential confounders, greater HA was
   related to poorer diet quality, including lower consumption of
   vegetables, fruits, fish and several vitamins RD was associated with
   healthier diet quality, including higher consumption of vegetables and
   intake of vitamin E and lower intake of alcohol. NS was significantly
   related to higher intake of fish, fat and alcohol and lower consumption
   of cereals, milk products and carbohydrates. No significant associations
   between P and intake of foods and nutrients were observed.
   Conclusions Our results suggest that there is an association between
   temperament traits and diet. Especially greater HA seems to associate
   with poorer diet quality and greater RD with healthier diet quality.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals vary greatly in the distance they disperse, and in doing so,
   strongly affect ecological and evolutionary processes. Dispersal, when
   viewed as a component of phenotype, can be affected independently or
   jointly by environment. However, among taxa with complex life cycles
   that occupy different habitats over ontogeny, the effects of environment
   on dispersal and the interaction between environment and phenotype
   remains poorly understood. Here, we conducted a field experiment to
   measure how dispersal distance was affected by phenotype, environment
   experienced before and after metamorphosis, and their interaction. We
   manipulated the environment encountered by a pond-breeding salamander
   Ambystoma annulatum during the aquatic larval stage and again as
   dispersing terrestrial juveniles. After assaying juvenile phenotype
   (exploration behavior, body condition, and morphology), we then measured
   the initial distance dispersed by juveniles. The distance moved by
   dispersing salamanders was affected by attributes of both larval and
   juvenile habitat, with salamanders that encountered low quality habitat
   in either life stage moving the farthest. However, we did not find
   support for an interactive effect of phenotype and environment affecting
   the distance moved by dispersers. Interestingly, exploration behavior
   explained the distance moved by philopatric animals but not dispersing
   ones. Our findings indicate that the environment experienced before
   metamorphosis can affect juvenile dispersal behavior, and demonstrates
   the need to consider dispersal in species with complex life cycles to
   understand the coupling between local and regional population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual ornaments contribute substantially to phenotypic diversity and it
   is particularly relevant to understand their evolution. Ornaments can
   assume the function of signals-of-quality that the choosy sex uses to
   evaluate potential mating partners. Often there are no obvious direct
   benefits and investment into mate choice is primarily rewarded by
   beneficial alleles that are inherited to the offspring. Inter-sexual
   communication via sexual ornaments requires honesty of the sexual
   signal, yet the question of what maintains honesty remains only
   partially solved. One solution is that honesty is maintained by trait
   expression being dependent on individual condition, since
   condition-dependent trait expression offers an effectively inexhaustible
   source of genetic variability. Here we test in the highly sexually
   dimorphic club-legged grasshopper Gomphocerus sibiricus if putative
   sexual ornaments, in particular the striking front-leg clubs, are more
   strongly affected by a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) immune challenge than
   putatively not sexually selected traits. Our results show overall little
   condition-dependent expression of morphological and song traits, with
   sexually selected traits exhibiting effects comparable to nonsexually
   selected traits (with the possible exception of stridulatory file length
   and syllable-to-pause ratio in advertisement songs). Interestingly,
   field observations of individuals of lethally parasitized individuals
   suggest that a very strong environmental challenge can specifically
   affect the expression of the front-leg clubs. The presence of 1\% of
   males in natural populations with missing or heavily deformed clubs plus
   5\% with minor club deformations furthermore indicate that there are
   risks associated with club development during final ecdysis and this
   might act as a filter against deleterious alleles.}},

Abstract = {{Polyphenisms, where multiple, discrete, environmentally-cued phenotypes
   can arise from a single genotype, are extreme forms of phenotypic
   plasticity. Cue acquisition and interpretation are vital for matching
   phenotypes to varying environments, but can be difficult if cues are
   unreliable indicators or if multiple cues are present simultaneously.
   Facultative paedomorphosis, where juvenile traits are retained at sexual
   maturity, is a density-dependent polyphenism exhibited by many
   salamanders. Favorable conditions such as low larval densities and
   stable hydroperiod delay metamorphosis and promote a paedomorphic
   strategy. We investigated proximate cues affecting facultative
   paedomorphosis in order to understand how larval newts (Notophthalmus
   viridescens louisianensis) assess conspecific density. To isolate the
   effects of density cues from the effects of resources and agonistic
   behavior, we caged larval newts in mesocosms in a 2 x 2 factorial design
   that manipulated both background larval newt densities (high or low) and
   food levels (ambient or supplemented). We found strong effects of both
   food and density on caged individuals. Under high densities, caged
   larvae were more likely to become efts, a long-lasting juvenile
   terrestrial stage, across both food levels, while paedomorphs were more
   common under low densities. Though food levels increased growth rates,
   density had strong independent effects on metamorphic timing and
   phenotype. Competition for food and space are classical
   density-dependent processes, but density cues themselves may be a
   mediator of density-dependent effects on polyphenisms and life history
   responses.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in intrinsic (body mass, reproductive condition) and extrinsic
   factors (habitat quality, spatio-temporal variation in food
   availability) can affect the costs and benefits of personality traits.
   Relationships between personality and fitness components can vary with
   changes in population density and/or habitat quality. Here, using
   capture-mark-recapture data of individually marked Eurasian red
   squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris), we explored whether indices of boldness
   and exploration are correlated with local survival in either of the
   sexes and with a measure of reproductive success in females, under
   different conditions of food availability. PCA scores derived from the
   number of captures (trappability) and number of different traps where an
   individual was captured (trap diversity), in the first 1 or 2 years of
   presence, were used as indices of personality (boldness and pure
   exploration). The relationships between boldness and local survival
   differed between habitats in both sexes. Bold squirrels survived better
   than shy ones in Norway spruce forest, while in the other two study
   areas (Scots pine or mixed spruce-fir forest), survival was lower for
   bolder squirrels. Pure exploration behavior was negatively correlated
   with local survival in all habitats and in both sexes. Female
   reproductive success increased with body mass and decreased with the
   tendency to explore, a relationship consistent across habitat types.
   Bolder females did not have a reproductive advantage in years of poor
   food availability. We suggest that costs and benefits of boldness vary
   with spatio-temporal differences in availability of high-quality food
   resources which may help to maintain variation in personality in red
   squirrels in heterogeneous landscapes.
   Differences in personality among individuals can affect their survival
   or reproductive success. We investigated the relationship between
   personality traits and fitness components in Eurasian red squirrels
   under different food availability. We scored boldness and exploration
   using indices derived from capture-mark-recapture data. Bold red
   squirrels survived longer than shy ones in spruce forest where food
   availability varied strongly between years. Instead, in mixed forests
   with more stable food supplies, shy individuals survived longer. Heavy
   females produced more litters in their lifetime than those with lower
   body mass. Explorative squirrels were more likely to die young and to
   produce no or few litters, independent of the habitat they lived in. Our
   results suggest that variation in personality traits within populations
   of Eurasian red squirrels was maintained by changing fitness benefits in
   relation to habitat type in pulsed resource systems.}},

Abstract = {{The current obesogenic environment promotes physical inactivity and food
   consumption in excess of energy requirements, two important modifiable
   risk factors influencing energy balance. Habitual physical activity has
   been shown to impact not only energy expenditure, but also energy intake
   through mechanisms of appetite control. This review summarizes recent
   theory and evidence underpinning the role of physical activity in the
   homeostatic and non-homeostatic mechanisms controlling appetite. Energy
   intake along the spectrum of physical activity levels (inactive to
   highly active) appears to be J-shaped, with low levels of physical
   activity leading to dysregulated appetite and a mismatch between energy
   intake and expenditure. At higher levels, habitual physical activity
   influences homeostatic appetite control in a dual-process action by
   increasing the drive to eat through greater energy expenditure, but also
   by enhancing post-meal satiety, allowing energy intake to better match
   energy expenditure in response to hunger and satiety signals. There is
   clear presumptive evidence that physical activity energy expenditure can
   act as a drive (determinant) of energy intake. The influence of physical
   activity level on non-homeostatic appetite control is less clear, but
   low levels of physical activity may amplify hedonic states and
   behavioural traits favouring overconsumption indirectly through
   increased body fat. More evidence is required to understand the
   interaction between physical activity, appetite control and diet
   composition on passive overconsumption and energy balance. Furthermore,
   potential moderators of appetite control along the spectrum of physical
   activity, such as body composition, sex, and type, intensity and timing
   of physical activity, remain to be fully understood.}},

Abstract = {{Existing programs which aim to prevent and treat childhood obesity often
   do not take into account individual variation and the underlying
   mechanisms that impact child eating behavior. Individual differences in
   children's appetitive traits have been shown to appear as early as
   during infancy and become more pronounced as children grow older and
   become more exposed to the obesogenic food environment. Differences in
   genetic predispositions interacting with factors in children's early
   environment account in part for individual differences in appetitive
   traits. It is very likely that obesogenic eating phenotypes manifest
   themselves before the onset of childhood obesity. If so, identifying
   these phenotypes early is expected to move primary prevention strategies
   in a new direction and holds great potential to significantly enhance
   our ability to prevent childhood obesity. The aim of this narrative
   review is to discuss the role of behavioral phenotyping as an innovative
   approach for the development of more personalized obesity prevention and
   treatment interventions that are tailored to children's individual
   predispositions. We describe several examples of appetitive traits which
   have been linked to overeating and excess weight gain in children and

   was significantly less intensive in chick-rearing skuas bearing higher
   mirex levels, suggesting reproductive behavioral impairment. Matrix
   population models were then built to project the rate of population
   decline according to increasing mirex burden. Although mirex levels were
   2.8 times higher in 2003 than in 2005, the population-level effect of

Abstract = {{Background: The significance of decision-making in suicidal behaviour is
   often highlighted; however, the performance of persons in suicide crisis
   is unknown. This study aimed to explore the comprehensive decision
   making profile of depressed patients following a suicide attempt.
   Methods: Decision-making was measured by reward- ({''}ABCD{''}) and
   punishment- ({''}EFGH{''}) sensitive versions of the Iowa Gambling Task
   (IGT) in 59 medication-free depressed patients within 72 h after a
   suicide attempt and in 46 healthy control subjects. Severity of
   depressive symptoms was assessed in the patient group by the Hamilton
   Depression Rating Scale.
   Results: Performance of the two groups differed significantly on the IGT
   ABCD, while a trend towards significant differences was seen on the IGT
   EFGH. Severity of depressive symptoms did not affect the depressed
   participants' decision-making performance.
   Limitations: Subjects were not matched for years of education.
   Administration of the IGT ABCD and IGT EFGH was not counterbalanced.
   Methods of suicide attempts and history of previous attempts were not
   collected.
   Conclusions: Individuals with a recent suicide attempt showed
   decision-making dysfunction on both IGT versions. However, on the EFGH,
   the overall difference between groups was not significant, depressed
   participants' performance remained poor during all blocks. Their
   behaviour reflected a focus on best immediate possible outcomes, not
   regarding future adverse consequences. This could be a result of
   psychological and cognitive alterations which modulate suicidal
   behaviour independent from mood. Further longitudinal studies should
   verify this possibility. Investigation of state-dependent
   neuropsychological characteristics of suicidal behaviour might be
   essential for detecting acute suicidal crisis.}},

Title = {{Influence of prey-food abundance on predator-prey foraging games: a test

Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background: A predator-prey relationship abounds with variables that
   might affect the behaviour of either species as it responds to the
   challenges of the predation game. In a series of experiments, we have
   studied the behavioural responses of goldfish (prey) and little egrets
   (predator) when brought together in a large laboratory apparatus - an
   aviary with three pools of water. To obtain a baseline, we measured
   their behaviour in an aviary without manipulating any variable (Katz et
   al., 2010). Because the results of that study suggested that both fish
   and egrets follow the rules of optimal foraging, we undertook a series
   of experiments in which we manipulated the number of food patches (Katz
   et al., 2014a), the number of fish per pool (Katz et al., 2014b; Vijayan
   et al., 2018a), and the size of goldfish refuges (vijayaa et al.,
   2018b). In each case, the results supported the hypothesis of optimal
   behaviour. Mitchell (2018, this issue) makes four predictions about the
   behaviours of both species as the abundance of fish resources changes in
   a system such as the aviary. Specifically: (1) Prey should respond very
   weakly, if at all, to variation in the food ration among patches. (2)
   The predator should allocate more time to patches with a higher
   prey-food ration. (3) When moving to another patch, the predator should
   choose the patch with the higher prey-food ration more often than it
   would at random. (4) The predator will kill more prey in patches
   receiving a larger ration of prey-food.
   Aims: Explore the effect of varying the abundance of fish-food on the
   behaviours of goldfish and little egrets in the aviary. Determine
   whether variation in their behaviours agrees with the predictions of
   Mitchell's theoretical model.
   Methods: We used little egrets (the predators) and goldfish (the prey).
   We conducted experiments in two identical aviaries (7 m diameter). Each
   aviary contained three separate patches, i.e. three pools (1.52 m
   diameter, 0.60 m deep, similar to 1000 litres), each open to foraging by
   a single egret in the aviary. A fixed cover (22.75 cm radius) at the
   centre of each pool provided a refuge for the goldfish. Each pool had 15
   fish. We manipulated intraspecific competition by offering three
   different amounts of goldfish food in an aviary each day: full (1.13 g
   per day), half (0.56 g per day), and quarter (0.28 g per day) rations.
   We then observed and recorded the behaviours of both players for 6
   hours.
   Results: Patch-to-patch variation in the food ration had no effect on
   fish activity. But the egret allocated more time to foraging in the
   patch where the prey-food ration was highest (1.13 g). When moving to
   another patch, the egret moved to the patches containing high food
   rations (1.13 and 0.56 g) rather than the patch with the lowest food
   ration (0.28 g). And the predator caught significantly fewer goldfish in
   these poorest patches. Thus all four predictions were validated.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies suggest that immune-challenged individuals need to
   allocate resources to the immune system to combat infection, reducing
   escape ability and increasing the vulnerability of infected individuals
   to predators. Such behavioural responses might change in anthropogenic
   habitats where the balance between predation risk and countering
   infections can differ from that in natural habitats. We experimentally
   explored whether fighting an infection has an effect on hiding behaviour
   in a frog (Pelophylax perezi), and whether frogs from urban ponds
   respond differently from those from natural forested ponds.
   Independently of habitat type, we found no evidence for changes in
   hiding behaviour of male frogs before and after they were immune
   challenged (injected with lipopolysaccharide) or not (injected with
   phosphate-buffered saline). We also explored whether immune response
   (phytohaemagglutinin assay) or morphological traits (head width, body
   condition, body size and length) were related to variation in hiding
   time, but we did not find a relationship between the measured traits and
   behavioural response for males from either habitat. In conclusion, we
   show that frog anti-predator behaviour is not always affected by an
   immune challenge and the effect of urban habitats can be weaker than
   expected, at least in species that could be pre-adapted to the novel

Journal = {{DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{145}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Sulfation of biomolecules, like phosphorylation, is one of the most
   fundamental and ubiquitous biochemical modifications with important
   functions during detoxification. This process is reversible, involving
   two enzyme classes: a sulfotransferase, which adds a sulfo group to a
   substrate; and a sulfatase that removes the sulfo group. However, unlike
   phosphorylation, the role of sulfation in organismal development is
   poorly understood. In this study, we find that two independent sulfation
   events regulate the development of mouth morphology in the nematode
   Pristionchus pacificus. This nematode has the ability to form two
   alternative mouth morphologies depending on environmental cues, an
   example of phenotypic plasticity. We found that, in addition to a
   previously described sulfatase, a sulfotransferase is involved in
   regulating the mouth-form dimorphism in P. pacificus. However, it is
   unlikely that both of these sulfation-associated enzymes act upon the
   same substrates, as they are expressed in different cell types.
   Furthermore, animals mutant in genes encoding both enzymes show
   condition-dependent epistatic interactions. Thus, our study highlights
   the role of sulfation-associated enzymes in phenotypic plasticity of
   mouth structures in Pristionchus.}},

Abstract = {{An organism's life history strategy is made up of a suite of
   physiological, behavioral, and ecological traits, which vary at both the
   interspecific and intraspecific levels in accordance with selective
   pressures operating on individuals. For birds, 2 primary ecological
   factors have been proposed to explain intraspecific and interspecific
   variation in nestling growth: nest predation and food availability.
   Individual nestling growth rates have important consequences for overall
   fitness because growth speed could influence subsequent reproductive
   performance and survival. We studied the relationship between ecological
   factors (i.e. precipitation level and predation rate) and nestling
   growth patterns of 2 New World flycatcher species (Tyrannidae) of the
   genus Tyrannus (Fork-tailed Flycatcher {[}T. savana] and Scissor-tailed
   Flycatcher {[}T. forficatus]) breeding at south- and north-temperate
   latitudes. We tested the hypothesis that nestling growth rates are
   driven by nest predation rates and predicted that nestling growth rates
   would be higher in species experiencing higher nest predation rates. We
   also tested the hypothesis that nestling growth rates are related to
   precipitation levels (a proxy for food abundance) and predicted that
   nestling growth rates would be higher at sites with higher precipitation
   levels. Growth rate was not associated with predation rate, but it
   varied with precipitation level, with faster nestling growth rates
   during wet years for the Scissor-tailed Flycatcher living at
   north-temperate latitudes. Among species, similar growth rates were
   found during wet years. These results indicate that, at least as
   proximate causes, precipitation explains intraspecific and interspecific
   growth rate variation in Tyrannus species to a larger degree than
   predation. Additionally, the variation in growth rate we observed
   between wet and dry years indicates a high level of plasticity in growth
   rate in this group of insectivorous birds.}},

Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Studies at small spatial scale are often fundamental to highlight the
   behavioural plasticity of a species and thus have important implications
   for conservation planning, in particular for species usually considered
   as habitat specialists. We investigated second-order habitat selection
   of the European pine marten in an area dominated by deciduous oak forest
   and open fields in central Italy, by radio-tracking 16 pine martens
   (eight males, eight females). Pine martens placed home ranges in areas
   with more open field than in the study area, whereas woodland (oak and
   conifer forests) comprised a smaller portion of the home range than
   predominant forest character of the studied area. Although the presence
   of the species in the open habitats has been documented, to our
   knowledge, our results provide the first evidence of home range
   establishment in this cover type by pine marten at population level. The
   combination of low predation risk and high availability of resources
   could allow pine martens to occupy open fields in our study area. We
   highlighted different individual strategies of habitat selection, with
   some individuals placing home ranges in areas with high forest coverage
   while others occupying open areas. We found no effects of sex and body
   condition on habitat selection, and this could indicate that in the
   study area, both forested and non-forested cover types, such as open
   fields, shrub and anthropic areas, can provide adequate food, overhead
   cover and resting sites for all individuals. Pine marten ability to
   occupy open fields seems thus more related to the behavioural
   flexibility of the species, rather than to the need to supplement dens
   and forage from complementary lower quality habitat. The high quality of
   the Mediterranean continental area studied could also explain the
   selection of open areas by the pine marten. Our results offer useful
   information on pine marten ecology and may be helpful for conservation
   management of this species in southern Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Anti-predator behavior can be costly to prey species and the
   consequences of these decisions may affect survival. Interactions
   between humans and hunted species can lead to behavioral shifts in the
   animal that affect hunter satisfaction and possibly fitness of the
   animals. We assessed the influence of multiple factors that may affect
   anti-predator behavior in a commonly harvested game bird, the northern
   bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), during October 2013-March 2015 on a
   private plantation in South Carolina, USA. We monitored bobwhite-hunter
   interactions during hunting events (n=40) using radio-telemetry and
   behavioral observations. We investigated bobwhite anti-predator behavior
   in 2 contexts, choice of evasive tactic and timing of tactic deployment
   (i.e., level of wariness), using a combination of linear regression and
   multinomial models in a Bayesian framework. Our results indicate the
   approach style of the hunter (i.e., pointing dog) and vegetation density
   affect the evasive tactic used. Dense vegetation at 0.6m above ground
   height promoted hiding behavior of bobwhites, whereas approaching
   pointing dogs (i.e., not holding point) promoted flushing. Also, dense
   vegetation at 0.3m above ground height and previous exposure to a
   discharged firearm elicited an earlier anti-predator response. Our
   results imply that bobwhites make context-specific decisions regarding
   hunter evasion, which may be a result of associative learning. Managers
   may be able to increase bobwhite-hunter encounters and improve hunter
   satisfaction by maintaining vegetation structure between 0.6 and 1.3m to
   promote hiding behavior throughout the hunting season. (c) 2018 The
   Wildlife Society.
   During hunter interactions, bobwhites held more frequently in dense
   vegetation 0.6m above ground height, flushed more often when encountered
   by moving pointing dogs, and exhibited learning behaviors from previous
   exposure to hunters. Proper vegetation management to provide the optimal
   structure while minimizing dense vegetation (i.e., mat forming grasses)
   at the ground level will foster increased opportunities to detect coveys
   and improve hunter satisfaction.}},

Abstract = {{Wild-living animals are subject to weather variability that may cause
   the generation of reactive oxygen species, resulting in oxidative stress
   and tissue damage, potentially driving demographic responses. Our 3-yr
   field study investigated the effects of seasonal weather conditions on
   biomarkers for oxidative stress, oxidative damage, and antioxidant
   defense in the European badger (Meles meles). We found age class
   effects: cubs were more susceptible to oxidative stress and oxidative
   damage than adults, especially very young cubs in the spring, when they
   also exhibited lower antioxidant biomarkers than adults. Although
   previous studies have found that intermediate spring and summer rainfall
   and warmer temperatures favor cub survival, counterintuitively these
   conditions were associated with more severe oxidative damage. Oxidative
   damage was high in cubs even when antioxidant biomarkers were high. In
   contrast, adult responses accorded with previous survival analyses.
   Wetter spring and summer conditions were associated with higher
   oxidative damage, but they were also associated with higher antioxidant
   biomarkers. Autumnal weather did not vary substantially from normative
   values, and thus effects were muted. Winter carryover effects were
   partially evident, with drier and milder conditions associated with
   greater oxidative damage in the following spring but also with higher
   antioxidant capacity. Plausibly, warmer conditions promoted more badger
   activity, with associated metabolic costs at a time of year when food
   supply is limited. Modeling biomarkers against projected climate change
   scenarios predicted greater future risks of oxidative damage, although
   not necessarily exceeding antioxidant capacity. This interdisciplinary
   approach demonstrates that individual adaptive physiological responses
   are associated with variation in natural environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Who takes risks, and when? The relative state model proposes two
   non-independent selection pressures governing risk-taking: need-based
   and ability-based. The need-based account suggests that actors take
   risks when they cannot reach target states with low-risk options
   (consistent with risk-sensitivity theory). The ability-based account
   suggests that actors engage in risk-taking when they possess traits or
   abilities that increase the expected value of risk-taking (by increasing
   the probability of success, enhancing payoffs for success or buffering
   against failure). Adaptive risk-taking involves integrating both
   considerations. Risk-takers compute the expected value of risk-taking
   based on their state-the interaction of embodied capital relative to
   one's situation, to the same individual in other circumstances or to
   other individuals. We provide mathematical support for this dual pathway
   model, and show that it can predict who will take the most risks and
   when (e.g. when risk-taking will be performed by those in good, poor,
   intermediate or extreme state only). Results confirm and elaborate on
   the initial verbal model of state-dependent risk-taking: selection
   favours agents who calibrate risk-taking based on implicit computations
   of condition and/or competitive (dis)advantage, which in turn drives
   patterned individual differences in risk-taking behaviour.}},

Title = {{Functional connectivity in ruminants: A generalized state-dependent
   modelling approach}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 26}},
Abstract = {{Animal behaviour is increasingly seen as an important component in
   maintaining functional connectivity between patches in fragmented
   landscapes. However, models that explicitly incorporate behavioural
   trade-offs are rarely applied to landscape planning problems like
   connectivity. The aim of this study was to explore how state-dependent
   behaviour influenced functional connectivity between patches from a
   theoretical perspective. We investigated how inter-patch distances
   influenced functional connectivity using a dynamic state variable model
   framework. The decision making process of an individual ruminant facing
   fitness trade-offs in staying in its patch of origin or moving to
   another patch at various distances were explicitly modelled. We
   incorporated energetic costs and predation costs of feeding, ruminating,
   and resting while in the patch and for transit between patches based on
   inter-patch distance. Functional connectivity was maintained with
   isolated patches when they offered high intake and the inactivity of
   rumination associated with rapid gut fill resulted in reduced predation
   risk. Nevertheless, individuals in high energetic state often would
   forgo moving to another patch, whereas individuals in poor energetic
   states were forced to accept the cost of movement to best meet their
   requirements in the distant patch. The inclusion of state-dependent
   behavioural models provides important insights into functional
   connectivity in fragmented landscapes and helps integrate animal
   behaviour into landscape planning. We discuss the consequences of our
   findings for landscape planning to show how the approach provides a
   heuristic tool to assess alternative scenarios for restoring landscape
   functional connectivity.}},

Title = {{Dispersal-competition tradeoff in microbiomes in the quest for land
   colonization}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{Ancestor microbes started colonizing inland habitats approximately 2.7
   to 3.5 billion years ago. With some exceptions, the key physiological
   adaptations of microbiomes associated with marine-to-land transitions
   have remained elusive. This is essentially caused by the lack of
   suitable systems that depict changes in microbiomes across sufficiently
   large time scales. Here, we investigate the adaptive routes taken by
   microbiomes along a contemporary gradient of land formation. Using
   functional trait-based metagenomics, we show that a switch from a
   microbial `dispersal' to a `competition' response modus best
   characterizes the microbial trait changes during this eco-evolutionary
   trajectory. The `dispersal' modus prevails in microbiomes at the
   boundary sites between land and sea. It encompasses traits conferring
   cell chemosensory and motile behaviors, thus allowing the local microbes
   to exploit short-lived nutritional patches in high-diffusion
   microhabitats. A systematic transition towards the `competition' modus
   occurs progressively as the soil matures, which is likely due to forces
   of viscosity or strain that favor traits for competition and chemical
   defense. Concomitantly, progressive increases in the abundances of genes
   encoding antibiotic resistance and complex organic substrate degradation
   were found. Our findings constitute a novel perspective on the ecology
   and evolution of microbiome traits, tracking back one of the most
   seminal transitions in the evolutionary history of life.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 5}},
Abstract = {{Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is an important protein with key
   modulatory functions in cell growth and survival. PTEN is crucial during
   embryogenesis and plays a key role in the central nervous system (CNS),
   where it directly modulates neuronal development and synaptic
   plasticity. Loss of PTEN signaling function is associated with cognitive
   deficits and synaptic plasticity impairment. Accordingly, Pten mutations
   have a strong link with autism spectrum disorder. In this study,
   neuronal Pten haploinsufficient male mice were subjected to a long-term
   environmental intervention - intermittent fasting (IF) - and then
   evaluated for alterations in exploratory, anxiety and learning and
   memory behaviors. Although no significant effects on spatial memory were
   observed, mutant mice showed impaired contextual fear memory in the
   passive avoidance test - an outcome that was effectively rescued by IF.
   In this study, we demonstrated that IF modulation, in addition to its
   rescue of the memory deficit, was also required to uncover behavioral

Abstract = {{Although shell colour polymorphism of the land snail Cepaea nemoralis is
   a well-known phenomenon, proximate and ultimate factors driving its
   evolution remain uncertain. Polymorphic species show variation in
   behavioural responses to selective forces. Therefore, we estimated
   effects of various environmental factors (temperature, humidity, food
   availability, (micro)habitat structure and predatory pressure) on
   behavioural response (frequency of locomotion, climbing and hiding) of
   C. nemoralis morphs, in experimental and natural conditions. In the
   experimental part of study, the frequency of locomotion was negatively
   affected by temperature and the presence of food and positively
   influenced by the presence of light. Morphs significantly differed in
   behavioural responses to environmental variability. Pink mid-banded and
   yellow five-banded morphs climbed less often and hide in shelter more
   often than yellow and pink unbanded individuals when temperature was low
   and food was absent. Snails fed most often at moderate temperature
   compared to low and high temperatures. Field investigations partially
   confirmed differences among morphs in frequency of climbing, but not in
   terms of probability of hiding in sheltered sites. In natural colonies,
   temperature and (micro)habitat structure significantly affected
   frequency of climbing as well as hiding in shelter. Snails more often
   hid in sheltered sites where thrushes preyed on Cepaea. Tendency of
   unbanded morphs to climb trees may have evolved under avian predatory
   pressure as thrushes forage on a ground. Tendency of banded morphs to
   hide in sheltered sites may reflect prey preferences for cryptic
   background. The results implicate that differential behaviour of C.
   nemoralis morphs compensate for their morphological and physiological
   limitations of adaptation to habitat.}},

Title = {{Mice learn to avoid regret}},
Journal = {{PLOS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Regret can be defined as the subjective experience of recognizing that
   one has made a mistake and that a better alternative could have been
   selected. The experience of regret is thought to carry negative utility.
   This typically takes two distinct forms: augmenting immediate postregret
   valuations to make up for losses, and augmenting long-term changes in
   decision-making strategies to avoid future instances of regret
   altogether. While the short-term changes in valuation have been studied
   in human psychology, economics, neuroscience, and even recently in
   nonhuman-primate and rodent neurophysiology, the latter long-term
   process has received far less attention, with no reports of regret
   avoidance in nonhuman decision-making paradigms. We trained 31 mice in a
   novel variant of the Restaurant Row economic decision-making task, in
   which mice make decisions of whether to spend time from a limited budget
   to achieve food rewards of varying costs (delays). Importantly, we
   tested mice longitudinally for 70 consecutive days, during which the
   task provided their only source of food. Thus, decision strategies were
   interdependent across both trials and days. We separated principal
   commitment decisions from secondary reevaluation decisions across space
   and time and found evidence for regret-like behaviors following
   change-of-mind decisions that corrected prior economically
   disadvantageous choices. Immediately following change-of-mind events,
   subsequent decisions appeared to make up for lost effort by altering
   willingness to wait, decision speed, and pellet consumption speed,
   consistent with past reports of regret in rodents. As mice were exposed
   to an increasingly reward-scarce environment, we found they adapted and
   refined distinct economic decision-making strategies over the course of
   weeks to maximize reinforcement rate. However, we also found that even
   without changes in reinforcement rate, mice transitioned from an early
   strategy rooted in foraging to a strategy rooted in deliberation and
   planning that prevented future regret-inducing change-of-mind episodes
   from occurring. These data suggest that mice are learning to avoid
   future regret, independent of and separate from reinforcement rate
   maximization.}},

Abstract = {{Overt parental restriction of food has previously been associated with
   child weight; however, most research has relied on self-reported feeding
   behaviour, or observations which give little opportunity to observe
   restriction of food. Using a novel lab-based observational technique to
   increase the opportunity to observe maternal feeding restriction, we
   explored the relationships between maternal restriction, child responses
   to restriction and child temperament with child body mass index (BMI)
   Z-scores over time. Sixty-two mother child dyads were recruited to the
   study when their children were aged 3-5 years and were followed up 2
   years later (N = 39 dyads). Families were observed during a feeding
   interaction in the laboratory where cookies were offered with the main
   meal to increase the opportunity for maternal restriction of food.
   Feeding observations were coded and child temperament and BMI were
   measured. Controlling for current child BMI Z-scores, greater maternal
   verbal and physical restriction of food at 3-5 years was related to
   higher child BMI Z-scores at 5-7 years. More emotional children were
   less likely to experience restriction and less likely to accept attempts
   to restrict their food intake. Further research should consider
   children's reactions to parental feeding behaviours in greater depth and
   explore how feeding practices interact with child temperament in the

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{140}},
Pages = {{187-197}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Animal `personality', the phenomenon of consistent individual
   differences in behaviour within populations, has been documented widely,
   yet its functional significance and the reasons for its persistence
   remain unclear. One possibility is that among-individual behavioural
   variation is linked to fitness-determining traits via effects on
   resource acquisition. In this study, we tested this idea, using rockpool
   prawns, Palaemon elegans, to test for a correlation between `high-risk
   exploration' and the ability to monopolize a limited resource. Modified
   open field trials (OFTs) confirmed that consistent among-individual
   (co)variation in high-risk exploratory behaviours does exist in this
   species, and multivariate analysis showed trait variation is consistent
   with a major axis of personality variation. Subsequent feeding trials in
   size-matched groups where competition was possible revealed a high
   repeatability of feeding duration, used here as a proxy for RHP
   (resource-holding potential). We found significant negative correlations
   between feeding duration and two `risky' behaviours, such that
   individuals that took fewer risks fed more. Our results are not
   consistent with the widely hypothesized idea of a `proactive syndrome'
   in which bolder, risk-taking personalities are positively associated
   with RHP. Rather they suggest the possibility of a trade-off, with some
   individuals successful at monopolizing limited, high-value resources,
   while others are more willing to engage in potentially risky exploration
   (which may increase the likelihood of encountering novel resource
   patches). We speculate that alternative strategies for acquiring limited
   resources might thereby contribute to the maintenance of personality
   variation observed in wild populations. (C) 2018 The Association for the

   southern Brazil}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Wild primates that live in urban areas face extreme threats that are
   less frequent in nonurban fragments, such as the presence of dangerous
   matrix elements (e.g., roads, power lines, buildings, and a high density
   of domestic dogs near food patches), that could influence their
   movements, feeding behavior, and survival. However, the scarcity of
   studies addressing this issue hinders our understanding of the
   behavioral adjustments that favor the survival of primates in urban
   areas. For 12 months, we studied a six-individual group of brown howlers
   (Alouatta guariba clamitans) in an urban fragment to determine (i) their
   diet richness and its relationships with food availability, (ii) their
   daily path length (DPL) and the matrix elements used during movement,
   and (iii) the main ecological drivers of the DPL. Sampling effort
   totaled 72 days, 787hr, and 3,224 instantaneous scans. We found that the
   diet of brown howlers contained 35 plant species (including seven
   cultivated crops) belonging to 33 genera and 21 families. The
   consumption of fruits and young leaves was directly related to their
   temporal availability. The average DPL (446m) was smaller than that
   reported for groups of howlers inhabiting large nonurban fragments. To
   move between food patches, animals used three main matrix elements:
   trees, power lines, and roofs. The number of plant species used during
   the day was the main driver of DPL. Our findings highlighted that the
   generalist-opportunistic diet of brown howlers and their ability to move
   across the anthropogenic matrix using artificial elements such as power
   lines, roofs, and wildlife crossings represent a remarkable part of
   their behavioral repertory in Lami. However, there are potential costs
   associated with these strategies, namely, electrocution and predation by
   domestic dogs. Thus, it is urgent to further investigate how these
   behaviors could affect the long-term survival of these animals.
   The brown howlers inhabited a highly disturbed area, and had a varied
   diet composed of 28 native plant species and 7 cultivated crops. The
   average daily path length (446m) was similar to that reported for groups
   inhabiting nonurban small fragments (544m), but smaller the than that
   reported for nonurban large fragments (658m). Animals used trees, power
   lines, and roofs to move between food patches and/or sleeping sites. The
   daily path length was mainly affected (directly) by the number of plant
   species used/day and, to a lesser extent, by the consumption of mature
   leaves. The potential costs associated with these behavioral strategies,
   namely, electrocution and predation by domestic dogs may be high in the
   long run.}},

Abstract = {{The ideal free distribution assumes that animals select habitats that

   influences on the fitness of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus
   caribou), a threatened, wide-ranging herbivore. We combined established
   methods of fitting resource and step selection functions derived from
   locations of collared animals in Ontario with newer techniques,
   including identifying calf status from video collar footage and seasonal
   habitat selection analysis through latent selection difference
   functions. We found that females with calves avoided predation risk and
   proximity to roads more strongly than females without calves within
   their seasonal ranges. At the local scale, females with calves avoided
   predation more strongly than females without calves. Females with calves
   increased predation avoidance but not selection for food availability
   upon calving, whereas females without calves increased selection for
   food availability across the same season. These behavioral responses
   suggest that habitat selection by woodland caribou is influenced by
   reproductive state, such that females with calves at heel use habitat
   selection to offset the increased vulnerability of their offspring to

Abstract = {{To preserve biodiversity, identifying at-risk populations and developing

   non-native fish species than during the 1970s. Large sunfish and
   non-native fish are relatively rare in the drying pools of Everglades

   provide alternative foraging habitat when prey availability is reduced

Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1631-1643}},

Abstract = {{1. Prey responses to predation risk can affect multiple phenotypic
   traits that have significant implications for
   population-to-ecosystem-level properties. The general stress paradigm
   (hereafter GSP) proposes integrating the principles of ecological
   stoichiometry and prey physiological plasticity in response to predation
   risk to provide an explicit mechanistic framework to evaluate the direct
   influence of predation risk on ecosystem functioning.
   2. However, theoretical attempts evaluating the GSP have focused on only
   one component of phenotypic plasticity, neglecting the fact that
   multiple phenotypic responses can affect nutrient demand and
   consumption, and therefore, the overall animal effect on nutrient
   cycling rates and stoichiometry.
   3. In this study, we used a dynamic state variable model to examine how
   variation in predation and starvation risk on a landscape of patch types
   that vary in food quality affects the behavioural and physiological
   phenotypic responses of prey and the linked nutrient and carbon
   recycling.
   4. We found that the stress imposed by predation risk promotes prey
   carbon limitation, which leads to increased nutrient release and carbon
   uptake due to a stoichiometric mismatch between an animal's demand and
   food stoichiometry. Such effects can be altered by prey shifting
   spatially to carbon- or nutrient-rich patches. However, the abilities of
   prey to cope with new physiological demands can be affected by absolute
   stress level or the predation risk distribution on a spatially implicit
   landscape of stoichiometric-divergent patch type availability. Overall,
   starvation risk can act as a selective force favouring individuals that
   maximize their growth, thus reducing their nutrient release, but
   increasing their exposure to predation risk.
   5. Our results provide an important connection between predator-induced
   stress ecology and ecosystem functioning, linking organism nutrition and
   ecological stoichiometry to fitness outcomes, thus improving our
   understanding of how non-consumptive predator effects can scale up to
   ecosystems.}},

   duration longer than 1 year (n = 82), while children in Fangshan County
   served as a control group with duration less than 1 year (n = 30) or a
   control group with duration longer than 1 year (n = 78).
   Methods: The control group received national public health services
   (NPHS), while the intervention group received NPHS plus comprehensive
   interventions covering health, nutrition, early psychosocial
   stimulation, and child protection. Home environment (Infant-Toddler Home
   Observation for Measurement of the Environment {[}HOME]) and child
   neurodevelopment (Ages and Stages Questionnaire {[}ASQ]) were measured
   by observation and interview with mothers after the intervention
   program.
   Results: The intervention group showed significantly higher overall
   HOME, organization, learning materials, and involvement than the control
   group, only for a duration longer than 1 year. Children in the
   intervention group performed better in overall ASQ, fine motor,
   problem-solving, and personal-social than children in the control group.
   Moderated mediation analyses indicated that there were significantly
   indirect effects of treatment on overall ASQ through overall HOME,
   organization, and involvement only when the duration was longer than 1
   year.
   Conclusions: Early comprehensive interventions longer than 1 year
   improve home environment and promote child neurodevelopment among
   children younger than 3 years in poor rural areas. What is more, effects
   of early comprehensive interventions longer than 1 year on child
   neurodevelopment were mediated by home environment. (c) 2018 The Royal

Abstract = {{Obesity is a major risk factor for many diseases in children.
   Considering the widespread pandemic of pediatric obesity, developing
   more strategies for life style management of this disorder is essential.
   Therefore it was decided to conduct a more comprehensive study for
   prevention and treatment children obesity based on Traditional Persian
   Medicine (TPM). In this review we searched the most important TPM
   textbooks (such as Al-Havi, Al-qanun fit-tib, Kamel al Sanaeh),
   Classical Medicine (CM) text book (Krause's Food and the Nutrition Care
   Process), and scientific databases such as Data sources included
   (Medline, Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar) the period from 2000 to 2017
   in terms of obesity management. The keywords Saman Mofrat,
   Setteh-e-Zarurieah, lifestyle, pediatric, children and obesity have been
   used in this search.
   Based on TPM the six essential principles (Setteh-e-Zarurieah) must be
   observed in management of pediatric obesity that these essential factors
   are as follows: air, food and drink, sleep and wakefulness, evacuation
   and retention, body movement, mental movement and repose. Unhealthy
   lifestyle for example irregular sleep, constipation, overeating and
   wrong nutritional habits, insufficient physical activity, and emotional
   excitement, such as sadness and anxiety are plays an important role in
   obesity that confirmed by classical medicine. Moreover, TPM has a
   particular attention to the type of nutrients and their temperament and
   the children's digestion ability. So, further clinical trials should be
   performed to confirm the long-term efficacy of healthy lifestyle in
   pediatric obesity management.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},

Abstract = {{Inducible behavioral defenses against predators, and how environmental
   factors mediate such responses, have been the focus of behavioral
   ecological research for decades. However, results often remained
   contradictory, perhaps because the ontogenetic context was ignored.
   Here, we investigated how antipredator behavioral responses of common
   toad (Bufo bufo) tadpoles are affected by food limitation and how the
   mediated responses changed during larval development. We raised tadpoles
   in the presence or absence of chemical cues indicating predation risk,
   combined with low or high food levels, and repeatedly monitored tadpole
   activity and visibility. We found that the presence of cues indicating
   predation risk and resource availability interactively affected
   visibility, but not relative activity, and this interactive effect
   changed with time over the larval period. Visibility of tadpoles
   decreased with time but to a greater extent when tadpoles were exposed
   to cues indicating predation risk compared to control groups, and this
   difference was more expressed when food was limited. Activity of
   tadpoles also decreased during larval development but to a greater
   extent in case of tadpoles raised in resource-limited environment
   compared to the other treatments. Also, activity of tadpoles was higher
   when food was scarce; however, the magnitude of this effect was not
   influenced by the predator-cue treatment. Thus, in addition to
   describing the trajectories of ontogenetic changes in tadpole behavior,
   our study also demonstrated that responses to environmental factors,
   such as predation threat and food availability, vary with age.
   Antipredator behavior is a common phenomenon in nature, and its
   expression is known to be influenced by the amount of available
   resources. How such defensive responses change with age, however, has
   been studied barely. By repeatedly observing common toad (Bufo bufo)
   tadpoles exposed to predators and/or food limitation, we found that
   tadpoles' activity and visibility decreased with age and did so to a
   greater extent when tadpoles were exposed to chemical cues indicating
   predation risk compared to control groups. Our study demonstrated how
   responses to environmental factors, such as predation threat and food
   availability, vary with age in an important amphibian model species.
   These results draw attention to the importance of considering age when
   studying behavioral responses to environmental change and provide a
   possible explanation for some inconsistencies in the relevant
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{Considering that obesity is one of the leading risks for death
   worldwide, it should be noted that a brain-related mechanism is involved
   in AngII-induced and AT(1)-receptor-dependent weight loss. It is
   moreover established that activation of the Ang(1-7)/ACE2/Mas axis
   reduces weight, but it remains unclear whether this Ang(1-7) effect is
   also mediated via a brain-related mechanism. Additionally to Sprague
   Dawley (SD) rats, we used TGR(ASrAOGEN) selectively lacking brain
   angiotensinogen, the precursor to AngII, as we speculated that effects
   are more pronounced in a model with low brain RAS activity. Rats were
   fed with high-calorie cafeteria diet. We investigated weight regulation,
   food behavior, and energy balance in response to chronic icv.-infusions
   of AngII (200 ng.h(-1)), or Ang(1-7) (200/600 ng.h(-1)) or artificial
   cerebrospinal fluid. High- but not low-dose Ang(1-7) slightly decreased
   weight gain and energy intake in SD rats. AngII showed an anti-obese
   efficacy in SD rats by decreasing energy intake and increasing energy
   expenditure and also improved glucose control. TGR(ASrAOGEN) were
   protected from developing obesity. However, Ang(1-7) did not reveal any
   effects in TGR(ASrAOGEN) and those of AngII were minor compared to SD
   rats. Our results emphasize that brain AngII is a key contributor for
   regulating energy homeostasis and weight in obesity by serving as a
   negative brain-related feedback signal to alleviate weight gain.
   Brain-related anti-obese potency of Ang(1-7) is lower than AngII but
   must be further investigated by using other transgenic models as
   TGR(ASrAOGEN) proved to be less valuable for answering this question.}},

Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},

Volume = {{189}},
Pages = {{59-63}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Preclinical pain assessments can be criticized for failing to adequately
   characterize the human clinical pain experience. Although recent
   assessments have improved upon this shortcoming, there are still
   significant limitations. One concern is that current procedures fail to
   examine underlying motivational drives related to pain. Therefore, we
   used a novel approach-avoidance paradigm that allowed a rat to either
   satisfy hunger or avoid noxious stimulation to reveal prioritizing of
   motivational drives. The operant paradigm utilized a single lever that
   the animal pressed for appetitive reward (approach). The lever press was
   associated with mechanical stimulation of an inflamed paw induced by
   subcutaneous injection of carrageenan (avoidance). The results revealed
   that carrageenan-injected animals had a significant suppression of lever
   pressing and, in addition, had a longer latency to approach and press a
   lever for appetitive reward. The pattern of operant behavioral responses
   indicates that the motivation to avoid pain superseded the motivation to
   alleviate hunger. Utilization of approach-avoidance paradigms, such as
   this one, can allow researchers to unravel the complexities of the pain
   experience with the goal of enhancing translation to clinical efficacy.}},

Title = {{Dietary challenges differentially affect activity and sleep/wake

   diet/energy balance and body weight}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Background and aims
   Associated with numerous metabolic and behavioral abnormalities, obesity
   is classified by metrics reliant on body weight (such as body mass
   index). However, overnutrition is the common cause of obesity, and may
   independently contribute to these obesity-related abnormalities. Here,
   we use dietary challenges to parse apart the relative influence of diet
   and/or energy balance from body weight on various metabolic and
   behavioral outcomes.
   Materials and methods
   Seventy male mice (mus musculus) were subjected to the diet switch
   feeding paradigm, generating groups with various body weights and
   energetic imbalances. Spontaneous activity patterns, blood metabolite
   levels, and unbiased gene expression of the nutrient-sensing ventral
   hypothalamus (using RNA-sequencing) were measured, and these metrics
   were compared using standardized multivariate linear regression models.
   Results
   Spontaneous activity patterns were negatively related to body weight
   (p<0.0001) but not diet/energy balance (p = 0.63). Both body weight and
   diet/energy balance predicted circulating glucose and insulin levels,
   while body weight alone predicted plasma leptin levels. Regarding gene
   expression within the ventral hypothalamus, only two genes responded to
   diet/energy balance (neuropeptide y{[}npy] and agouti-related peptide
   {[}agrp]), while others were related only to body weight.
   Conclusions
   Collectively, these results demonstrate that individual components of
   obesity-specifically obesogenic diets/energy imbalance and elevated body
   mass-can have independent effects on metabolic and behavioral outcomes.
   This work highlights the shortcomings of using body mass-based indices
   to assess metabolic health, and identifies novel associations between
   blood biomarkers, neural gene expression, and animal behavior following
   dietary challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Type 2 diabetes mellitus studies focus on metabolic
   indicators and different self-reported lifestyle or care behaviors.
   Self-reported instruments involve conscious process therefore responses
   might not reflect reality. Meanwhile implicit responses involve
   automatic, unconscious processes underlying social judgments and
   behavior. No studies have explored the combined influence of both
   metabolic indicators and implicit responses on lifestyle practices in
   type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. The purpose was to investigate the
   explained variance of socio-demographic, metabolic, anthropometric,
   clinical, psychosocial, cognitive, and lifestyle variables on glycemic
   status and on the ability to adapt to changing demands in people with
   and without type 2 diabetes mellitus in Monterrey, Mexico.
   Methods: Adults with (n=30, mean age 46.90 years old, 33.33\% male) and
   without (n=32, mean age: 41.69 years old, 21.87\% male) type 2 diabetes
   mellitus were studied. Glycemic status was assessed using Bio-Rad D-10
   Hemoglobin A1c Program, which uses ion-exchange high-performance
   chromatography. Stroop 2 test was used to assess the ability to changing
   demands.
   Results: In participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus, less years of
   education, negative self-actualization, and higher levels of cholesterol
   and triglycerides explained more than 50\% of the variance in glycemic
   status. In participants without type 2 diabetes mellitus, the variance
   (38.7\%) was explained by total cholesterol, metabolic syndrome,
   high-density lipoprotein, and self-actualization scores; the latter in
   opposite direction. The ability to adapt to changing demands was
   explained by total cholesterol, malondialdehyde, insulin resistance, and
   triglycerides. In participants without type 2 diabetes mellitus, the
   contributing variables were metabolic syndrome and nutrition scores.
   Conclusion: Results showed significant effect on at least one of the
   following variables (socio-demographic, metabolic, or lifestyle
   subscale) on glycemic status in people with and without type 2 diabetes
   mellitus. The ability to adapt to changing demands was explained by
   metabolic variables but only in participants without type 2 diabetes
   mellitus. Preference for unhealthy behaviors (implicit or automatic
   responses) outweighs healthy lifestyle practices in people with and
   without type 2 diabetes mellitus.}},

Abstract = {{Life history theory emphasizes the importance of trade-offs in how time

   importance of resource acquisition over resource allocation to explain
   geographic variation in fecundity, parental care, and offspring

Abstract = {{Environmental enrichment is a tool used to promote the welfare and
   well-being of captive animals by encouraging the display of
   species-specific behaviors and reducing the stress or boredom induced by
   captive environments. Lemurs are highly endangered, yet few studies have
   analyzed the behavioral impacts of enrichment on captive populations. We
   studied the impacts of two novel enrichment devices on three lemur
   species (ring-tailed lemurs {[}Lemur catta], red-ruffed lemurs
   {[}Varecia rubra], and Coquerel's sifaka {[}Propithecus coquereli]) to
   determine both the overall and species-specific impacts of enrichment on
   lemur behavior. We recorded lemur behavior using the continuous sampling
   method to obtain behavior duration and analyzed our results using ANOVA
   Repeated Measures. Results showed enrichment effectiveness differed for
   each species and that different enrichment devices had varying impacts
   on lemur behavior across all species. We attributed the differences in
   species-specific responses to the unique locomotor patterns and methods
   of diet acquisition of each species, and the variances in behavioral
   responses across all species to the characteristics of each device. Our
   study highlights the importance of species-specific enrichment and

Abstract = {{Cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Diet, nutrition,
   physical inactivity, and obesity have been identified as important
   contributors to the increasing cancer incidence worldwide. To
   effectively plan interventions to reduce cancer incidence and to
   influence the public's decisions regarding health behaviors, it is
   important for professionals to have an understanding of the ways in
   which people understand risk with regard to development of cancer.
   Selecting an appropriate method to evaluate awareness of cancer risk is
   an important consideration. Quantitative approaches such as surveys may
   be used to investigate awareness of risk, and recall of risk factors as
   well as recognition of such factors may form part of such assessments.
   Such quantitative methods may be used to evaluate risk in different
   demographic groups, as well as to examine the link between risk factors
   and behavior. Qualitative approaches include in-depth interviews, focus
   groups, and open-ended survey items and may be used to explain findings
   derived using quantitative methods. Mixed methods approaches may also be
   employed, involving use of a survey as well as interviews or focus
   groups to gather in-depth information. Assessment of awareness of cancer
   risk using an appropriate method has important implications for
   educators, as professionals must evaluate understanding of risk factors
   and tailor messages accordingly for educational programs. Ongoing
   evaluation of awareness is a key part of determining the effectiveness
   of education initiatives and identifying new and emerging issues.}},

Pages = {{30-37}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Noisy human activities such as helicopter traffic may affect physiology
   and behaviour of wild animals. Since chronic behavioural modifications
   can ultimately alter reproductive success and population dynamics,
   studying the response of different taxa and species to human-induced
   disturbance in different habitats is paramount. The present study
   analysed data collected from 10 male Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) monitored
   with GPS collars to assess their response to disturbance caused by
   helicopter overflights. We compared ibex activity levels in the hours
   before and after 34 helicopter overflights during the summer of 2013 in
   Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy), a protected area that is essential
   for the conservation of Alpine ibex. The behaviour of Alpine ibex was
   affected both during and after helicopter overflights: compared to the
   average activity levels in the hours before the disturbance event,
   activity increased during the disturbance and decreased during the hour
   following the overflights. The reduction in activity persisted over the
   whole day of the helicopter disturbance and finally went back to normal
   levels during the following day. There was no evidence of habituation to
   the disturbance throughout the study period. The prolonged behavioural
   response to the disturbance suggests that frequent helicopter
   overflights may ultimately affect the ibex's body conditions, as well as
   the life-history traits of a population. These findings highlight the
   importance of considering medium and long-term behavioural responses in
   assessing disturbance-related effects on wildlife populations. (C) 2018

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In a physical model of a thin planktonic layer, the estuarine copepod
   Acartia tonsa strongly avoided weakly stratified layers of dissolved
   chemical compounds from the harmful dinoflagellate Karenia brevis.
   Chemical-induced changes in swimming kinematics allowed copepods to
   effectively avoid the layer and surrounding volume, highlighting the
   relevance of harmful alga-grazer interactions at a distance that involve
   dissolved chemical signals. Avoidance increased significantly with
   increasing chemical concentration representative of a range of
   ecologically relevant bloom conditions (1-10(4) cells/mL equivalent).
   Under mid to maximal bloom conditions, Acartia displayed visually and
   hydrodynamically conspicuous avoidance jumps featuring large, rapid
   displacements with swimming speeds near those reported for predatory
   escape reactions. Previous findings show K. brevis is both toxic and
   nutritionally inadequate to A. tonsa when ingested and that exposure to
   dissolved chemical compounds likely rapidly suppresses effective
   sampling and grazing behaviors. Thus, copepods have strong incentive to
   sense and avoid nearby, spatially discrete patches of toxic algae in
   order to improve fitness by avoiding exposure and/or ingestion and
   associated negative impacts. Our results suggest harmful alga not only
   produce deleterious physiological effects in copepod grazers, but
   chemical-induced behavioral responses also likely alter grazer
   distributions and top-down control via avoidance reactions (reduced
   harmful alga-grazer encounter rates). Additionally, predator-prey
   encounter rates at higher trophic levels are likely enhanced via
   significant changes in copepod swimming kinematics. These combined
   mechanisms could protect and sustain harmful blooms contained in
   subsurface thin layers until blooms reach critical mass and produce
   widespread impacts at the ecosystem level, the ``cryptic bloom{''}
   effect.}},

Abstract = {{Why are some individuals more prone to gamble than others? Animals often
   show preferences between 2 foraging options with the same mean reward
   but different degrees of variability in the reward, and such risk
   preferences vary between individuals. Previous attempts to explain
   variation in risk preference have focused on energy budgets, but with
   limited empirical support. Here, we consider whether biological ageing,
   which affects mortality and residual reproductive value, predicts risk
   preference. We studied a cohort of European starlings (Stumus vulgaris)
   in which we had previously measured developmental erythrocyte telomere
   attrition, an established integrative biomarker of biological ageing. We
   measured the adult birds' preferences when choosing between a fixed
   amount of food and a variable amount with an equal mean. After
   controlling for change in body weight during the experiment (a proxy for
   energy budget), we found that birds that had undergone greater
   developmental telomere attrition were more risk averse as adults than
   were those whose telomeres had shortened less as nestlings.
   Developmental telomere attrition was a better predictor of adult risk
   preference than either juvenile telomere length or early-life food
   supply and begging effort. Our longitudinal study thus demonstrates that
   biological ageing, as measured via developmental telomere attrition, is
   an important source of lasting differences in adult risk preferences.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality and behavioral syndromes can have profound effects on
   individual fitness. Consequently, there is growing recognition that
   knowledge of these phenomena may assist with animal conservation. Here
   we review evidence for personality and behavioral syndromes in
   amphibians (the most threatened vertebrate class), critique experimental
   approaches, and explore whether knowledge in this domain might assist
   with endangered species management. Despite being a neglected field
   (research has spanned just 24 species), there is emerging evidence that
   frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts show personality and behavioral
   syndromes along three behavioral axes: boldness, exploration, and
   activity. Among vertebrates, amphibians are unique in having a biphasic
   lifecycle defined by metamorphosis and obvious transformations in
   morphology, physiology, and habitat use, characteristics that enable
   detailed examination of behavioral changes across life stages and
   ecological contexts. Accordingly, recent work has started to make
   important contributions to our understanding of the development and
   proximate causes of personality and behavioral syndromes, with some
   emerging evidence for ontogenetic stability, genetic control, and
   state-dependent personality. To date, however, no study has considered
   the conservation implications of personality for amphibians. Drawing on
   a conceptual framework and empirical literature for all vertebrates, we
   argue that there is considerable potential for knowledge of animal
   personality to improve amphibian conservation programs. We propose a
   novel paradigm to improve (i) the mating and reproductive success of
   captive animals by ensuring that breeding pairs are behaviorally
   compatible and (ii) the post-reintroduction survival and reproductive
   potential of animals by facilitating the selection of optimal behavioral
   types for release.
   Significance statement
   Animal personality and behavioral syndromes appear to be widespread in
   nature. Here, we review animal personality and behavioral syndromes in
   amphibians, an understudied taxonomic group within the field. We
   summarize evidence, critique methodological approaches used, and
   emphasize that the unique behavioral ecology of amphibians makes them a
   model group for studying the proximate causes and ecological
   consequences of personality and behavioral syndromes. We also highlight
   that knowledge of these phenomena may have significant conservation
   implications for amphibian captive breeding and reintroduction programs.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Outdoor free play is important for preschoolers' physical
   activity, health, and development. Certain temperamental characteristics
   are associated with obesity, nutrition, and sedentary behaviors in
   preschoolers, but the relationship between temperament and outdoor play
   has not been examined. This study examined whether there is an
   association between temperament and outdoor play in young children.
   METHODS: Healthy children aged 1 to 5 years recruited to The Applied
   Research Group for Kids (TARGet Kids!), a community-based primary care
   research network, from July 2008 to September 2013 were included.
   Parent-reported child temperament was assessed using the Childhood
   Behavior Questionnaire. Outdoor free play and other potential
   confounding variables were assessed through validated questionnaires.
   Multivariable linear regression was used to determine the association
   between temperament and outdoor play, adjusted for potential
   confounders.
   RESULTS: There were 3393 children with data on outdoor play. The
   association between negative affectivity and outdoor play was moderated
   by sex; in boys, for every 1-point increase in negative affectivity
   score, mean outdoor play decreased by 4.7 minutes per day. There was no
   significant association in girls. Surgency was associated with outdoor
   play; for every 1-point increase in surgency/extraversion, outdoor play
   increased by 4.6 minutes per day.
   CONCLUSIONS: Young children's temperamental characteristics were
   associated with their participation in outdoor free play. Consideration
   of temperament could enhance interventions and strategies to increase
   outdoor play in young children. Longitudinal studies are needed to
   elucidate the relationship between children's early temperament and
   physical activity.}},

Abstract = {{The predation pressure and food availability to which individuals are
   exposed during their life histories shape inspection behaviour in
   animals. In this study, we aimed to test whether such behaviours varied
   with prior experience (predation, starvation or both treatments) or
   measurement condition (with or without the presence of a predator; here,
   the snakehead fish, Channa argus) in the fish species Spinibarbus
   sinensis, known as qingbo. Unexpectedly, prior predator experience
   showed no significant effect on inspection behaviour as demonstrated by
   either the frequency or the duration of each activity outside shelter or
   on cooperation as demonstrated by the inter-individual distance or
   synchronization of speed. This may have been due to the different
   adjustments in behaviour among individuals (more shelter use vs. more
   inspection), the predator treatment used in the present study (exposure
   to caged predator rather than direct predation) and/or a
   species-specific strategy in the qingbo. The starved fish displayed
   shorter inspection latency, increased inspection behaviour and greater
   cooperation when measured without the predator; however, when measured
   in the presence of the predator, the starved fish showed increased
   inspection frequency but shorter inspection duration, possibly due to
   the compromise between energy needs and predation risk. Similar to those
   of the predation group, the fish from the double-treated group showed no
   difference in inspection behaviour compared to the control group under
   the predator-absent condition, while the high-frequency, short-duration
   inspection behaviours remained the same as in the starved group. These
   findings suggested that the adjustment of inspection behaviour and
   related cooperation are rather complicated according to either predator
   experience or food deprivation, partially due to the inter-individual
   differences in behavioural adjustment and/or different environmental

Abstract = {{Individuals frequently show long-term consistency in behaviour over

   around the use of resources and how they are valued by individuals,
   attempt to explain the maintenance of these different behavioural types

   the evolution of behavioural variation. The pace-of-life syndrome
   hypothesis suggests that differences in personalities result from
   divergent life-history strategies, with more active/risk-taking
   individuals reproducing rapidly but dying young. However, studies of
   wild animals provide only limited support for key elements of this and
   related hypotheses, such as a negative relationship between residual
   reproductive value and activity. Furthermore, alternative models make
   divergent predictions regarding the relationship between risk-taking
   behaviours and variables consistent in the short-term, such as
   condition. To test these predictions, we regularly measured willingness
   to leave a shelter and the activity level of wild adult field crickets
   (Gryllus campestris) at both short and long intervals over their entire
   adult lives. We found some support for a pace-of-life syndrome
   influencing personality, as lifespan was negatively related to
   willingness to leave the shelter and activity. Crickets did not appear
   to protect their assets however, as estimates of residual reproductive
   value were not related to behaviour. Although there was considerable
   variance attributed to the short-term consistency, neither trait was
   affected by phenotypic condition, failing to support either of the
   models we tested. Our study confirms that behaviours may covary with
   some life-history traits and highlights the scales of temporal

Abstract = {{Plasticity, the capacity of an organism to respond to its environment,
   is thought to evolve through changes in development altering the
   integration of environmental cues. In polyphenism, a discontinuous
   plastic response produces two or more phenotypic morphs. Here we
   describe evolutionary change in wing polyphenism and its underlying
   developmental regulation in natural populations of the red-shouldered
   soapberry bug, Jadera haematoloma (Insecta: Hemiptera: Rhopalidae) that
   have adapted to a novel host plant. We find differences in the fecundity
   of morphs in both sexes and in adult expression of insulin signaling
   components in the gonads. Further, the plastic response of
   ancestral-state bugs can be shifted to resemble the reaction norm of
   derived bugs by the introduction of exogenous insulin or RNA
   interference targeting the insulin signaling component encoded by FoxO.
   These results suggest that insulin signaling may be one pathway involved

Abstract = {{Metabolic flexibility is defined as the ability to adapt substrate
   oxidation rates in response to changes in fuel availability. The
   inability to switch between the oxidation of lipid and carbohydrate
   appears to be an important feature of chronic disorders such as obesity
   and type 2 diabetes. Laboratory assessment of metabolic flexibility has
   traditionally involved measurement of the respiratory quotient (RQ) by
   indirect calorimetry during the fasted to fed transition (e.g. mixed
   meal challenge) or during a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. Under
   these controlled experimental conditions, metabolic inflexibility' is
   characterized by lower fasting fat oxidation (higher fasting RQ) and/or
   an impaired ability to oxidize carbohydrate during feeding or
   insulin-stimulated conditions (lower postprandial or clamp RQ). This
   experimental paradigm has provided fundamental information regarding the
   role of substrate oxidation in the development of obesity and insulin
   resistance. However, the key determinants of metabolic flexibility among
   relevant clinical populations remain unclear. Herein, we propose that
   habitual physical activity levels are a primary determinant of metabolic
   flexibility. We present evidence demonstrating that high levels of
   physical activity predict metabolic flexibility, while physical
   inactivity and sedentary behaviours trigger a state of metabolic
   inflexibility', even among individuals who meet physical activity
   recommendations. Furthermore, we describe alternative experimental
   approaches to studying the concept of metabolic flexibility across a
   range of activity and inactivity. Finally, we address the promising use
   of strategies that aim to reduce sedentary behaviours as therapy to
   improve metabolic flexibility and reduce weight gain risk.}},

Abstract = {{In behavioral ecology, state-dependent models are frequently used for

   and mating success (N = 204). We found that exposure to conflict is
   related to a fast life-history personality profile: lower Honesty,
   Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, followed by higher Extraversion.
   Furthermore, interaction effects showed that high Extraversion and low
   Emotionality are related to higher mating success, but only in a harsh

   density using 1 of 3 potential competitors: feeding conspecifics,
   feeding heterospecifics, and non-feeding heterospecifics. We
   hypothesized that feeding competitors would induce a morphological
   response similar to limiting food, while the effect of non-feeders would
   depend on whether larvae respond directly to higher density or
   indirectly to food reduction. Plutei cultured with limited food grew
   longer feeding arms and shorter stomachs, though only in higher density
   treatments. Whereas the response to food involved a tradeoff between
   skeleton and stomach growth, larvae responded to high density by in
   creasing in vestment in both, reflecting a more complex set of energetic
   tradeoffs. Similar responses to the presence of feeding and non-feeding
   larvae implicate a sensory mechanism involving signals from potential
   competitors rather than a food decline. Patterns in 2 literature surveys
   of laboratory experiments and field studies suggest that culture density
   is a critical but neglected aspect of experimental design in the study
   of early life-history stages. Larvae are most likely exposed to
   densities sufficient to induce plasticity following synchronous
   spawning, highlighting the importance of natural history in
   understanding density-dependent effects on developmental plasticity.}},

Title = {{Transcriptional responses of attractin gene in the mosquito Anopheles
   culicifacies: A synergistic neuro-olfactory regulation}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Attractin, is a large multi-domain protein
   which has regulatory functions in multiple physiological processes and
   thus have strong therapeutic potential. In invertebrates, it was first
   identified as a water-borne protein pheromone that plays important role
   in chemical communication and coordinates reproductive activities. But
   its role in mosquitoes/insects remains unknown. Our unexpected discovery
   of attractin homolog from the olfactory tissue of Anopheles culicifacies
   mosquito prompted us to investigate the possible role of Ac-attractin
   (Ac-atrn) in diverse behavioural responses, e.g. feeding, mating and
   other non-genetic stresses.
   Methods: A homology search analysis was performed to identify the full
   length attractin (Ac-atrn) gene of Anopheles culicifacies mosquito. To
   unravel its molecular function during external and internal stresses,
   extensive real-time PCR was performed in the neuro-olfactory tissues of
   the adult mosquitoes as well as in the larval stages. Further, a
   behavioural assay was conducted to elucidate its role in mosquitoes
   mating behaviour.
   Results: The results indicated that Ac-atrn is a 3942 bp long transcript
   which encodes a 1313 amino acid protein, having multiple domains
   including CUB, EGF, Keltch, etc, with 80-90\% homology to other
   insect/mosquito homologs. Ac-atrn gene was dominantly expressed in the
   young larvae and its expression was elevated in response to the fresh
   food supply in the starved larvae. Cold stress temporarily arrested the
   expression of Ac-atrn gene. In case of adult mosquitoes, olfactory and
   brain tissue showed relatively higher expression of Ac-atrn than
   reproductive organs. Although, starvation did not yield significant
   changes in olfactory tissues, but aging and nutritional stress modulated
   Ac-atrn expression in the brain tissue. Furthermore, a circadian rhythm
   dependent change in the expression of Ac-atrn of virgin and mated
   mosquitoes (both sexes), indicates that Ac-atrn might also have a
   pheromone guided role during swarm formation and mating behaviour.
   Interpretation \& conclusion: The relative expression profiling of
   Ac-atrn gene in the larvae during nutritional and cold stress suggested
   its possible role in mediating chemical communication towards the food
   source and in thermal regulation of young larvae. Similarly, it might
   have crucial regulatory role in the stress management and survival of
   adult mosquitoes. The results revealed that Ac-atrn gene is a global
   regulator of many physiological processes in mosquitoes including stress
   response and mating behaviour and thus might be a potential target to
   design novel intervention strategy against mosquitoes.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Incorporation of young people to higher education implies
   the emancipation of the family home, some to share a flat with other
   students or to live in university residences. This fact can influence at
   behavioral level (identity and personality) and health. Specifically,
   social and academic factors can be related to diet in this stage. This
   study aims to describe the level of adherence to the Mediterranean Diet
   (MD) and its association with social and academic factors in a sample of
   Spanish university students, as well as to determine the relationship
   between level of adherence to MD and sex, place of residence, degree and
   religious tendency.
   Material and Methods: This descriptive and cross-sectional study was
   carried out with a sample composed by 597 university students aged
   between 17 and 20 years old (M=19.04; DT=2.71), where 156 were men
   (26.1\%) and 441 women (73.9\%) from the province of Granada and the
   transboundary cities of Ceuta and Melilla. The Questionnaire of
   Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and an ad hoc questionnaire for
   social factors were used to assess the variables for this study. It was
   assessed the prevalence of MD and its association with socio-academic
   factors using a binary logistic regression.
   Results: The results showed that a 70\% of the subjects presented a high
   adherence to MD and a 63.8\% live in their family home. It was shown
   that students living in cross-border cities (Ceuta and Melilla) had
   three times more risk of having a worse adherence to MD than those of
   the peninsula. No differences were found in the dietary pattern
   according to sex, scope of knowledge, domicile or religious tendency.
   Conclusions: It is shown that the quality of the dietary pattern of
   Spanish university students varies according to social factors, such as
   the place of residence and the university campus.}},

   availability (brine shrimp), presence of chemosensory predator cues
   (adult crayfish and odonate larvae), and conspecific density (2 verses 1
   larvae) were applied to determine the effects on the duration of time in
   substrates following hatch and growth from hatch until emergence. In
   spring 2010, larvae from two full-sib families were individually placed
   into 240 mL perforated plastic containers (n = 263) with gravel
   substrate immediately following hatch. Containers were maintained in
   stream water at ambient temperatures and constant flow (similar to 0.03
   m/sec) in 4 m experimental flowing streams. Duration of time (days) each
   individual remained in the substrate was recorded. Morphological traits
   including total length (mm), body area (mm(2)), and yolk-sac area
   (mm(2)) were measured at hatch and at the time of emergence from
   substrate to compare growth and amount of endogenous yolk reserves used
   in individuals among experimental treatments. Environmental conditions
   significantly affected emergence time. Individuals emerged earlier in
   treatments exposing larvae to chemosensory predator odorants and higher
   conspecific density. Use of endogenous reserves (yolk-sac area) at the

   significantly greater when individuals were provided a food source

Abstract = {{Compared with adults, adolescent behavior is often characterized by
   reduced behavioral flexibility, increased sensitivity to reward, and

   hypothesized to confer heightened vulnerability to psychopathologies
   such as substance use disorders (SUDs), have been the focus of studies
   in laboratory animal models that seek to understand their neural
   underpinnings. However, rodent studies to date have typically used only
   males and have adopted standard methodological practices (e.g., weight
   loss inducing food restriction) that are likely to have a disparate
   impact on adolescents compared with adults. Here, we used adolescent and
   adult Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes to study instrumental behavior
   tasks that assess behavioral flexibility (strategy shifting and reversal
   learning; Experiment 1), sensitivity to reward value (outcome
   devaluation; Experiment 2), and risky decision making (probability
   discounting; Experiment 3). In Experiment 1, we found that adolescents
   were faster to acquire reversal learning than adults but there were no
   differences in strategy shifting. In Experiments 2 and 3, adolescents
   and adults were equally sensitive to changes in reward value and
   exhibited similar reductions in preference for a large reward when
   reinforcement probability was decreased. However, adolescents responded
   more efficiently and earned reinforcers at a higher rate than their
   same-sex, adult counterparts. Together, these findings provide only
   limited support for the existence of an ``adolescent-typical{''}

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Picky eating is common in children. Few studies have
   examined predictors of picky eating, and the association of picky eating
   with weight status and dietary quality is inconsistent in the
   literature. We aimed to identify predictors of picky eating and to test
   the association of picky eating with child body mass index z-score
   (BMIz), dietary quality, and micronutrient intake.
   METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a
   randomized controlled trial to prevent obesity among 506 preschoolers
   attending Head Start. Parents completed questionnaires to assess picky
   eating and child temperament. Three 24-hour dietary recalls were
   collected to assess dietary intake. Multivariate regression models
   assessed child, parent, and family predictors of picky eating;
   additional models tested adjusted associations of picky eating with
   child BMIz, dietary quality (measured using the Healthy Eating
   Index-2010), and micronutrient intake.
   RESULTS: Picky eating was predicted by male sex, older child age, and
   more difficult temperament but not race/ethnicity, maternal body mass
   index, maternal depressive symptoms, household food insecurity, or
   single parent home. Picky eating was not associated with child BMIz or
   micronutrient deficiencies; it was inversely associated with total
   Healthy Eating Index-2010 score and servings of whole fruit, total
   vegetables, greens and beans, and total protein foods.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric providers should support parents in expanding the
   number of healthy foods the child eats to improve dietary quality, but
   reassure parents that picky eating is not associated with children's
   weight status or micronutrient deficiencies.}},

Abstract = {{Mortality through predation is often selective, particularly at
   life-history bottlenecks. While many studies have looked at the
   importance for survival of specific prey characteristics in isolation,
   few have looked at a broad array of attributes and how they relate to
   survival in a realistic context.
   Our study measures 18 morphological, performance and behavioural traits
   of a juvenile damselfish that have been hypothesized as important for
   prey survival, and examines how they relate to survival in the field
   immediately after settlement. These attributes included size, relative
   false eye-spot size, fast-start escape response kinematics, thigmotaxis,
   laterality, and space use and activity in the field.
   Using conditional inference trees, we identify the most important
   drivers out of a reduced suite of 13 characters. Fast-start response
   latency, boldness, feeding rates and two measures of activity were found
   to significantly contribute to survival. Morphological variables and
   most laboratory measures of performance appeared to contribute little to
   survival.
   Results suggest selection works on a suite of characters associated with
   boldness. Bold and active fish are those that will be best able to learn
   using public information, but because of the relative naivete of newly
   metamorphosed fishes, speed to react to a strike from an unknown
   predator is of critical importance.
   Findings substantiate the ecomorphological paradigm by suggesting that
   selection on behaviour modifies the correlations of morphological and
   performance variables with survival probabilities, since behaviour
   modifies performance capabilities by making them specific to context.}},

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{982-989}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Prey species can respond to the risk of predation with a range of
   antipredator behaviours and physiological changes. While these responses
   increase chances of survival, they often involve feeding reductions and
   greater energy expenditure (e.g. increases in metabolic rate). As a
   consequence, a prey response is constrained by its own nutritional
   condition. While a number of studies indeed demonstrate that prey in
   better nutritional condition have stronger antipredator behaviours, we
   do not yet understand how condition impacts the physiological component
   of the prey's response.
   Previous research revealed that Leptinotarsa decemlineata beetles
   experiencing predation risk improve their offspring's nutritional
   condition by promoting intraclutch egg cannibalism. Importantly, egg
   cannibalism decreased offspring vulnerability by increasing larval
   behavioural responses to chronic predation risk. In this study we test
   if egg cannibalism similarly impacts larval physiological responses by
   comparing how risk of predation in cannibals and non-cannibals affects
   their behaviour (e.g. feeding reductions), metabolic rate and energy
   stores.
   We found that non-cannibals did not exhibit antipredator behaviours but
   responded physiologically, by increasing metabolic rates. In contrast,
   cannibals responded behaviourally, suppressing feeding, but without
   altering metabolism. While cannibals and non-cannibals coupled food
   intake and energy expenditure differently, both reached similar growth
   rates and had similar energy stores when facing chronic predation risk.
   These results indicate that increases in predator avoidance behaviours
   are not merely mirrored by a stronger physiological response. Instead,
   changes in metabolism appear to ameliorate, within our experimental
   conditions, the costs associated with the behavioural response. Prey in
   poorer nutritional state are not less responsive to predators but appear
   to rely more heavily on physiological responses, demonstrating that how
   prey integrates behaviour and physiology depends on their own
   nutritional state.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of assisted reproduction has allowed the conception of
   millions of individuals who otherwise would not have existed. Although
   most ART children are born healthy, there is increasing awareness of the
   plasticity of the human embryo causing concerns about potential
   long-term consequences of ART for the growth, development and health of
   this growing population of individuals. Evidence from studies in animals
   and humans suggest that physiology and metabolism may be permanently
   affected by ART. It suggests that ART children may be at increased risk
   of later cardiometabolic diseases. Part of this increased susceptibility
   to cardiometabolic diseases seems to be due to parental predisposition,
   while part of the increased susceptibility seems to be due to the ART
   procedure itself. Due to the fast development of new techniques in ART,
   it is unclear whether newer techniques are associated with similar
   risks. There is evidence to suggest that the newer techniques are safer,
   but the rapid developments in reproductive medicine and ever increasing
   indications for ART make it difficult to draw conclusions. Until more is
   known about the effectiveness and safety of ART for the broader
   indications in which ART is currently used, caution in using ART is
   mandatory.
   Further progress could be made if long-term follow-up studies were
   included in the development of new ART techniques. Harmonization of
   measurements in human and animal studies of ART would allow faster
   scientific progress and less scientific waste. Also, including more
   details of the ART procedures in ART registries and allowing follow up
   of ART children through linking registries with already collected data
   from perinatal registries, child health clinics and schools would help
   to provide a better understanding of the growth, development and health
   of the growing population of ART children. Ultimately, these studies
   will provide the much needed information on how to provide ART children

Abstract = {{The links between parental restriction of food intake, child's eating
   behaviour and child's adiposity are still unclear. Our aim was to
   validate a model suggesting an underlying mechanism for the impact of
   parental restriction on child's adiposity through a broad dimension of
   child's eating temperament entitled the appetite reactivity (including
   both appetite arousal and appetite persistence). Using an online
   questionnaire administered at home to children aged between 8 and 11
   years (N = 414) with one or both of their parents, we measured: based on
   child's reports, the perceived maternal restriction of child's food
   intake, the appetite reactivity and both the desired and the eaten mean
   food portion sizes; based on parental reports, the mean food portion
   size given to the child and the child's BMI. Structural equation
   modelling was used to test a model linking measured variables. A
   well-fitting structural model (AGFI = 0.91; RMSEA = 0.07; SRMR = 0.08)
   was identified, showing that: (i) perceived maternal restriction of
   child's food intake negatively impacts child's appetite arousal and food
   portion size but positively influences child's appetite persistence;
   (ii) the two components of appetite reactivity have a positive effect on
   child's adiposity which is partly mediated by child's actual food
   portion size. Results suggest an explanation for the controversy
   surrounding the links between parental food restriction and child's
   adiposity: through its negative impact on child's appetite arousal and
   food portion size, parental control may protect against overweight, but
   because of its positive effect on appetite persistence, it can also be
   detrimental. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies indicate that the outcome of nutritional and lifestyle
   interventions can be linked to brain `signatures' in terms of neural
   reactivity to food cues. However, `dieting' is often considered in a
   rather broad sense, and no study so far investigated modulations in
   brain responses to food cues occurring over an intervention specifically
   aiming to reduce sugar intake. We studied neural activity and liking in
   response to visual food cues in 14 intensive consumers of
   sugar-sweetened beverages before and after a 3-month replacement period
   by artificially-sweetened equivalents. Each time, participants were
   presented with images of solid foods differing in fat content and taste
   quality while high-density electro-encephalography was recorded.
   Contrary to our hypotheses, there was no significant weight loss over
   the intervention period and no changes were observed in food liking or
   in neural activity in regions sub serving salience and reward
   attribution. However, neural activity in response to high-fat, sweet
   foods was significantly reduced from pre-to post-intervention in
   prefrontal regions often linked to impulse control. This decrease in
   activity was associated with weight loss failure, suggesting an
   impairment in individuals' ability to exert control and adjust their
   solid food intake over the intervention period. Our findings highlight
   the need to implement multidisciplinary approaches when aiming to help
   individuals lose body weight. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{While the effects of nectar robbing on plants are relatively

   used radio telemetry to track the spatial and behavioral responses of
   the territorial hummingbird Aglaeactis cupripennis to experimental
   nectar robbing over a period of several days. Simulated nectar robbing
   impacted foraging behavior by increasing territory area, distance flown,
   and reliance on novel food resources, especially small-bodied flying
   insects. We did not observe any impact on the amount of time individuals
   spent foraging, nor did we observe territory abandonment. These findings
   indicate that nectar robbing may impose a significant energetic cost on
   pollinators via increased flight distances and shifts towards
   potentially less profitable food resources, and demonstrate the
   importance of quantifying the indirect effects of nectar robbing on
   pollinators in addition to plants.}},

Title = {{Factors determining neophobia and neophilia with regard to new
   technologies applied to the food sector: A systematic review}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GASTRONOMY AND FOOD SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{1-19}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This systematic review was performed starting from the understanding of
   the complexity that characterizes the human relationship to food,
   combining different dimensions, ranging from those aspects going from
   the biological (nutritional function) to the cultural (symbolic
   function), as well as the ones linking the individual to the community,
   the psychological to the social. Addressing this multi-dimensional
   character is at the base of sound research paths aiming at assessing the
   determinants of consumers' choices and behaviors. This systematic review
   analyses and synthetizes the main results of recent studies dealing with
   food neophobia and neophilia with regard to new technologies applied to
   the food sector, both in the context of developed countries and in
   developing ones. In particular, main factors leading to caution and
   aversion for food technologies were identified and discussed, as well as
   different approaches to measure consumers' resistance to the mentioned
   technologies and to predict consumers' behavior.
   Scopus and Web of Science engines were used to search the existing
   literature and to identify the relevant studies to include, conducted in
   different countries and by means of different methodological approaches.
   These studies investigated the mentioned consumers' choices and
   behaviors, that are influenced by many interacting factors; the adoption
   of a relevant conceptual framework allows the distinction between distal
   (or primary) determinants, and proximal (or secondary) ones.
   Communication and attitudes or psychometric models constitute the base
   of the cited framework, and the link between the two determinants
   categories. In particular, an effective tool capable of enhancing the
   understanding of the neophobia-neophilia forces that determine food
   choices is the Food Technology Neophobia Scale (FTNS), with its
   fourcomponents constituting the base of a sound analysis of the
   influence on the mentioned choices of each single neophobia-neophilia
   force (risk perception and novelty seeking, media influence, own health
   and environmental concerns) as well as a device to turn the four
   components into a single, comprehensive framework. Finally, the case of
   consumer acceptance of the eating of insects is discussed as an emerging
   trend in food science.}},

Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{Transparent Cylinder and Barrier tasks are used to purportedly assess
   inhibitory control in a variety of animals. However, we suspect that
   performances on these detour tasks are influenced by non-cognitive
   traits, which may result in inaccurate assays of inhibitory control. We
   therefore reared pheasants under standardized conditions and presented
   each bird with two sets of similar tasks commonly used to measure
   inhibitory control. We recorded the number of times subjects incorrectly
   attempted to access a reward through transparent barriers, and their
   latencies to solve each task. Such measures are commonly used to infer
   the differential expression of inhibitory control. We found little
   evidence that their performances were consistent across the two
   different Putative Inhibitory Control Tasks (PICTs). Improvements in
   performance across trials showed that pheasants learned the affordances
   of each specific task. Critically, prior experience of transparent
   tasks, either Barrier or Cylinder, also improved subsequent inhibitory
   control performance on a novel task, suggesting that they also learned
   the general properties of transparent obstacles. Individual measures of
   persistence, assayed in a third task, were positively related to their
   frequency of incorrect attempts to solve the transparent inhibitory
   control tasks. Neophobia, Sex and Body Condition had no influence on
   individual performance. Contrary to previous studies of primates,
   pheasants with poor performance on PICTs had a wider dietary breadth
   assayed using a free-choice task. Our results demonstrate that in
   systems or taxa where prior experience and differences in development
   cannot be accounted for, individual differences in performance on
   commonly used detour-dependent PICTS may reveal more about an
   individual's prior experience of transparent objects, or their
   motivation to acquire food, than providing a reliable measure of their
   inhibitory control.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{Phytophagy is a common feature among pure herbivorous insects and
   omnivores that utilise both plant and prey as food resources;
   nevertheless, experimental evidence for factors affecting their
   interactions is restricted to intraguild predation and predator-mediated
   competition. We herein focused on plantmediated effects that could
   result from plant defence activation or quality alteration and compared
   the performance of an omnivore, the western flower thrips Frankliniella
   occidentalis, and a pure herbivore, the greenhouse whitefly Trialeurodes
   vaporariorum, on cucumber plants previously infested with either
   species. Furthermore, we recorded their behavioural responses when given
   a choice among infested and clean plants. Whiteflies laid less eggs on
   plants previously exposed to thrips but more on whiteflyinfested plants.
   Thrips survival was negatively affected on whitefly-infested than on
   thrips-infested or clean plants. Notably, whiteflies developed
   significantly faster on plants infested with conspecifics. In
   accordance, whiteflies avoided thrips-infested plants and preferred
   whitefly-infested over clean plants. Thrips showed no preference for
   either infested or clean plants. Our study is a first report on the role
   of plant-mediated effects in shaping omnivore-herbivore interactions.
   Considering the factors driving such interactions we will likely better
   understand the ecology of the more complex relationships among plants
   and pest organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Inter-specific symbiotic links are often reinforced by morphological,

   Here we inspect chemical traits of the physogastric staphylinid Corotoca
   melantho (Insecta: Coleoptera) and its termite host Constrictotermes
   cyphergaster (Insecta: Blattodea: Isoptera), aiming to verify whether
   staphylinids resemble their host. First, we compared CHC profiles of
   hosts and guests within and among termitaria, to gather evidence on the
   origin of such profiles in guests. Then, we examined nitrogen and carbon
   isotopic signatures of these cohabitants to inspect whether chemical
   disguise is achieved by predation of host workers by staphylinids.
   Beetles presented CHC more similar to the CHC of their cohabiting
   termites than to (i)their conspecifics and (ii)termites from another
   nest, thereby favouring the hypothesis on CHC acquisition by guests.
   Isotopic signatures revealed that such similarities could not be majorly
   determined by share nutrition between these cohabitants. In general, our
   results evidenced that chemical disguise in termitophiles may function
   as a strategy for social integration in morphological mimics.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis of pace-of-life syndromes (POLS) predicts relationships
   between traits including life history traits and risk-taking behaviour
   that can be mediated by the trade-off between current and future
   reproductive value. However, alternative causal mechanisms may also
   generate covariance among these traits without trade-offs. We
   investigated the relationships between survival to the next year,
   current reproductive investment and risk-taking behaviour (flight
   initiation distance) in male collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis,
   using long-term data. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to
   uncover whether the associations among traits are mediated by a common
   latent factor that determines how individuals balance the trade-off
   between current and future reproductive value. As trade-offs could be
   concealed when there are differences in resource acquisition between
   individuals, we also included potential causes of these differences,
   body mass and body size, in the analysis. We found that risk-taking
   behaviour was positively related to reproductive investment and
   negatively to survival to the next year as could be predicted if
   investment into a risky behaviour is traded against future prospects.
   However, the most supported SEM model also suggested that survival to
   the next year was positively related to current reproductive investment,
   contrary to predictions of a hypothesis based on trade-off. These
   results remained qualitatively similar when controlling for body
   condition. In conclusion, we only could derive partial support for the
   POLS hypothesis. We suggest that aspects of individual quality, and not
   only trade-offs, should also be considered when interpreting the
   relationships between life history and behavioural traits.
   Significance statement
   We investigated the association between two life history components
   (survival to the next year and current reproductive effort) and
   risk-taking behaviour, relying on long-term records from a passerine
   bird, to investigate the predictions of the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS)
   hypothesis. Using structural equation modelling, we found support for a
   causal model that implies that risk-taking negatively affects survival
   to the next year and that survival to the next year and current
   reproductive effort are strongly and positively associated. Controlling
   for the effect of body condition did not fundamentally change these
   relationships. We could not find conclusive evidence for the
   investigated traits being mediated by a common underlying factor, as
   generally predicted by the POLS hypothesis. However, the sign of the
   relationship between risk-taking behaviour and survival to the next year
   was as predicted by the POLS hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the ways in which individuals cope with threats, respond
   to challenges, make use of opportunities and mediate the harmful effects
   of their surroundings is important for predicting their ability to
   function in a rapidly changing world. Perhaps one of the most essential
   drivers of coping behaviour of adults is the environment experienced
   during their early-life development. Although the study of coping,
   defined as behaviours displayed in response to environmental challenges,
   has a long and rich research history in biology, recent literature has
   repeatedly pointed out that the processes through which coping
   behaviours develop in individuals are still largely unknown. In this
   review, we make a move towards integrating ultimate and proximate lines
   of coping behaviour research. After broadly defining coping behaviours
   (1), we review why, from an evolutionary perspective, the development of
   coping has become tightly linked to the early-life environment (2),
   which relevant developmental processes are most important in creating
   coping behaviours adjusted to the early-life environment (3), which
   influences have been shown to impact those developmental processes (4)
   and what the adaptive significance of intergenerational transmission of
   coping behaviours is, in the context of behavioural adaptations to a
   fast changing world (5). Important concepts such as effects of parents,
   habitat, nutrition, social group and stress are discussed using examples
   from empirical studies on mammals, fish, birds and other animals. In the
   discussion, we address important problems that arise when studying the
   development of coping behaviours and suggest solutions.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Correlations between behavioral, physiological, and morphological traits
   linked to life history' have been given the label ``pace-of-life
   syndrome{''} (POLS), hypothesized to arise through variation in the
   resolution of a trade-off between present and future reproduction.
   However, other trade-offs over energy allocation may also have effects
   and influence the present-future trade-off. We analyzed an optimality
   model of basal metabolic rate (BMR) across variation in food
   availability and two types of mortality. The model contained three major
   features: (1) feedback between activity and energy acquisition, (2)
   links between BMR and the use of energy for other traits, and (3)
   allocation trade-offs between BMR and all other traits, between activity
   and defense, and between defense against activity-related risk and
   activity-independent risk. The model produced an intermediate optimal
   BMR that was usually highest at an intermediate level of food
   availability. Food availability and both types of mortality risk
   interacted to influence the exact value of optimal BMR. Trait
   correlations expected in the POLS existed under some environmental
   conditions, but these correlations flipped sign under different
   conditions and were not always strong. Our model reproduces trait
   correlations consistent with the POLS, but also generated a ``sloppy{''}
   syndrome with considerable non-POLS-like variation. In addition,
   among-individual, non-adaptive variation in BMR produced adjustments of
   the other traits. These fit a best-of-a-had job strategy, and the
   adjustments further weakened trait correlations. The results emphasize
   that variation in resources and mortality risk creates a diversity of
   correlation structures. This complexity means the POLS is likely to be a
   variable construct.
   Significance statement
   Many attributes important for reproduction and survival are associated.
   Such associations may arise through common physiological processes and
   con-elated selection. We modeled metabolic rate within a system in which
   foraging behavior both depended on and mediated the acquisition of
   resources necessary for metabolism, while energy was allocated among
   multiple attributes. Variation in several environmental variables (food
   availability and two types of mortality risk) influenced basal metabolic
   rate, activity, and defenses against mortality risk. This variation
   affected the correlations between the traits in complex ways. When basal
   metabolic rate was non-optimal, evolution of the allocation of energy to
   other traits partially compensated, but this further eroded consistent
   trait correlations. Our results indicate that complexity in how energy
   is acquired and used can potentially disrupt trait correlations normally
   associated with the pace-of-life syndrome.}},

Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Folates in their role as key one carbon donors, are
   essential for two major pathways: the synthesis of DNA and RNA
   precursors and DNA methylation. A growing body of evidence from
   epidemiological studies indicates a possible association between
   nutritional and functional deficiency in folates and Autism Spectrum
   Disorders (ASD). However, there are no available behavioral animal
   studies on periconceptional one-carbon donor deficiency during gestation
   and the autistic phenotype.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to determine if the
   periconceptional alteration of one-carbon metabolism induced with a
   folate deficient diet would affect the behaviour of rat offspring.
   Methods: Female Wistar rats were divided in two groups: control (basal
   diet, in compliance with standards of regular laboratory diets), or
   exposed during one month before breeding until Gestational Day 15 to a
   modified diet with no added folic acid (0.2 mg/kg of food), reduced
   choline (750 mg/kg of food), and added 1\% SST (a non-absorbable
   antibiotic used to inhibit folate synthesis by gut bacteria). We
   administered behavioral tests to offspring, i.e., open field (P20),
   social interactions (P25), marble burying (P30), elevated plus maze
   (P35), and prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex
   (sensorimotor gating) (P45). Blood homocysteine levels were used to
   confirm the deficit in one-carbon donors.
   Results: Compared to controls, offspring with the periconceptional
   deficit in folate showed: (i) congenital body malformations; (ii)
   reduced social interactions, with a similar to 30\% decrease in social
   sniffing behavior; (iii) reduced exploration of the open arm by 50\% in
   the elevated plus maze test, indicating increased anxiety; (iv) a 160\%
   increased number of marbles buried, indicating repetitive behaviors; and
   (v) altered sensorimotor gating, with a global 50\% decrease in startle
   inhibition.
   Conclusion: Maternal periconceptional deficit in folate provokes
   alterations in the behavior of offspring relevant to the autistic-like
   phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Many people visit intertidal mudflats to collect bait and seafood, or
   for eco-tourism and recreation, and as a consequence trample on the
   mudflats frequently. Trampling would not be life threatening to most
   animals in the intertidal flats as they have evolved hiding behavior to
   escape predation. However, what is the effect of trampling on the
   behavior of intertidal animals? In this study, the effect of mudflat
   trampling on the activity of crabs (e.g. fiddler crabs, sentinel crabs)
   living on the mudflat was explored. The number of crabs active on the
   mudflat surface in experimental plots (1.5 x 1.5 m(2)) before and after
   (10 min. and 30 min.) trampling of three different intensities (Heavy
   trampling = 60 steps; Moderate trampling = 20 steps; and No trampling)
   was compared in two different mudflat systems. After trampling, the
   number of crabs active on the surface decreased and was significantly
   lower than that of control plots. The more intensively trampled the
   mudflat was, the fewer crabs were active on the mudflat surface.
   Surprisingly, the number of active crabs did not recover even 30 min.
   after trampling. The results clearly support the hypothesis that
   trampling can severely interfere with the behavior of crabs living on

Abstract = {{The risk that an animal's offspring are eaten by predators is thought to
   strongly influence an animal's decisions regarding reproductive effort.
   We found that birds breeding in locations with a high risk of nest
   predation laid fewer eggs than their conspecifics nesting in areas with
   a lower risk of nest predation. Montane birds nesting at higher
   elevations lay fewer eggs than at lower elevations because of the higher
   risk of nest predation at higher elevations.Questions about the
   ecological drivers of, and mechanistic constraints on, productivity have
   driven research on life-history evolution for decades. Resource
   availability and offspring mortality are considered among the 2 most
   important influences on the number of offspring per reproductive
   attempt. We used a factorial experimental design to manipulate food
   abundance and perceived offspring predation risk in a wild avian
   population (red-faced warblers; Cardellina rubrifrons) to identify the
   mechanistic cause of variation in avian clutch size. Additionally, we
   tested whether female quality helped explain the extant variation in
   clutch size. We found no support for the Food Limitation or Female
   Quality Hypotheses, but we did find support for both predictions of the
   Nest Predation Risk Hypothesis. Females that experienced an
   experimentally heightened perception of offspring predation risk
   responded by laying a smaller clutch than females in the control group.
   Additionally, predation rates at artificial nests were highest where
   red-faced warbler clutch size was smallest (at high elevations).
   Life-history theory predicts that an individual should invest less in
   reproduction when high nest predation risk reduces the likely benefit
   from that nesting attempt and, indeed, we found that birds exhibit
   phenotypic plasticity in clutch size by laying fewer eggs in response to
   increasing nest predation risk.}},

   constraining an ectothermic animal's movement in response to how food
   and microclimates vary in space and time. The model uses r to drive a
   NetLogo individual-based model together with microclimate and energy-
   and mass-budget modelling functions from the r package NicheMapR. It
   explicitly incorporates physiological and morphological traits,
   behavioural thermoregulation, movement strategies and movement costs.
   From this, the model generates activity budgets of foraging and
   shade-seeking, home range behaviour, spatial movement patterns and life
   history consequences under user-defined configurations of food and
   microclimates. To illustrate the model, we run simulations of the
   Australian sleepy lizard Tiliqua rugosa under different movement
   strategies (optimising or satisficing) in two contrasting habitats of
   varying food and shade (sparse and dense). We then compare the results
   with real, fine-scale movement data of a wild population throughout the
   breeding season. Our results show that (1) the extremes of movement
   behaviour observed in sleepy lizards are consistent with feeding
   requirements (passive movement) and thermal constraints (active
   movement), (2) the model realistically captures majority of the
   distribution of observed home range size, (3) both satisficing and
   optimising movement strategies appear to exist in the wild population,
   but home range size more closely approximates an optimising strategy,
   and (4) satisficing was more energetically efficient than optimising
   movement, which returned no additional benefit in metabolic fitness
   outputs. This framework for predicting physical constraints to
   individual movement can be extended to individual-level interactions
   with the same or different species and provides new capabilities for
   forecasting future responses to novel resource and weather scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Species sharing a prey or a predator species may go extinct due to
   exploitative or apparent competition. We examine whether evolution of
   the shared species acts as a coexistence mechanism and to what extent
   the answer depends on the genetic architecture underlying trait
   evolution. In our models of exploitative and apparent competition, the
   shared species evolves its defense or prey use. Evolving species are
   either haploid or diploid. A single locus pleiotropically determines
   prey nutritional quality and predator attack rates. When pleiotropy is
   sufficiently antagonistic (e.g., nutritional prey are harder to
   capture), eco-evolutionary assembly culminates in one of two stable
   states supporting only two species. When pleiotropy is weakly
   antagonistic or synergistic, assembly is intransitive: species-genotype
   pairs are cyclically displaced by rare invasions of the missing
   genotypes or species. This intransitivity allows for coexistence if,
   along its equilibria, the geometric mean of recovery rates exceeds the
   geometric mean of loss rates of the rare genotypes or species. By
   affecting these rates, synergistic pleiotropy can mediate coexistence,
   while antagonistic pleiotropy does not. For diploid populations
   experiencing weak antagonistic pleiotropy, superadditive allelic
   contributions to fitness can mitigate coexistence via an
   eco-evolutionary storage effect. Density dependence and mutations also
   promote coexistence. These results highlight how the efficacy of
   evolution as a coexistence mechanismmay depend on the underlying genetic
   architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Learned aspects of song affect female mating preferences in a number of
   species of songbirds, including swamp sparrows, Melospiza georgiana. One
   explanation for why female songbirds attend to such song features is
   that these song attributes convey information on the general cognitive
   ability of singers. The fact that song attributes and cognitive ability
   are affected during development by the same stressors makes a connection
   between the two plausible. Here we test the hypothesis that song is a
   signal of cognitive ability by relating five measures of song quality to
   five measures of cognitive performance in 49 captive male swamp
   sparrows. The five song measures are repertoire size, mean and minimum
   vocal deviation (measures of vocal performance), and mean and maximum
   typicality (measures of song learning). Cognitive performance was
   measured as the speed with which five cognitive tasks were mastered: a
   novel foraging task, a colour association, a colour reversal, a spatial
   learning problem and a detour-reaching test. In general linear mixed
   models controlling for neophobia, none of the song measures were
   predictive of any of the cognitive performance measures. Thus the
   results do not support the hypothesis that song attributes signal
   general cognition in swamp sparrows. (C) 2018 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Considering the antioxidant properties of sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) and
   the involvement of oxidative stress events in paraquat-induced

   Na2SeO3 on biochemical and behavioral parameters of zebrafish exposed to
   paraquat (PQ). Fish were pretreated with a Na2SeO3 diet for 21 days and
   then PQ (20 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally with six
   injections for 16 days. In the novel tank test, the Na2SeO3 diet
   prevented the locomotor impairments, as well as the increase in the time
   spent in the top area of the tank, and the exacerbation of freezing
   episodes. In the preference for conspecifics and in the mirror-induced
   aggression (MIA) tasks, Na2SeO3 prevented the increase in the latency to
   enter the area closer to conspecifics and the agonistic behavior of
   PQ-treated animals, respectively. Na2SeO3 prevented the increase of
   carbonylated protein (CP), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and
   nitrite/nitrate (NOx) levels, as well as the decrease in non-protein
   thiols (NPSH) levels. Regarding the antioxidant enzymatic defenses,
   Na2SeO3 prevented the increase in catalase (CAT) and glutathione

   improves behavioral and biochemical function impaired by PQ treatment in
   zebrafish, by modulating not only redox parameters, but also anxiety-

Abstract = {{The planktonic rotifer, Brachionus calyciflorus, displays extensive
   variation in the length of its anterior and posterior spines. Notably,
   posterolateral spines may be absent or near body length. Studies of
   laboratory and natural populations have identified the different factors
   controlling this variation and have investigated the trade-offs
   associated with increased spine development. Low temperature and low
   food availability can induce modest spine elongation that may reduce
   sinking rate. A kairomone released by the carnivorous rotifer Asplanchna
   induces pronounced spine elongation, without detectable reproductive
   cost, that can provide an effective defense against this predator.
   Endogenous mechanisms also operate: Spine development is inhibited in
   females hatched from fertilized resting eggs and can be promoted by
   increasing maternal age. Genetic variation for the length of spines in
   both noninduced (default) and induced phenotypes occurs among and within
   populations. Asplanchna in natural communities likely leads to seasonal
   selection for genotypes that can develop increasingly long spines.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{99}},

Pages = {{681-689}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Predators can alter nutrient cycles simply by inducing stress in prey.
   This stress accelerates prey's protein catabolism, nitrogen waste
   production, and nitrogen cycling. Yet predators also reduce the feeding
   rates of their prey, inducing food deprivation that is expected to slow
   protein catabolism and nitrogen cycling. The physiology of prey under
   predation risk thus balances the influences of predation risk and food
   deprivation, and this balance is central to understanding the role of
   predators in nutrient cycles. We explored the separate and combined
   effects of predation risk and food deprivation on prey physiology and
   nutrient cycling by exposing guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to predation
   risk and food deprivation in a 2x2 design. We simulated predation risk
   using chemical cues from a natural predator of guppies, and we created
   food deprivation by rationing food availability. We measured guppy
   response as food consumption, growth, tissue energy density, tissue
   carbon:nitrogen, and nitrogen (N) excretion and assimilation. We found
   that N-linked physiological processes (N consumption, assimilation,
   excretion) were strongly affected by predation risk, independent of food
   consumption. Guppies excreted substantially less under predation risk
   than they did under food deprivation or control conditions. These
   results suggest that predation risk, per se, triggers physiological
   changes in guppies that increase N retention and decrease N excretion.
   We suggest that slower N metabolism under predation risk is an adaptive
   response that minimizes protein loss in the face of predictable,
   predator-induced food restriction. Notably, N metabolism shares common
   hormonal control with food seeking behavior, and we speculate that
   increased N retention is a direct and immediate result of reduced food
   seeking under predation risk. Contrary to predation-stress-based
   hypotheses for how predators affect nutrient cycling by prey, our result
   indicates that even short-term exposure topredators may decelerate,
   rather than accelerate, the speed of N cycling by suppressing N turnover
   by prey.}},

Abstract = {{Predation risk affects foraging behavior and, particularly, the amount
   of time devoted to the search for food. When exposed to predation risk,
   food deprived animals should be risk prone and relax behavioral defenses
   to a wider extent than well fed individuals. To test for this
   prediction, we used a 2 x 2 factorial design experiment, manipulating
   both the energetic state (fed vs. fasted) and exposure to an
   attack-released cue (injured vs. uninjured conspecifics) of common water
   frog tadpoles (Pelophylax kl. esculentus). Contrary to expectations,
   food deprivation significantly lowered the activity level of
   predator-exposed tadpoles. As in this experiment no food resource was
   added to test containers, energy conserving behavior might have both
   delayed starvation and lowered the probability of encountering the
   potential predator. To test for the effect of food availability on
   behavioral responses, we performed a second experiment, using the same
   protocol and procedures, except for adding food to all test containers.
   All tadpoles showed similar levels of activity, while fed tadpoles
   exposed to alarm cues tended to swim farther from the cage containing
   the stimulus than in the first experiment. As many anuran larvae can
   feed on dead conspecifics, prey-borne cues may have been interpreted as
   the potential presence of both a food source and a predator, fed
   tadpoles possibly being more confident than fasted tadpoles in their
   ability to escape predation in case an actual attack occurs.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims: The aim of this study was to examine, in a

   Methods and results: Participants were 532 community-living middle-aged
   and elderly adults from the Personality and Total Health (PATH) Through
   Life study. They spanned the full weight range
   (underweight/normal/overweight/obese). Latent class analysis and
   multivariate generalised linear models were used to investigate the
   association of Body Mass Index (BMI, kg/m(2)) trajectory over twelve
   years with plasma insulin (mu lU/ml), plasma glucose (mmol/L), and HOMA2
   insulin resistance and beta cell function at follow-up. All models were
   adjusted for age, gender, hypertension, pre-clinical diabetes status
   (normal fasting glucose or impaired fasting glucose) and physical
   activity. Four weight trajectories were extracted; constant normal (mean
   baseline BMI = 25; follow-up BMI = 25), constant high (mean baseline BMI
   = 36; follow-up BMI = 37), increase (mean baseline BMI = 26; follow-up
   BMI = 32) and decrease (mean baseline BMI = 34; follow-up BMI = 28). At
   any given current BMI, individuals in the constant high and increase
   trajectories had significantly higher plasma insulin, greater insulin
   resistance, and higher beta cell function than those in the constant
   normal trajectory. Individuals in the decrease trajectory did not differ

Abstract = {{Predation impacts development, behavior and morphology of prey species

   Non-lethal threat of predation, specifically, can have a strong

   often focus on the impact of predation threat on prey in isolation,
   tests of its interactive effects with food availability and resource
   competition on prey survival and fitness can improve understanding of
   costs, benefits and trade-offs of anti-predator strategies. This study,
   involving Aedes aegypti mosquitoes as a model organism, investigates
   both simple and interactive effects of predation threat during the
   larval stage on survival, size at and time to maturity, stored teneral
   reserves of glycogen, protein and lipid in adults, and adult longevity.
   Our results show that development times of mosquito larvae were

   eclosing adults decreased (by 62.30\% in males and by 58.33\% in
   females) when exposed to lowered nutrition and elevated intraspecific
   competition, but that predation had no detectable effect on these simple
   traits. Teneral reserves of glycogen, protein and lipid and adult
   longevity were positively correlated with adult body size. Non-lethal
   predation threat had significant interactive effects with nutrition and
   larval competition on teneral reserves in males and adult longevity in
   males and females. The sexes responded differently to conditions
   encountered as larvae, with the larval environment affecting development
   and adult characteristics more acutely for females than for males. The
   outcome of this study shows how threat of predation on juveniles can

Abstract = {{Background: Hypremesis Gravidarum (HG) is a common disease in pregnancy
   during the first trimester. Patients suffering from HG commonly present
   with dehydration, nutritional depletion, electrolyte imbalance, and the
   loss of at least 5\% of body weight. Although the psychological etiology
   of HG is not clear, it has been shown that psychiatric symptoms are
   extensively present in patients with HG. Objectives: The aim of this
   study was to investigate the relationship between temperament,
   attachment style and hyperemesis gravidarum.
   Materials and Methods: This case-control study was conducted at
   Kirikkale University Hospital in Kirikkale, Turkey, between May 2015 and
   May 2017. A total of 98 pregnant women suffering from HG in their first
   trimester of pregnancy (HG group) and 95 healthy pregnant women in their
   first trimester of pregnancy (control group) were included in the study.
   Adult attachment styles were determined as secure, fearful, preoccupied,
   and dismissing. The evaluation of temperament was done using the TEMPS-A
   scale.
   Results: The mean secure attachment style score in the HG group was 3.9
   +/- 0.9 and significantly lower than the mean attachment style score
   (4.6 +/- 1.1) in the control group (P = 0.001). In the TEMPS-A scale,
   patients with HG showed significantly higher mean depressive (9.7 +/-
   3.8) and mean anxious scores (13 +/- 2.3) than those of the control
   group (6.6 +/- 2.9 and 8 +/- 0.9, respectively) (P = 0.001 and P =
   0.040, respectively).
   Conclusions: This study revealed that HG patients had more common
   depressive and anxious temperament characteristics and lower secure
   attachment style than non-HG patients. Due to the fact that attachment
   and temperament styles are relatively stable throughout life, we thought
   that psychiatric problems may play a role on development of HG.}},

   corpus callosum atrophy and reduced ``behavioral plasticity{''}, which,
   taken together, engenders an increased risk for mood and anxiety
   disorders in humans but also a putative sparing of calories. Herein, we
   test the hypothesis whether a thrifty phenotype induced by ELS is
   peripherally evident as hypotrophy of cardiac structure and function,
   raising the possibility that certain mood disorders may represent
   maladaptive physiological and central thrift adaptations.
   Methods: 14 adult bonnet macaques (6 males) exposed to the maternal
   variable foraging demand (VFD) model of ELS were compared to 20 non-VFD
   adult subjects (6 males). Left ventricle end-diastolic dimension
   (LVEDD), Left ventricle end-systolic dimension (LVESD) and stroke volume
   (SV) were calculated using echocardiography. Blood pressure and heart
   rate were measured only in females. Previously obtained neurobehavioral
   correlates available only in males were analyzed in the context of
   cardiac parameters.
   Results: Reduced LVESD (p < 0.05) was observed when controlled for age,
   sex, body weight and crown-rump length whereas ejection fraction (EF) (p
   = 0.037) was greater in VFD-reared versus non-VFD subjects. Pulse
   pressure was lower in VFD versus non-VFD females (p < 0.05). Male
   timidity in response to a human intruder was associated with reduced
   LVEDD (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: ELS is associated with both structural and functional
   reductions of left ventricular measures, potentially implying a
   body-wide thrifty phenotype. Parallel ``thrift{''} adaptations may occur
   in key brain areas following ELS and may play an unexplored role in mood
   and anxiety disorder susceptibility. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{We used Argos-linked Fastloc-Global Positioning System (Argos-linked
   Fastloc-GPS) satellite tags to investigate how loggerhead sea turtles
   use neritic foraging habitats at multiple scales. Out of 24 turtles, six
   individuals used more than one foraging site, with all sites being
   separated by >25 km. These six individuals used up to four sites,
   remaining at each site for a mean of 150 days and returning to the same
   site a minimum of 52 days later. The other 18 turtles remained in a
   single site. The area within sites was not used uniformly, with 15 out
   of 24 turtles exhibiting complex movement patterns within and amongst up
   to five focal patches, which were typically 0.1-5.0 km apart within a
   single site. Movements between sites and patches might sometimes have
   reflected overwintering behaviour; however, similar movement patterns
   occurred at multiple times of the year, suggesting other factors were
   also involved. Use of multiple sites and patches might be driven by
   differences in resource availability, such as food and/or night-time
   refuges, competition, or exploratory movement to investigate or locate
   alternative patches. We confirmed competition via direct visual
   observations of aggressive interactions between individuals at one
   foraging patch. Our results illustrate the importance of standardizing
   data to the same number of locations per day and night to accurately
   delineate key areas used by turtles or for evidence-based marine

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Predators can significantly affect prey by removing prey individuals and
   by changing prey behavior. The tradeoff between foraging behavior and
   predation risk may result in a trophic cascade that can have important
   effects on ecosystem processes. For herbivores that can feed both above-
   and below-ground, it is likely that predation risk affects the location
   of feeding. We tested whether two species of predatory marsh crabs
   affected feeding behavior of the herbivorous crab, Sesarma reticulatum.
   We found that predatory crabs could kill or injure Sesarma and that
   Sesarma did less damage to its food plant Spartina alterniflora in the
   presence of the more dangerous predator. Sesarma prefers to feed on and
   grows better on belowground rhizomes than aboveground leaves; however,
   the costs of digging burrows to access rhizomes lead to higher mortality
   if it is the only diet option. The location of feeding did not affect
   total biomass of S. alterniflora. For Sesarma, a choice in feeding
   location allows the crabs the behavioral flexibility to balance the
   risks of predation, the nutritional benefit of feeding belowground, and
   the survival costs of belowground feeding. Similar tradeoffs are likely
   to increase the success of other herbivores that can feed both above-and
   belowground.}},

Abstract = {{Personality research suggests that individual differences in risk

   few empirical studies examine whether repeatable differences in risk

   although both behaviours were repeatable, they did not correlate.
   Latency to enter was negatively related to body condition and the number

   explained by whether incubating females had been flushed from the nest
   before the trial began. Thus, our inferences on the relationship between

Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Little is known about how variation in nestling begging intensity
   influences the behaviour of adult raptors and how responses of adult
   males and females to such variation might differ. Our objective was to
   manipulate the begging intensity of nestling American Kestrels (Falco
   sparverius) and examine the responses of adults. We studied 12 pairs of
   American Kestrels nesting in nest boxes from 1 March to 1 July 2014 at
   the Blue Grass Army Depot, Madison County, Kentucky. Nest boxes were
   modified with a separate compartment for a camcorder to record nestling
   behaviour, and a second camcorder was placed outside the nests to
   monitor adult behaviour. To manipulate nestling hunger levels, 12 to
   26-day-old nestlings in six nests were deprived of food for 24 h and
   those in the other six nests were fed until satiated. At each nest, we
   alternated control (no treatment) and treatment (fed or food deprived)
   days over a 4 day period to minimise the possible effect of nestling age
   on adult and nestling behaviour. Nestling begging intensity differed
   among treatments, with nestlings in food-deprived nests begging with
   greater intensity after food deprivation and those in fed-treatment
   nests begging with less intensity after being fed. Adult male and female
   American Kestrels provisioned nestlings at similar rates, with both
   sexes feeding nestlings at higher rates after food deprivation and at
   lower rates after fed treatments. Thus, the begging behaviour of
   nestling American Kestrels varied with hunger level, and adult American
   Kestrels responded by adjusting provisioning rates. Although the
   response of adults to nestling begging suggests that natural selection
   might favour `dishonest' begging to obtain more food, the potential
   costs of `dishonest' begging, such as attracting predators, reduced
   immunocompetence, and loss of indirect fitness benefits if such begging
   negatively impacts siblings and parents, may outweigh any possible
   benefit.}},

   same experimental treatments}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory studies of animal behavior can use animals with different
   developmental histories, including those that have spent most of their
   lives in the field or those raised in the laboratory. Both types of
   animals are assumed to respond similarly to experimental treatments. The
   goal of this study was to test if this assumption is true, if
   field-collected and lab-reared animals respond similarly to experimental
   treatments. In the first experiments, we test how diet (high lipid or
   protein) affected mating behaviors of male jumping spiders, Phidippus
   audax. Male spiders had opposite responses to diet based on their
   rearing condition in both scramble competition and male-male interaction
   trials. Field-collected spiders fed with high-protein diets and
   lab-reared spiders fed with high-lipid diets found mates quicker and
   were more aggressive than their counter parts fed with different diets.
   Field-collected spiders were also more active in open arenas and courted
   females more actively than lab-reared spiders. In a second experiment,
   we tested spiders for preference of flower color, and found that both
   lab-reared and field-collected spiders selected flowers with color over
   white flowers. However, field-collected spiders prefer red flowers with
   UV fluorescence, while lab-reared spiders seem to prefer red without UV.
   These results suggest that lab-reared and field-collected animals can
   respond differently to the same experimental treatments. Further work is
   needed to test if this happens in other animals, and which types of
   individuals (lab-reared or field collect) best reflect the responses of
   animals in nature.
   Significance statement
   Laboratory studies are commonly used to study animal behavior. Animals
   used in these studies can be either raised in the laboratory or
   collected from the field just prior to the study. While lab-reared and
   field-collected animals can differ sometimes in their behavior (e.g.,
   more or less active in response to a treatment), they are both assumed
   to respond in qualitatively the same manner. However, this does not
   appear to be the case in our study of a common species of jumping
   spider, Phidippus audax. Labreared and field-collected animals responded
   in opposite directions to identical treatment conditions. These results
   suggest that the developmental histories of animals can fundamentally
   affect how they respond to experimental treatments in the laboratory
   and, hence, the conclusions drawn from such studies.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose In recent years, a new term-orthorexia nervosa (ON)-has been
   introduced in the field of clinical assessment and psychotherapy.
   Orthorexia nervosa is defined as a fixation on healthy food and a
   pathological obsession to eat food with more natural, higher quality
   ingredients. Although instruments to measure ON are available, no study
   on the psychometric properties of the original developed instrument by
   Bratman (Orthorexia nervosa: Overcoming the obsession with healthful
   eating, Broadway Books, New York, 2000) in a large clinical sample
   exists until now.
   Methods The study was conducted in a large clinic in Germany. The study
   sample consisted of N = 1122 inpatients, 70\% were female, and the mean
   age was 41 years (SD = 14 years). The main diagnoses at the end of
   treatment were affective disorders (46\%), followed by eating disorders
   (13\%), anxiety disorders (10\%), and personality disorders (10\%). The
   patients filled out several instruments, like the Ortho-10, the 10-item
   version of the orthorexia nervosa instrument, and other
   construct-related, disorder-specific and construct-distant instruments.
   Results The exploratory factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure:
   an eating disorder-specific factor and an orthorexia-nervosa specific
   factor. The eating disorder factor showed good convergent and
   discriminative validity in which patients with eating disorders and
   those without could correctly be classified. However, the
   orthorexia-nervosa specific factor revealed no informational gain
   compared to the eating disorder-specific factor in this clinical sample.
   Conclusions Further investigation is necessary to approach the concept
   of ON and its sense in clinical samples.}},

   Exposure of P. maculatus tadpoles to chemical cues of caged predator

   tadpoles, or were starved elicited defense behavior (by avoiding
   predator zone) in them. Such a behavior was not evident when exposed to
   predators housed in a glass beaker (visual cues). Both early (Gosner
   stage 27-28) and later (Gosner stage 35-36) stage tadpoles when exposed
   to caged predators (fed with conspecific tadpoles), prey tadpoles spent
   less time swimming and remained motionless for longer periods. Yet, the
   time spent by prey in feeding was unaffected. Further, the predator
   avoidance behavior exhibited by them was of the same intensity
   regardless of whether the caged predators were fed or starved implying
   the influence of predator's kairomones. Tadpoles reared with caged
   predator reached the metamorphic climax stage (MC stage; Gosner stage
   42) earlier than those reared without a predator. Size at emergence
   (Gosner stage 46) was comparable in both the groups. The findings
   suggest that P. maculatus tadpoles assess predation risk chiefly by
   sensing kairomones of the predator in eliciting antipredator defense
   behaviors. Accelerated development and early metamorphosis without any
   compromise of the size at emergence may be due to their unaltered

Abstract = {{Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker 1857) is a freshwater mussel with
   physiological tolerance to different environmental conditions, which may
   explain its success as an invasive species. The role of abiotic factors
   in its establishment, abundance and projections of risk of further
   spread into several areas has been studied. These mussels may respond to
   multiple environmental stressors, such as temperature, through
   physiological mechanisms, behavioral responses, mortality or some
   combination of these. The aim of this study was to investigate the
   behavioral responses (valve closing), glycogen concentrations and
   mortality of L. fortunei under four different temperatures (5 degrees C,
   10 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C) during a chronic test (30
   days). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare glycogen
   concentrations across days of the experiment and at the different
   temperatures. Differences in valve-closing behavior and mortality among
   temperatures were tested using repeated-measures ANOVA. We observed that
   most of the mussels maintained at 5 degrees C closed their valves (74.7
   +/- 15.3\%), indicating that they remain inactive at low temperatures.
   The glycogen levels significantly differed among the temperatures
   tested. These differences occurred mainly due to the high glycogen
   values observed in mussels exposed to 10 degrees C. Stability in
   glycogen concentrations was observed within each particular temperature.
   The cumulative mortality was higher at extreme temperatures (5 degrees C
   and 30 degrees C). The ideal temperature for laboratory maintenance and
   tests is approximately 20 degrees C. Our data also show that L. fortunei
   can survive and maintain their energy reserves (glycogen) for several
   days at 5 degrees C, an important feature related to its invasion
   success.}},

   supplied from folic acid. Therefore, from the epigenetic point of view,
   proper intake of folic acid is important for pregnant women not only to
   prevent congenital abnormalities such as neural tube defect but also to
   prevent various adult disorders of the offspring. Dyslipidemia is an
   important risk factor of coronary heart disease, and epidemiological
   studies on Dutch winter famine, Jewish holocaust survivors, and Chinese

   the activity of delta-6 desaturase and delta-5 desaturase, that

Title = {{Life history trade-offs and the partitioning of maternal investment
   Implications for health of mothers and offspring}},
Journal = {{EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{153-166}},
Abstract = {{Lay Summary: This review sets out the hypothesis that life history
   trade-offs in the maternal generation favour the emergence of similar
   trade-offs in the offspring generation, mediated by the partitioning of
   maternal investment between pregnancy and lactation, and that these
   trade-offs help explain widely reported associations between growth
   trajectories and NCD risk.
   Growth patterns in early life predict the risk of non-communicable
   diseases (NCDs), but adaptive explanations remain controversial. It is
   widely assumed that NCDs occur either because of physiological
   adjustments to early constraints, or because early ecological cues fail
   to predict adult environmental conditions (mismatch). I present an
   inter-generational perspective on developmental plasticity, based on the
   over-arching hypothesis that a key axis of variability in maternal
   metabolism derives from life history trade-offs, which influence how
   individual mothers partition nutritional investment in their offspring
   between pregnancy and lactation. I review evidence for three resulting
   predictions: (i) Allocating relatively more energy to growth during
   development promotes the capacity to invest in offspring during
   pregnancy. Relevant mechanisms include greater fat-free mass and
   metabolic turnover, and a larger physical space for fetal growth. (ii)
   Allocating less energy to growth during development constrains fetal
   growth of the offspring, but mothers may compensate by a tendency to
   attain higher adiposity around puberty, ecological conditions
   permitting, which promotes nutritional investment during lactation.
   (iii) Since the partitioning of maternal investment between pregnancy
   and lactation impacts the allocation of energy to `maintenance' as well
   as growth, it is expected to shape offspring NCD risk as well as adult
   size and body composition. Overall, this framework predicts that life
   history trade-offs in the maternal generation favour the emergence of
   similar trade-offs in the offspring generation, mediated by the
   partitioning of maternal investment between pregnancy and lactation, and
   that these trade-offs help explain widely reported associations between
   growth trajectories and NCD risk.}},

Pages = {{191-213}},
Abstract = {{Mycorrhizal fungal networks linking the roots of trees in forests are
   increasingly recognized to facilitate inter-tree communication via
   resource, defense, and kin recognition signaling and thereby influence
   the sophisticated behavior of neighbors. These tree behaviors have
   cognitive qualities, including capabilities in perception, learning, and
   memory, and they influence plant traits indicative of fitness. Here, I
   present evidence that the topology of mycorrhizal networks is similar to
   neural networks, with scale-free patterns and small-world properties
   that are correlated with local and global efficiencies important in
   intelligence. Moreover, the multiple exploration strategies of
   interconnecting fungal species have parallels with crystallized and
   fluid intelligence that are important in memory-based learning. The
   biochemical signals that transmit between trees through the fungal
   linkages are thought to provide resource subsidies to receivers,
   particularly among regenerating seedlings, and some of these signals
   appear to have similarities with neurotransmitters. I provide examples
   of neighboring tree behavioral, learning, and memory responses
   facilitated by communication through mycorrhizal networks, including,
   respectively, (1) enhanced understory seedling survival, growth,
   nutrition, and mycorrhization, (2) increased defense chemistry and kin
   selection, and (3) collective memory-based interactions among trees,
   fungi, salmon, bears, and people that enhance the health of the whole
   forest ecosystem. Viewing this evidence through the lens of tree
   cognition, microbiome collaborations, and forest intelligence may
   contribute to a more holistic approach to studying ecosystems and a
   greater human empathy and caring for the health of our forests.}},

Title = {{Metagenomic Approaches for Understanding New Concepts in Microbial
   Science}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Abstract = {{Over the past thirty years, since the dawn of metagenomic studies, a
   completely new (micro) universe was revealed, with the potential to have
   profound impacts on many aspects of the society. Remarkably, the study
   of human microbiome provided a new perspective on a myriad of human
   traits previously regarded as solely (epi-) genetically encoded, such as
   disease susceptibility, immunological response, and social and
   nutritional behaviors. In this context, metagenomics has established a
   powerful framework for understanding the intricate connections between
   human societies and microbial communities, ultimately allowing for the
   optimization of both human health and productivity. Thus, we have
   shifted from the old concept of microbes as harmful organisms to a
   broader panorama, in which the signal of the relationship between humans
   and microbes is flexible and directly dependent on our own decisions and
   practices. In parallel, metagenomics has also been playing a major role
   in the prospection of ``hidden{''} genetic features and the development
   of biotechnological applications, through the discovery of novel genes,
   enzymes, pathways, and bioactive molecules with completely new or
   improved biochemical functions. Therefore, this review highlights the
   major milestones over the last three decades of metagenomics, providing
   insights into both its potentialities and current challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objective: There is great interest, supported by clinical
   experience, in the relationship between Eating Disorders (EDs) and
   psychiatric symptoms and diseases. The psychopathology of EDs is also
   referred to many risk and protective factors, and there is some evidence
   in the literature, also about genetic and neurobiological factors
   involved. The aim of this review is to examine and synthesize the recent
   scientific literature on this topic, in particular the complex
   relationship between Anorexia Nervosa and Neuropsychiatric Disorders.
   Methods: We analyzed the best of published literature on the topic,
   identifying keywords and MeSH terms in Pubmed and then searching them.
   The last search was performed on November 2017.
   Results: Psychiatric comorbidities are very common in anorexia nervosa.
   Mood disorders, major depressive disorders, anxiety disorders,
   obsessive-compulsive disorders, developmental disorders among autistic
   spectrum and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and even some
   personality disorders, substance abuse and borderline traits have been
   reported, and some observations suggest a positive genetic correlation
   between anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia.
   Conclusion: The great amount of scientific articles dealing with the
   relationship between EDs and psychopathology confirms the complexity of
   these problems and the difficulties in diagnosis and treatment. An
   accurate diagnosis and assessment of clinical risk about psychological,
   psychiatric, nutritional and somatic aspects are therefore essential for
   an appropriate therapeutic management of patients affected by anorexia

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Objectives This study tested hypotheses drawn from a risk model positing
   that psychosocial risk plus disease-related and treatment factors
   contribute to bulimic symptoms in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D)
   transitioning to an insulin pump. The goal of this study was to examine
   whether disease-related factors, particularly disease-and
   treatment-based disruption in hunger and satiety, contribute to report
   of bulimic symptoms in youth with T1D after accounting for psychosocial
   risk factors. Methods 43 youth (ages 10-17, 54\% female) with
   established T1D were recruited before transition from multiple daily
   injections to insulin-pump therapy from three tertiary pediatric
   diabetes centers. Participants completed measures of bulimic symptoms,
   depressive symptoms dietary restraint, and the Diabetes Treatment and
   Satiety Scale, a diabetes-specific questionnaire assessing hunger and
   satiety cues and eating behavior in response to blood glucose levels and
   treatment. Results Hierarchical multiple regression was used to assess
   contributions of psychosocial and disease-based risk to report of
   bulimic symptoms. After assessing the contributions of body mass index,
   body image dissatisfaction, and dietary restraint, a significant 2-way
   interaction emerged between depression and diabetes-related
   uncontrollable hunger related to bulimic symptoms (beta-1.82, p<.01).
   Conclusions In addition to psychosocial risk, disease-and
   treatment-based hunger and satiety dysregulation appear to be important
   factors contributing to report of bulimic symptoms in youth with T1D.
   These preliminary findings have significant treatment implications for
   bulimic symptoms in youth with T1D.}},

Journal = {{ETHOLOGY ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{70-87}},
Abstract = {{Predation is a strong selective force that affects prey population and
   ecosystem dynamics. Detecting predators and associated levels of threat
   is crucial to prey responses. Once a predator is detected,
   anti-predatory responses improve the chances of survival of prey. We
   used Aedes aegypti larvae to study behavioural responses to predation
   threat from guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Specifically, we tested the
   relative importance of chemical cues, both in isolation and in
   combination with physical cues, in eliciting anti-predatory behaviours.
   Larvae responded more strongly, by reducing the lengths of their wriggle
   bursts, when presented with a combination of chemical and physical cues
   than with chemical cues alone. Anti-predatory responses often come with
   an associated cost, and we expect that the ability to pay these costs
   should influence responses to predation risk. To test this, we compared
   wriggling patterns of satiated vs starved larvae in the same experiment.
   We found that, under predation risk, starved larvae were willing to take
   more risks than satiated larvae were. We sought to experimentally test
   the assumption that anti-predator behaviours increase the survival of
   prey. To do this, starved guppies were made to choose between displays
   of simulated larvae, moving in short and long wriggle bursts as observed
   in the previous experiment. The fish preferentially attacked larvae
   moving in long bursts, demonstrating the survival value of the larval
   anti-predatory response of shifting to a preponderance of short wriggle
   bursts. Our study identifies specific ways in which trade-offs between
   predation risk and energetic costs could affect anti-predator behaviour.}},

Pages = {{13-25}},
Abstract = {{Breast cancer (BC) is one of the leading causes of death among women
   worldwide. Identification of susceptible women might help us reduce
   BC-related deaths. Traditionally women's susceptibility to BC has been
   estimated based on family, reproductive and nutritional histories and/or
   genotyping. Unfortunately, predictions made based on all these factors
   remain imprecise. Research conducted over the past decades supports the
   premise that patients displaying some personality traits are prone to
   develop cancer. Nevertheless, conflicting results have been published.
   We then conducted a study aimed at evaluating relationships between
   specific personality traits and different types of breast pathology.
   This approach aimed at evaluating whether personality profiling, in
   conjunction with other parameters might help us, in the near future, to
   identify more accurately Mexican women susceptible to develop BC. As a
   first step towards this goal, we asked whether healthy women and
   patients having signs of benign breast pathology or cancer shared or not
   specific personality traits. We used the Courtauld Emotional Control
   Total Score, the Weinberger Adjustment Inventory and the Symptoms of
   Stress Inventory to identify personality traits. Our results indicated
   that women diagnosed with benign or malign breast pathology share low
   restraint, low global stress symptoms, low physical stress symptoms, low
   restraint-defensiveness composite and high distress before diagnosis.
   This outcome was independent of the educational level, as well as of
   family, reproductive and nutritional histories, supporting that the
   weight of the psychological traits is greater than that of the latter
   variables, at least in our sample.}},

Abstract = {{Consumers have evolved from scavengers of necessity to scavengers of
   excess. Citizens of industrialized countries have little survival
   motivation to forage for food, yet a dominance of food cues in the
   environment exacerbates eating control. As a result, behavioral
   strategies are needed to mediate these negative effects. However,
   healthful consumption likelihood has been an extremely elusive measure
   to predict. Most studies are able to show only an incremental amount of
   variance explained in consumers' behavioral intentions. Moreover,
   generalizability is often limited to college student data. In response,
   the present research uses structural equation modeling methods to
   investigate the complexity of this domain. The results from a
   representative panel of U.S. adult consumers show that motivation,
   social support, and food features all have significant effects on
   healthful consumption likelihood. Finally, several of these effects are
   mediated by the importance of healthy eating and convenience barriers.
   The final structural model explains 58\% of the variance in healthy
   eating-a significant contribution to extant research.}},

   structures were characterized by C-13 and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental
   analysis. The UV-vis absorption spectra revealed these dyads have broad
   optical absorption in the ultraviolet and visible regions due to the
   complementary absorption of the two units. The differential scanning
   calorimetry traces and polarized optical microscopy textures showed all
   these dyads have columnar liquid crystal phases. Cyclic voltammetry
   revealed the highest occupied molecular orbitals of the dyads located on
   the porphyrin units, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals
   located on the perylene units. In addition, these results were in
   agreement with that of the theoretical modeling. When excited at 423 or
   473 nm, the photoluminescent emission spectra showed that the degree of
   fluorescence quenching of porphyrin units increased as the spacers
   became shorter. This quenching was ascribed to intramolecular
   photoinduced electron transfer, which also induced the dyad molecules to
   form the charge-separated states. The charge-separated molecules were
   further confirmed by the photocurrent response curves. These behaviors
   of broad absorption of the ultraviolet-visible light, yielding the
   charge-separated states of the molecules when excited and the formation
   of columnar liquid crystal phase made these dyads candidates for

Abstract = {{Frailty, a critical intermediate status of the aging process that is at
   increased risk for negative health-related events, includes physical,
   cognitive, and psychosocial domains or phenotypes. Cognitive frailty is
   a condition recently defined by operationalized criteria describing
   coexisting physical frailty and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), with
   two proposed subtypes: potentially reversible cognitive frailty
   (physical frailty/MCI) and reversible cognitive frailty (physical
   frailty/pre- MCI subjective cognitive decline). In the present article,
   we reviewed the framework for the definition, different models, and the
   current epidemiology of cognitive frailty, also describing
   neurobiological mechanisms, and exploring the possible prevention of the
   cognitive frailty progression. Several studies suggested a relevant
   heterogeneity with prevalence estimates ranging 1.0-22.0\% (10.7-22.0\%
   in clinical-based settings and 1.0-4.4\% in population-based settings).
   Cross-sectional and longitudinal population-based studies showed that
   different cognitive frailty models may be associated with increased risk
   of functional disability, worsened quality of life, hospitalization,
   mortality, incidence of dementia, vascular dementia, and neurocognitive
   disorders. The operationalization of clinical constructs based on
   cognitive impairment related to physical causes (physical frailty, motor
   function decline, or other physical factors) appears to be interesting
   for dementia secondary prevention given the increased risk for
   progression to dementia of these clinical entities. Multidomain
   interventions have the potential to be effective in preventing cognitive
   frailty. In the near future, we need to establish more reliable clinical
   and research criteria, using different operational definitions for
   frailty and cognitive impairment, and useful clinical, biological, and
   imaging markers to implement intervention programs targeted to improve
   frailty, so preventing also late-life cognitive disorders.}},

Abstract = {{For marine top predators like seabirds, the oceans represent a multitude
   of habitats regarding oceanographic conditions and food availability.
   Worldwide, these marine habitats are being altered by changes in climate
   and increased anthropogenic impact. This is causing a growing concern on
   how seabird populations might adapt to these changes. Understanding how
   seabird populations respond to fluctuating environmental conditions and
   to what extent behavioral flexibility can buffer variations in food
   availability can help predict how seabirds may cope with changes in the
   marine environment. Such knowledge is important to implement proper
   long-term conservation measures intended to protect marine predators. We
   explored behavioral flexibility in choice of foraging habitat of
   chick-rearing black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla during multiple
   years. By comparing foraging behavior of individuals from two colonies
   with large differences in oceanographic conditions and distances to
   predictable feeding areas at the Norwegian shelf break, we investigated
   how foraging decisions are related to intrinsic and extrinsic factors.
   We found that proximity to the shelf break determined which factors
   drove the decision to forage there. At the colony near the shelf break,
   time of departure from the colony and wind speed were most important in
   driving the choice of habitat. At the colony farther from the shelf
   break, the decision to forage there was driven by adult body condition.
   Birds furthermore adjusted foraging behavior metrics according to time
   of the day, weather conditions, body condition, and the age of the
   chicks. The study shows that kittiwakes have high degree of flexibility
   in their behavioral response to a variable marine environment, which
   might help them buffer changes in prey distribution around the colonies.
   The flexibility is, however, dependent on the availability of foraging
   habitats near the colony.}},

Title = {{Indirect risk effects reduce feeding efficiency of ducks during spring}},

Abstract = {{Indirect risk effects of predators on prey behavior can have more of an
   impact on prey populations than direct consumptive effects. Predation
   risk can elicit more vigilance behavior in prey, reducing the amount of
   time available for other activities, such as foraging, which could
   potentially reduce foraging efficiency. Understanding the conditions
   associated with predation risk and the specific effects predation risk
   have on prey behavior is important because it has direct influences on
   the profitability of food items found under various conditions and
   states of the forager. The goals of this study were to assess how ducks
   perceived predation risk in various habitat types and how strongly
   perceived risk versus energetic demand affected foraging behavior. We
   manipulated food abundance in different wetland types in Illinois, USA
   to reduce confounding between food abundance and vegetation structure.
   We conducted focal-animal behavioral samples on five duck species in
   treatment and control plots and used generalized linear mixed-effects
   models to compare the effects of vegetation structure versus other
   factors on the intensity with which ducks fed and the duration of
   feeding stints. Mallards fed more intensively and, along with
   blue-winged teal, used longer feeding stints in open habitats,
   consistent with the hypothesis that limited visibility was perceived to
   have a greater predation risk than unlimited visibility. The species
   temporally nearest to nesting, wood ducks, were willing to take more
   risks for a greater food reward, consistent with an increase in a
   marginal value of energy as they approached nesting. Our results
   indicate that some duck species value energy differently based on the
   surrounding vegetation structure and density. Furthermore, increases in
   the marginal value of energy can be more influential than perceived risk
   in shaping foraging behavior patterns. Based on these findings, we
   conclude that the value of various food items is not solely determined
   by energy contained in the item but by conditions in which it is found
   and the state of the forager.}},

Abstract = {{The embodied mammalian brain evolved to adapt to an only partially known
   and knowable world. The adaptive labeling of the world is critically
   dependent on the neocortex which in turn is modulated by a range of
   subcortical systems such as the thalamus, ventral striatum, and the
   amygdala. A particular case in point is the learning paradigm of
   classical conditioning where acquired representations of states of the
   world such as sounds and visual features are associated with predefined
   discrete behavioral responses such as eye blinks and freezing. Learning
   progresses in a very specific order, where the animal first identifies
   the features of the task that are predictive of a motivational state and
   then forms the association of the current sensory state with a
   particular action and shapes this action to the specific contingency.
   This adaptive feature selection has both attentional and memory
   components, i.e., a behaviorally relevant state must be detected while
   its representation must be stabilized to allow its interfacing to output
   systems. Here, we present a computational model of the neocortical
   systems that underlie this feature detection process and its
   state-dependent modulation mediated by the amygdala and its downstream
   target the nucleus basalis of Meynert. In particular, we analyze the
   role of different populations of inhibitory interneurons in the
   regulation of cortical activity and their state-dependent gating of
   sensory signals. In our model, we show that the neuromodulator
   acetylcholine (ACh), which is in turn under control of the amygdala,
   plays a distinct role in the dynamics of each population and their
   associated gating function serving the detection of novel sensory
   features not captured in the state of the network, facilitating the
   adjustment of cortical sensory representations and regulating the
   switching between modes of attention and learning.}},

   Individual body size had a strong effect on the activity-boldness
   relationship within the low-predation population from flowing water

Abstract = {{Many prey species detect predators through chemoreception, particularly
   in low-visibility aquatic environments. Moreover, injury-released
   chemical cues from conspecifics are often perceived as a reliable
   indicator of predation threat. We examined whether males of the
   freshwater caridean shrimp Palaemon argentinus (Nobili, 1901) react to
   different types of infochemicals associated with predation threat.
   Shrimp were exposed to chemical stimuli from starved individuals of a
   predatory fish (Australoheros facetus (Jenyns, 1842)) and from crushed
   conspecific shrimp. Our experiment showed that P. argentinus reacts to
   waterborne substances associated with predation threat, indicating that
   chemical cues mediate behavioural antipredator responses. Shrimp adopted
   an appropriate antipredator behaviour (reduced swimming activity) in
   response to chemical stimuli from A. facetus, and from crushed
   conspecifics, relative to a distilled-water control. The chemical
   stimuli from crushed conspecifics elicited the strongest reduction in
   swimming activity. Reduced movement, a common response in prey animals
   to the presence of predators, was not entirely consistent because shrimp
   increased their walking time in response to the chemical stimuli that
   were investigated. The ability to alter behaviour based on
   vision-independent perception of ambient risk would be highly useful for
   macroinvertebrate prey species such as P. argentinus living in eutrophic
   shallow lakes where visibility is often reduced. Our results
   demonstrated chemosensory recognition of predation risk highlighting the
   important role of chemical cues in the behavioural ecology of this
   shrimp, especially with regards to predator-prey interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Late arrival on the breeding grounds has been associated with reduced
   fitness in migratory birds. Because migratory stopover accounts for the
   majority of time spent on migration, how individuals respond to both
   exogenous and endogenous factors associated with stopover will influence
   the pace of migration and arrival timing on the breeding grounds. Among
   the most important endogenous factors, body condition (i.e. fat stores)
   is expected to influence both movement behavior and departure decisions
   of individual migrants during stopover. In a novel experiment, we
   manipulated the condition of after-second-year (adult) male American
   Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) captured during spring migratory
   stopover and radio-tracked all individuals after release using a passive
   automated telemetry array and conventional hand tracking. After
   accounting for the positive effect of tailwind and capture date on
   departure probability, we demonstrated that body condition influenced
   both the movement behavior of individuals and stopover duration.
   Individual movement decreased throughout the stopover period at a rate
   of 0.7 km day(-1), supporting the notion that birds progressively limit
   their movements as stopover progresses. However, treatment birds whose
   condition was experimentally reduced (i.e. food-restricted) exhibited
   similar to 3.4 times greater daily movement rates, and control birds
   were 4 times more likely to depart on a given day than treatment birds.
   These results underscore the importance of energetic condition in
   mediating the movement and stopover dynamics of migratory birds.
   Further, despite their capacity to make behavioral adjustments, our
   results suggest migratory songbirds that experience decreases in body
   condition during migration (which could result from inclement weather or
   low-quality stopover habitat) are likely to be delayed in their arrival
   on the breeding grounds, which could lower reproductive performance and
   ultimately have population-level ramifications.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Winter is an ecologically challenging season for ectothermic cold-water
   fish in natural streams because of reduced flow and freezing. Hydropower
   regulation in many northern rivers increase winter stream flow and
   temperatures, and reduce ice formation and surface ice cover. From a
   background review of knowledge about e.g. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)
   and brown trout (Salmo trutta) winter survival strategies, we explore
   responses to hydropower impacts as a basis for adaptive management,
   mitigating strategies, and future research. Winter intensity and
   duration, hydrologic conditions and channel characteristics drive
   complex ice processes which become more complex and pervasive in
   smaller, high-gradient streams. Stream ice formation may be divided into
   the dynamic period `freeze-up' in early winter with sub-surface ice,
   more stable `mid-winter' with surface ice, and the ecologically
   challenging `ice break-up' in winter-spring with potential mechanical
   ice runs and scouring. The characteristics of periods vary depending on
   climate and hydropower regulation. In reaches downstream of power-plant
   outlets water temperature may increase and reduce surface ice formation.
   The mid-winter period destabilize or become absent. In bypass reaches
   flows decrease and facilitate freezing and ice production. Knowledge
   about longitudinal water temperature changes is limited. Hydro-peaked
   systems may aggravate high-low flow effects. A basic winter survival
   strategy in salmon and trout is energy storage, but also reduced
   metabolism, tolerance and starvation effected by quiescence. Energy
   storage may depend on local conditions, but there is little indication
   of adaptation to local thermal climates. Intraspecific phenotypic
   plasticity is important. The main behavioural strategy is risk-reducing
   sheltering in the substratum or deep areas, and nocturnal activity.
   Local movements between daytime refuges and nighttime slow-current
   activity areas are usually limited to meters. Larger fish may move more
   and aggregate in restricted suitable deep-slow refuge habitats such as
   pools and deep glides. Fish cope with ordinary thermal ice phenomena,
   and do not appear to become trapped in ice. Surface ice may reduce fish
   metabolism, but other factors, e.g. availability of substrate shelter,
   may override this effect. Mechanical ice break-ups and less surface ice
   may reduce survival. An adaptive mitigating strategy may be higher
   regulated flows in winter which increase rearing and/or resting habitat
   and survival, but studies are few and knowledge is limited. However,
   higher regulated flows also affect temperature regime. Low flows
   increase ice formation, reduce and fragment available habitat, and may
   reduce egg and fish survival. Influx of ground water may mitigate these
   impacts, as will stabilize minimum flows. Sudden drops in regulated
   water discharge should be avoided. Fish may strand, in particular at low
   temperatures in the daytime when fish are less mobile and seek shelter.
   The challenging winter season is understudied, and important management
   considerations and future research areas for better adaptive management
   are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Attacks by aquatic predators generate frontal water disturbances
   characterised by low-frequency gradients in pressure and particle
   motion. Low-frequency hearing is highly developed in cephalopods. Thus,
   we examined behavioural responses in juvenile cuttlefish to infrasonic
   accelerations mimicking main aspects of the hydrodynamic signals created
   by predators. In the experimental set-up, animals and their surrounding
   water moved as a unit to minimise lateral line activation and to allow
   examination of the contribution by the inner ear. Behavioural responses
   were tested in light versus darkness and after food deprivation
   following a `simulated' hunting opportunity. At low acceleration levels,
   colour change threshold at 3, 5 and 9 Hz was 0.028, 0.038 and 0.035 m
   s(-2), respectively. At higher stimulus levels, jet-propulsed escape
   responses thresholds in daylight were 0.043, 0.065 and 0.069 m s(-2) at
   3, 5 and 9 Hz, respectively, and not significantly different from the
   corresponding darkness thresholds of 0.043, 0.071 and 0.064 m s(-2). In
   a simulated hunting mode, escape thresholds were significantly higher at
   3 Hz (0.118 m s(-2)) but not at 9 Hz (0.134 m s(-2)). Escape responses
   were directional, and overall followed the direction of the initial
   particle acceleration, with mean escape angles from 313 to 33 deg for
   all three experiments. Thus, in the wild, particle acceleration might
   cause escape responses directed away from striking predators but towards
   suction-feeding predators. We suggest that cuttlefish jet-propulsed
   escape behaviour has evolved to be elicited by the early hydrodynamic
   disturbances generated during predator encounters, and that the inner
   ear plays an essential role in the acoustic escape responses.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{57-68}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{For social foragers, movement as a group could increase foraging
   efficiency through collective discovery of high-quality food sources.
   This would require an efficient mechanism for transferring information
   about food quality between individuals. Conversely, the constraints of
   foraging as a cohesive group could decrease efficiency; grouping may
   persist to serve other functions such as protection from predators. To
   test what drives cohesion in herbivores, we manipulated patch shape and
   within-patch pattern of food quality and quantified the effects on group
   level diet selection by a social herbivore, the fallow deer, Dama dama.
   We arranged feeders containing fodder in lines or blocks, and
   manipulated the pattern of food quality within patches by adding tannin,
   a plant secondary compound that decreases palatability. We quantified
   the relative consumption of low- and high-tannin food to compare diet
   selectivity at the group level between patch treatments. If group
   foraging evolved to increase foraging efficiency, altering the spatial
   arrangement of food should not affect diet selectivity because
   information about food location and quality is shared. We found,
   however, that the herd expressed different levels of selectivity between
   both patch shapes and food quality patterns. Deer selected better diets
   in blocks than lines. In lines, the herd selected better diets when
   quality varied between alternate feeders rather than between the two
   halves of the patch, suggesting a reliance on personal rather than group
   information. Deer consumed the most at patch centres in all treatments
   except in blocks with high-tannin centres, but diet selection was poorer
   in the latter compared to blocks with low-tannin centres. Aggregation at
   the centre of patches appears to have restricted exploitation of the
   best food. Predation pressure and/or resource variability may have
   favoured the evolution of a foraging strategy that prioritizes social
   cohesion over effective diet selection. (C) 2017 The Association for the

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{85-96}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Learning by observing others has been acknowledged as a powerful
   learning strategy. Whereas in several species observation of fear
   conditioning or other operational procedures can improve subsequent
   performance during actual learning, much less attention has been paid to
   observational learning of spatial discrimination tasks. To this end, we
   developed a set of procedures in which the spatial memory of adult rats,
   Rattus norvegicus, was tested in an eight-arm radial maze. Moreover, in
   view of controversial information concerning the incidence of mistakes
   made by demonstrators on the effectiveness of observational learning,
   our observer rats watched experienced or nontrained demonstrators.
   Food-deprived observers and demonstrators were initially habituated to
   the maze with all arms baited. Then observers were placed in a mesh cage
   positioned above the maze while a demonstrator rat was locating the
   spatial position of three baited arms. Rats observing conspecifics
   progressively learning the spatial discrimination improved subsequent
   performance compared to a control group watching an empty maze, but only
   if the configuration of baited arms presented during demonstration and
   testing matched. Therefore, rats integrated relevant spatial information
   during observation and used it efficiently when their spatial
   discrimination was tested in the maze. However, when the information was
   provided by trained demonstrators, making no mistakes and visiting only
   baited arms, observer rats failed to exhibit improved performance.
   Nevertheless, when given an initial habituation without food rewards,
   rats were subsequently able to benefit from observation of trained
   demonstrators thus showing that watching mistakes was not necessary for
   successful observational learning. Together, these findings indicate
   that rats can acquire spatial information via observation enabling more
   pertinent search strategies during testing and that for observation to
   be beneficial, what is observed must be sufficiently relevant or novel
   to complement existing knowledge ( here initial habituation with or
   without rewards). (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Seasonal variation in food resources and predation risk imposes major
   constraints on herbivores, which must adjust their behaviour to maximize
   their energy intake and survival. In seasonally driven landscapes, it is
   not yet clear what the primary drivers are that shape seasonal variation
   in vigilance and feeding rates. These rates have been shown to vary in
   relation to various environmental, social and individual factors, but
   many of these factors also vary through the year, due to variation in
   food supply. We studied wild female eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus
   giganteus, under low predation risk over a year to investigate whether
   vigilance and feeding rates varied seasonally and whether this variation
   was mainly driven by food quantity or quality, group size or
   individuals' reproductive states. Both vigilance and feeding rates
   varied seasonally, as did food quantity and quality and group size.
   Vigilance, including antipredator (head orientation away from the group)
   and exclusive (i.e. vigilance without chewing) vigilance, decreased and
   feeding rate increased with increasing group size. However, because
   group size increased with food quality and quantity, food resources
   emerged as the primary driver of variation in behavioural strategies.
   These results suggest that the observed effects of group size on the
   trade-off between food acquisition and safety are in fact corollaries of
   the seasonal variation in food supply in our study system, in which the
   risk of predation on adults is low, and hence are by-products of the
   foraging choices made by kangaroos in response to the dynamics of the
   quantity and quality of food. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Biologging technologies are changing the way in which the marine
   environment is observed and monitored. However, because device retrieval
   is typically required to access the high-resolution data they collect,
   their use is generally restricted to those animals that predictably
   return to land. Data abstraction and transmission techniques aim to
   address this, although currently these are limited in scope and do not
   incorporate, for example, acceleration measurements which can quantify
   animal behaviours and movement patterns over fine-scales. In this study,
   we present a new method for the collection, abstraction and transmission
   of accelerometer data from free-ranging marine predators via the Argos
   satellite system. We test run the technique on 20 juvenile southern
   elephant seals Mirounga leonina from the Kerguelen Islands during their
   first months at sea following weaning. Using retrieved archival data
   from nine individuals that returned to the colony, we compare and
   validate abstracted transmissions against outputs from established
   accelerometer processing procedures. Abstracted transmissions included
   estimates, across five segments of a dive profile, of time spent in prey
   catch attempt (PrCA) behaviours, swimming effort and pitch. These were
   then summarised and compared to archival outputs across three dive
   phases: descent, bottom and ascent. Correlations between the two
   datasets were variable but generally good (dependent on dive phase,
   marginal R-2 values of between .45 and .6 to>.9) and consistent between
   individuals. Transmitted estimates of PrCA behaviours and swimming
   effort were positively biased to those from archival processing. Data
   from this study represent some of the first remotely transmitted
   quantifications from accelerometers. The methods presented and analysed
   can be used to provide novel insight towards the behaviours and
   movements of free-ranging marine predators, such as juvenile southern
   elephant seals, from whom logger retrieval is challenging. Future
   applications could however benefit from some adaption, particularly to
   reduce positive bias in transmitted PrCA behaviours and swimming effort,
   for which this study provides useful insight.}},

Abstract = {{The eating beahaviour of obese population can be influenced by various
   psychological factors such us eating restriction, lack of control or
   emotional eating. Although in most ocassions this variables have been
   studied in obese population, the aim of this study is to evaluate the
   relations between this factors with eating behaviour in non-obese
   population and relate this behaviour with Edorexia Syndrome. A battery
   of psychological tests was applied to 75 students of Murcia University,
   this battery consisted of the Edorexia Syndrome Questionnaire, Big Five
   Personality Questionnaire and the Coping Response Inventory (CRI-A). The
   results showed how the Edorexia Syndrome was related with a dicrease in
   emotional stability, emotional control and positive reevaluation as well
   as an increase in acceptance and resignation. In addition, people with
   Edorexia Syndrome were related to dieting, food deprivation, exercising
   and consumption without needing. This results are explained by the Five
   Ways Theory (Macht, 2008) which relates the lack of skills to cope with
   emotions with the uncontrollable abuse of food.}},

Abstract = {{Because both predation risk and resource quality have a pivotal role in
   ecological communities, their combined effects were assessed in stream
   detritivores. Bioassays were conducted using a simplified trophic chain,
   coupling effects of predation risk and basal resources with different
   nutritious qualities, namely, a predator planarian Dugesia
   subtentaculata, a caddisfly shredder Sericostoma vittatum, a dipteran
   collector Chironomus riparius, native alder Alnus glutinosa and invasive
   eucalypt Eucalyptus globulus. We investigated whether individual
   performance of C. riparius larvae is affected under predation risk and
   whether the response can be mediated by resource quality. We also
   assessed whether shredder-collector interactions are altered under these
   conditions. Predation risk and food quality influenced leaf
   decomposition and C. riparius growth independently. Chironomus riparius
   fed preferentially on alders, resulting in increased growth rate. Litter
   processing decreased under planarian presence, in both leaf types,
   impairing the growth of C. riparius larvae, this effect being
   exacerbated with eucalypts. Chironomus riparius growth was also reduced
   in the presence of the caddisfly, suggesting competition between these
   species, irrespective of planarian presence, but dependent on leaf type.
   The present study highlighted the importance of assessing predator
   influence along detritus-based processing chains, because predation risk
   may result in sublethal costs, with potential cascading effects.}},

Abstract = {{Life history theory integrates ecological, physiological, and molecular
   layers within an evolutionary framework to understand organisms'
   strategies to optimize survival and reproduction. Two life history
   hypotheses and their implications for child growth, development, and
   health (illustrated in the South African context) are reviewed here. One
   hypothesis suggests that there is an energy trade-off between linear
   growth and brain growth. Undernutrition in infancy and childhood may
   trigger adaptive physiological mechanisms prioritizing the brain at the
   expense of body growth. Another hypothesis is that the period from
   conception to infancy is a critical window of developmental plasticity
   of linear growth, the duration of which may vary between and within
   populations. The transition from infancy to childhood may mark the end
   of a critical window of opportunity for improving child growth. Both
   hypotheses emphasize the developmental plasticity of linear growth and
   the potential determinants of growth variability (including the role of
   parent-offspring conflict in maternal resources allocation).
   Implications of these hypotheses in populations with high burdens of
   undernutrition and infections are discussed. In South Africa, HIV/AIDS
   during pregnancy (associated with adverse birth outcomes, short duration
   of breastfeeding, and social consequences) may lead to a shortened
   window of developmental plasticity of growth. Furthermore,
   undernutrition and infectious diseases in children living in South
   Africa, a country undergoing a rapid nutrition transition, may have
   adverse consequences on individuals' cognitive abilities and risks of
   cardio-metabolic diseases. Studies are needed to identify physiological
   mechanisms underlying energy allocation between biological functions and
   their potential impacts on health.}},

Pages = {{85-92}},

Abstract = {{Supplemental feeding, whether intentional or accidental, alters wildlife
   foraging behaviors and may have consequences at the population and
   ecosystem levels. Wildlife feeding may also cause animals to develop
   aggressive behaviors toward conspecifics and people. The risks to humans
   is potentially accrued when the species is a native predator. Food-based
   attraction has been implicated in the development of human-directed
   aggression in the dingo (Canis lupus dingo) population on Fraser Island,
   Queensland, Australia. Management strategies such as education programs,
   prohibition of inappropriate human behaviors, and fencing of garbage
   dumps have been implemented to stop the (intentional or inadvertent)
   feeding of dingoes by people. Despite these efforts, dingoes continue to
   obtain human-sourced food, suggesting that other means of supplemental
   feeding are still available. One possible source of subsidized food is
   recreational fishing, which is a popular activity on the island. We
   conducted a quasi-experimental study during May-June 2014 of dingo
   foraging behaviors on the eastern beach of Fraser Island. We
   video-recorded the behaviors of lone and groups of dingoes when they
   were in the vicinity of anglers or by themselves. We hypothesized that
   if recreational fishing was a source of subsidies to dingoes, then there
   would be differences in dingo foraging behavior among the 2 groups. We
   found that in the absence of anglers, dingoes spent 81\% of their time
   engaged in mobile food-related behaviors. When anglers were present,
   however, they spent 52\% of their time sitting and resting. These
   results suggest that dingoes shifted from active searching to a sit and
   wait foraging mode upon detecting recreational anglers. We observed an
   event in which a dingo spent 2hours resting near an angler, then dug up
   the fish remains buried by the man as soon as he had left the area. This
   and other anecdotal evidence support the view that the changes in dingo
   foraging activity detected in this study were related to increased
   opportunities to secure food from anglers. Recreational fishing may play
   an important role in the inadvertent subsidizing of dingoes on Fraser
   Island, although further investigations are needed before proposing and
   implementing additional conservation and management actions. (c) 2017
   The Wildlife Society.
   We demonstrate that dingoes on Fraser Island, Queensland, Australia,
   alter their locomotor and foraging behaviors in the presence of anglers.
   We advocate for further research in the role of recreational fishing in
   the development of negative dingo-human interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout the animal kingdom, individual variation in reproductive
   success is commonly observed, even under similar environmental
   conditions. However, the mechanisms behind such differences remain
   unclear. The notion of behavioural consistency in animals has developed
   rapidly since the early 21st century partly as an approach to understand
   among-individual differences. In this context, a number of studies have
   highlighted the influence of pair assortment in personality on breeding
   success. In this study, we related breeding success to individual
   behaviour, specifically a risk-taking behaviour, and pair assortment per
   behaviour in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) over two breeding
   seasons of contrasting food availability. On Bird Island, Algoa Bay,
   South Africa, we used indices of boldness and overall mobility in
   penguins' nest defence behaviour as a response to a standard pedestrian
   approach during chick-rearing. These behaviours were consistent over the
   trials and indicated these traits may be related to personality in
   African penguins. Individuals were categorized as risk-prone (bold,
   mobile) or risk-averse (shy, non-mobile). We then assessed their
   breeding success through chick growth and survival over 4weeks in 2015
   and 2016. There was weak positive assortment of pairs in relation to
   nest defence behaviour. However, pair assortment did not significantly
   influence birds' breeding success. Shy penguins were generally the most
   successful (had the highest chick growth rates), which was especially
   apparent during a food shortage in 2016, possibly reflecting a higher
   energy investment when foraging. In contrast, chicks from bold parents
   grew significantly slower, especially in 2016. Bold parents may defend
   their nest successfully against predation or intra-specific aggression
   when food is abundant, but when predation risks are limited and food
   availability is low, this strategy may not be beneficial. In the context
   of climate change, where food shortage events may become more frequent,
   risk-averse individuals may be favoured and genetic diversity may be
   reduced in African penguins.}},

Abstract = {{Food addiction is characterized by poorly controlled intake of
   highly-palatable, calorically-dense, foods. While previous studies
   indicate that risk factors for food addiction are similar to substance
   use disorders (SUD), these studies have looked at food addiction and SUD
   in independent samples, limiting the ability to directly compare food
   addiction to SUD. The present study was conducted to assess rates of
   post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, childhood and adult
   trauma exposure, as well as presence and severity of emotion
   dysregulation, in a sample of women (N = 229) who either meet criteria
   for no addiction, food addiction only or SUD only. The prevalence of
   food addiction was 183\% and the prevalence of SUD was 30.6\% in this
   sample. Women with food addiction and women with SUD endorsed more
   depression and PTSD symptoms when compared with individuals with no
   addiction. Individuals with food addiction and SUD had higher total
   emotion dysregulation scores, specifically with difficulties in goal
   directed behaviors, non-acceptance of emotional responses, impulse
   control, limited access to emotion regulation strategies, and lack of
   emotional clarity, when compared to individuals with no addiction (all
   p's < 0.05). There were no differences in PTSD and depression symptoms

   total:childhood (p < 0.01) and adulthood trauma (p < 0.01) as compared
   with women with no addiction or food addiction. These results suggest
   that women with food addiction and those with SUD share similar

Abstract = {{Childhood obesity/overweight (OB/OW) displayed a rapid increase and high
   prevalence in the last few decades in preschool-aged children, which
   raised health concerns across the world and motivated researchers to
   investigate the factors that underlie childhood obesity. The current
   study examined parenting styles and child-feeding practices as potential
   predictors for OB/OW in preschool children, controlling for child's
   temperament, which has been shown to be linked with OB/OW. The sample
   included 61 normal weight (NW) and 61 obese/overweight (OB/OW) Turkish
   pre-schoolers (M age = 62.2 months; SD = 7.64, range = 45-80 months).
   Parenting styles (authoritarian, authoritative), child-feeding practices
   (restriction, pressure to eat, monitoring), and child's temperament
   (negative affectivity) were measured with mothers' reports. Results
   showed that authoritarian parenting and maternal pressure to eat were
   the two parenting variables that significantly predicted child's weight
   status; the odds of being OB/OW was 4.71 times higher in children whose
   mothers used higher authoritarian parenting style, and was 0.44 times
   lower when mothers pressured their child to eat. These findings suggest
   that understanding the unique role of different aspects of parenting in
   the risk of early OB/OW status of children would be important in
   developing more effective interventions from early years in life. (C)

Abstract = {{Because of the well-established effect of food neophobia on children's
   variety of food consumption, the availability of valid measures of food
   neophobia in young children is necessary. We studied a Portuguese
   version of the Child's Food Neophobia Scale (CFNS), assessing its
   validity and reliability. The CFNS was completed by 388 parents of 2-to
   6-year-old children. Construct validity was examined through an
   exploratory factorial analysis and a confirmatory factorial analysis.
   Measurement invariance (child's age and sex) and reliability analysis
   were examined. Correlational analyses between the CFNS and children's
   eating habits, food preferences and temperament dimensions were run. The
   results support a two-factor solution, suggesting two opposite
   dimensions: Food Neophobia and Food Neophilia. Invariance analysis
   showed the same structure for both age groups (2- to 4 vs. 5- to 6-year
   old), although only partial metric invariance across sex groups was
   attained. For both Food Neophobia and Food Neophilia subscales, good
   internal consistency and excellent test retest reliability were
   achieved, as well as a moderate negative association between the two
   groups, of items. Higher scores in Food Neophobia and lower scores in
   Food Neophilia were significantly correlated with a more inhibited
   temperament, lower preference for healthy foods, acceptance of fewer
   foods, less frequent consumption of healthy foods, and consumption of a
   smaller variety of fruits, vegetables and legumes. Children's unhealthy
   food intake was not associated with both CNFS subscales. Our preliminary
   findings support the adequacy of this version of CFNS for the Portuguese
   population. Further studies are needed to confirm the two-dimensional
   structure of the scale and explore the implications of this structure.

   Beach-dwelling Jumping Spider}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Animal personality, defined as consistent differences between
   individuals in behavior, has been the subject of hundreds if not
   thousands of papers. However, little work explores the fitness
   consequences of variation in behavior within individuals, or
   intraindividual variability (IIV). We probe the effects of behavioral
   IIV on predator-prey interaction outcomes in beach-dwelling jumping
   spiders (Terralonus californicus). Prior studies have found that spiders
   with higher body condition (body mass relative to size) behave more
   variably. Thus, we hypothesized that jumping spider activity level IIV
   would relate positively to foraging performance. To address this, we
   tested for associations between activity IIV, average activity level,
   and two measures of foraging success in laboratory mesocosms: change in
   spider mass and the number of prey killed. Activity IIV positively
   correlated with the mass that spiders gained from prey, but not with the
   number of prey killed. This suggests that spiders with high IIV consumed
   a greater proportion of their prey or used less energy. Interestingly,
   average activity level (personality) predicted neither metric of
   foraging success, indicating that behavioral IIV can predict metrics of
   success that personality does not. Therefore, our findings suggest that
   IIV should be considered alongside personality in studies of
   predator-prey interactions.}},

Journal = {{BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Excess dietary fructose intake associated with metabolic
   syndrome and insulin resistance and increased risk of developing type 2
   diabetes. Previous animal studies have reported that diabetic animals
   have significantly impaired behavioural and cognitive functions,
   pathological synaptic function and impaired expression of glutamate
   receptors. Correction of the antioxidant status of laboratory rodents
   largely prevents the development of fructose-induced plurimetabolic
   changes in the nervous system. We suggest a novel concept of efficiency
   of Stevia leaves for treatment of central diabetic neuropathy.
   Methods: By in vivo extracellular studies induced spike activity of
   hippocampal neurons during high frequency stimulation of entorhinal
   cortex, as well as neurons of basolateral amygdala to high-frequency
   stimulation of the hippocampus effects of Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni
   plant evaluated in synaptic activity in the brain of fructose-enriched
   diet rats. In the conditions of metabolic disorders caused by fructose,
   antioxidant activity of Stevia rebaudiana was assessed by measuring the
   NOX activity of the hippocampus, amygdala and spinal cord.
   Results: In this study, the characteristic features of the metabolic
   effects of dietary fructose on synaptic plasticity in hippocampal
   neurons and basolateral amygdala and the state of the NADPH oxidase
   (NOX) oxidative system of these brain formations are revealed, as well
   as the prospects for development of multitarget and polyfunctional
   phytopreparations (with adaptogenic, antioxidant, antidiabetic,
   nootropic activity) from native raw material of Stevia rebaudiana.
   Stevia modulates degree of expressiveness of potentiation/depression
   (approaches but fails to achieve the norm) by shifting the percentage
   balance in favor of depressor type of responses during high-frequency
   stimulation, indicating its adaptogenic role in plasticity of neural
   networks. Under the action of fructose an increase (3-5 times) in
   specific quantity of total fraction of NOX isoforms isolated from the
   central nervous system tissue (amygdala, hippocampus, spinal cord) was
   revealed. Stevia exhibits an antistress, membrane-stabilizing role
   reducing the level of total fractions of NOX isoforms from central
   nervous system tissues and regulates NADPH-dependent O-2(-) producing
   activity.
   Conclusion: Generally, in condition of metabolic disorders caused by
   intensive consumption of dietary fructose Stevia leaves contributes to
   the control of neuronal synaptic plasticity possibly influencing the
   conjugated NOX-specific targets.}},

Abstract = {{Metabolism, behaviour and growth are highly flexible in fish species,
   and inter-individual variation in these traits is evolutionarily and
   ecologically significant. It has long been suggested that these traits
   co-vary, although their relationships are debated. In the present study,
   we investigated whether metabolism, behaviour, growth and the potential
   relationships among them vary with food availability in sterile triploid
   carp. In this experimental animal model, we investigated the standard
   metabolic rate (SMR), growth performance and personality traits (i.e.
   activity, exploration and boldness) of juvenile individuals before and
   after 25 days of rearing in which fish were fed either once or twice a
   day to satiation. Inter-individual differences in SMR in each group
   showed high repeatability across the experimental period, and twice-fed
   fish showed higher SMRs than once-fed fish after 25 days of rearing.
   Compared with the once-fed group, the twice-fed group showed higher
   feeding rates (FRs) and lower feeding efficiencies (FEs) but similar
   specific growth rates (SGRs). None of the personality traits was
   affected by food availability. Furthermore, both boldness and
   exploration were highly repeatable throughout the experiment in the
   group fed twice a day, whereas only exploration showed repeatability in
   the group fed once a day. In the once-fed group, SMR and the personality

Title = {{Nutrition in the First 1000 Days: Ten Practices to Minimize Obesity
   Emerging from Published Science}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity has increased in most
   countries the last decades. Considering this in a simplistic way, we can
   say that obesity is the result of an imbalance between energy intake and
   energy expenditure. Moreover, the environment from conception to
   childhood could influence the child's future health. The first 1000 days
   of life start with woman's pregnancy, and offer a unique window of
   opportunity to contribute to obesity prevention. In light of the actual
   literature, the aim of our article is to discuss a proposal of 10 good
   practices to minimize obesity in the first 1000 days emerging from
   published science. (1) Both the mother's and the father's behaviors are
   important. A balanced diet with appropriate fat and protein intake, and
   favoring fruits and vegetables, is recommended for both parents during
   the conception period and pregnancy. Furthermore, overweight obese women
   who are planning to become pregnant should reduce their weight before
   conception. (2) During pregnancy, at birth, and during early life, body
   composition measurements are crucial to monitor the baby's growth. (3)
   Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended at the beginning of life until
   six months of age. (4) Four to six months of age is the optimal window
   to introduce complementary feeding. Until one year of age, breast milk
   or follow-on commercial formula is the main recommended feeding source,
   and cow's milk should be avoided until one year of age. (5) Fruit and
   vegetable introduction should begin early. Daily variety, diversity in a
   meal, and repeated exposure to the food, up to eight times, are
   efficient strategies to increase acceptance of food not well accepted at
   first. There is no need to add sugar, salt, or sugary fluids to the
   diet. (6) Respect the child's appetite and avoid coercive ``clean your
   plate{''} feeding practices. Adapt the portion of food and don't use
   food as reward for good behavior. (7) Limit animal protein intake in
   early life to reduce the risk of an early adiposity rebound. Growing-up
   milk for children between one and three years of age should be preferred
   to cow's milk, in order to limit intake and meet essential fatty acid
   and iron needs. (8) The intake of adequate fat containing essential
   fatty acids should be promoted. (9) Parents should be role models when
   feeding, with TV and other screens turned-off during meals. (10)
   Preventive interventions consisting of promoting physical activity and
   sufficient time dedicated to sleep should be employed. In fact, short
   sleep duration may be associated with increased risk of developing
   obesity. Based on literature reviews, and given the suggestions
   described in this manuscript, concerted public health efforts are needed
   to achieve the healthy objectives for obesity and nutrition, and to
   fight the childhood obesity epidemic.}},

Abstract = {{Phenological advancement allows individuals to adapt to climate change
   by timing life-history events to the availability of key resources so
   that individual fitness is maximized. However, different trophic levels
   may respond to changes in their environment at different rates,
   potentially leading to a phenological mismatch. This may be especially
   apparent in the highly seasonal arctic environment that is experiencing
   the effects of climate change more so than any other region. During a
   14-year study near Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska, we estimated
   phenological advancement in egg laying in relation to snowmelt for eight
   arctic-breeding shorebirds and investigated potential linkages to
   species-specific life-history characteristics. We found that snowmelt
   advanced 0.8days/yearsix times faster than the prior 60-year period.
   During this same time, six of the eight species exhibited phenological
   advancement in laying dates (varying among species from 0.1 to 0.9days
   earlier per year), although no species appeared capable of keeping pace
   with advancing snowmelt. Phenological changes were likely the result of
   high phenotypic plasticity, as all species investigated in this study
   showed high interannual variability in lay dates. Commonality among
   species with similar response rates to timing of snowmelt suggests that
   nesting later and having an opportunistic settlement strategy may
   increase the adaptability of some species to changing climate
   conditions. Other life-history characteristics, such as migration
   strategy, previous site experience, and mate fidelity did not influence
   the ability of individuals to advance laying dates. As a failure to
   advance egg laying is likely to result in greater phenological mismatch,
   our study provides an initial assessment of the relative risk of species
   to long-term climatic changes.}},

Abstract = {{Predators select prey so as to maximize energy and minimize manipulation
   time. In order to reduce prey detection and handling time, individuals
   must actively select their foraging space (microhabitat) and populations
   exhibit morphologies that are best suited for capturing locally
   available prey. We explored how variation in diet correlates with
   habitat type, and how these factors influence key morphological
   structures (mouth gape, eye diameter, fin length, fin area, and pectoral
   fin ratio) in a common microcarnivorous cryptic reef fish species, the
   triplefin Helcogrammoides cunninghami. In a mensurative experiment
   carried out at six kelp-dominated sites, we observed considerable
   differences in diet along 400km of the Chilean coast coincident with
   variation in habitat availability and prey distributions. Triplefins
   preferred a single prey type (bivalves or barnacles) at northern sites,
   coincident with a low diversity of foraging habitats. In contrast,
   southern sites presented varied and heterogeneous habitats, where
   triplefin diets were more diverse and included amphipods, decapods, and
   cumaceans. Allometry-corrected results indicated that some morphological
   structures were consistently correlated with different prey items.
   Specifically, large mouth gape was associated with the capture of highly
   mobile prey such as decapods, while small mouth gape was more associated
   with cumaceans and copepods. In contrast, triplefins that capture
   sessile prey such as hydroids tend to have larger eyes. Therefore,
   morphological structures co-vary with habitat selection and prey usage
   in this species. Our study shows how an abundant generalist reef fish
   exhibits variable feeding morphologies in response to the distribution
   of potential habitats and prey throughout its range.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity and hyperinsulinemia are risk factors for stroke. We tested the
   hypothesis that caloric restriction, which reduces the incidence of
   age-related obesity and metabolic syndrome, may represent an efficient
   and cost-effective strategy for preventing stroke and its devastating
   consequences. To this end, we placed aged, obese Sprague-Dawley aged
   rats on a calorie-restricted diet for 8 weeks prior to the experimental
   infarction. Stroke in this animal model caused a progressive decrease in
   weight that reached a minimum at day 6 for the young rats, and at day 10
   for the aged, ad libitum-fed rats. However, in aged animals that were
   calorie-restricted prior to stroke, body weight did not decrease after
   stroke, but we noted accelerated body weight gain shortly thereafter
   starting at day 5 poststroke. Moreover, calorie-restricted aged animals
   showed improved behavioral recovery in tasks requiring complex
   sensorimotor skills, or in tasks requiring cutaneous sensitivity and
   sensorimotor integration or spatial memory. Likewise, calorie-restricted
   aged rats showed significant poststroke increases in serum glucose,
   insulin, and IGF1 levels, as well as CR-specific changes in the
   expression of gene transcripts involved in glycogen metabolism, IGF
   signaling, apoptosis, arteriogenesis, and hypoxia. In conclusion, our

Title = {{Male hyraxes increase countersinging as strangers become `nasty
   neighbours'}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{9-14}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Many territorial animals interact less aggressively with neighbours than
   with strangers, a phenomenon known as the `dear enemy' effect, although
   some species show the opposite behaviour. Rock hyraxes, Procavia
   capensis, are social mammals that communicate via a rich acoustic
   repertoire. Male hyraxes produce elaborate advertisement calls (i.e.
   songs) both spontaneously and in response to occasional
   attention-grabbing events (e.g. pup screams, agonistic interaction), as
   well as to conspecific male songs. When replying to conspecific songs,
   male hyraxes tend to respond more to familiar males than to strangers,
   reflecting the `nasty neighbour' effect. Our study relates to the
   general question of why some species respond aggressively towards
   neighbours, while others are more aggressive towards strangers. We
   hypothesized that male hyraxes eventually familiarize themselves with a
   stranger, subsequently perceiving its intentions as highly threatening
   and deserving of a vocal response. To simulate the presence of a
   stranger in the area we exposed wild hyrax groups to playbacks of
   natural songs of unfamiliar hyraxes. Male rock hyraxes became more
   likely to reply to a stranger's song over time, but this was independent
   of the number of times they heard the song. This suggests that either
   (1) the threat presented by a stranger increases when it is no longer
   perceived as transient or (2) because listeners do not physically
   encounter the stranger, they perceive replying aggressively as a
   low-risk response. Our work implies that species may demonstrate a range
   of condition-dependent behaviours instead of a dichotomy between the
   `nasty neighbour' and `dear enemy' strategies. (C) 2017 The Association

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{87-98}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Understanding animal movements is a key prerequisite for deciphering
   ecological processes such as population dynamics, community structure or
   biological invasions. Many animals restrict their movements to certain
   areas (home ranges) by alternating visits among several suitable sites.
   The dynamics of these recursive movements are assumed to be primarily
   driven by food availability and predation risk. In contrast,
   environmental parasite pressures have rarely been considered as possible
   drivers of animals' ranging patterns. In this article, we present
   evidence that environmentally transmitted gastrointestinal parasites may
   shape recursive movement patterns of a group of free-ranging mandrills,
   Mandrillus sphinx. These rainforest-dwelling primates returned less
   frequently and after longer time lags to sites, including sleeping
   sites, they had contaminated than to sites with low contamination
   levels. This pattern was especially pronounced during the dry season,
   when contamination risk was highest. In contrast, rainfall shortened the
   time between visits, consistent with the hypothesis that rainfall may
   wash away parasites, allowing a more rapid return to previously used
   sites. Although resource distribution and predator threat could not be
   ruled out in this study, we suggest that the risk of acquiring
   environmentally transmitted parasites is possibly another factor
   influencing animal ranging patterns as well as habitat selection or
   species distribution. Consequently, parasites and their distribution in
   the environment, as well as the possible antiparasite strategy we
   document here, should be targets for future research on animal movement.

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although reproductive strategies can be influenced by a variety of
   intrinsic and extrinsic factors, life history theory provides a rigorous
   framework for explaining variation in reproductive effort. The terminal
   investment hypothesis proposes that a decreased expectation of future
   reproduction (as might arise from a mortality threat) should precipitate
   increased investment in current reproduction. Terminal investment has
   been widely studied, and a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic cues that
   elicit such a response have been identified across an array of taxa.
   Although terminal investment is often treated as a static strategy, the
   level at which a cue of decreased future reproduction is sufficient to
   trigger increased current reproductive effort (i.e., the terminal
   investment threshold) may depend on the context, including the internal
   state of the organism or its current external environment, independent
   of the cue that triggers a shift in reproductive investment. Here, we
   review empirical studies that address the terminal investment
   hypothesis, exploring both the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that
   mediate its expression. Based on these studies, we propose a novel
   framework within which to view the strategy of terminal investment,
   incorporating factors that influence an individual's residual
   reproductive value beyond a terminal investment trigger-the dynamic
   terminal investment threshold.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To examine compensatory changes in sedentary

   to a 22-week exercise training program in overweight/obese adults; and
   to determine if different forms of exercise training and physical
   activity recommendations interact with these compensatory changes.
   SUBJECTS/METHODS: Eighty-nine overweight and obese individuals (body
   mass index (BMI): 25-34.9 kg/m(2), 48\% males), aged 1850 years, were
   randomized into four intervention groups (strength, endurance, combined
   strength + endurance and physical activity recommendations) with a
   25-30\% caloric restriction of total daily energy expenditure for 22
   weeks. Energy expenditure was measured by accelerometry before, during
   and after the program.
   RESULTS: LIPA increased significantly (Po0.001) after three months and
   at the end of intervention compared to baseline (pre: 281 +/- 9 min; 3
   months: 303 +/- 9 min; post: 312 +/- 8 min). SB percentage decreased by
   5.3 at the end of the intervention (P = 0.002). No interactions were
   observed between groups or sexes. Significant correlations were found
   between SB and body weight, fat mass, android fat mass and lean body
   mass before and after the intervention (P < 0.05). LIPA was also
   significantly correlated with all these body composition variables in
   the pre-intervention, but only correlated with body weight at the end of
   intervention.
   CONCLUSIONS: There were no compensatory changes after a combined

   decreased after the program, without differences among exercise modes.
   Greater physical activity levels can contribute to a better percentage

   Methods: Convergent parallel mixed methods triangulation design

   using logistic regression analyses. Results: Healthy dietary salt
   consumption behaviors were associated with basic salt knowledge (P

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{145}},
Pages = {{86-92}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Stress is ubiquitous in nature and organisms have evolved mechanisms to
   cope with it. Stress responses nevertheless vary based on the type of
   stress, its duration, magnitude, and the organism's physiological
   status. We studied here the effect of two separately applied stress
   types, differing also in their duration, on various behavioral responses
   of the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum). The two stress types
   applied were short-term cold stress and long-term low protein stress.
   The behavioral response variables were movement activity, preference to
   move along the test arena edges, latency to emerge from shelter, and
   preference for dark microhabitat, measured at two stages of the beetles'
   lives, as young adults after eclosion and one month later. Behavioral
   responses were stress-specific. Cold-stressed beetles moved over the
   longest distances but were also the most reluctant to leave an
   accessible shelter. We interpret this to mean that cold-stressed beetles
   were the most active under unfavorable conditions and least bold under
   more favorable, protected conditions. As beetles aged, their movement
   activity decreased and latency to emerge from shelter increased.
   Non-stressed beetles were the most consistent in their behavior across
   all behavioral tests. This finding is similar to those in previous
   studies and suggests that moderate stress reduces behavioral

Abstract = {{When exposed to an environment that promotes a sedentary lifestyle and
   food accessibility, some individuals are at a higher risk of weight
   gain. This individual difference can be explained by gene-environment
   interactions. It has been shown that some individuals have a genetic
   predisposition to obesity. In addition, a genetic component has been
   associated with eating behaviour traits such as cognitive restraint,
   disinhibition, and susceptibility to hunger, all of which are also
   linked to obesity. The purpose of this review article is to present the
   current state of knowledge on the heritability of specific eating
   behaviour traits and to then identify the genes associated with these
   behaviours. The findings show that disinhibition and susceptibility to
   hunger are 2 eating behaviour traits that are particularly heritable and
   that several candidate genes are now associated with eating behaviour
   traits. These findings indicate that we are far from equal when it comes
   to food and can help professionals better understand the variability
   observed in an intervention context. Identifying genes associated with
   eating behaviour traits is crucial to better identify and intervene with
   people at higher risk of weight gain.}},

Abstract = {{Prior work has suggested a paradoxical positive relationship between the
   risk behavior alcohol use and the health behavior exercise, particularly
   in young adults. Though seldom tested, different theoretical
   perspectives exist on the mechanisms that may explain the positive
   relationship. The aims of this study were to test theorized mechanisms
   of association, including common causes shared by both behaviors (e.g.,
   personality, motives, affective), compensatory processes such as
   exercising to compensate for calories from alcohol consumption, and
   methodological confounds (e.g., between vs. within subject effects) in a
   college sample (N = 132; 56.3\% male; 76\% Caucasian; M (age) = 19.15,
   SD = 0.99) using a cross-sectional design and time line follow back
   methods. A positive, between-subjects association between alcohol and
   exercise was found and explained by exercising to compensate for
   calories of alcohol consumption, enhancement motives, and physical
   activity enjoyment. However, we also observed a significant and negative
   within-subjects association between the two constructs, suggesting that,
   on a given day, individuals who exercise more tended to drink less.
   Furthermore, individuals who exercised more during the week tended to
   have declines in weekend drinking over time. Results suggest a complex
   relationship between exercise and alcohol use among young adults, and
   highlight the importance of distinguishing between and within subject
   processes, as well as the temporal ordering of the two behaviors.
   Implications are discussed in regard to theory, prevention, and

Abstract = {{BackgroundEarly childhood temperament is increasingly recognized as an
   important attribute that may impact screen time use, outdoor play and
   childhood obesity. The relationship between temperament and nutrition in
   preschool children is less clear.
   ObjectiveThe objective of the study is to investigate if temperament
   dimensions (negative affectivity, effortful control and surgency) in
   early childhood are associated with nutritional risk factors.
   MethodsSix hundred seventy-eight children were followed (mean age at
   baseline visit 3.1years; mean time to follow-up 16.5months). Parents
   reported on child temperament and nutritional risk factors during
   regularly scheduled well-child clinic visits.
   ResultsA mixed effect model demonstrated a significant association
   between higher negative affectivity (1.03; 95\% CI 0.69 to 1.37) and
   higher effortful control (-0.88; 95\% CI -1.27 to -0.49) on concurrent
   nutritional risk, independent of covariates. Multivariate linear
   regression analysis identified that higher effortful control, and not
   negative affectivity, was significantly associated with a decrease in
   nutritional risk (-0.67; 95\% CI -1.10 to -0.24) over time, independent
   of covariates. There was no relationship identified between surgency and
   nutritional risk.
   ConclusionThree-year-old children with higher effortful control had
   reduced nutritional risk at 5years of age. Future nutritional risk
   prevention strategies may benefit from interventions to increase
   effortful control in early childhood.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a non-restrictive

   In all, sixty-nine obese men aged 415 (sd 57) years were randomly

   carbohydrate and lipid, respectively; n 34) or satiating (20-25, 45-50
   and 30-35 \% energy as protein, carbohydrate and lipid, respectively; n
   35) diet for 16 weeks, and were classified as having a low (LSP) or high
   (HSP) satiety phenotype. Both diets were consumed ad libitum. Changes in
   body weight, BMI, percent fat mass, waist circumference, satiety
   responsiveness and eating behaviour traits were assessed following the
   intervention. Dropout rates were higher in the control diet (441 \%)
   compared with the satiating diet (86 \%). Decreases in body weight, BMI
   and waist circumference were significant in both groups, yet HSP
   individuals lost more body weight than LSP individuals (P=0048).
   Decreases in \% fat mass were greater in the satiating diet (LSP: -21
   (sd 21) \%; P<001 and HSP: -30 (sd 25) \%; P<0001) compared with the

Title = {{Artificial selection for odor-guided behavior in Drosophila reveals
   changes in food consumption}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: The olfactory system enables organisms to detect chemical
   cues in the environment and can signal the availability of food or the
   presence of a predator. Appropriate behavioral responses to these
   chemical cues are therefore important for organismal survival and can
   influence traits such as organismal life span and food consumption.
   However, understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying odor-guided
   behavior, correlated responses in other traits, and how these constrain
   or promote their evolution, remain an important challenge. Here, we
   performed artificial selection for attractive and aversive behavioral
   responses to four chemical compounds, two aromatics (4-ethylguaiacol and
   4-methylphenol) and two esters (methyl hexanoate and ethyl acetate), for
   thirty generations.
   Results: Artificial selection for odor-guided behavior revealed
   symmetrical responses to selection for each of the four chemical
   compounds. We then investigated whether selection for odor-guided
   behavior resulted in correlated responses in life history traits and/or
   food consumption. We found changes in food consumption upon selection
   for behavioral responses to aromatics. In many cases, lines selected for
   increased attraction to aromatics showed an increase in food
   consumption. We then performed RNA sequencing of lines selected for
   responses to 4-ethylguaiacol to identify candidate genes associated with
   odor-guided behavior and its impact on food consumption. We identified
   91 genes that were differentially expressed among lines, many of which
   were associated with metabolic processes. RNAi-mediated knockdown of
   select candidate genes further supports their role in odor-guided
   behavior and/or food consumption.
   Conclusions: This study identifies novel genes underlying variation in
   odor-guided behavior and further elucidates the genetic mechanisms
   underlying the interrelationship between olfaction and feeding.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the background mechanisms affecting the emergence and
   maintenance of consistent between-individual variation within population
   in single (animal personality) or across multiple (behavioural syndrome)
   behaviours has key importance. State-dependence theory suggests that
   behaviour is `anchored' to individual state (e.g. body condition,
   gender, age) and behavioural consistency emerges through
   behavioural-state feedbacks. A number of relevant state variables are
   labile (e.g. body condition, physiological performance) and expected to
   be affected by short-term environmental change. Yet, whether short-term
   environmental shifts affect behavioural consistency during adulthood
   remains questionable. Here, by employing a full-factorial laboratory
   experiment, we explored if quantity of food (low vs. high) and time
   available for thermoregulation (3h vs. 10h per day) had an effect on
   activity and risk-taking of reproductive adult male European green
   lizards (Lacerta viridis). We focussed on different components of
   behavioural variation: (i) strength of behavioural consistency
   (repeatability for animal personality; between-individual correlation
   for behavioural syndrome), (ii) behavioural type (individual mean
   behaviour) and (iii) behavioural predictability (within-individual
   behavioural variation). Activity was repeatable in all treatments.
   Risktaking was repeatable only in the low basking treatments. We found
   significant between-individual correlation only in the low food x long
   basking time group. The treatments did not affect behavioural type, but
   affected behavioural predictability. Activity predictability was higher
   in the short basking treatment, where it also decreased with size
   (approximate to age). Risk-taking predictability in the short basking
   treatment increased with size under food limitation, but decreased when
   food supply was high. We conclude that short-term environmental change
   can alter various components of behavioural consistency. The effect
   could be detected in the presence/absence patterns of animal personality
   and behavioural syndrome and the level of individual behavioural
   predictability, but not in behavioural type.}},

Abstract = {{This study explored Pasifika peoples' understandings of Deliberate
   Self-Harm (DSH) based on the perspective of Pacific health professionals
   in New Zealand. A total of 20 informants were interviewed using
   semi-structured Talanoa methods. Informants held professional roles in
   the mental health, social and addiction sectors in Auckland, (female, n
   = 10, male, n = 10). DSH was defined as an intentional act of inflicting
   harm to the physical, mental or spiritual self, and served separate
   functions from suicidal intent. DSH was defined to include both direct
   self-harm, as well as indirect forms of self-harm over time including,
   alcohol and drug misuse, gambling, self-starvation and risk taking
   behaviours. Intentional harm to the spiritual or the mental self
   included deliberate disconnection from spiritual faith and holding
   adverse perspectives and worldviews.
   Conclusion: Based on the findings it is recommended that a) DSH may be
   acknowledged as a behaviour that can be separated from suicide in terms
   of functionality, b) the present clinical DSH diagnosis criteria should
   include Pacific definitions of DSH, c) best-practice clinical treatment
   guidelines should accordingly be reviewed to incorporate treatment that
   encapsulate DSH behaviours relevant to Pacific people, and finally, d)
   researchers need to adopt operational definitions that reflects Pacific
   conceptualisations of DSH when conducting studies with Pacific

Abstract = {{Introduction The prevalence of obesity and obesity-related diseases,
   including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is increasing. Exclusion of
   the foregut, as occurs in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, has a key role in
   the metabolic improvements that occur following bariatric surgery, which
   are independent of weight loss. Endoscopically placed duodenal-jejunal
   bypass sleeve devices, such as the EndoBarrier (GI Dynamics, Lexington,
   Massachusetts, USA), have been designed to create an impermeable barrier
   between chyme exiting the stomach and the mucosa of the duodenum and
   proximal jejunum. The non-surgical and reversible nature of these
   devices represents an attractive therapeutic option for patients with
   obesity and T2DM by potentially improving glycaemic control and reducing
   their weight.
   Methods and analysis In this multicentre, randomised, controlled,
   non-blinded trial, male and female patients aged 18-65 years with a body
   mass index 30-50 kg/m(2) and inadequately controlled T2DM on oral
   antihyperglycaemic medications (glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 58-97
   mmol/mol) will be randomised in a 1: 1 ratio to receive either the
   EndoBarrier device (n=80) for 12 months or conventional medical therapy,
   diet and exercise (n=80). The primary outcome measure will be a
   reduction in HbA1c by 20\% at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures will
   include percentage weight loss, change in cardiovascular risk factors
   and medications, quality of life, cost, quality-adjusted life years
   accrued and adverse events. Three additional subgroups will investigate
   the mechanisms behind the effect of the EndoBarrier device, looking at
   changes in gut hormones, metabolites, bile acids, microbiome, food
   hedonics and preferences, taste, brain reward system responses to food,
   eating and addictive behaviours, body fat content, insulin sensitivity,

Abstract = {{Introduction Anaemia is a major global health problem affecting about
   43\% of preschool children globally and 60\% of 6-24-month-old children
   in rural Bangladesh, half of which is attributed to iron deficiency
   (ID). Although WHO recommends universal supplementation with iron or
   home fortification with iron-containing multiple micronutrient powders
   (MMPs) to children under 2 years, evidence for benefits of these
   interventions on childhood development (a key rationale for these
   interventions) and harms (especially infection) remains limited. This
   study aims to evaluate the impact of iron or MMPs supplementation
   compared with placebo on (a) children's development, (b) growth, (c)
   morbidity from infections and (d) haematological and iron indices.
   Methods and analysis This study is a three-arm, blinded, double-dummy,
   parallel-group, placebo-controlled superiority trial using stratified
   individual block randomisation. The trial will randomise 3300 children
   aged 8-9 months equally to arm 1: iron syrup (12.5 mg elemental iron),
   placebo MMPs; arm 2: MMPs (including 12.5 mg elemental iron), placebo
   syrup; and arm 3: placebo syrup, placebo MNPs. Children will receive
   interventions for 3 months based on WHO recommendations and then be
   followed up for 9 months post intervention. The primary outcome is
   cognitive composite score measured by Bayley III. Secondary outcomes
   include motor and language composite score by Bayley III, behaviour
   rating using selected items from Wolke's rating scales and BSID-II
   behaviour ratings, temperament, growth, haemoglobin, anaemia and iron
   status, and infectious morbidity. Outcomes will be measured at baseline,
   at the end of 3-month intervention and after 9 months postintervention
   follow-up.
   Ethics and dissemination The trial has been approved by the Ethical
   Review Committee of icddr,b (Dhaka, Bangladesh) and the Melbourne Health

   study will be disseminated through scientific publications,
   presentations at international meetings and policy briefs to key

Abstract = {{Invasion success is dependent on the ability of a species to discover
   and exploit novel food resources. Within this context, individuals must
   be willing to taste novel foods. They must also be capable of evaluating
   the nutritional content of new foods, and selecting their relative
   intake in order to fulfil their nutritional needs. Whereas the former
   capacity is well studied, little is known about the latter capacity.
   First, using the common myna as a model avian invader species, we
   quantified the willingness of mynas to taste novel foods relative to
   familiar ones. Mynas readily tasted high protein (HP) novel foods and
   consumed them in higher quantities compared to a familiar food. Data
   showed that at three different levels - mixes, ingredients and
   macronutrients - intake could not be explained by a random model. In
   experiment 2, we confirmed that mynas were making their selection based
   on protein (P) content rather than a selection for novelty per se. When
   given the choice of three equally unfamiliar foods, mynas again ate
   disproportionately from the high protein relative to high lipid and high
   carbohydrate foods. Analysis revealed that mynas consumed amounts of
   protein that were closer to the ones in their natural diet. Finally, in
   experiment 3, we measured inter-individual variation in innovation and
   exploration propensities, and examined associations with
   inter-individual variation in consumption of specific macronutrients.
   This analysis revealed that individuals that selected HP pellets were
   more exploratory and individuals that selected HC pellets were quicker
   to solve the innovative foraging task. These findings indicate that not
   only the willingness to taste novel foods, but also the capacity to
   evaluate their nutritional content, might be central to the myna's
   substantial ecological success.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonality creates a template for many natural processes and
   evolutionary adaptations. Organisms are often faced with an annual cycle
   consisting of a productive (favorable) and unproductive period. This
   yearly cycle along with other seasonal variations in abiotic factors and
   associated biotic interactions form strong selection pressures shaping
   the scheduling of annual activities and the developmental stages and
   modes of life through the year. Annual decisions impact trade-offs that
   involve both current and future reproductive value (RV), and life
   history theory provides the foundation to understand these linkages
   between phenology and an organism's full life. Annual routine models
   further allow for multiple annual decisions to be optimized and
   predicted with respect to lifetime consequences. Studies of life history
   adaptations to seasonality are concerned with questions such as: within
   the productive season, should growth come first, followed by
   reproduction, or the other way around? What is the best time to diapause
   or migrate, and how will this timing impact other life history traits?
   Should energy reserves be built, to transfer resources from 1 year to
   the next, and allow for the spatial and temporal freedom of capital
   breeding? If offspring value is low during parts of the productive
   season, what is then the best alternative to reproduction: accumulate
   stores, grow, or wait in safety? To help answer these and other
   questions, I provide an overview of key theoretical concepts and some of
   the main life schedules, annual routines, and trade-offs involved.
   Adaptations to the unproductive period include diapause (dormancy),
   embryonic resting stages (eggs, seeds), energy reserves, and seasonal
   migrations. Adaptations to the productive window include rapid growth,
   high reproductive effort, capital breeding, and reproduction entrained
   to the annual cycle and with precise timing. Distinct annual routines,
   large body size, energy storage capacities, and parental care are also
   adaptations to seasonality. Phenotypic plasticity and state-dependence
   are important parts of these traits and are adaptations in their own. I
   give particular attention to timing of breeding and the associated
   birth-time dependent contributions to fitness. Seasonality in offspring
   value impacts the scheduling of growth, storage, and reproduction and
   may create parent-offspring conflicts over breeding timing. A combined
   offspring and parent value perspective should be adopted more broadly,
   also because of the management implications. I further argue for
   strategic but careful use of latitudinal (and altitudinal) gradients,
   and more attention to the role of seasonally varying predation risk as a
   selective force.}},

Abstract = {{Cities are rapidly expanding, and wildlife may experience different
   selection pressures in urban environments when compared to natural
   habitats. Phenotypic differences between urban and natural populations
   may occur because of the altered urban environment. Behavior, the
   activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and body
   condition can be expected to differ between urban and natural habitats.
   We used the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) to test for differences
   in behavior assayed from an open field test, hair and fecal cortisol
   concentrations, and body condition (size-corrected body mass),
   predicting that urban chipmunks would exhibit more exploratory behavior,
   higher cortisol concentrations, and higher body condition, than their
   counterparts from natural habitats. We sampled eastern chipmunks in 2
   urban areas paired with natural habitats and subjected adult chipmunks
   to an open field test, collected hair and fecal samples for the
   determination of cortisol concentrations, and measured body size and
   body mass to estimate body condition. Eastern chipmunks in urban
   habitats had significantly different behavior, tending toward reduced
   locomotion and grooming, and greater latency, than their counterparts
   from natural habitats. Urban chipmunks also had lower fecal cortisol
   concentrations than those from natural habitats, and female chipmunks
   were in better body condition when captured in urban habitats. These
   results suggest that urban habitats may be relatively benign for urban
   chipmunks, perhaps because of reduced need for exploration and the
   availability of anthropogenic food subsidies associated with urban

Abstract = {{Obesity affects more than 35\% of Americans, increasing the risk of more
   than 200 comorbid conditions, impaired quality of life and premature
   mortality. This review aimed to summarize literature published over the
   past 15years regarding the prevalence and impact of obesity in people
   with haemophilia (PWH) and to discuss implementing general guidelines
   for weight management in the context of the haemophilia comprehensive
   care team. Although few studies have assessed the effects of obesity on
   haemophilia-specific outcomes, existing evidence indicates an important
   impact of weight status on lower extremity joint range of motion and
   functional disability, with potentially important effects on overall
   quality of life. Data regarding bleeding tendency in PWH with coexisting
   obesity are largely inconclusive; however, some individuals may
   experience reduced joint bleeds following moderate weight loss.
   Additionally, conventional weight-based dosing of factor replacement
   therapy leads to increased treatment costs for PWH with obesity or
   overweight, suggesting pharmacoeconomic benefits of weight loss.
   Evidence-based recommendations for weight loss include behavioural
   strategies to reduce caloric intake and increase physical activity,
   pharmacotherapy and surgical therapy in appropriate patients. Unique
   considerations in PWH include bleed-related risks with physical
   activity; thus, healthcare professionals should advise patients on types
   and intensities of, and approaches to, physical activity, how to adjust
   treatment to accommodate exercise and how to manage potential
   activity-related bleeding. Increasing awareness of these issues may
   improve identification of PWH with coexisting obesity and referral to
   appropriate specialists, with potentially wide-ranging benefits in
   overall health and well-being.}},

Title = {{Aggression mediates dispersal tendency in an invasive lizard}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{133}},
Pages = {{29-34}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Personality-dependent dispersal is a key ecological and evolutionary
   process that is likely to facilitate the successful movement and
   colonization/invasion success of species. This dispersal syndrome
   suggests that dispersers should possess a suite of behavioural
   tendencies that differ from those of nondispersers, thus influencing the
   composition of populations in the new range and, ultimately,
   colonization success. However, dispersal is also often condition
   dependent, and is probably mediated by the interaction between an
   individual's personality and environmental and social factors such as
   competition. Accordingly, we investigated whether dispersal tendency was
   linked to an activity, exploration and social syndrome and/or aggression
   in a reptile, the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata, which has had a
   successful invasion history via accidental introductions. Contrary to
   our prediction, we found that dispersal was not related to activity,
   exploration or social personality traits. Instead, dispersal tendency
   was associated with aggression: the most aggressive individuals
   dispersed further and faster than less aggressive individuals. The
   presence of aggression-dependent dispersal could be due to either (1)
   dispersers generally being more aggressive than nondispersers or (2)
   aggressive individuals forcing nonaggressive individuals into hiding,
   thus impinging on the ability of subordinates to disperse regardless of
   their personality. Our study highlights the need to consider the
   ecological context when examining personality-dependent dispersal and
   suggests that aggression and the social environment can play an
   important role in dispersal decisions. (C) 2017 The Association for the

Journal = {{AIDS AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2, 2}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The harmful use of alcohol is a component cause for more than 200
   diseases. The association between alcohol consumption, risk taking
   behavior and a range of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS is well
   established. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS as well as harmful alcohol use
   in low and middle income countries is high. Alcohol has been identified
   as a modifiable risk factor in the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS.
   The objective of this paper is to define research priorities for the
   interaction of alcohol and HIV/AIDS in low and middle income countries.
   The Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) priority
   setting methodology was applied in order to assess research priorities
   of the interaction of alcohol and HIV/AIDS. A group of 171 global and
   local experts in the field of alcohol and or HIV/AIDS related research
   were identified and invited to generate research questions. This
   resulted in 205 research questions which have been categorized and
   refined by senior researchers into 48 research questions to be evaluated
   using five criteria: answerability, effectiveness, feasibility,
   applicability and impact, as well as equity. A total of 59 experts
   participated independently in the voluntary scoring exercise (a 34\%
   response rate). There was substantial consensus among experts on
   priorities for research on alcohol and HIV. These tended to break down
   into two categories, those focusing on better understanding the nexus
   between alcohol and HIV and those directed towards informing practical
   interventions to reduce the impact of alcohol use on HIV treatment
   outcomes, which replicates what Bryant (Subst Use Misuse 41:1465-1507,
   2006) and Parry et al. (Addiction 108:1-2, 2012) found. Responses from
   experts were stratified by location in order to determine any
   differences between groups. On average experts in the LMIC gave higher
   scores than the HIC experts. Recent research has shown the causal link
   between alcohol consumption and the incidence of HIV/AIDS including a
   better understanding of the pathways through which alcohol use affects
   ARV adherence (and other medications to treat opportunistic infections)
   and CD4 counts. The results of this process clearly indicated that the
   important priorities for future research related to the development and
   assessment of interventions focusing on addressing alcohol and HIV/AIDS,
   addressing and exploring the impact of HIV risk and comorbid alcohol
   use, as well as exploring the risk and protective factors in the field
   of alcohol and HIV/AIDS. The findings from this priority setting
   exercise could guide international research agenda and make research
   funding more effective in addressing the research on intersection of
   alcohol and HIV/AIDS.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The early life stage is typically a selective bottleneck during which
   individual performance is important for survival. We investigated size,
   energetic state, and activity, in relation to recapture probability in
   the youngest free-swimming stage of a territorial fish, the brown trout.
   In two experiments, we induced compensatory growth in wild-caught brown
   trout fry, using a restriction-refeeding protocol. Upon refeeding in the
   laboratory, the restricted trout showed compensatory growth in mass, but
   not in length. During this compensatory growth phase, we released the
   fish into their native stream habitat and then recaptured them after 1
   month to assess survival and growth. Despite not having fully
   compensated body size at release, restricted fish did not show continued
   growth compensation in the stream, indicating that the natural
   environment limits growth capacity during early life. Individual
   baseline activity was scored in open-field tests before and after food
   restriction and was found repeatable but not significantly affected by
   growth manipulations. Under natural conditions, we found a positive
   association between open-field activity and survival (as indicated by
   recapture probability), but no significant differences between
   food-restricted and control fish. Initial body length positively
   influenced survival in the first experiment (early summer), but not in
   the second (late summer). These results contrast with the assumption
   that high baseline activity should be riskier in natural environments.
   For territorial animals, we hypothesize that activity is associated with
   high aggression and territoriality, which facilitates access to
   high-quality territories providing both shelter from predation and
   reduced starvation risk, which reduces mortality risk.
   Significance statement
   In the early critical life stage, more active brown trout are better
   survivors. This finding, which contradicts general assumptions about the
   balance between predator exposure and food intake, could possibly be due
   to trout being highly territorial species in which active individuals
   can claim the best territories. We also find that young trout are likely
   limited in growth rate by environmental conditions in the wild, as
   growth compensation following food restriction is possible in the lab,
   but not realized in natural streams.}},

Title = {{Individual foraging preferences are linked to innovativeness and

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Personality and innovativeness are predicted to drive important
   functional behaviours that can influence life history strategies within
   populations. For example, the reactive-proactive personality axis is
   thought to reflect the `pace of life' syndrome and predicts correlation
   with foraging; empirical evidence also suggests a positive correlation
   with routine-like behaviour. Similarly, the adaptive innovation
   hypothesis predicts that innovators may have a higher food intake when
   novel foraging opportunities arise, and that they should have a more
   diverse range of foraging tactics. Experimental tests of these
   hypotheses are limited. We conducted standardized assays of exploratory
   behaviour (an index of the reactive-proactive axis) and innovative
   problem-solving performance on wild-captured great tits, Parus major,
   temporarily brought into captivity from different woodland types. To
   test for dietary preferences, birds were provided with three different
   types of food, and their daily energy intake measured. We found no
   evidence of a significant relationship between exploratory behaviour and
   the amount of calories ingested. However, fast-exploring great tits
   consumed a higher proportion of sunflower seeds, while slower
   individuals preferred peanuts. Problem-solving performance was
   positively correlated with energy intake but not food preference.
   Peanuts accounted for a larger proportion of total daily energy intake
   for coniferous birds, which also lost more weight on average. Our
   results illustrate that a complex array of factors can determine
   foraging behaviour and success, including personality, innovativeness,
   state variables, time, and habitat origin. This highlights the challenge
   of explaining how selection acts on foraging performance over time.
   Significance statement
   Experimental tests assessing how personality and innovativeness drive
   functional behaviour within populations are limited. We studied these
   links by means of exploratory behaviour and innovative problem-solving
   performance tests in relation to food preference and energy intake in
   wild-captured great tits, Parus major, from two different habitats.
   Personality was related to dietary preference (fast explorers consumed a
   higher proportion of sunflower seeds, while slower individuals preferred
   peanuts), and problem-solving was related to energy intake. Moreover, we
   found differential diet selection between coniferous and deciduous
   birds. Our results show that foraging behaviour and body mass are driven
   by multiple factors, including personality, innovativeness, and habitat
   origin.}},

Abstract = {{Escape-response behaviour is essential to ensure an individual's
   survival during a predator attack, however, these behaviours are
   energetically costly and may cause oxidative stress. Oxidative stress
   can be reduced by supplementing an individual's diet with exogenous
   antioxidants or through regular moderate exercise training, which
   stimulates the upregulation of the endogenous antioxidant system. Two
   studies have tested the simultaneous effects of dietary antioxidant
   supplementation and exercise training on animal escape-response
   behaviour. The present study investigated the effects of dietary
   carotenoids and exercise training on the escape response behaviour of
   Southern Corroboree frogs. Frogs were fed either a
   carotenoid-supplemented or unsupplemented diet and were exposed to
   repeated escape-response trials (training) for five consecutive weeks.
   Carotenoid-supplemented individuals outperformed unsupplemented
   individuals in initial hopping speed, length of the first hop and
   hopping distance, however, the performance of frogs in each treatment
   group became statistically similar after training. Within treatment
   groups, exercise training significantly improved the hopping speed of
   unsupplemented frogs, with speeds almost doubling between training weeks
   one and five. By contrast, exercise training did not significantly
   improve the hopping speed of carotenoid-supplemented frogs. Our results
   provide some of the first evidence that exercise training improves
   escape performance, and that dietary antioxidants may inhibit

Abstract = {{Obesity is a major health concern in modern societies. Although
   decreased physical activity and enhanced intake of high-caloric foods
   are important risk factors for developing obesity, human behavior during
   eating also plays a role. Previous studies have shown that distraction
   while eating increases food intake and leads to impaired processing of
   food stimuli. As olfaction is the most important sense involved in
   flavor perception, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   techniques to investigate the influence of cognitive memory load on
   olfactory perception and processing. Low-and high-caloric food odors
   were presented in combination with either low or high cognitive loads
   utilizing a memory task. The efficacy of the memory task was verified by
   a decrease in participant recall accuracy and an increase in skin
   conductance response during high cognitive load. Our behavioral data
   reveal a diminished perceived intensity for low-but not high-caloric
   food odors during high cognitive load. For low-caloric food odors,
   bilateral orbitofrontal (OFC) and piriform cortices (pirC) showed
   significantly lower activity during high compared with low cognitive
   load. For high-caloric food odors, a similar effect was established in
   pirC, but not in OFC. Insula activity correlates with higher intensity
   ratings found during the low cognitive load condition. We conclude lower
   activity in pirC and OFC to be responsible for diminished intensity
   perception, comparable to results in olfactory impaired patients and
   elderly. Further studies should investigate the influence of
   olfactory/gustatory intensities on food choices under distraction with
   special regards to low-caloric food.}},

Abstract = {{An autoshaping procedure was used to test the notion that conditioned

Abstract = {{Changes in climate can indirectly regulate populations at higher trophic
   levels by influencing the availability of food resources in the lower
   reaches of the food web. As such, species that rely on fruit and nectar
   food resources may be particularly sensitive to these bottom-up
   perturbations due to the strength of their trophic linkages with
   climatically-influenced plants. To measure the influence of
   climatically-mediated, bottom-up processes, we used climate, bird
   capture, bird count, and plant phenology data from the Big Island of
   Hawaii to construct a series of structural equationand abundance models.
   Our results suggest that fruit and nectar-eating birds arrange life
   cycle events around climatically-influenced food resources, while some
   of these same food resources also influence seasonal patterns of
   abundance. This trend was particularly strong for two native
   nectarivores, `I'iwi and `Apapane, where we found that the dissimilar
   timing of molting and breeding activity was associated with peak
   abundance of the two most common flowers at our study site which, in
   turn, were each driven by dissimilar climatic cues. Given the rapidly
   changing Hawaiian climate, we suggest that determining behavioral
   plasticity, or evolutionary capacity of birds to mitigate changes in

Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{25-31}},

Abstract = {{The expression of different behavioral components in the adult rat
   depends on a number of early influences, including age, hormones,
   manipulations of sensory cues, and perinatal undernutrition, all of
   which impact the development of brain areas underlying adaptive
   processes, maternal behavior, and the response to novelty. The current
   study investigates the effects of pre- and neonatal undernutrition on
   various components of maternal behavior of dams exposed to the challenge
   of an unfamiliar home cage on days 4, 8, and 12 of lactation. Food
   restriction was initiated from gestational day (G) G6 to G19 when dams
   received 50-70\% of the normal balanced diet, followed by 100\% from G20
   to G21. After birth, pups were underfed by alternating every 12 h
   between two lactating dams, one of which, had ligated nipples. Weaning
   was at 25 days of age followed by an ad libitum diet until postpartum
   day 90, when females were mated, and subsequently tested for maternal
   behavior in an unfamiliar cage. The results indicated that in early
   underfed mothers the frequency of handling wood shavings and of,
   approaching, licking, crouching, and grasping pups for retrieval was
   significantly reduced. Moreover, self grooming increased substantially

   Additionally, the body weight of pups nursed by early underfed dams was
   significantly lower than that of control pups. These findings suggest a

   observed when these dams were challenged by exposure to an unfamiliar

Abstract = {{The presence of graywolves (Canis lupus) can directly and indirectly
   affect beef cattle (Bos taurus) production on rangelands of the Northern
   Rocky Mountains. While fairly extensive knowledge exists for the direct
   effects of wolf predation threat (e.g., cattle death and injury losses,
   elevated stress), our understanding of wolf-caused changes in cattle
   behavior and the associated cascade of potential indirect effects on
   cattle resource selection, diet quality, activity budgets, and energetic
   relationships is still largely in its infancy. We investigated whether
   wolf presence affected the daily travel distance of Global Positioning
   System(GPS)-collared cattle under a replicated, Impact-Control study
   conducted inwestern Idaho and northeasternOregon during 2008-2012.
   Cattle in three Control (Oregon) study areas, where wolf presence was
   consistently low, traveled farther per day (13.7 +/- 0.396 SE km
   day(-1)) than those in three Impact (Idaho) study areas (11.4 +/- 0.396
   SE km day(-1)) with moderate to high wolf presence. At Control study
   areas, cattle traveled farthest per day in July (13.2 +/- 0.355 SE km
   day(-1)) and were least mobile in October (11.8 +/- 0.365 SE km
   day(-1)), but daily travel distances were similar across all months for
   cattle in Impact study areas. This observational study provides evidence
   suggesting cattle in mountainous grazing areas alter their spatial
   behavior in response to gray wolf presence. These behavioral changes
   have energetic consequences that could potentially impact cattle
   productivity and ranch economics. Additional research into the activity
   budget and resource selection responses of these collared cattle is
   required to better understand the specific mechanisms behind these daily
   travel distance results. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The

Title = {{Linking fishes to multiple metrics of coral reef structural complexity

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 25}},
Abstract = {{Structural complexity strongly influences biodiversity and ecosystem
   productivity. On coral reefs, structural complexity is typically
   measured using a single and small-scale metric ('rugosity') that
   represents multiple spatial attributes differentially exploited by
   species, thus limiting a complete understanding of how fish associate
   with reef structure. We used a novel approach to compare relationships
   between fishes and previously unavailable components of reef complexity,
   and contrasted the results against the traditional rugosity index. This
   study focused on damselfish to explore relationships between fishes and
   reef structure. Three territorial species, with contrasting trophic
   habits and expected use of the reef structure, were examined to infer
   the potential species-specific mechanisms associated with how complexity
   influences habitat selection. Three-dimensional reef reconstructions
   from photogrammetry quantified the following metrics of habitat quality:
   1) visual exposure to predators and competitors, 2) density of predation
   refuges and 3) substrate-related food availability. These metrics
   explained the species distribution better than the traditional measure
   of rugosity, and each species responded to different complexity
   components. Given that a critical effect of reef degradation is loss of
   structure, adopting three-dimensional technologies potentially offers a
   new tool to both understand species-habitat association and help
   forecast how fishes will be affected by the flattening of reefs.}},

Abstract = {{Despite recent progress on neural pathways underlying individual
   behaviors, how an animal balances and prioritizes behavioral outputs
   remains poorly understood. While studying the relationship between
   hunger induced feeding and pup-induced maternal behaviors in virgin
   female mice, we made the unexpected discovery that presence of pups
   strongly delayed and decreased food consumption. Strikingly, presence of
   pups also suppressed feeding induced by optogenetic activation of Agrp
   neurons. Such a suppressive effect inversely correlated with the extents
   of maternal behaviors, but did not rely on the display of these
   behaviors, and was also present in virgin males. Furthermore,
   chemogenetic activation of Vglut2+ neurons in the medial preoptic area
   (mPOA), a region critical for maternal behaviors and motivation, was
   sufficient to suppress hunger-induced feeding. However, muscimol
   inhibition of the mPOA, while disrupting maternal behaviors, did not
   prevent pup suppression of feeding, indicating that neural pathways in
   other brain regions may also mediate such an effect. Together, these
   results provide novel insights into neural coordination of pup care and

Abstract = {{The trophic behavior of marine predators varies according to the level
   of competition to which they are exposed. In general, populations that
   inhabit lower productivity systems face a strong intraspecific
   competition, which contributes to the development of different foraging
   strategies to maximize nutritional efficiency. Given the high trophic
   flexibility of Zalophus wollebaeki, this species is considered
   appropriate for the analysis of such behavior. Furthermore, this trophic
   flexibility has allowed them to persist in a seemingly marginal
   ecosystem. In this study, we used a comparative analysis of variables
   (diet and dive behavior) related to Z. wollebaeki trophic niche
   plasticity to better understand their foraging ecology, using techniques
   such scat analysis, satellite telemetry and complementarily an isotopic
   analysis. Scat analysis revealed intra-population variation in their
   diet, represented by prey from different environments (epipelagic and
   benthic). These results are supported by the animals' locations at sea
   and diving profiles. Global Positioning System (GPS) and time-depth
   recorder (TDR) records showed the existence of two groups, with
   differing feeding areas and diving behavior. Also the delta N-15 values
   showed differences in the trophic level at which the species fed. These
   results constitute a relevant finding in the evolutionary behavior of
   the species, showing that Z. wollebaeki has developed a high degree of
   foraging flexibility, thus increasing its survival rate in an ecosystem
   that is highly demanding in terms of resource availability.}},

Abstract = {{Feed deprivation has deleterious effects on fish behavior and stress
   physiology which may susceptible them to disease outbreak. Functional
   ingredients in diets may substantially impact the physiology and stress
   responses of host organisms. Here, we hypothesized that the
   administration of a dietary prebiotic might attenuate the negative
   influences of feed deprivation on the behavioral profile of anxiety and
   physiological responses to stress in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Fish were
   fed with either basal or mannan-oligosaccharide supplemented (0.4\%
   MOS/kg diet) diets, once per day (normal-control: CN, and
   normal-prebiotic: PN) or once every other day (starved control: CS, and
   starved-prebiotic: PS) for 8 weeks. Afterwards, fish were subjected to a
   novel tank test to measure anxiety. Fish from the CS treatment exhibited
   more pronounced bottom-dwelling behavior than the other treatments. The
   number of transitions from the bottom to the top third of the novel tank
   was significantly higher in PN fish than the CS specimens. No
   significant differences were found between the CN and PS treatments in
   all of the anxiety behaviors. CS fish showed higher baseline cortisol
   levels than the other treatments, which was in line with higher
   expression of CRH gene in fish subjected to this treatment. Cortisol
   levels and CRH gene expression of the subjects were also measured after
   induction of two routine aquaculture stressors. CN and PS fish exhibited
   similar patterns of cortisol responses at most of the sampling times
   after stress, and PN specimens showed a significantly lower
   concentration of cortisol than the other treatments in most cases.
   Expression of the CRH gene was higher in feed deprived fish immediately
   after stress induction. Overall, the results show that feed deprivation
   in some cases influenced anxiety-like behaviors and elevated stress
   response in zebrafish juveniles; however, the addition of MOS to the
   diet helped deprived fish exhibit behaviors more typical of normally fed
   animals.}},

Abstract = {{Human development strongly influences large carnivore survival and
   persistence globally. Behavior changes are often the first measureable
   responses to human disturbances, and can have ramifications on animal
   populations and ecological communities. We investigated how a large
   carnivore responds to anthropogenic disturbances by measuring activity,
   movement behavior, and energetics in pumas along a housing density
   gradient. We used log-linear analyses to examine how habitat, time of
   day, and proximity to housing influenced the activity patterns of both
   male and female pumas in the Santa Cruz Mountains. We used spatial GPS
   location data in combination with Overall Dynamic Body Acceleration
   measurements recorded by onboard accelerometers to quantify how
   development density affected the average distances traveled and energy
   expended by pumas. Pumas responded to development differently depending
   on the time of day; at night, they were generally more active and moved
   further when they were in developed areas, but these relationships were
   not consistent during the day. Higher nighttime activity in developed
   areas increased daily caloric expenditure by 10.1\% for females and
   11.6\% for males, resulting in increases of 3.4 and 4.0 deer prey
   required annually by females and males respectively. Our results support
   that pumas have higher energetic costs and resource requirements in
   human-dominated habitats due to human-induced behavioral change.
   Increased energetic costs for pumas are likely to have ramifications on
   prey species and exacerbate human-wildlife conflict, especially as
   exurban growth continues. Future conservation work should consider the
   consequences of behavioral shifts on animal energetics, individual
   fitness, and population viability.}},

Volume = {{284}},

Abstract = {{Empirical studies imply that sex-specific genetic architectures can
   resolve evolutionary conflicts between males and females, and thereby
   facilitate the evolution of sexual dimorphism. Sex-specificity of
   behavioural genetic architectures has, however, rarely been considered.
   Moreover, as the expression of genetic (co) variances is often
   environment-dependent, general inferences on sex-specific genetic
   architectures require estimates of quantitative genetics parameters
   under multiple conditions. We measured exploration and aggression in
   pedigreed populations of southern field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus)
   raised on either naturally balanced (free-choice) or imbalanced
   (protein-deprived) diets. For each dietary condition, we measured for
   each behavioural trait (i) level of sexual dimorphism, (ii) level of
   sex-specificity of survival selection gradients, (iii) level of
   sex-specificity of additive genetic variance, and (iv) strength of the
   cross-sex genetic correlation. We report here evidence for sexual
   dimorphism in behaviour as well as sex-specificity in the expression of
   genetic (co) variances as predicted by theory. The additive genetic
   variances of exploration and aggression were significantly greater in
   males compared with females. Cross-sex genetic correlations were highly
   positive for exploration but deviating (significantly) from one for
   aggression; findings were consistent across dietary treatments. This
   suggests that genetic architectures characterize the sexually dimorphic
   focal behaviours across various key environmental conditions in the
   wild. Our finding also highlights that sexual conflict can be resolved
   by evolving sexually independent genetic architectures.}},

Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1272-1287}},
Month = {{OCT 3}},
Abstract = {{In late 2009, the Catalina Island Conservancy began using fertility
   control to replace periodic removals to manage an introduced population
   of American bison (Bison bison) on the island. Through the application
   of the immunocontraceptive vaccine porcine zona pellucida (PZP),
   population growth was slowed within 1 year, and halted over time. In
   response to lingering questions about the use of PZP to manage large,
   free-ranging wildlife populations, we sought to determine the
   reversibility of PZP by ceasing the annual application to a subset of 15
   bison cows and monitoring for subsequent calf arrival, and to document
   changes in the timing and length of the breeding season in response to
   PZP by monitoring breeding behavior and assessing fecal progesterone
   (FP) levels for all 60 resident cows over a 13-month period. As of June
   2017, no new calves had been observed on the island, suggesting that,
   following repeated annual treatment with PZP (3 or 4 years), bison do
   not resume normal reproduction for at least 4 or 5 years, and that fewer
   treatments would be advisable if a faster return to fertility is
   desired. Based on observations of bull and cow behavior, and FP levels,
   cows displayed estrous cycles consistently throughout the study period,
   indicating that bison may ovulate year-round when conception and its
   consequences, e.g., lactation and presence of calves, are blocked.
   Because there is little evidence that an extended breeding season would
   negatively impact the health of bulls or result in large numbers of
   out-of-season births on Catalina, PZP appears to be a highly effective
   tool for managing the population of introduced bison on the island.
   However, the extended period of contraception and breeding activity of
   both cows and bulls may make PZP less suitable in high-latitude,
   predator-rich environments where bison conservation remains a top
   priority.}},

Journal = {{HELIYON}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Some sea urchins, including the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus
   purpuratus, have been successfully used in aquaculture, but their slow
   growth and late reproduction are challenging to overcome when developing
   efficient aquaculture production techniques. S. purpuratus develops via
   an indirect life history that is characterized by a drastic settlement
   process at the end of a larval period that lasts for several weeks.
   During this transition, the bilateral larva is transformed into a
   pentaradial juvenile, which will start feeding and growing in the
   benthic habitat. Due to predation and other ecological factors,
   settlement is typically associated with high mortality rates in juvenile
   populations. Additionally, juveniles require several days to develop a
   functional mouth and digestive system. During this perimetamorphic
   period, juveniles use up larval resources until they are capable to
   digest adult food. Mechanisms underlying the onset of juvenile feeding
   and metabolism have implications for the recruitment of natural
   populations as well as aquaculture and are relatively poorly understood
   in S. purpuratus. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling
   (IIS)/Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway (IIS/TOR) is well conserved
   among animal phyla and regulates physiological and developmental
   functions, such as growth, reproduction, aging and nutritional status.
   We analyzed the expression of FoxO, TOR, and ILPs in post-settlement
   juveniles in conjunction with their early growth trajectories. We also
   tested how pre-settlement starvation affected post-settlement expression
   of IIS. We found that FoxO provides a useful molecular marker in early
   juveniles as its expression is strongly correlated with juvenile growth.
   We also found that pre-settlement starvation affects juvenile growth
   trajectories as well as IIS. Our findings provide preliminary insights
   into the mechanisms underlying post-settlement growth and metabolism in
   S. purpuratus. They also have important implications for sea urchin
   aquaculture, as they show that pre-settlement nutrient environment
   significantly affects both early growth trajectories and gene
   expression. This information can be used to develop new biomarkers for
   juvenile health in sea urchin population ecology and aquaculture
   aquaculture.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical organisms are predicted to be among the most impacted by
   increasing sea surface temperatures, particularly those from intertidal
   habitats. In this study, a complete thermal biology assessment was
   conducted for two widespread tropical Atlantic shallow reef fish:
   Abudefduf saxatilis (damselfish) and Scartella cristata (blenny), which
   make extensive use of tide pools. The main objectives were to measure
   the time-course changes during one month in i) thermal and oxidative
   stress biomarkers (in gills, muscle and skin), ii) upper thermal limits,
   acclimation capacity and thermal safety margins and iii) body size,
   condition and energy reserves (total protein and lipid contents), under
   two temperature treatments (control - mean summer temperature, and
   elevated temperature - + 3 degrees C, as projected by climate warming
   scenarios for the end of this century).
   Results from biomarker analyses suggest that under increased
   temperature, both species displayed a typical response of physiological
   stress characterized by the activation of molecular chaperones and
   antioxidant protection. Both species presented a significant acclimation
   potential in the long term, as shown by increased critical thermal
   maxima values at higher temperature. However, these species may already
   be at risk during summer heat waves, as thermal safety margins for both
   species were low. Additionally, despite acclimation, some energetic
   tradeoffs may exist, since specimens from both species showed smaller
   body sizes at higher temperature (even though maintaining body
   condition). Finally, temperature treatments had a significant influence
   not only in the total amount of energy reserves (lipid contents) but
   also in their rate of deposition or depletion (total proteins and lipid
   contents). This is the first multi-end-point holistic approach to assess
   the impact of warming in shallow tropical water fish and it highlights
   the high risk that intertidal organisms are facing in both present and

Pages = {{81-90}},

Abstract = {{Owing to trade-offs between investment in current and future
   reproduction, factors that diminish a parent's survival prospects, such
   as predation threat, are expected to increase investment in existing
   young. Nevertheless, effects of predation risk on parental investment
   have only rarely been examined, and not at all within the context of
   filial cannibalism ( parental consumption of their own offspring). We
   examined filial cannibalism and nest characteristics in a small fish
   with paternal egg care, the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus, both when
   exposed to a common piscivore, the perch, Perca fluviatilis, and in the
   absence of predators. We found that when males consumed only some of
   their eggs ( partial filial cannibalism), the number of eaten eggs did
   not depend on predation threat, possibly indicating that partial clutch
   consumption is largely motivated by benefits to existing young. Total
   filial cannibalism ( whole clutch consumption) was marginally less
   common under predator exposure, while its strongest predictor was small
   clutch size. This suggests that the return on parental investment has a
   greater influence on total filial cannibalism than the likelihood of
   future breeding. Regarding nest architecture, males that consumed their
   entire brood after exposure to a predator built larger nest entrances,
   possibly to facilitate predator evasion. Males that cared for at least
   part of their brood, however, maintained small nest entrances regardless
   of predation threat. Furthermore, more elaborate nests were not
   associated with greater egg consumption, suggesting that filial
   cannibalism is not employed to sustain nest building. (C) 2017 The

   measuring switching between feed bins. Individual consistency in
   preferences was assessed between tests, and longer-term consistency was
   evaluated by comparing these results with behaviour in novel object and
   novel feed tests before weaning. On average, the heifers preferred the
   constant, familiar feed (spending on average just 20\% of their time at
   varied feed bins), but this preference varied among individuals (from 0
   to 46\% of time eating in the forage trial, and 0-93\% in the flavour
   trial). Preference for varied forages correlated positively with intake
   of novel feed as calves (r(s) = 0.72, n = 9). Preference for varied
   flavours showed a negative correlation with latency to approach a novel
   object (r(s) = -0.65). It thus appears that preference for variety and
   exploratory foraging behaviour reflect consistent personality traits.
   These results suggest that offering novel feeds on a rotating schedule
   as a supplement to the regular diet may be an effective form of
   enrichment for at least some individuals within a herd.}},

Abstract = {{Antipredator behaviours can be lost relatively quickly in populations
   that are relieved of predation, as is known for several species
   inhabiting islands. Flight initiation distance (FID) is often studied in
   the context of island tameness; however, little is known about the
   factors that influence and maintain FID variation in predation-free
   populations. Here, we studied FID in foals of an isolated predator-free
   population of feral horses (Equus caballus L., 1758) on Sable Island,
   Canada, to determine if FID could be used for research on consistent
   individual differences in risk aversion and island tameness. In addition
   to testing for temporal, spatial, and sex effects on FID, we compared
   repeatability estimates at two temporal scales (within and among days).
   Similar FID for measurements obtained on the same day and for males and
   females indicated an absence of short-term desensitization and sex
   effects. In contrast, FID decreased for measurements made on subsequent
   days and from east to west, which could reflect habituation to human
   presence and (or) other temporal and spatial processes. Repeatability
   was high (0.42 +/- 0.06), but tended to decrease with increasing time
   intervals. This study highlights the potential of FID for
   individual-based research on the ecology and evolutionary dynamics of
   risk aversion in predation-free populations.}},

Abstract = {{The risk of both predation and food level has been shown to affect
   phenotypic development of organisms. However, these two factors also
   influence animal behavior that in turn may influence phenotypic
   development. Hence, it might be difficult to disentangle the behavioral
   effect from the predator or resource-level effects. This is because the
   presence of predators and high resource levels usually results in a
   lower activity, which in turn affects energy expenditure that is used
   for development and growth. It is therefore necessary to study how
   behavior interacts with changes in body shape with regard to resource
   density and predators. Here, we use the classic predator-induced
   morphological defense in fish to study the interaction between predator
   cues, resource availability, and behavioral activity with the aim to
   determine their relative contribution to changes in body shape. We show
   that all three variables, the presence of a predator, food level, and
   activity, both additively and interactively, affected the body shape of
   perch. In general, the presence of predators, lower swimming activity,
   and higher food levels induced a deep body shape, with predation and
   behavior having similar effect and food treatment the smallest effect.
   The shape changes seemed to be mediated by changes in growth rate as
   body condition showed a similar effect as shape with regard to
   food-level and predator treatments. Our results suggests that shape
   changes in animals to one environmental factor, for example, predation
   risk, can be context dependent, and depend on food levels or behavioral
   responses. Theoretical and empirical studies should further explore how
   this context dependence affects fitness components such as resource gain
   and mortality and their implications for population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Background Previous research has reported the existence of disordered
   eating in students studying nutrition and dietetics. However, the
   occurrence of exercise addiction, previously linked to disordered
   eating, is poorly understood in this group.
   Objective The main objective of this study was to explore the prevalence
   of self reported symptoms of exercise addiction and the association with
   disordered eating in a sample of students studying nutrition and
   dietetics. A secondary objective was to compare the prevalence of
   exercise addiction to students enrolled in another health related
   degree.
   Design We conducted a cross-sectional study in 165 undergraduate
   students.
   Participants/setting Participants were students of both sexes enrolled
   in nutrition and dietetics and occupational therapy degree programs at
   an Australian university in August 2013.
   Main outcome measures Participants completed four validated
   questionnaires for assessment of exercise- and eating-related attitudes
   and behaviors measuring scores for exercise addiction, weekly volume of
   physical activity (PA), eating disorder symptoms, and cognitive
   restraint. Stretch stature and body mass were measured and body
   composition was assessed using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry.
   Statistical analyses performed Independent t test, Mann-Whitney U test,
   and X.2 test were completed to compare groups of students based on sex,
   degree, or eating attitudes. Spearman's correlation was performed to
   explore associations between continuous variables (exercise addiction
   scores, PA volume, and scores for eating attitudes and cognitive
   restraint).
   Results Approximately 23\% of nutrition and dietetics students were
   found to be at risk of exercise addiction (20\% females and 35\% males;
   P=0.205), while the majority demonstrated some symptoms of exercise
   addiction. A similar proportion of at risk individuals was found in the
   female occupational therapy group (19\%; P=1.000). In females (nutrition
   and dietetics and occupational therapy combined), the exercise addiction
   scores were associated with three other outcome measures: PA volume
   (r(s)=0.41; P<0.001), eating attitudes scores (r(s)=0.24; P=0.008), and
   cognitive restraint (r(s)=0.32; P<0.001). Comparative analysis indicated
   that female students with high cognitive restraint had greater exercise
   addiction scores than those with low cognitive restraint (20.3 {[}4.8]
   compared to 17.8 {[}4.2]; P=0.003).
   Conclusions Results suggest high prevalence of exercise addiction in
   this sample of undergraduate health-related degree students and its link
   to amount of PA and disordered eating in females. Future research should
   include larger samples of both sexes to build the existing understanding
   on these maladaptive behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{The positive effects of the ketogenic diet (KD) on social behavior have
   been recently reported in patients and rodent models of autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD). Given the beneficial effects of the KD on epilepsy,
   mitochondrial function, carbohydrate metabolism, and inflammation,
   treatment based on the ED has the potential to reduce some of the
   ASD-associated symptoms, including abnormal social interactions. It is
   not known whether the ED influences sociability by reducing the
   pathological processes underlying ASD or through some independent
   mechanism. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of
   the KD on the social behavior of rats.
   Four-week-old Long-Evans males were treated with the KD for 4 subsequent
   weeks. Afterwards, behavioral tests were performed in order to evaluate
   sociability, locomotor activity, working memory, and anxiety-related
   behaviors. Additionally we performed the social interaction test in
   animals that were receiving beta-hydroxybutyrate or acetone. We have
   observed that rats fed with the KD showed increased social exploration
   in three different experimental settings. We did not observe any changes
   in the level of social interactions in animals treated with exogenous
   ketone bodies. The results did not show any difference in mobility or
   anxiety-related behaviors or working memory between the animals fed with
   the KD or standard rodent chow. In conclusion, we showed that the KD
   affects the social behavior of wild-type young adult male rats, which
   was not associated with other behavioral changes.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical detection of predation risk is direct when based on
   predator odors, or indirect when an injured conspecific or
   heterospecific signal it. Physiological adjustments may be necessary in
   parallel to defensive reactions to cope with an imminent risk. Here, we
   tested the effects of predator odors and conspecific chemical alarm cues
   in ventilation response (VR) of frillfin goby, Bathygobius soporator,
   because this response increases oxygen uptake for supporting behavioral
   tasks. No VR change was detected in response to odors of predators
   (catfish) that fed on conspecific, heterospecific fish (tilapia), or
   were deprived of food and to non-predator (tilapia) that fed chow
   (non-specific odor control) and odor eluent. The goby's VR, however,
   increased in response to conspecific alarm cues, but not to
   heterospecific cues or eluent. Clearly, the VR response in fish depends
   on the nature of the chemical cue. It is in line with `threat-sensitive
   hypothesis' as a chemical cue from an injured prey might mean a foraging
   predator, whilst the mere presence of a predator odor might not. In
   addition, because VR can increase, decrease or remains unchanged in
   response to predation risk in other fish species (including other
   gobies), we reinforces the species-specific chracteristic of VR
   responses in fish, regarding the results obtained here for frillfin

Abstract = {{Given that approximately two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese,
   there is substantial interest in dieting (dietary restraint) to promote
   weight loss. However, research on the associations between dietary
   restraint and binge eating is inconsistent. One possible explanation for
   contradictory findings is that measures of dietary restraint assess
   heterogeneous constructs. Nonclinical samples of university student (n =
   433; 62.6\% female) and community-recruited (n = 407; 47.4\% female)
   adults completed self-report measures of dietary restraint. Exploratory
   structural equation modeling and exploratory and confirmatory factor
   analyses were used to identify latent dietary restraint factor(s).
   Structural equation modeling and multiple regression were used to test
   associations among latent dietary restraint factor(s), body mass index
   (BMI), eating-disorder risk, binge eating, and psychopathological and
   personality variables. Three latent dietary restraint factors emerged:
   (a) Calorie Counting; (b) Preoccupation With Dieting; and (c)
   Weight-Focused Restraint. The model demonstrated a good fit to the data.
   Eating-disorder risk was significantly and positively associated with
   all restraint factors, whereas higher levels of BMI and binge eating
   were significantly associated with greater Preoccupation with Dieting
   and Weight-Focused Restraint only. Our findings indicated that dietary
   restraint is a heterogeneous construct and that measures of restraint
   assess different aspects of dieting. Our results have important
   implications for eating and weight disorders treatment, and suggest that
   weight-loss interventions that do not simultaneously increase negative
   attitudes toward one's body may be useful for treating weight disorders,

Abstract = {{Objective: This study's objective was to determine whether two distinct
   carbohydrate (CHO)-modified diets and a standard portion-controlled (PC)
   diet differentially impacted children's eating behaviors and whether
   eating behavior scores predicted lower BMI among children with obesity.
   Methods: Children (n=102) aged 7-12 years with obesity were randomly
   assigned to a 12-month intervention of a low-carbohydrate (LC), reduced
   glycemic load (RGL), or standard PC diet. The Three-Factor Eating
   Questionnaire (TFEQ) was completed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months by
   parents to characterize their child's hunger (H), disinhibition (D), and
   cognitive restraint (CR). Baseline and follow-up TFEQ scores by diet
   were evaluated relative to BMI status over time.
   Results: All diet groups showed increased CR and decreased H and D from
   baseline to 3 months, with differences from baseline remaining at 12
   months for CR and H. Lower BMI status during study follow-up was
   associated with different TFEQ scores by diet group (LC and RGL: higher
   CR; PC: lower H), adjusting for sex, age, and race. Higher CR at
   follow-up was predicted by race and higher baseline CR; only lower H at
   baseline predicted lower H at follow-up.
   Conclusion: Eating behaviors improved significantly with all diets
   during the initial 3 months; higher CR and lower H were sustained at
   treatment's end. BMI outcomes were associated with different eating
   behaviors in CHO-modified diet groups compared with PC diets. Targeting
   diets of children with obesity with specific baseline characteristics

Abstract = {{Anti-predator responses in animals are dynamic and depend on multiple
   factors. However, most of our understanding about animal escape
   responses comes from studies which examine only a small set of factors
   at a time and are done over a short period of animal life spans. This
   limits our understanding of the dynamic nature of animal escape
   behaviour and the relative importance of individual factors in
   determining their escape behaviour. We used a repeated-measures study
   design to assess the anti-predator response of a wild population of a
   sexually dimorphic tropical lizard, Psammophilus dorsalis. We followed
   marked individuals throughout their breeding lifespan, repeatedly
   assayed their escape response and measured representative intrinsic and
   extrinsic factors that could modulate their escape response. Our
   findings suggest that intrinsic factors, such as sex and body size,
   influenced escape response relatively more than extrinsic factors did,
   such as distance to refuge and perch height. Although individual
   variables influenced escape behaviour, in a direction mostly consistent
   with predictions from optimal escape theory, the interaction between
   factors led to novel insights into how animals dynamically evaluate
   multiple and changing costs throughout their lifetime to evade
   predation.
   Significance statement
   Fleeing from a potential predator is crucial to animals and depends on
   different factors, as there are various costs to escaping. Although
   several studies in the past have evaluated the role of various factors
   in determining escape response, the relative importance of factors and
   how it changes across the lifetime of individuals are not clear. By
   assessing individuals repeatedly over a substantial part of their
   lifespan, we could gain insight into how escape response changes as
   associated factors, intrinsic or extrinsic, change for an individual
   over time. This approach provided us a more robust and accurate
   representation of the dynamic nature of escape decisions. We also
   demonstrate that when multiple factors are considered simultaneously,
   their relative importance in determining timing of escape can
   considerably differ from theoretical predictions.}},

Abstract = {{In animal societies, behavioral idiosyncrasies of the individuals often
   guide which tasks they should perform. Such personality-specific task
   participation can increase individual task efficiency, thereby improving
   group performance. While several recent studies have documented
   group-level benefits of within-group behavioral (i.e., personality)
   diversity, how these benefits are realized at the individual level is
   unclear. Here we probe the individual-level benefits of
   personality-driven task participation in the social spider Stegodyphus
   dumicola. In S. dumicola, the presence of at least one highly bold
   individual catalyzes foraging behavior in shy colony members, and all
   group constituents heavily compete for prey. We assessed boldness by
   examining how quickly spiders resumed normal movement after a simulated
   predator attack. We test here whether (1) participants in collective
   foraging gain more mass from prey items and (2) whether bold individuals
   are less resistant to starvation than shy spiders, which would motivate
   the bold individuals to forage more. Next, we assembled colonies of shy
   spiders with and without a bold individual, added one prey item, and
   then tracked the mass gain of each individual spider after this single
   feeding event. We found that spiders that participated in prey capture
   (whether bold or shy) gained more mass than nonparticipators, and
   colonies containing a single bold spider gained more total mass than
   purely shy colonies. We also found that bold spiders participated in
   more collective foraging events and were more susceptible to starvation
   than shy spiders, suggesting that the aggressive foraging of bold
   individuals may represent a strategy to offset starvation risk. These
   findings add to the body of evidence that animal personality can shape
   social organization, individual performance, and group success.}},

Abstract = {{Parent birds show a continuous spectrum of breeding strategies, ranging
   from a low-fecundity and high-survival pattern to a high-fecundity,
   low-survival pattern. Investigations of parental breeding strategies
   under variable environmental conditions can illustrate how parents
   trade-off the benefits and costs of these two extreme strategies.
   White-collared Blackbirds Turdus albocinctus can breed twice a year on
   the Tibetan Plateau. We show that both life-history traits and parental
   feeding behaviour differ between these two breeding attempts. In the
   first attempt, the birds produced small clutches and fledged a small
   number of nestlings of high body condition. In the second attempt, they
   produced larger clutches and fledged more nestlings of lower body
   condition. Males made greater contributions to brood provisioning
   compared with females in the first attempt but there was no sex
   difference in brood provisioning in the second attempt. In the first
   attempt, producing smaller clutches can shorten the nestling period, and
   the increased male contribution to brood provisioning can protect the
   energy reserves of females. Thus, females can begin a second attempt
   sooner and produce larger clutches. During the second nesting attempt,
   when conditions are warmer and wetter, parents rely on a broader array
   of food types (both invertebrates and plant material, primarily berries)
   than during the first attempt, which includes only animal food such as
   arthropods and annelids. We suggest that this difference in breeding
   strategies between nesting attempts and sexes is in part influenced by
   marked seasonal variation in food availability.}},

Abstract = {{Lifestyle intervention can be effective when treating non-alcoholic
   fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) patients. Weight loss decreases
   cardiovascular and diabetes risk and can also regress liver disease.
   Weight reductions of >= 10\% can induce a near universal non-alcoholic
   steatohepatitis resolution and fibrosis improvement by at least one
   stage. However, modest weight loss (>5\%) can also produce important
   benefits on the components of the NAFLD activity score (NAS).
   Additionally, we need to explore the role of total calories and type of
   weight loss diet, micro-and macronutrients, evidence-based benefits of
   physical activity and exercise and finally support these modifications
   through established behavioural change models and techniques for
   long-term maintenance of lifestyle modifications.
   Following a Mediterranean diet can reduce liver fat even without weight
   loss and is the most recommended dietary pattern for NAFLD. The
   Mediterranean diet is characterised by reduced carbohydrate intake,
   especially sugars and refined carbohydrates (40\% of the calories vs.
   5060\% in a typical low fat diet), and increased monounsaturated and
   omega-3 fatty acid intake (40\% of the calories as fat vs. up-to 30\% in
   a typical low fat diet). Both TV sitting (a reliable marker of overall
   sedentary behaviour) and physical activity are associated with
   cardiometabolic health, NAFLD and overall mortality. A `triple hit
   behavioural phenotype' of: i) sedentary behaviour, ii) low physical
   activity, and iii) poor diet have been defined. Clinical evidence
   strongly supports the role of lifestyle modification as a primary
   therapy for the management of NAFLD and NASH. This should be accompanied
   by the implementation of strategies to avoid relapse and weight regain.

Abstract = {{1. The swallowtail butterfly Battus polydamas archidamas Boisduval,
   1936, exhibits polyphenism for pupal coloration (green and brown). It is
   distributed across arid regions with winter rains and is monophagous on
   Aristolochia plants, which emerge after the winter rains and dry out the
   during summer. Thus, day length does not covary positively with host
   plant productivity. It was hypothesised that pupal colour was driven by
   food availability, not photoperiod. The benefits of pupal coloration
   matching the colour of pupation sites in terms of field survival were
   also investigated to evaluate the adaptive value of pupa colour.
   2. Larvae were reared under a factorial array of two photoperiods (LD
   10: 14 h and LD 14: 10 h) and two food availability regimes (leaves ad
   libitum and available every other day) to assess the frequency of green
   and brown pupae. Field survival of green and brown pupae was quantified
   in three commonly used habitats that differ in background coloration
   (cacti, rocks and shrubs).
   3. Food availability determined pupal colour. Larvae in the ad libitum
   regime resulted mostly in green pupae, while those with restricted food
   were mostly brown. In contrast, photoperiod did not influence pupal
   colour. Survival probability of pupae placed on cacti was higher than
   those placed on rocks and shrubs, and the lowest predation risk across
   habitats was for green pupae on cacti.
   4. Food availability plays a major role in the seasonal polyphenism for
   pupal colour of specialist butterflies inhabiting arid environments with

Abstract = {{Round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) have invaded benthic habitats of
   the Laurentian Great Lakes and connected tributary streams. Although
   connected, these two systems generally differ in temperature (Great
   Lakes are typically colder), food availability (Dreissenid mussels are
   more prevalent in Great Lakes), and system size and openness. Here, we
   compare round goby life histories from inshore Lake Michigan and
   adjacent tributary systemsan uncommon case study of life-history
   differences between connected systems. Tributary round gobies grew much
   faster (average length-at-age of 122.3 vs. 65.7mm for Age 2+ round
   gobies), appeared to have shorter life spans (maximum observed age of 2
   vs. 5) and had lower age-at-50\% maturity (1.6 vs. 2.4years; females
   only) compared to gobies from Lake Michigan. In addition, tributary
   gobies had greater fecundity at Ages 1-2 than lake gobies, but had fewer
   eggs for a given body size prior to the first spawning event of the
   summer. We were not able to determine the cause of the observed
   life-history differences. Nonetheless, the observed differences in
   growth, maturation and longevity were consistent with known effects of
   water temperature, as well as predictions of life-history theory for
   animals at invasion fronts exposed to novel environmental conditions.
   The high degree of phenotypic plasticity in connected populations of

Title = {{The association of addictive-like eating with food intake in children}},
Journal = {{APPETITE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{82-90}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: The potential role of an addictive process in problematic
   eating is a growing area of interest and debate. Children are more
   vulnerable to the negative effects of addictive substances than adults
   and may be at increased risk for addictive-like eating behavior. No
   prior study has evaluated the association of addictive-like eating with
   objectively measured eating behavior in adults or children. We examined
   the association between ``food addiction{''} and observed food
   consumption among children and whether age moderated this association.
   Method: Seventy children participated in an observed dinner meal,
   completed a dietary recall interview, and answered the Yale Food
   Addiction Scale for Children (YFAS-C), a questionnaire assessing
   symptoms of ``food addiction{''}. Children's total calories ordered,
   calories consumed at dinner, calories consumed post-dinner, and a total
   of calories consumed at dinner and post-dinner were calculated along
   with their BMI percentile. We used generalized estimated equation models
   to investigate the relationship between the YFAS-C and food consumption.
   Results: Elevated ``food addiction{''} symptoms, but not BMI percentile,
   were positively associated with an increased amount of calories consumed
   at dinner and post-dinner. Age significantly moderated the relationship
   between YFAS-C and caloric intake, with only younger children exhibiting
   this association.
   Conclusions: As the first study of objectively measured eating behavior,
   we found addictive-like eating scores in children were positively
   associated with the total amount of calories consumed. Among younger
   children, ``food addiction{''} was more strongly asociated with the
   total calories consumed than BMI percentile, highlighting the importance
   of assessing behavioral phenotypes when evaluating caloric intake. This
   association between addictive-like eating and caloric intake among
   younger, but not older children may be due to differences in inhibitory
   control and dietary restraint. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{SEP 29}},
Abstract = {{Tests based on hyponeophagia phenomena are the most widely used to check
   the efficacy and efficiency of new-generation chronic antidepressant
   treatments. Even so, these tests lack strict consensus about their
   methodology, which reduces their validity, reproducibility and makes
   translatability difficult. Therefore, after an extensive literature
   review on this subject, we propose a methodological protocol for the
   Novelty-Suppressed Feeding Test to normalize this situation. Animals
   were induced to a reserpine-induced depression model and were then
   chronically treated with duloxetine, desvenlafaxine or vehicle. After a
   14-day treatment, a standardized Novelty-Suppressed Feeding Test was
   performed. Standardization included three-phase deprivation and the
   introduction of standard highly palatable food. The duloxetine-treated
   and desvenlafaxine-treated animals exhibited behavioral improvement of
   depressive-like symptoms. They took less time to eat from the center of
   the open-field, and approached food more times per minute than the
   vehicle-treated animals. This normalization proposal proves effective in
   measuring the antidepressant effect on chronic treatment. Thus
   introducing this normalization proposal would reduce inter-laboratory
   variability and increase the validity and robustness of this behavioral
   test. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{Evidence from epidemiological, clinical, and experimental studies have
   clearly shown that disease risk in later life is increased following a
   poor early life environment, a process preferentially termed
   developmental programming. In particular, this work clearly highlights
   the importance of the nutritional environment during early development
   with alterations in maternal nutrition, including both under-and
   overnutrition, increasing the risk for a range of cardiometabolic and
   neurobehavioral disorders in adult offspring characterized by both
   adipokine resistance and obesity. Although the mechanistic basis for
   such developmental programming is not yet fully defined, a common
   feature derived from experimental animal models is that of alterations
   in the wiring of the neuroendocrine pathways that control energy balance
   and appetite regulation during early stages of developmental plasticity.
   The adipokine leptin has also received significant attention with clear
   experimental evidence that normal regulation of leptin levels during the
   early life period is critical for the normal development of tissues and
   related signaling pathways that are involved in metabolic and
   cardiovascular homeostasis. There is also increasing evidence that
   alterations in the epigenome and other underlying mechanisms including
   an altered gut-brain axis may contribute to lasting cardiometabolic
   dysfunction in offspring. Ongoing studies that further define the
   mechanisms between these associations will allow for identification of
   early risk markers and implementation of strategies around interventions
   that will have obvious beneficial implications in breaking a programmed
   transgenerational cycle of metabolic disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Active flight requires the ability to efficiently fuel bursts of costly

   We took a multi-faceted approach to estimate how fruit-eating bats

   fig juice. Miniaturized heart rate telemetry shows that they use a
   novel, cyclic, bradycardic state that reduces daily energetic
   expenditure by 10\% and counteracts heart rates as high as 900 bpm
   during flight. Uroderma bilobatum support flight with some of the
   fastest metabolic incorporation rates and dynamic circulating cortisol
   in vertebrates. These bats will exchange fat reserves within 24 hr,
   meaning that they must survive on the food of the day and are at daily
   risk of starvation. Energetic flexibly in U. bilobatum highlights the

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that biological markers are associated with human

   Transplantation (ACT) randomized controlled trial}},
Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Low physical activity and reduced physical functioning are
   common after renal transplantation, resulting in a reduced quality of
   life. Another common post-transplantation complication is poor
   cardio-metabolic health, which plays a main role in long-term outcomes
   in renal transplant recipients (RTR). It is increasingly recognized that
   weight gain in the first year after transplantation, especially an
   increase in fat mass, is a highly common contributor to cardio-metabolic
   risk. The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes of usual care to
   the effects of exercise alone, and exercise combined with dietary
   counseling, on physical functioning, quality of life and
   post-transplantation weight gain in RTR.
   Methods: The Active Care after Transplantation study is a multicenter
   randomized controlled trial with three arms in which RTR from 3 Dutch
   hospitals are randomized within the first year after transplantation to
   usual care, to exercise intervention (3 months supervised exercise 2
   times per week followed by 12 months active follow-up), or to an
   exercise + diet intervention, consisting of the exercise training with
   additional dietary counseling (12 sessions over 15 months by a renal
   dietician). In total, 219 participants (73 per group) will be recruited.
   The primary outcome is the subdomain physical functioning of quality of
   life, (SF-36 PF). Secondary outcomes include other evaluations of
   quality of life (SF-36, KDQOL-SF, EQ-5D), objective measures of physical
   functioning (aerobic capacity and muscle strength), level of physical
   activity, gain in adiposity (body fat percentage by bio-electrical
   impedance assessment, BMI, waist circumference), and cardiometabolic
   risk factors (blood pressure, lipids, glucose metabolism). Furthermore,
   data on renal function, medical history, medication, psychological
   factors (motivation, kinesiophobia, coping style), nutrition knowledge,
   nutrition intake, nutrition status, fatigue, work participation, process
   evaluation and cost-effectiveness are collected.
   Discussion: Evidence on the effectiveness of an exercise intervention,
   or an exercise + diet intervention on physical functioning, weight gain
   and cardiometabolic health in RTR is currently lacking. The outcomes of
   the present study may help to guide future evidence-based lifestyle care
   after renal transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{Childhood malnutrition is a risk factor for mental disorders, such as
   major depression and anxiety. Evidence shows that similar early life
   adversities induce sex-dependent epigenetic reprogramming. However,
   little is known about how genes are specifically affected by early
   malnutrition and the implications for males and females respectively.
   One relevant target is neuropeptide Y (NPY), which regulates both stress
   and food-intake. We studied maternal low protein diet (LPD) during
   pregnancy/lactation in mice. Male, but not female, offspring of LPD
   mothers consistently displayed anxiety-and depression-like behaviors
   under acute stress. Transcriptome-wide analysis of the effects of acute
   stress in the amygdala, revealed a list of transcription factors
   affected by either sex or perinatal LPD. Among these immediate early
   genes (IEG), members of the Early growth response family (Egr1/2/4) were
   consistently upregulated by perinatal LPD in both sexes. EGR1 also bound
   the NPY receptor Y1 gene (Npy1r), which co-occurred with sex-specific
   effects of perinatal LPD on both Npy1r DNA-methylation and gene
   transcription. Our proposed pathway connecting early malnutrition,
   sex-independent regulatory changes in Egr1, and sex-specific epigenetic
   reprogramming of its effector gene, Npy1r, represents the first
   molecular evidence of how early life risk factors may generate
   sex-specific epigenetic effects relevant for mental disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Animal welfare should be prioritized not only for the
   animal's life sustainability but also for supporting the sustainability
   of living organism's life on the earth. However, Indonesian people have
   not understood it yet, thereby still treating animals arbitrarily and
   not appreciating either domesticated or wild animals.
   Aim: This research aimed to analyze the zoo agent's action in applying
   the five freedoms principle for animal welfare in Taman Satwa Taru Jurug
   (thereafter called TSTJ) or Surakarta Zoo and Gembira Loka Zoo (GLZ) of
   Yogyakarta Indonesia using Giddens structuration theory.
   Materials and Methods: The informants in this comparative study with
   explorative were organizers, visitors, and stakeholders of zoos selected
   using purposive sampling technique. The informants consisted of 19
   persons: 8 from TSTJ (Code T) and 10 from GLZ (Code G) and
   representatives from Natural Resource Conservation Center of Central
   Java (Code B). Data were collected through observation, in-depth
   interview, and Focus Group Discussion and Documentation. Data were
   analyzed using an interactive model of analysis consisting of three
   components: Data reduction, data display, and conclusion drawing. Data
   validation was carried out using method and data source triangulations.
   Results: Food, nutrition, and nutrition level have been given consistent
   with the animals' habit and natural behavior. Animal keepers always
   maintain their self-cleanliness. GLZ has provided cages according to the
   technical instruction of constructing ideal cages, but the cages in TSTJ
   are worrying as they are not consistent with standard, rusty, and
   damaged, and animals have no partner. Some animals in GLZ are often
   sick, whereas some animals in TSTJ are dead due to poor maintenance. The
   iron pillars of cages restrict animal behavior in TSTJ so that they have
   not had freedom to behave normally yet, whereas, in GLZ, they can move
   freely in original habitat. The animals in the two zoos have not been
   free from disruption, stress, and pressure due to the passing over
   vehicles.
   Conclusion: There should be strategic communication, information, and
   education, community development, and law enforcement for the animal
   welfare.}},

   interventions. The objective of the present scoping review was to
   identify the attributes of food literacy.
   Design: A scoping review of peer-reviewed and grey literature was
   conducted and attributes of food literacy identified. Subjects included
   in the search were high-risk groups. Eligible articles were limited to
   research from Canada, USA, the UK, Australia and New Zealand.
   Results: The search identified nineteen peer-reviewed and thirty grey
   literature sources. Fifteen identified food literacy attributes were
   organized into five categories. Food and Nutrition Knowledge informs
   decisions about intake and distinguishing between healthy' and
   unhealthy' foods. Food Skills focuses on techniques of food purchasing,
   preparation, handling and storage. Self-Efficacy and Confidence
   represent one's capacity to perform successfully in specific situations.

   microsystems with food decisions and behaviours. Food Decisions reflects
   the application of knowledge, information and skills to make food
   choices. These interdependent attributes are depicted in a proposed
   conceptual model.
   Conclusions: The lack of evaluated tools inhibits the ability to assess
   and monitor food literacy; tailor, target and evaluate programmes;
   identify gaps in programming; engage in advocacy; and allocate
   resources. The present scoping review provides the foundation for the
   development of a food literacy measurement tool to address these gaps.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Among young children excessive externalizing behaviors often
   predict adolescent conduct and substance use disorders. Adolescents with
   those disorders show aberrant brain function when choosing between risky
   or cautious options. We therefore asked whether similarly aberrant brain
   function during risky decision making accompanies excessive
   externalizing behaviors among children, hypothesizing an association
   between externalizing severity and regional intensity of brain
   activation during risky decision-making.
   Method: Fifty-eight (58) 9-11 year-old children (both sexes), half
   community-recruited, half with substance treated relatives, had
   parent-rated Child Behavior Checklist Externalizing scores. During fMRI,
   children repeatedly chose between doing a cautious behavior earning 1
   point or a risky behavior that won 5 or lost 10 points. Conservative
   permutation-based whole-brain regression analyses sought brain regions
   where, during decision-making, activation significantly associated with
   externalizing score, with sex, and with their interaction.
   Results: Before risky responses higher externalizing scores were
   significantly, negatively associated with neural activation (t's:
   2.91-4.76) in regions including medial prefrontal cortex (monitors
   environmental reward-punishment schedules), insula (monitors internal
   motivating states, e.g., hunger, anxiety), dopaminergic striatal and
   midbrain structures (anticipate and mediate reward), and cerebellum
   (where injuries actually induce externalizing behaviors). Before
   cautious responses there were no significant externalizing:activation
   associations (except in post hoc exploratory analyses), no significant
   sex differences in activation, and no significant sex-by externalizing
   interactions.
   Conclusions: Among children displaying more externalizing behaviors
   extensive decision-critical brain regions were hypoactive before risky
   behaviors. Such neural hypoactivity may contribute to the excessive
   real-life risky decisions that often produce externalizing behaviors.
   Substance exposure, minimal here, was a very unlikely cause.}},

Abstract = {{All too often, studies of sexual selection focus exclusively on the
   responses in one sex, on single traits, typically those that are
   exaggerated and strongly sexually dimorphic. They ignore a range of less
   obvious traits and behavior, in both sexes, involved in the interactions
   leading to mate choice. To remedy this imbalance, we analyze a textbook
   example of sexual selection in the stalk-eyed fly (Diasemopsis
   meigenii). We studied several traits in a novel, insightful, and
   efficient experimental design, examining 2,400 male-female pairs in a
   round-robin array, where each female was tested against multiple males
   and vice versa. In D.meigenii, females exhibit strong mate preference
   for males with highly exaggerated eyespan, and so we deliberately
   constrained variation in male eyespan to reveal the importance of other
   traits. Males performing more precopulatory behavior were more likely to
   attempt to mate with females and be accepted by them. However, behavior
   was not a necessary part of courtship, as it was absent from over almost
   half the interactions. Males with larger reproductive organs (testes and
   accessory glands) did not make more mating attempts, but there was a
   strong tendency for females to accept mating attempts from such males.
   How females detect differences in male reproductive organ size remains
   unclear. In addition, females with larger eyespan, an indicator of size
   and fecundity, attracted more mating attempts from males, but this trait
   did not alter female acceptance. Genetic variation among males had a
   strong influence on male mating attempts and female acceptance, both via
   the traits we studied and other unmeasured attributes. These findings
   demonstrate the importance of assaying multiple traits in males and
   females, rather than focusing solely on prominent and exaggerated
   sexually dimorphic traits. The approach allows a more complete
   understanding of the complex mating decisions made by both males and
   females.}},

Abstract = {{Policy decisions have the potential to affect biodiversity conservation
   and modify, among other factors, animal demography, behavior and
   ecological processes. This became manifest in Europe in the past decade
   in light of the appearance of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
   However, the obvious effects of policy decisions on foraging behavior
   are lacking. Here, we use data from a long-term study (1992-2015) of the
   ecology of the bearded vulture Gypaetus barbatus in the Pyrenees to
   assess whether or not the implementation of health policies in the
   period 2006-2011 really did affect this vultures foraging behavior and
   breeding success. To test this, we used the frequency of nest
   changeovers (between 1992 and 2015) as a surrogate for the time invested
   in searching for and obtaining food. Additionally, between 2006 and 2015
   we monitored the movements of 20 bearded vultures with GPS satellite
   transmitters. Our findings show no differences between annual home range
   sizes and/or the time used to search for food either before, during or
   after the imposition of health regulations. No differences between
   periods (during or after health regulations) were found in the use of
   supplementary feeding sites (SFS). An analysis of food available
   indicates that this similarity of use in different periods could be
   explained by the high habitat quality in the Pyrenees and the good
   availability of trophic resources. Our results suggest that diet
   plasticity and habitat quality compensate for the sudden effects of food
   shortages and so question the true usefulness of SFS in buffering a
   quantitative food deficit. We discuss the implications of these results
   from both ecological and conservation perspectives.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Diabetes and depression are reciprocally linked, but few
   studies modeled their interplay considering the influence of affective
   temperaments (AT) and demographic factors.
   Methods: Participants with type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1DM and T2DM, n
   = 279) recruited from Diabetes Units were assessed with the Beck
   Depression Inventory (BDI), Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa,
   Paris and San Diego-autoquestionnaire version (TEMPS-A), Morisky
   Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS), Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) and
   Cumulative Illness Rating Scales (CIRS). Glycosylated hemoglobin levels
   (HBA1C) was used as index of glycemic control. The bi-directional
   association between glycemic control, depression and candidate mediators
   was examined with Structural Equation Modeling, testing the impact of
   moderator variables (AT, diabetes type, age and gender) with multigroup
   comparison.
   Results: The association between HBA1C and depressive symptoms was
   mediated by diabetes-related distress,, while there was no definite
   evidence of depression influencing HBA1C through changes of adherence,
   tiredness, appetite, alcohol intake or smoking. Among individuals with
   AT, distress was unrelated to HBA1C and had a higher impact on
   depression; adherence was inversely association with HBA1C. Moreover,
   physical comorbidities impacted on depression. While diabetes type had a
   moderation role, age and gender did not affect the model.
   Limitations: Cross sectional design, lack of objective measures of diet
   and physical activity.
   Conclusions: Glycemic control seem to influence the severity of
   depressive symptoms, but the reciprocal association seems
   non-significant. AT and diabetes type may shape this relationship

Abstract = {{Psychosocial stress is associated with an increased intake of palatable
   foods and weight gain in stress reactive individuals. Personality traits
   have been shown to predict stress-reactivity. However, it is not known
   if personality traits influence brain activity in regions implicated in
   appetite control during psychosocial stress. The current study assessed
   whether Gray's Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS) scale, a measure of
   stress-reactivity, was related to the activity of brain regions
   implicated in appetite control during a stressful period. Twenty-two
   undergraduate students participated in a functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) experiment once during a non-exam period and once during
   final exams in a counter-balanced order. In the scanner, they viewed
   food and scenery pictures. In the exam compared with the non-exam
   condition, BIS scores related to increased perceived stress and
   correlated with increased blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response
   to high-calorie food images in regions implicated in food reward and
   subjective value, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, (vmPFC)
   and the amygdala. BIS scores negatively related to the functional
   connectivity between the vmPFC and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
   The results demonstrate that the BIS trait influences stress reactivity.
   This is observed both as an increased activity in brain regions
   implicated in computing the value of food cues and decreased
   connectivity of these regions to prefrontal regions implicated in
   self-control. This suggests that the effects of real life stress on
   appetitive brain function and self-control is modulated by a personality
   trait. This may help to explain why stressful periods can lead to

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Nutrient deprivation during early development has been associated with
   the predisposition to metabolic disorders in adulthood. Considering its
   interaction with metabolism, appetite and behavior, the endocannabinoid
   (eCB) system represents a promising target of developmental programming.
   Methods
   By cross-fostering and variation of litter size, early postnatal
   nutrition of CB6F1-hybrid mice was controlled during the lactation
   period (3, 6, or 10 pups/mother). After weaning and redistribution at
   P21, all pups received standard chow ad libitum. Gene expression
   analyses (liver, visceral fat, hypothalamus) were performed at P50, eCB
   concentrations were determined in liver and visceral fat. Locomotor
   activity and social behavior were analyzed by means of computer-assisted
   videotracking.
   Results
   Body growth was permanently altered, with differences for length,
   weight, body mass index and fat mass persisting beyond P100 (all 3>6>10,
   p<0.01). This was paralleled by differences in hepatic IGF-I expression
   (p<0.01). Distinct gene expression patterns for key enzymes of the eCB
   system were observed in fat (eCB-synthesis: 3>6>10 (DAGL alpha p<0.05;
   NAPE-PLD p = 0.05)) and liver (eCB-degradation: 3>6>10 (FAAH p<0.05; MGL
   p<0.01)). Concentrations of endocannabinoids AEA and 2-AG in liver and
   visceral fat were largely comparable, except for a borderline
   significance for higher AEA (liver, p = 0.049) in formerly overfed mice
   and, vice versa, tendencies (p<0.1) towards lower AEA (fat) and 2-AG
   (liver) in formerly underfed animals. In the arcuate nucleus, formerly
   underfed mice tended to express more eCB-receptor transcripts (CB1R
   p<0.05; CB2R p = 0.08) than their overfed fellows. Open-field social
   behavior testing revealed significant group differences, with formerly
   underfed mice turning out to be the most sociable animals (p<0.01).
   Locomotor activity did not differ.
   Conclusion
   Our data indicate a developmental plasticity of somatic growth, behavior
   and parameters of the eCB system, with long-lasting impact of early
   postnatal nutrition. Developmental programming of the eCB system in
   metabolically active tissues, as shown here for liver and fat, may play
   a role in the formation of the adult cardiometabolic risk profile
   following perinatal malnutrition in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural decisions are often context-dependent, where information
   from immediate experience is incorporated into an individual's
   decision-making, particularly in complex environments. To test whether
   such mechanism is adopted by foragers in heterogeneous environments, we
   investigated the foraging behaviour of the deposit-feeding sand-bubbler
   crab, Scopimera intermedia. An individual-based model was constructed,
   based on an optimal-patch selection criterion, which implicitly assumed
   that individuals adjust foraging decisions based on immediate past
   experience. The model's predictions were tested on the shore by
   manipulating the location of food patches, where the crab showed a
   strong context-dependent foraging pattern. When resources were randomly
   distributed, the crab responded by spending 56\% of time in enriched
   patches compared with only 28\% in the same area when patches were
   composed of natural sediments. Shore manipulations varying resource
   distribution supported the underlying principles of the model mechanism,
   and highlighted the benefits of such a strategy in heterogeneous
   environments such as intertidal sediments where food resources vary at
   different spatial and temporal scales. The proposed model therefore
   provides a mechanistic process, based on optimal foraging, to predict
   foraging decisions and movement patterns of animals feeding in

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{Alternative behavioral strategies typically differ in their associated
   risks, meaning that a different variance in fitness-related outcomes
   characterizes each behavior. Understanding how selection acts on risk
   preference is crucial to interpreting and predicting behavior. Despite
   much research, most theoretical frameworks have been laid out as
   optimization problems from the individual's perspective, and the
   influence of population dynamics has been underappreciated. We use
   agentbased simulations that implement competition between two simple
   behavioral strategies to illuminate effects of population dynamics on
   risk-taking. We explore the effects of inter-generational reproduction
   dynamics, population size, the number of decisions throughout an
   individual's life, and simple alternate distributions of risk. We find
   that these factors, very often ignored in empirical and theoretical
   studies of behavior, can have significant and non-intuitive impacts on
   the selection of alternative behavioral strategies. Our results
   demonstrate that simple rules regarding predicted risk preference do not
   hold across the complete range of each of the factors we studied; we
   propose intuitive interpretations for the dynamics within each regime.
   We suggest that studies of behavioral strategies should explicitly take
   into account the species' life history and the ecological context in
   which selection acted on the riskrelated behavior of the organism of
   interest.}},

Abstract = {{Group living has been proposed to yield benefits that enhance fitness
   above the level that would be achieved through living as solitary
   individuals. Dominance hierarchies occur commonly in these social
   assemblages, and result, by definition, in resources not being evenly
   distributed between group members. Determinants of rank within a
   dominance hierarchy can be associated with morphological
   characteristics, previous experience of the individual, or personality
   traits such as exploration tendencies. The purpose of this study was to
   investigate whether greater exploration and positive responses to novel
   objects in homing pigeons (Columba livia) measured under laboratory
   conditions were associated with (i) greater initial exploration of the
   local area around the home loft during spontaneous exploration flights
   (SEF), (ii) faster and more efficient homing flights when released from
   further afield, and (iii) whether the traits of greater exploration and
   more positive responses to novel objects were more likely to be
   exhibited by the more dominant individuals within the group. There was
   no relationship between laboratory-based novel object exploration and
   position within the dominance hierarchy. Pigeons that were neophobic
   under laboratory conditions did not explore the local area during SEF
   opportunities. When released from sites further from home, neophobic
   pigeons took longer routes to home compared to those birds that had not
   exhibited neophobic traits under laboratory conditions, and had
   spontaneously explored to a greater extent. The lack of exploration in
   the neophobic birds is likely to have resulted in the increased costs of
   homing following release: unfamiliarity with the landscape likely led to
   the greater distances travelled and less efficient routes taken. Birds
   that demonstrated a lack of neophobia were not the dominant individuals
   inside the loft, and thus would have less access to resources such as
   food and potentially mates. However, a lack of neophobia makes the
   subordinate position possible, because subordinate birds that incur high
   travel costs would become calorie restricted and lose condition. Our
   results address emerging questions linking individual variation in
   behaviour with energetics and fitness consequences.

Abstract = {{In this time of massive global change, species are now frequently
   interacting with novel players. Greater insight into the impact of these
   novel interactions on traits linked to fitness is essential, because
   effects on these traits can hinder population existence or promote rapid
   adaptation. Sexually selected weapons and ornaments frequently influence
   fitness and often have heightened condition-dependence in response to
   nutrition. Condition-dependence in response to different ecological
   conditions, a form of developmental plasticity, may be responsible for
   much of the intraspecific variation in sexually selected ornaments and
   weapons in wild populations. Here we examined the consequences of
   developing on a novel plant for the expression of size and shape in the
   leaf-footed cactus bug Narnia femorata (Hemiptera: Coreidae). Themales
   of this species possess enlarged, sexually dimorphic femurs on their
   hind legs. These legs are used as weapons in male-male contests. Females
   are typically larger in overall body size. Our study revealed that
   developing upon a novel host can lead to pronounced phenotypically
   plastic change in sexually dimorphic traits. Male hind femurs were
   greatly impacted by the novel diet to the extent that the sexual
   dimorphism in hind femurs was lost. Further, dimorphismin body size
   increased, as males became tiny adults while females better maintained
   their body size. These patterns underscore the complex effects that
   novel species interactions may have on sexual phenotypes.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Animals often view humans as predators, leading to alterations in their
   behavior. Even nuanced aspects of human activity like clothing color
   affect animal behavior, but we lack an understanding of when and where
   such effects will occur. The species confidence hypothesis posits that
   birds are attracted to colors found on their bodies and repelled by
   non-body colors. Here, we extend this hypothesis taxonomically and
   conceptually to test whether this pattern is applicable in a non-avian
   reptile and to suggest that species should respond less fearfully to
   their sexually-selected signaling color. Responses to clothing color
   could also be impacted by habituation to humans, so we examine whether
   behavior varied between areas with low and high human activity. We
   quantified the effects of four T-shirt colors on flight initiation
   distances (FID) and on the ease of capture in western fence lizards
   (Sceloporus occidentalis), and we accounted for detectability against
   the background environment. We found no differences in lizard behavior
   between sites. However, lizards tolerated the closest approaches and
   were most likely to be captured when approached with the T-shirt that
   resembled their sexually-selected signaling color. Because changes in
   individual behavior affect fitness, choice of clothing color by people,
   including tourists, hikers, and researchers, could impact wildlife
   populations and research outcomes.}},

Title = {{Examining the relationship between the food environment and adult
   diabetes prevalence by county economic and racial composition: an
   ecological study}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Inequitable access to healthy food may contribute to health
   disparities. This study examines the relationship between the prevalence
   of adult diabetes and food access in the U.S. by county economic/racial
   composition.
   Methods: An ecological study from 2012 was used to estimate the
   relationship between diabetes and retail food outlet access. County
   diabetes prevalence was measured based on individual responses to the
   Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey question, ``Have you ever
   been told by a doctor that you have diabetes?{''} If the answer was
   ``yes{''} individuals were classified as having diabetes. Retail food
   outlets included grocery stores, supercenters, farmer's markets,
   full-service restaurants, fast food restaurants and convenience stores.
   Counties were categorized as ``high-poverty{''} or ``low-poverty{''}.
   Counties were categorized as low (< 4.6\%), medium (4.6\%-31.0\%), and
   high (> 31.0\%) percent minority residents. Multiple linear regression
   models estimated the association between retail food outlets and
   diabetes, controlling for confounders, and testing for interactions
   between retail food outlets and county racial composition. Regression
   models were conditioned on county economic composition. Data were
   analyzed in 2016.
   Results: Density of retail foods outlets varied greatly by county
   economic and racial composition; counties with medium-minority
   populations had the least access to grocery stores and the highest
   access to fast food restaurants and convenience stores. Low
   poverty/low-minority population counties had the greatest access to
   farmer's markets and grocery stores. For low poverty/low-minority
   counties, grocery stores were associated with decreased of diabetes
   prevalence. Supercenters were associated with an increase in diabetes
   prevalence for high-poverty/low-minority counties. Only low
   poverty/medium-minority counties had a statistically significant
   relationship between farmer's markets and diabetes prevalence. Fast food
   restaurants were found to be positively associated with diabetes
   prevalence in all counties except high poverty/medium-minority. However,
   only low poverty/low-minority counties had a statistically significant
   relationship. Across all models, access to full service restaurants were
   significantly associated with lower prevalence of diabetes. Generally,
   access to convenience stores were associated with increased diabetes
   prevalence, except for high poverty/low-minority counties.
   Conclusions: The food environment is more strongly associated with
   diabetes prevalence for wealthier counties with a lower proportion of
   minority residents. This is important given efforts to increase food
   access in vulnerable communities. Availability of healthier food may not
   be enough to change health outcomes.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{Organisms react to environmental changes through plastic responses that
   often involve physiological alterations with the potential to modify
   life-history traits and fitness. Environmentally induced shifts in
   growth and development in species with complex life cycles determine the
   timing of transitions between subsequent life stages, as well as body
   condition at transformation, which greatly determine survival at later
   stages. Here we show that spadefoot toad larvae surviving pond drying
   and predators experienced marked alterations in growth and development,
   and in their fat reserves, oxidative stress, and relative telomere
   length. Tadpoles accelerated development but reduced growth and consumed
   more fat reserves when facing pond drying. However, oxidative stress was
   buffered by increased antioxidant enzyme activity, and telomeres
   remained unchanged. Predators caused opposite effects: they reduced
   larval density, hence relaxing competition and allowing faster
   development and enhanced growth of survivors. Tadpoles surviving
   predators metamorphosed bigger and had larger fat bodies, increasing
   their short-term survival odds, but showed signs of oxidative stress and
   had shorter telomeres. Developmental acceleration and enhanced growth
   thus seemed to have different physiological consequences: reduced fat
   bodies and body size compromise short-term survival, but are reversible
   in the long run, whereas telomere shortening is non-reversible and could
   reduce long-term survival.}},

Abstract = {{Vertical transmission of glucocorticoids via breast milk might pose a
   mechanism through which lactating women could prepare their infants for
   the postnatal environment. The primary source of breast milk
   glucocorticoids is probably the systemic circulation. Research from our
   group showed that milk cortisol and cortisone concentrations follow the
   diurnal rhythm of maternal hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity,
   with a higher abundance of cortisone compared to cortisol. Measurement
   of breast-milk glucocorticoid concentrations is challenging due to
   possible cross-reactivity with progestagens and sex steroids, which are
   severely elevated during pregnancy and after parturition. This requires
   precise methods that are not hindered by cross reactivity, such as
   LC-MS/MS. There are some data suggesting that breast-milk
   glucocorticoids could promote intestinal maturation, either locally or
   after absorption into the systemic circulation. Breast-milk
   glucocorticoids might also have an effect on the intestinal microbiome,
   although this has not been studied thus far. Findings from studies
   investigating the systemic effects of breast-milk glucocorticoids are
   difficult to interpret, since none took the diurnal rhythm of
   glucocorticoids in breast milk into consideration, and various
   analytical methods were used. Nevertheless, glucocorticoids in breast
   milk might offer a novel potential pathway for signal transmission from
   mothers to their infants. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sympatric predators are predicted to partition resources, especially
   under conditions of food limitation. Spatial heterogeneity that
   influences prey availability might play an important role in the scales
   at which potential competitors select habitat. We assessed potential
   mechanisms for coexistence by examining the role of heterogeneity in
   resource partitioning between sympatric raptors overwintering in the
   southern Great Plains. We conducted surveys for wintering Red-tailed
   hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) and Northern Harrier (Circus cyanea) at two
   state wildlife management areas in Oklahoma, USA. We used information
   from repeated distance sampling to project use locations in a GIS. We
   applied resource selection functions to model habitat selection at three
   scales and analyzed for niche partitioning using the outlying mean
   index. Habitat selection of the two predators was mediated by spatial
   heterogeneity. The two predators demonstrated significant fine-scale
   discrimination in habitat selection in homogeneous landscapes, but were
   more sympatric in heterogeneous landscapes. Red-tailed hawk used a
   variety of cover types in heterogeneous landscapes but specialized on
   riparian forest in homogeneous landscapes. Northern Harrier specialized
   on upland grasslands in homogeneous landscapes but selected more cover
   types in heterogeneous landscapes. Our study supports the growing body
   of evidence that landscapes can affect animal behaviors. In the system
   we studied, larger patches of primary land cover types were associated
   with greater allopatry in habitat selection between two potentially
   competing predators. Heterogeneity within the scale of raptor home
   ranges was associated with greater sympatry in use and less
   specialization in land cover types selected.}},

Abstract = {{The translation of the growing increase of findings emerging from basic

   ResultsMothers with higher executive function reported relying on fewer
   non-satiety cues at 2weeks of age (=-0.29, p=0.037) and on more infant
   hunger cues at 3months of age (=0.31, p=0.018) in their decisions on

Abstract = {{Growth in cattle may be related to animal temperament via alterations in
   intake or feed conversion. However, temperament is ill-defined, and
   different temperament measures may relate differently to production
   traits or interact with dietary factors in their effects. To examine
   relationships between diet, temperament, growth, and health, 160
   crossbred steers (262 +/- 22 kg) were used in a 56-d RCBD experiment
   with a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial treatment structure with 5 pens/treatment.
   Steers were pen fed a corn silage-based diet with or without monensin
   (41.9 g/t DM), ad libitum. Temperament treatments (assigned on d -7)
   were exit velocity (EV; slow vs. fast) and objective chute score (OCS;
   low vs. high), a novel temperament measure, representing the CV of
   weights collected at 5 measures/s for 10 s while an animal's head was
   restrained in a chute. Both were measured on d. 7, 0, 14, 28, 55, and
   56. Subjective chute scores (SCS; visual estimates of animal activity
   obtained simultaneously with OCS measures) were measured on d -7 and d
   56. Jugular blood samples from d 28 were analyzed for antibody response
   to leptospirosis vaccine and NEFA concentrations. No monensin x OCS x EV
   interactions were detected (P >= 0.11). There was a positive correlation
   between SCS and OCS (P < 0.01; r = 0.57). Changes in OCS and EV across
   the duration of the study differed among treatments (treatment x day, P
   < 0.10) and indicated that initial measures may be better proxies of
   growth than average measures. There were no interactions between EV and
   OCS (P >= 0.15) for any response variable and no interactions among
   treatments (P >= 0.31), nor main effects of temperament factors (P >=
   0.12) for DMI (\%BW). Monensin decreased DMI (P < 0.01) similarly across
   all levels of EV and OCS. Gains and G:F responses to monensin depended
   on OCS (P < 0.10) but not EV (P >= 0.80). Gain was reduced (P < 0.10) by
   monensin with low, but not high, OCS, and G: F was increased (P < 0.10)
   by monensin on high, but not low, OCS. Gain during the second 4 wk was
   lesser (P = 0.04) in fast, compared with slow, EV animals. Results
   provide novel indications that certain temperament measures can interact
   with dietary manipulation to influence animal performance.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock production to provide food for a growing world population,
   with increasing demand for meat and milk products, has led to a rapid

   consumers and the wider society are also increasingly concerned about
   the welfare, health and living conditions of farm animals. Awareness of
   animal needs underpins new production standards for animal health and

   barn environmental situation, food and water adequacy, health, welfare
   and production efficiency. Real-time scoring of cattle and pig
   behaviours is challenging, but the increasing availability and
   sophistication of technology makes automated monitoring of animal
   behaviour practicable. Machine vision techniques, as novel technologies,

   and time of flight cameras) along with 2D cameras for effectively
   identifying livestock behaviours, and presents automated approaches for
   monitoring and investigation of cattle and pig feeding, drinking, lying,
   locomotion, aggressive and reproductive behaviours. The performance of
   developed systems is reviewed in terms of sensitivity, specificity,
   accuracy, error rate and precision. These technologies can support the
   farmer by monitoring normal behaviours and early detection of abnormal

Abstract = {{The common bed bug (Cimex lectularius L.) (Hemiptera: Cimicidae) is an
   obligate blood-sucking insect that has been resurging in many countries.
   Researching this pest's behavior will help design more effective control
   methods. In this study, we evaluated the effect of feeding history and
   time elapsed from field collection on bed bug movement behavior and
   response to chemical lure or carbon dioxide stimulation in the
   laboratory. After CO2 was released, bed bugs unfed for 3 d began to
   return to harborages; in contrast, the ones unfed for 2 and 4 wk spent
   significantly more time outside their harborages during the first 1 h
   after than the 1 h before CO2 release. After CO2 release, there was an
   increase in activity (time spent moving outside harborage) in all bed
   bugs with different feeding history or time elapsed from field
   collection. During the 8-h observation period when CO2 was present, bed
   bug males unfed for 4 wk spent significantly more time exploring outside
   harborages than the ones unfed for 3 d, 1 wk, and 2 wk. Nymphs collected
   1-2 wk and 1 yr ago spent significantly more time exploring outside
   harborages than the ones collected 43 yr ago. Bed bug's exploratory
   activity (the total percentage of bed bugs trapped in both baited and
   unbaited interceptors) was significantly affected by their time elapsed
   from field collection and their exploratory activity level was 1-2 wk >
   6mo > 5 and 43 yr. Both feeding history and time elapsed from field
   collection significantly affected bed bug movement, whereas bed bug's
   response to chemical lure or CO2 (the percentage of bed bugs trapped in
   the baited interceptor, summarized as the number of bed bugs trapped in
   the baited interceptor divided by the total number of trapped bed bugs
   in both baited and unbaited interceptors) was unaffected by the time

Title = {{Individual versus collective decision making: optimal foraging in the

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{130}},
Pages = {{27-35}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Collective decision making is one of the main mechanisms of organization
   in social insects. However, individual decision making can also play an
   important role, depending on the type of foraging behaviour. In the
   termite-hunting ant species Megaponera analis information about foraging
   sites is collected by only a handful of individual scouts that have to
   convey this information to the colony as accurately as possible to
   optimize their foraging behaviour. We therefore looked at predictions
   made by optimal foraging theory to better understand the interplay
   between collective and individual decision making in this obligate
   group-raiding predator. We found a clear positive relation between raid
   size (200-500 ants) and termite abundance at the foraging site thereby
   confirming predictions of the maximization of energy theory.
   Furthermore, selectivity of the food source increased with distance,
   thus confirming central place prediction theory. The confirmation of
   these theories suggests that individual scouts must be the main driver
   behind raid size, choice and raiding behaviour. The marginal value
   theorem was also confirmed by our results: time spent at the hunting
   ground increased with distance and prey quantity. This raises questions
   on how foraging time at the food source is regulated in a group-hunting
   predator. Hunger decreased selectivity of scouts with respect to food
   sources, while average raid size increased and more scouts left the nest
   in search of prey, thus implying that scouts are aware of the hunger
   state of the colony and adapt their decision making accordingly.
   Remarkably, most central place foraging behaviours in M. analis were not
   achieved by collective decisions but rather by individual decisions of
   scout ants. Thus, 1\% of the colony (10-20 scouts) decided the fate and
   foraging efficiency of the remaining 99\%. (C) 2017 The Association for

Title = {{Hens vary their vocal repertoire and structure when anticipating
   different types of reward}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{130}},
Pages = {{79-96}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The vocalizations of nonhuman animals are considered potential
   indicators of motivational or internal state. In many species, different
   call types, and structural variation within call types, encode
   information about physical characteristics such as age or sex, or about
   variable traits such as motivation. Domestic chickens, Gallus gallus,
   have an elaborate vocal repertoire, enabling investigation into whether
   reward-related arousal is encoded within their call type and structure.
   Twelve hens were given a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm using sound
   cues to signal the availability of two food rewards (mealworms, normal
   food), one nonfood reward (a container of substrate suitable for
   dustbathing), and a sound-neutral event (sound cue, no reward). A
   muted-neutral treatment (no sound cue, no reward) provided a baseline
   for vocal behaviour. Sound cues preceded a 15 s anticipation period
   during which vocalizations were recorded. Hens produced a `Food call'
   (previously defined in other studies) in anticipation of all rewards,
   including the nonfood reward. `Food calls' and `Fast clucks' were more
   prevalent in anticipation of rewards, and most prevalent following the
   cue signalling the dustbathing substrate, suggesting that this reward
   induced the most arousal in hens. The peak frequency of `Food calls'
   made in anticipation of the dustbathing substrate was significantly
   lower than those made in anticipation of food rewards, potentially
   reflecting differences in arousal. Vocalizations that reliably indicate
   hens' motivational state could be used as measures of welfare in on-farm
   assessment situations. Our study is the first to reveal variation in the
   frequency-related parameters of the `Food call' in different contexts,
   and to show the prevalence of different call types in reward and
   nonreward contexts, which may have implications for welfare assessments.

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{1. Broad phylogenetic patterns in sexual size dimorphism (SSD) are
   shaped by sex differences in net selection pressures (e.g. sexual
   selection, fecundity selection, survival selection), but environmental
   and ecological factors can also affect the expression of SSD.
   2. Discussions of proximate ecological influences on SSD have focused on
   niche divergence; for example, increase in a prey type used by only one
   sex can elevate growth rates of that sex but not the other. Food
   limitation also can generate spatial and temporal variation in SSD.
   Under restricted prey abundance, curtailed growth may mask SSD even if
   the optimal size is greater for one sex than the other. Because an
   increase in food availability elicits increased feeding and growth by
   the sex that benefits more from increased body size, variation in prey
   abundance can generate variation in SSD.
   3. We used mark-recapture methods to study growth rates relative to prey
   (frog) abundance in two species of sexually dimorphic colubrid snake
   species in tropical Australia.
   4. In slatey-grey snakes (Stegonotus cucullatus), a species in which
   larger body size enhances reproductive output in both sexes (because
   larger males win combat bouts, and larger females produce more/heavier
   eggs), increased abundance of frogs caused equivalent increases in
   growth rates in both sexes and hence did not affect SSD. In keelbacks
   (Tropidonophis mairii), a species in which larger size enhances
   reproductive output in females more than males (reflecting a lack of
   male-male combat), increased abundance of frogs elicited higher growth
   rates of females only. Thus, SSD in keelbacks was modified by prey
   abundance.
   5. Our results show that the magnitude of sex differences in adult body
   size can be influenced by proximate environmental factors and support
   the hypothesis of sex-specific targets for maximum feeding rates.}},

Journal = {{BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Addressing impaired foetal growth is recognized as a public
   health priority. Certain risk factors for this condition, such as poor
   nutritional status at birth, have been found to be highly correlated
   with poverty. However, the role of psychosocial factors, specifically
   the mother's mental health and exposure to violence during pregnancy,
   have yet to be further explored. Our objective was to determine if there
   is a measurable association between combined psychosocial factors,
   specifically domestic violence and mental disorders, and birth outcomes,
   specifically birth nutritional status and preterm delivery.
   Methods: We followed 775 women from an underserved, urban area,
   beginning their 28th week of gestation. Diagnostic interviews were
   performed to determine if any of the mothers had any of the following
   disorders: mood disorder, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),
   substance dependence, psychotic disorder, or anti-social personality
   disorder. Physical, psychological, and sexual domestic violence were
   also assessed.
   Results: Domestic violence and mental disorders were highly correlated
   in our sample. About 27.15\% of the women in our study experienced
   domestic violence, and about 38.24\% of them were diagnosed with mental
   disorders. The main association we found between combined psychosocial
   factors and neonate outcomes was between anxiety (IRR = 1.83; 95\% CI =
   1.06-3.17)/physical violence (IRR = 1.95; 95\% CI = 1.11-3.42) and the
   rate of small-for-gestational age (SGA) in new-borns. More specifically,
   the combination of anxiety (beta = -0.48; 95\% CI = -0.85/-0.10) and
   sexual violence (beta = -1.58; 95\% CI = -2.61/-0.54) was also
   associated with birth length. Maternal risk behaviours such as smoking,
   drinking, inadequate prenatal care, and inadequate weight gain could not
   sufficiently explain these associations, suggesting that these
   psychosocial factors may be influencing underlying biological
   mechanisms.
   Conclusion: Domestic violence against women and mental disorders amongst
   pregnant women are extremely prevalent in under-resourced, urban areas
   and ultimately, have detrimental effects on birth outcomes. It is
   imperative that actions be taken to prevent violence and improve mental
   health during pregnancy.}},

Journal = {{PEERJ}},

Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{The decisions animals make to adjust their antipredator behavior to
   rapidly changing conditions have been well studied. Inducible defenses
   in plants are an antipredator behavior that acts on a longer time scale,
   but sensitive plants, Mimosa pudica, have a much more rapid antipredator
   response; they temporarily close their leaves when touched. The time
   they remain closed is defined as hiding time. We studied hiding time in
   sensitive plants and found that individual plants differed significantly
   in their hiding times. We then showed that the effect of individual
   explained substantial variation in hiding time on a short time scale.
   Finally, on a longer time scale, individuality persisted but the amount
   of variation attributed to individual decreased. We hypothesized that
   variation in plant condition might explain this change. We therefore
   manipulated sunlight availability and quantified hiding time. When
   deprived of light for 6 h, sensitive plants significantly shortened
   their hiding times. But when only half a plant was deprived of light,
   hiding times on the deprived half and light exposed half were not
   significantly different. This suggests that overall condition best
   explains variation in sensitive plant antipredator behavior. Just like
   in animals, sensitive plant antipredator behavior is condition
   dependent, and, just like in animals, a substantial amount of the
   remaining variation is explained by individual differences between
   plants. Thus, models designed to predict plasticity in animal behavior
   may be successfully applied to understand behavior in other organisms,
   including plants.}},

Abstract = {{According to life history theory, increased investment in reproductive

   Reproductive traits in both sexes evolved sensitivity to ecological
   conditions, as reflected in contemporary associations of hormone
   concentrations with geographical setting, nutritional status, and
   physical activity level. Lifetime exposure to increased concentrations
   of sex hormones is associated with the risk of some cancers, hence
   decreasing fertility patterns contribute to secular increases in their
   incidence. Conversely, increased investment in reproductive function
   might compromise somatic investment in health, such that faster sexual

   understand the pattern of reaction time, morphometric data were also

Abstract = {{Energy-dense, yet nutritionally poor food is a high-risk factor for
   mental health disorders. This is of particular concern during
   adolescence, a period often associated with increased consumption of low
   nutritional content food and higher prevalence of mental health
   disorders. Indeed, there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms
   linking unhealthy diet and mental disorders. Deficiency in n-3
   polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is a hallmark of poor nutrition and
   mood disorders. Here, we developed a mouse model of n-3 PUFA deficiency
   lasting from adolescence into adulthood. Starting nutritional deficits
   in dietary n-3 PUFAs during adolescence decreased n-3 PUFAs in both
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens, increased
   anxiety-like behavior, and decreased cognitive function in adulthood.
   Importantly, we discovered that endocannabinoid/mGlu(5)-mediated LTD in
   the mPFC and accumbens was abolished in adult n-3-deficient mice.
   Additionally, mPFC NMDAR-dependent LTP was also lacking in the
   n-3-deficient group. Pharmacological enhancement of the mGlu(5)/eCB
   signaling complex, by positive allosteric modulation of mGlu(5) or
   inhibition of endocannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol degradation, fully
   restored synaptic plasticity and normalized emotional and cognitive
   behaviors in malnourished adult mice. Our data support a model where
   nutrition is a key environmental factor influencing the working synaptic
   range into adulthood, long after the end of the perinatal period. These
   findings have important implications for the identification of
   nutritional risk factors for disease and design of new treatments for
   the behavioral deficits associated with nutritional n-3 PUFA deficiency.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JUL 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Foraging efficiency determines whether animals will be able
   to raise healthy broods, maintain their own condition, avoid predators
   and ultimately increase their fitness. Using accelerometers and GPS
   loggers, features of the habitat and the way animals deal with variable
   conditions can be translated into energetic costs of movement, which, in
   turn, can be translated to energy landscapes. We investigated energy
   landscapes in Gentoo Penguins Pygoscelis papua from two colonies at New
   Island, Falkland/Malvinas Islands.
   Results: In our study, the marine areas used by the penguins, parameters
   of dive depth and the proportion of pelagic and benthic dives varied
   both between years and colonies. As a consequence, the energy landscapes
   also varied between the years, and we discuss how this was related to
   differences in food availability, which were also reflected in
   differences in carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values and isotopic
   niche metrics. In the second year, the energy landscape was
   characterized by lower foraging costs per energy gain, and breeding
   success was also higher in this year. Additionally, an area around three
   South American Fur Seal Arctocephalus australis colonies was never used.
   Conclusions: These results confirm that energy landscapes vary in time
   and that the seabirds forage in areas of the energy landscapes that
   result in minimized energetic costs. Thus, our results support the view
   of energy landscapes and fear of predation as mechanisms underlying
   animal foraging behaviour. Furthermore, we show that energy landscapes
   are useful in linking energy gain and variable energy costs of foraging
   to breeding success.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the molecular basis of mosquito behavioural complexity
   plays a central role in designing novel molecular tools to fight against
   their vector-borne diseases. Although the olfactory system plays an
   important role in guiding and managing many behavioural responses
   including feeding and mating, but the sex specific regulation of
   olfactory responses remain poorly investigated. From our ongoing
   transcriptomic data annotation of olfactory tissue of blood fed adult
   female An. culicifacies mosquitoes; we have identified a 383 bp long
   unique transcript encoding a Drosophila homolog of the quick-to-court
   protein. Previously this was shown to regulate courtship behaviour in
   adult male Drosophila. A comprehensive in silico analysis of the
   quick-to-court (qtc) gene of An. culicifacies (Ac-qtc) predicts a 1536
   bp single copy gene encoding 511 amino acid protein, having a high
   degree of conservation with other insect homologs. The age-dependent
   increased expression of putative Ac-qtc correlated with the maturation
   of the olfactory system, necessary to meet the sex-specific conflicting
   demand of mating (mate finding) versus host seeking behavioural
   responses. Sixteen to eighteen hours of starvation did not alter Ac-qtc
   expression in both sexes, however, blood feeding significantly modulated
   its response in the adult female mosquitoes, confirming that it may not
   be involved in sugar feeding associated behavioural regulation. Finally,
   a dual behavioural and molecular assay indicated that natural
   dysregulation of Ac-qtc in the late evening might promote the mating
   events for successful insemination. We hypothesize that Ac-qtc may play
   a unique role to regulate the sex-specific conflicting demand of
   mosquito courtship behaviour versus blood feeding behaviour in the adult
   female mosquitoes. Further elucidation of this molecular mechanism may
   provide further information to evaluate Ac-qtc as a key molecular target
   for mosquito-borne disease management.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Eating disorders can be defined as behavioral syndromes
   characterized by major changes in feeding behavior and body image
   distortion of the affected individuals with anorexia nervosa and bulimia
   nervosa, the most frequent types. These syndromes occur in many
   populations where low weight is used to obtain good results, such as in
   ballet. Objective: To evaluate the nutritional status of dancers and its
   association with risk factors for eating disorders. Materials and
   Methods: Data were collected in a ballet school in the city of Porto
   Alegre (RS). We measured body weight, height, triceps skinfold,
   subscapular, pectoral, mid axillary, suprailiac, abdominal and thigh,
   and the questionnaire was applied Eating Attitudes Test (Eating
   Attitudes Test). Results: The sample consisted of five dancers, male
   aged between 18 and 24 years. The assessment of body mass index showed
   that 60\% of individuals are found in eutrophic. The average fat
   percentage was found to be 6.68\%, which is considered excellent.
   Regarding the behavior of risk for the development of eating disorder,
   one individual (20\%) was classified as positive. Conclusion: The
   results show a high prevalence of risk associated with feeding disorders
   in dancers, concluding that these are high risk for occurrence of TA.}},

Pages = {{161-170}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Proximate mechanisms underpinning between-individual variation in
   repeatedly expressed behaviours (animal personality) remain poorly
   understood. Recent theoretical models have focused on the concept of
   adaptive state-dependent behaviour, proposing that repeatable
   differences in behaviour emerge due to individual differences in
   repeatable state variables such as metabolic rate, age, sex or body
   size. Fewstudies have attempted to investigate the effect of state on
   personality empirically, and evidence for links between individual
   variation in state and personality remains equivocal. We used a captive
   colony of southern corroboree frogs, Pseudophryne corroboree, to (1)
   test for innate, temporally repeatable behavioural differences (animal
   personality) along the activity, exploration/avoidance and
   boldness/shyness behavioural axes, (2) test for behavioural syndromes
   (between-individual correlations between behavioural traits) and (3)
   determine whether behavioural traits are correlated with body size at
   the between-individual level. Individuals exhibited repeatable variation
   along all three behavioural axes, but between-individual correlations
   did not deviate from zero, providing no evidence for behavioural
   syndromes. Body size explained 40\% of the between-individual variance
   in exploration behaviour, with larger frogs exhibiting greater mobility
   and travelling further in a novel environment. These associations
   indicate that there is potential for innate body size variation in P.
   corroboree to act as an important state variable underpinning repeatable
   between-individual behavioural differences. Future research may test
   this idea experimentally. Continued investigation of state-dependent
   individual behaviour in P. corroboree and other animals is likely to
   provide important insights into the proximate causes of animal
   personality. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{How does repeated or chronic childhood adversity shape social and
   cognitive abilities? According to the prevailing deficit model, children
   from high-stress backgrounds are at risk for impairments in learning and
   behavior, and the intervention goal is to prevent, reduce, or repair the
   damage. Missing from this deficit approach is an attempt to leverage the
   unique strengths and abilities that develop in response to high-stress
   environments. Evolutionary-developmental models emphasize the coherent,
   functional changes that occur in response to stress over the life
   course. Research in birds, rodents, and humans suggests that
   developmental exposures to stress can improve forms of attention,
   perception, learning, memory, and problem solving that are ecologically
   relevant in harsh-unpredictable environments (as per the specialization
   hypothesis). Many of these skills and abilities, moreover, are primarily
   manifest in currently stressful contexts where they would provide the
   greatest fitness-relevant advantages (as per the sensitization
   hypothesis). This perspective supports an alternative adaptation-based
   approach to resilience that converges on a central question: ``What are
   the attention, learning, memory, problem-solving, and decision-making
   strategies that are enhanced through exposures to childhood
   adversity?{''} At an applied level, this approach focuses on how we can
   work with, rather than against, these strengths to promote success in
   education, employment, and civic life.}},

Abstract = {{1. Despite being globally widespread in coastal regions, the impacts of
   light pollution on intertidal ecosystems has received little attention.
   Intertidal species exhibit many night-time-dependent ecological
   strategies, including feeding, reproduction, orientation and predator
   avoidance, which are likely negatively affected by shifting light
   regimes, as has been observed in terrestrial and aquatic taxa.
   2. Coastal lighting may shape intertidal communities through its
   influence on the nocturnal foraging activity of dogwhelks (Nucella
   lapillus), a widespread predatory mollusc that structures biodiversity
   in temperate rocky shores. In the laboratory, we investigated whether
   the basal and foraging activity of this predator was affected by
   exposure to night-time lighting both in the presence and absence of
   olfactory predator cues (Carcinus maenas, common shore crab).
   3. Assessments of dogwhelks' behavioural responses to night-time white
   LED lighting were performed on individuals that had been acclimated to
   night-time white LED lighting conditions for 16 days and individuals
   that had not previously been exposed to artificial light at night.
   4. Dogwhelks acclimated to night-time lighting exhibited natural
   refuge-seeking behaviour less often compared to control animals, but
   were more likely to respond to and handle prey irrespective of whether
   olfactory predator cues were present. These responses suggest night-time
   lighting likely increased the energetic demand of dogwhelks through
   stress, encouraging foraging whenever food was available, regardless of
   potential danger. Contrastingly, whelks not acclimated under night-time
   lighting were more likely to respond to the presence of prey under
   artificial light at night when olfactory predator cues were present,
   indicating an opportunistic shift towards the use of visual instead of
   olfactory cues in risk evaluation.
   5. These results demonstrate that artificial night-time lighting
   influences the behaviour of intertidal fauna such that the balance of
   interspecific interactions involved in community structuring may be
   affected.}},

   manipulated the voles' perception of predation danger by adjusting the

   density, or in the quantity or quality of food. During the experiments,
   we measured indices of vole reproductive effort including activity
   (electronic detectors), foraging intensity (fecal plates), and the

Volume = {{211}},
Number = {{A}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{There is a general assumption that animal species that face
   anthropogenic disturbance through tourism suffer some negative impacts
   as a result. We carried out a meta-analysis of empirical studies of
   wildlife responses to tourism activities in natural areas to test this
   assumption. A literature review yielded effect size data for 102 studies
   representing 99 species. We compare and contrast different measures of
   response to tourist activities (avoidance responses, time budgets, and
   physiological responses). Despite most authors interpreting their data
   as revealing negative impacts of tourist activities on wildlife, we
   found that behavioural data (flight responses and time budgets) often
   indicated positive effects of such activities; time budget data are
   often ambiguous, while physiological data tended to show negative
   responses. Therefore, how researchers measure the responses of animals,
   how they interpret the valence of these responses, and the timescale of
   measure are all important considerations. For example, different
   measures of physiological response may indicate short term coping
   responses, while there may be long term physiological change that could
   influence population dynamics, often beyond the scope of the study. Many
   species are also able to mitigate the effect of tourist disturbance
   through habituation and moderation of short term responses, such as
   avoidance/fleeing responses. In conclusion, therefore, although there
   could be long term consequences to tourist activities, these impacts are
   often not readily measurable. Greater consideration of assessment
   methods to quantify such effects is warranted.}},

Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1829-1838}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Increased perceived predation risk can cause behavioral and
   physiological responses to reduce direct predation mortality, but these
   responses can also cause demographic costs through reduced reproductive
   output. Such indirect costs of predation risk have received increased
   attention in recent years, but the relative importance of direct vs.
   indirect predation costs to population growth (k) across species remains
   unclear. We measured direct nest predation rates as well as indirect
   benefits (i.e., reduced predation rates) and costs (i.e., decreased
   reproductive output) arising from parental responses to perceived
   offspring predation risk for 10 songbird species breeding along natural
   gradients in nest predation risk. We show that reductions in seasonal
   fecundity from behavioral responses to perceived predation risk
   represent significant demographic costs for six of the 10 species.
   However, demographic costs from these indirect predation effects on
   seasonal fecundity comprised only 12\% of cumulative predation costs
   averaged across species. In contrast, costs from direct predation
   mortality comprised 88\% of cumulative predation costs averaged across
   species. Demographic costs from direct offspring predation were
   relatively more important for species with higher within-season
   residual-reproductive value (i.e., multiple-brooded species) than for
   species with lower residual-reproductive value (i.e., single-brooded
   species). Costs from indirect predation effects were significant across
   single-but not multiple-brooded species. Ultimately, demographic costs
   from behavioral responses to offspring predation risk differed among
   species as a function of their life-history strategies. Yet direct
   predation mortality generally wielded a stronger influence than indirect
   effects on seasonal fecundity and projected lambda across species.}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1405-1417}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Escaping from a predator is a matter of life or death, and prey are
   expected to adaptively alter their physiology under chronic predation
   risk in ways that may affect escape. Theoretical models assume that
   escape performance is mass dependent, whereby scared prey strategically
   maintain an optimal body mass to enhance escape. Experiments testing the
   mass-dependent predation risk hypothesis have demonstrated that prior
   experience of predation risk can affect body mass, and the behavioural
   decisions about evasive actions to take. Other studies on natural
   changes in body mass indicate that mass can affect escape. No single
   experiment has tested if all of these components are indeed linked,
   which is a critical necessary condition underpinning the mass-dependent
   predation risk hypothesis.
   2. We tested all components of the mass-dependent predation risk
   hypothesis in a repeated measures experiment by presenting predator and
   non-predator cues to brown-headed cowbirds housed in semi-natural
   conditions. Exposure to predator cues affected body mass, fat, pectoral
   muscle thickness and evasive actions (take-off angle and speed), but not
   the physiological capacity to escape, as measured by flying ability.
   Examining individual variation revealed that flying ability was
   unrelated to mass loss in either sex, unrelated to mass gain in males,
   and only females that gained a very large amount of mass flew poorly.
   3. We next conducted a body mass manipulation in the laboratory to
   rigorously test whether small to large perturbations in mass can ever
   affect flying ability. We induced either no change in mass (control), a
   moderate reduction of <10\% or a more extreme reduction of >10\% which
   the literature suggests should enhance flight. Flying ability was
   maintained regardless of treatment. Examining individual variation
   revealed the same precise patterns as in the first experiment.
   4. We conclude that prey may alter their mass and evasive actions in
   response to predation risk, but their escape ability remains robust and
   inelastic, presumably because disabling oneself is likely to lead to
   disastrous consequences. We suggest that animals may only face a
   mass-dependent predation risk trade-off in a narrow set of circumstances
   linked to life-history stages that require large amounts of mass gain,
   for example, parturition and migration.}},

   articles that identify shared familial risk across disorders, integrate
   transdiagnostic and eating disorder-specific risk, and examine the
   impact of affective processing on restricting behavior. The importance
   of eating disorder-specific risk is reflected in an article on
   disorder-specific relations between hunger and taste. The importance of
   integrative risk models across levels of analysis is reflected in
   articles that investigate the heritable component of interactions
   between broad personality and disorder-specific risk factors, the
   momentary impact of personality traits on precipitants of binge-purge
   episodes, brain system function responses to environmental stressors,
   and cross-generational transmission of risk. The importance of further
   understanding the nature and scope of eating disorder pathology is

Abstract = {{Dietary specialization has been described across a wide range of taxa in

   dietary specializations in the herring gull Larus argentatus, an
   omnivorous seabird, using an extensive dataset which includes breeding
   and dietary data of 10 successive years. We hypothesized that pairs that
   focused on prey of higher energetic value would yield higher fledging
   rates. An alternative hypothesis is that pairs that relied on more
   resources simultaneously would reproduce better. The novelty of this
   study is that we used continuous measurements representing dietary
   composition and degree of specialization rather than restricting our
   analysis to predefined categories. By relating these two continuous
   measurements for diet to several proxies for reproductive success, we
   show clear consequences of dietary choice. Most pairs concentrated on
   bivalves, a prey type not particularly rich in energy. Pairs feeding on
   energy-rich prey (e.g., ``domestic refuse and fishery discards{''})
   during chick rearing were found to have a higher reproductive success,
   supporting the first hypothesis. Pairs that used more resources did not
   clearly have a higher reproductive success. The majority of the pairs
   did not switch to energy-rich prey during chick rearing, despite low

Abstract = {{Investigation of alternative phenotypes, different morphologies produced
   by a single genome, has contributed novel insights into development and
   evolution. Yet, the mechanisms underlying developmental switch points
   between alternative phenotypes remain poorly understood. The calyptraeid
   snails Crepidula navicella and Calyptraea lichen produce two phenotypes:
   viable and nutritive embryos, where nutritive embryos arrest their
   development after gastrulation and are ingested by their viable siblings
   as a form of intracapsular nutrition. Here, we investigate the activity
   of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK, ERK1/2) and apoptosis during
   early cleavage. MAPK and apoptosis, found in a previous transcriptomic
   study, are known to be involved in organization of other spiralian
   embryos and nutritive embryo development, respectively. In the model
   Crepidula fornicata, MAPK activation begins at the 16-cell stage. In
   contrast, we discovered in C.navicella and C. lichen that many embryos
   begin MAPK activation at the one-cell stage. A subset of embryos shows a
   similar pattern of MAPK activation to C. fornicata at later stages. In
   all stages where MAPK is detected, the activation pattern is highly
   variable, frequently occurring in all quadrants or in multiple tiers of
   cells. We also detected apoptosis in cleaving embryos, while C.
   fornicata and Crepidula lessoni, which do not produce nutritive embryos,
   show no signs of apoptosis during cleavage. Our results show that MAPK
   and apoptosis are expressed during early development in species with
   nutritive embryos, and raises the possibility that these processes may
   play a role and even interact with one another in producing the
   nutritive embryo phenotype. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Overconsumption of high-fat diets (HFDs) can critically affect synaptic
   and cognitive functions within telencephalic structures such as the
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The underlying mechanisms, however,
   remain largely unknown. Here we show that adolescence is a sensitive
   period for the emergence of prefrontal cognitive deficits in response to
   HFD. We establish that the synaptic modulator reelin (RELN) is a
   critical mediator of this vulnerability because (1) periadolescent HFD
   (pHFD) selectively downregulates prefrontal RELN+ cells and (2)
   augmenting mPFC RELN levels using transgenesis or prefrontal
   pharmacology prevents the pHFD-induced prefrontal cognitive deficits. We
   further identify N-methyl-D-aspartate-dependent long-term depression
   (NMDA-LTD) at prefrontal excitatory synapses as a synaptic signature of
   this association because pHFD abolishes NMDA-LTD, a function that is
   restored by RELN overexpression. We believe this study provides the
   first mechanistic insight into the vulnerability of the adolescent mPFC
   towards nutritional stress, such as HFDs. Our findings have primary
   relevance to obese individuals who are at an increased risk of
   developing neurological cognitive comorbidities, and may extend to
   multiple neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders in which RELN
   deficiency is a common feature.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: We evaluated risk-sensitive foraging in adult male western
   chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) occupying a savanna environment at
   Fongoli, Senegal. The aim of this study was to determine how the risks
   of predation and heat stress influenced their behavior while feeding on
   a key food, fruit of the baobab tree (Adansonia digitata).
   Materials and Methods: Proximity of fruiting baobab trees to
   anthropogenic landmarks were compared to food intake, feeding rate, and
   behavioral indicators of fear in adult males (N = 11) at Fongoli.
   Additionally, we compared foraging to vegetative habitats, baobab ripe
   fruit nutritive quality, surface water availability, and foraging party
   composition.
   Results: Fruit abundance increased with proximity to anthropogenic
   landmarks, and chimpanzees exhibited higher frequencies of antipredator
   behaviors as they approached these risky areas. However, predation risk
   did not deter adult males from visiting these fruiting trees; instead,
   risky foraging bouts were associated with higher food intakes and longer
   feeding times. Additionally, higher feeding rates were observed in
   open-canopy habitats, and this behavior may have minimized their risk of
   heat stress.
   Conclusions: Adaptations that minimize predation risk are widespread in
   mammalian prey species, but these traits are poorly understood in
   chimpanzees. Great apes encounter few nonhuman predators capable of
   successfully capturing and killing them; thus, such events are rarely
   observed. Although people rarely hunt chimpanzees in Senegal, we found
   that adult males perceived humans as predators and adjusted their
   behavior while foraging in risky habitats. From an applied perspective,
   risk-taking behavior is important for understanding and mitigating the
   problem of crop-feeding in locations where chimpanzees and humans live
   in sympatry.}},

Abstract = {{Elevated brain reward and attention region response, and weaker
   inhibitory region response to high calorie food images have been found
   to predict future weight gain. These findings suggest that an
   intervention that reduces reward and attention region response and
   increases inhibitory control region response to such foods might reduce
   overeating. We conducted a randomized pilot experiment that tested the
   hypothesis that a multi-faceted food response and attention training
   with personalized high and low-calorie food images would produce changes
   in behavioral and neural responses to food images and body fat compared
   to a control training with non-food images among community-recruited
   over-weight/obese adults. Compared to changes observed in controls,
   completing the intervention was associated with significant reductions
   in reward and attention region response to high-calorie food images
   (Mean Cohen's d = 1.54), behavioral evidence of learning, reductions in
   palatability ratings and monetary valuation of high-calorie foods (p =
   0.009, d's = 0.92), and greater body fat loss over a 4-week period (p =
   0.009, d = 0.90), though body fat effects were not significant by
   6-month follow-up. Results suggest that this multifaceted response and
   attention training intervention was associated with reduced reward and
   attention region responsivity to food cues, and a reduction in body fat.
   Because this implicit training treatment is both easy and inexpensive to
   deliver, and does not require top-down executive control that is
   necessary for negative energy balance obesity treatment, it may prove
   useful in treating obesity if future studies can determine how to create
   more enduring effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The physiological consequences of severe energy deficit
   include hypogonadism and the loss of fat free mass. Prolonged energy
   deficit also impacts physical performance, mood, attentiveness, and
   decision making capabilities. This study will determine whether
   maintaining a eugonadal state during severe, sustained energy deficit
   attenuates physiological decrements and maintains mental performance.
   This study will also assess the effects of normalizing testosterone
   levels during severe energy deficit and recovery on gut health and
   appetite regulation.
   Methods: Fifty physically active men will participate acclimation phase
   (protein: 1.6 g.kg(-1).d(-1); fat: 30\% total energy intake),
   participants will be randomized to undergo a 28-d, 55\% energy deficit
   phase with (DEF + TEST: 200 mg testosterone enanthate per week) or
   without (DEF) exogenous testosterone. Diet and physical activity will be
   rigorously controlled. Recovery from the energy deficit (ad libitum
   diet, no testosterone) will be assessed until body mass has been
   recovered within +/- 2.5\% of initial body mass. Body composition,
   stable isotope methodologies, proteomics, muscle biopsies, whole-room
   calorimetry, molecular biology, activity/sleep monitoring, personality
   and cognitive function assessments, functional MRI, and comprehensive
   biochemistries will be used to assess physiological and psychological
   responses to energy restriction and recovery feeding while volunteers
   are in an expected hypogonadal versus eugonadal state.
   Discussion: The Optimizing Performance for Soldiers (OPS) study aims to
   determine whether preventing hypogonadism will mitigate declines in
   physical and mental function that typically occur during prolonged
   energy deficit, and the efficacy of testosterone replacement on recovery

Abstract = {{A major issue in the addiction field is the limited number of animal
   models of the voluntary induction and maintenance of alcohol dependence
   in outbred rats.
   To address this issue, we developed a novel apparatus that vaporizes
   alcohol for 2-10 min after an active nosepoke response.
   Male Wistar rats were allowed to self-administer alcohol vapor for 8
   h/day every other day for 24 sessions (escalated) or eight sessions
   (non-escalated). Escalated and non-escalated rats were then tested for
   progressive ratio responding. Anxiety-like behavior, somatic signs of
   withdrawal, and hyperalgesia were assessed during acute withdrawal.
   The results showed that rats exhibited excellent discrimination between
   the active and inactive operanda (> 85\%), and the escalated rats
   quickly increased their blood alcohol levels from similar to 50 to > 200
   mg\% in similar to 6 weeks. Compared with non-escalated rats, escalated
   rats exhibited severe addiction-like behavior, including somatic signs
   of withdrawal, anxiety-like behavior, hyperalgesia, and higher
   responding on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement.
   These results demonstrate that outbred rats will voluntarily
   self-administer alcohol vapor to the point of dependence without the use
   of forced alcohol administration, sweeteners, food/water restriction,
   operant pretraining, or behavioral/genetic selection. This novel animal
   model may be particularly useful for medication development to help
   unveil the neuronal circuitry that underlies the voluntary induction of
   alcohol addiction and identify novel molecular targets that are
   specifically recruited after the voluntary induction and maintenance of
   alcohol dependence.}},

Abstract = {{Energetic status and body size are inconstant bodily states often
   considered to have feedback effects on behaviour. Feedbacks can be
   negative, like starvation-threshold feedbacks (lower state
   values=increased risk taking due to higher energy need, and vice versa),
   or positive, like state-dependent safety feedbacks (higher state
   values=lower vulnerability when expressing risky behaviours, and vice
   versa). Few studies have investigated feedback effects during the
   early-life survival bottleneck of territorial species, when rapid growth
   is particularly important to maintain competitive ability. We
   investigated effects of body size and energetic status on the emergence
   latency into an unknown environment in highly territorial brown trout
   fry. We manipulated energetic status using high and low food rations in
   different combinations over two consecutive periods. In contrast to
   results from other small-sized fishes, no general behavioural effects of
   energetic state were detected, but larger fish had on average shorter
   emergence latency. Starvation-threshold feedbacks were not supported,
   but the size effect favours the presence of a state-dependent safety
   feedback. When individuals were split into clusters characterised by
   long (>34s) and short (<34s) emergence latency, a state-dependent safety
   feedback, based on energetic status, was found in the short-latency
   cluster. Positive state-dependent feedbacks may reflect the high level
   of competition among wild trout fry during the first summer,
   particularly among the more active individuals (i.e., from the short
   latency cluster). High state levels could be utilised to gain advantages
   over lesser competitors (e.g., to establish territories), particularly
   if the overall risk of starvation is higher than the risk of predation.}},

Abstract = {{Nutritional conditions in early life can have a lasting impact on health
   and disease risk, though the underlying mechanisms are incompletely
   understood. In the healthy individual, physiological and behavioral
   responses to stress are coordinated in such a way as to mobilize
   resources necessary to respond to the stressor and to terminate the
   stress response at the appropriate time. Induction of proinflammatory
   gene expression within the brain is one such example that is initiated
   in response to both physiological and psychological stressors, and is
   the focus of the current study. We tested the hypothesis that early life
   nutrition would impact the proinflammatory transcriptional response to a
   stressor. Pregnant and lactating dams were fed one of three diets; a
   low-protein diet, a high fat diet, or the control diet through pregnancy
   and lactation. Adult male offspring were then challenged with either a
   physiological stressor (acute lipopolysaccharide injection, IP) or a
   psychological stressor (15 min restraint). Expression of 20
   proinflammatory and stress-related genes was evaluated in hypothalamus,
   prefrontal cortex, amygdala and ventral tegmental area. In a second
   cohort, behavioral responses (food intake, locomotor activity, metabolic
   rate) were evaluated. Offspring from low protein fed dams showed a
   generally reduced transcriptional response, particularly to LPS, and
   resistance to behavioral changes associated with restraint, while HF
   offspring showed an exacerbated transcriptional response within the PFC,
   a reduced transcriptional response in hypothalamus and amygdala, and an
   exacerbation of the LPS-induced reduction of locomotor activity. The
   present data identify differential proinflammatory transcriptional
   responses throughout the brain driven by perinatal diet as an important
   variable that may affect risk or resilience to stressors. (C) 2016

Title = {{Exploring influences on food choice in a large population sample: The

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Food choice is influenced by many interacting factors in humans. Its
   multidimensional and complex nature is well recognized, particularly
   within the sensory and consumer food science field. However, the vast
   majority of the studies aimed at understanding determinants of food
   choices, preferences, and eating behaviours are affected by important
   limitations: the limited number of factors that are considered at once
   and the sample size. Furthermore, sensory and hedonic responses to
   actual food stimuli are often not included in such studies.
   The Italian Taste project is a large-scale study (three thousand
   respondents in three years) launched by the Italian Sensory Science
   Society aimed at addressing these limitations by exploring the
   associations among a variety of measures biological, genetic,
   physiological, psychological and personality-related, socio-cultural
   describing the dimensions of food liking, preference, behaviour and
   choice, and their relevance in determining individual differences within
   a given food culture framework. In addition, the study includes also the
   collection of sensory and hedonic responses to actual food stimuli
   commonly consumed in Italy and prepared to elicit a variation in the
   strength (from weak to strong) of bitterness, sweetness, saltiness,
   sourness, pungency, umami and astringency.
   The aims of the present paper are twofold. Firstly, the paper is aimed
   to illustrate the variables selected to explore the different dimensions
   of food choice and to report the experimental procedure adopted for data
   collection. Secondly, the paper is aimed at showing the potential of the
   Italian Taste dataset on the basis of the data collected in the first
   year of the project. For the purpose, we selected a small number of
   variables known to influence food choices from data collected in the
   first year of the project on 1225 individuals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Sirtuins are pleiotropic NAD(+) dependent histone deacetylases involved
   in metabolism, DNA damage repair, inflammation and stress resistance.
   SIRT6, a member of the sirtuin family, regulates the process of normal
   aging and increases the lifespan of male mice over-expressing Sirt6 by
   15\%. Neurogenesis, the formation of new neurons within the hippocampus
   of adult mammals, involves several complex stages including stem cell
   proliferation, differentiation, migration and network integration.
   During aging, the number of newly generated neurons continuously
   declines, and this is correlated with a decline in neuronal plasticity
   and cognitive behavior. In this study we investigated the involvement of
   SIRT6 in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Mice over-expressing Sirt6
   exhibit increased numbers of young neurons and decreased numbers of
   mature neurons, without affecting glial differentiation. This implies of
   an involvement of SIRT6 in neuronal differentiation and maturation
   within the hippocampus. This work adds to the expanding body of
   knowledge on the regulatory mechanisms underlying adult hippocampal
   neurogenesis, and describes novel roles for SIRT6 as a regulator of cell

Title = {{Age- and environment-dependent changes in chemical defences of larval
   and post-metamorphic toads}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{JUN 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Chemical defences are widespread in animals, but how their
   production is adjusted to ecological conditions is poorly known. Optimal
   defence theory predicts that inducible defences are favoured over
   constitutive defences when toxin production is costly and the need for
   it varies across environments. However, if some environmental changes
   occur predictably (e.g. coupled to transitions during ontogeny), whereas
   others are unpredictable (e.g. predation, food availability), changes in
   defences may have constitutive as well as plastic elements. To
   investigate this phenomenon, we raised common toad (Bufo bufo) tadpoles
   with ad libitum or limited food and in the presence or absence of
   chemical cues on predation risk, and measured their toxin content on 5
   occasions during early ontogeny.
   Results: The number of compounds showed limited variation with age in
   tadpoles and was unaffected by food limitation and predator cues. The
   total amount of bufadienolides first increased and later decreased
   during development, and it was elevated in young and mid-aged tadpoles
   with limited food availability compared to their ad libitum fed
   conspecifics, whereas it did not change in response to cues on predation
   risk. We provide the first evidence for the active synthesis of
   defensive toxin compounds this early during ontogeny in amphibians.
   Furthermore, the observation of increased quantities of bufadienolides
   in food-restricted tadpoles is the first experimental demonstration of
   resource-dependent induction of elevated de novo toxin production,
   suggesting a role for bufadienolides in allelopathy.
   Conclusions: Our study shows that the evolution of phenotypic plasticity
   in chemical defences may depend on the ecological context (i.e.
   predation vs. competition). Our results furthermore suggest that the
   age-dependent changes in the diversity of toxin compounds in developing
   toads may be fixed (i.e., constitutive), timed for the developmental
   stages in which they are most reliant on their chemical arsenal, whereas
   inducible plasticity may prevail in the amount of synthesized compounds.}},

Title = {{Alternative foraging strategies enable a mountain ungulate to persist
   after migration loss}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The persistence of many migratory ungulate populations worldwide is
   threatened due to anthropogenic impacts to seasonal ranges and migration
   routes. While many studies have linked migratory ungulate declines to
   migration disruption or loss, very few have explored the underlying
   factors that determine whether a population perishes or persists. In
   some cases, populations undergo severe declines and extirpation after
   migration loss; however, others appear able to persist as residents. We
   predict that to persist, populations must replace the traditional
   benefits of migration by altering the foraging strategies they employ as
   residents within one seasonal range. We propose the alternative foraging
   strategies (AFS) hypothesis as a framework for identifying various
   behavioral strategies that populations may use to cope with migration
   loss. We tested the hypothesis using the formerly migratory Teton
   bighorn sheep population in northwest Wyoming, which ceased migrating
   over 60 yr ago, but has persisted as a resident population. We used
   global positioning system data to evaluate winter and summer habitat
   selection and seasonal elevational movements for 28 adult female bighorn
   sheep (Ovis canadensis) from 2008 to 2010. Resource selection functions
   revealed that bighorn sheep employ winter foraging strategies to survive
   as residents by seeking out rugged, high-elevation, windswept
   ridgelines. Seasonal movement analyses indicated that bighorn sheep
   undergo a newly documented ``abbreviated migration{''} strategy that is
   closely synchronized with vegetation green-up patterns within their one
   range. Bighorn sheep descend 500 m in elevation and travel up to 10 km
   in spring, gaining access to newly emergent forage approximately 30 d
   before it appears on their high-elevation winter and summer ranges. Our
   findings indicate that the Teton bighorn sheep population has persisted
   due to its habitat selection, AFS, and unique movement patterns, which
   allow migration loss to be mediated to some extent. The identification
   of AFS and the habitats that support them can help reveal the underlying
   benefits of migration and conserve populations in the face of future
   migration loss.}},

Abstract = {{Developmental plasticity is a key feature of many organisms and
   individuals can benefit from early programming to optimize their
   phenotypes for the expected environmental conditions. However,
   environmental conditions may sometimes change unexpectedly. Mismatches
   between early and adult life, for example, can have important
   repercussions for adult phenotypes, potentially leading to better
   performance under matched than mismatched conditions as predicted by the
   predictive adaptive response hypothesis. We conducted a long-term
   experimental manipulation of dietary conditions in a population of zebra
   finches, Taeniopygia guttata. Broods were exposed to two early
   nutritional treatments until independence and we used a split-brood
   design to independently manipulate nutritional conditions after
   independence to create matched and mismatched nutritional environments
   in later life. Developmental trajectories of all individuals were
   followed for more than 5 years and we scored behavioural responses in
   trials in a special environment and while interacting with a special
   object three times during adult life. Overall, we found no evidence for
   early programming affecting morphology. Tarsus and wing length were
   exclusively influenced by the early nutrition. Body weight showed
   lasting effects of the early treatment and independent effects of
   nutritional condition during adulthood, but no effects of environmental
   matching or mismatching. Special-object trials showed effects of the
   adult nutritional treatment while environmental matching affected
   hopping activity in special environments. These behavioural responses
   showed substantial long-term individual stability over a 3-month period
   and were only marginally smaller when measured over a period of more
   than 4 years. Interestingly, survival of individuals from low-quality
   early nutritional condition was higher compared with highquality early
   condition individuals, which became evident only after years of survival
   monitoring. Beyond the nutritional treatment itself, we found sizable
   brood identity effects that slowly but steadily declined with age,
   indicating a significant but decaying effect of natural variation in
   parental provisioning on adult phenotypes. (C) 2017 The Association for

Abstract = {{A fundamental question in life-history evolution is how organisms cope
   with fluctuating environments, including variation between stressful and
   benign conditions. For short-lived organisms, environments commonly vary
   between generations. Using a novel experimental design, we exposed
   wild-derived Drosophila melanogaster to three different selection
   regimes: one where generations alternated between starvation and benign
   conditions, and starvation was always preceded by early exposure to
   cold; another where starvation and benign conditions alternated in the
   same way, but cold shock sometimes preceded starvation and sometimes
   benign conditions; and a third where conditions were always benign.
   Using six replicate populations per selection regime, we found that
   selected flies increased their starvation resistance, most strongly for
   the regime where cold and starvation were reliably combined, and this
   occurred without decreased fecundity or extended developmental time. The
   selected flies became stress resistant, displayed a pronounced increase
   in early life food intake and resource storage. In contrast to previous
   experiments selecting for increased starvation resistance in D.
   melanogaster, we did not find increased storage of lipids as the main
   response, but instead that, in particular for females, storage of
   carbohydrates was more pronounced. We argue that faster mobilization of
   carbohydrates is advantageous in fluctuating environments and conclude
   that the phenotype that evolved in our experiment corresponds to a
   compromise between the requirements of stressful and benign
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Unhealthy behaviors, including smoking, poor nutrition, excessive
   alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and sedentary lifestyles, are
   global risk factors for non-communicable diseases and premature death.
   Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a unique approach to
   optimize health messages by examining how the brain responds to
   information relating to health. Our aim was to systematically review
   fMRI studies that have investigated variations in brain activation in
   response to health messages relating to (i) smoking; (ii) alcohol
   consumption; (iii) physical activity; (iv) diet; and (v) sedentary
   behavior. The electronic databases used were Medline/PubMed, Web of
   Science (Core Collection), PsychINFO, SPORTDiscuss, Cochrane Library and
   Open Grey. Studies were included if they investigated subjects aged >=
   10 years and were published before January 2017. Of the 13,836 studies
   identified in the database search, 18 studies (smoking k = 15; diet k =
   2; physical activity/sedentary behavior k = 1) were included in the
   review. The prefrontal cortex was activated in seven (47\%) of the
   smoking-related studies and the physical activity study. Results suggest
   that activation of the ventromedial, dorsolateral and medial prefrontal
   cortex regions were predictive of subsequent behavior change following
   exposure to aversive anti-smoking stimuli. Studies investigating the
   neurological responses to anti-smoking material were most abundant. Of
   note, the prefrontal cortex and amygdala were most commonly activated in
   response to health messages across lifestyle behaviors. The review
   highlights an important disparity between research focusing on different
   lifestyle behaviors. Insights from smoking literature suggest fMRI may
   help to optimize health messaging in relation to other lifestyle
   behaviors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To understand geographic body size variation in an insect species,
   various factors including habitat temperature, correlation between life
   history traits, and food availability must be examined. Carabus
   (Ohomopterus) japonicus is univoltine, feeds exclusively on earthworms
   during its larval stage, and shows a clinal body size variation along
   the habitat temperature gradient in northern Kyushu, Japan. Carabus
   japonicus occurs at both high and low altitudes; at high altitudes it
   coexists with a larger species, C. (O.) dehaanii. At low altitudes, C.
   japonicus shows larger body sizes. We sought to determine whether this
   increase in body size is only an adaptation to high habitat temperatures
   in the absence of C. dehaanii, and examined the life history of C.
   japonicus and seasonal trends in prey earthworms at six sites between
   altitudes of 30 and 980 m. While high-altitude populations used the
   entire warm season for reproduction and larval development, low-altitude
   populations showed shorter periods of reproductive activity and larval
   incidence coincided with seasonal trends in earthworm abundance. Thus,
   C. japonicus attained larger body sizes at lower altitudes without a
   notable extension of their juvenile period. At lower altitudes,
   earthworms grew faster and reached sizes, which may be too large for
   predation by small carabid larvae. Large females had higher fecundity,
   and laid larger eggs, from which larger first instar larvae hatch. The
   large body size of C. japonicus in warm habitats may thus be an
   adaptation not only for high fecundity, but also for producing large
   first instar larvae to more efficiently prey on large earthworms.}},

Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{863-873}},

Abstract = {{Food availability and predation risk can have drastic impacts on animal
   behaviour and populations. The tradeoff between foraging and predator
   avoidance is crucial for animal survival and will strongly affect
   individual body mass, since large fat reserves are beneficial to reduce
   starvation but may increase predation risk. However, two-factor
   experiments simultaneously investigating the interactive effects of food
   and predation risk, are still rare. We studied the effects of food
   supplementation and natural predation risk imposed by pygmy owls
   Glaucidium passerinum on the abundance and fat reserves of tit species
   in boreal forests of north Europe, from January to March in 2012 and in
   2013. Food supplementation increased the number of individuals present
   in a given forest patch, whereas the level of predation risk had no
   clear impact on the abundance of tit species. The stronger impact of
   food supply respect to predation risk could be the consequence of the
   harsh winter conditions in north Europe, with constant below-zero
   temperatures and only few (5-7 h) daylight hours available for foraging.
   Predation risk did not have obvious effects on tit abundance but
   influenced food consumption and, together with food supplementation,
   affected the deposition of subcutaneous fat in great tits Parus major.
   High owl predation risk had detrimental effects on body fat reserves,
   which may reduce over-winter survival, but the costs imposed by pygmy
   owl risk were compensated when food was supplemented. The
   starvation-predation tradeoff faced by great tits in winter may thus be
   mediated through variation in body fat reserves. In small species living
   in harsh environment, this tradeoff appeared thus to be biased towards
   avoidance of starvation, at the cost of increasing predation risk.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Although it has been frequently suggested that resource partitioning of
   species coexisting at the same trophic level can be mediated by
   interactions with species at non-adjacent trophic levels, empirical
   evidence supporting this claim is scarce. Here we demonstrate that
   plants may mediate resource partitioning for two parasitoids that share
   the same herbivorous host. The tephritid fly Tephritis femoralis is the
   primary pre-dispersal seed predator of two Asteraceae species, Saussurea
   nigrescens and Anaphalis flavescens, both of which dominate the plant
   community in the alpine meadows of the Tibetan Plateau. Field surveys
   and molecular barcoding analyses showed that the identity of the fly's
   main predator depended on the plant in which the fly developed.
   Tephritid flies that developed in S. nigrescens were preyed upon mainly
   by the parasitoid wasp Pteromalus albipennis, while the parasitoid
   Mesopolobus sp. was the main predator of flies that developed in A.
   flavescens. Microcosm experiments revealed that P. albipennis could not
   exploit the host flies within the capitula of A. flavescens due to food
   limitation (capitula are too small), while Mesopolobus sp. could not
   exploit the host flies within the capitula of S. nigrescens due to its
   inability to reach the host with its ovipositor (capitula are too
   large). Such bottom-up control of plant species traits may facilitate
   the coexistence of parasitoid wasps sharing a common host in this
   system. We suggest that interactions between non-adjacent trophic levels
   may potentially promote species coexistence and diversity in biological
   communities.}},

Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{227-239}},

Abstract = {{Predation is a significant cause of nest failure in passerine birds,
   and, thus, natural selection is expected to favor behavioral plasticity
   to allow birds to respond to perceived changes in predation risk.
   However, behavioral plasticity in response to perceived predation risk,
   and its potential fitness-related costs, are understudied. In a wild
   population of breeding house wrens (Troglodytes aedon), we tested the
   hypotheses that (1) birds show behavioral plasticity in response to
   perceived nest-predation risk to reduce self-risk or risk to offspring,
   but (2) this plasticity incurs fitness-related costs. We experimentally
   increased the perceived risk of nest predation by enlarging the diameter
   of the nestbox entrance from the standard 3.2 to 5.0 cm once incubation
   began. Unexpectedly, large-hole females spent significantly less time
   being vigilant than small-hole (control) females during late incubation.
   Both males and females also exhibited plasticity in their provisioning
   behavior. Large-hole males increased and large-hole females decreased
   provisioning visits with increasing brood size, whereas small-hole males
   and females behaved similarly and were unaffected by brood size. Females
   did not show plasticity in their incubation or brooding behavior.
   Notwithstanding this behavioral plasticity in response to increased
   perceived predation risk, treatment had no effect on hatching success or
   early hatchling survival, nor did it affect nestling body condition or
   fledging success. We conclude, therefore, that house wrens show
   behavioral plasticity in response to perceived nest-predation risk, but
   that any short-term fitness-related costs associated with this
   flexibility appear negligible.}},

Abstract = {{1. Human-induced rapid environmental change may decrease food resources
   and create unfavourable conditions for native species. Organisms showing
   a flexible foraging behaviour can exploit novel or alternative foods and
   are more likely to persist, whereas less flexible organisms might suffer
   starvation and numerical reductions. 2. This study assessed whether
   declines in the quality and availability of seeds prompted by grazing
   provoke behavioural and numerical responses in Pogonomyrmex mendozanus
   ants, and aimed to test whether behavioural flexibility buffers habitat
   degradation and prevents numerical declines. 3. Heavy grazing caused
   seed reductions, especially of the highly consumed and preferred grass
   seeds, and triggered two kinds of ant responses. Ants expanded their
   diet by incorporating a greater proportion of non-seed items, and they
   reduced foraging activity. As a consequence, the rate of food intake per
   colony lessened, particularly that of carbohydrate-rich seeds like grass
   seeds. Colony density under heavy grazing also fell. 4. Habitat
   degradation triggered a cascade of mechanisms that starts with a
   decrease in the seed resources and continues with changes in ant
   behaviour. However, behavioural responses were insufficient to prevent
   ant numerical declines. The results of this study suggest that the
   reduction in the colony density under habitat degradation was provoked
   by ant nutritional deficit and starvation, and predict a deterioration
   in body condition, colony performance and reproduction of ants, which
   deserve further assessment.}},

Abstract = {{1. The food plant quality influences feeding preferences and various
   life history traits of herbivorous insects. However, the effects of
   different host plant qualities on the behavioural phenotype have rarely
   been studied in behavioural ecology, especially in a
   pest-crop-framework. 2. Behavioural phenotypes of insects may not only
   be affected by external environmental factors, such as the host plant
   quality but are also shaped by internal factors, such as the sex and the
   age of individuals. 3. To study host plant effects on behavioural
   phenotypes, we reared mustard leaf beetles (Phaedon
   cochleariaeFabricius) either on their natural host watercress or on the
   crop cabbage, on which this beetle can be a pest. The behavioural
   phenotype was characterised twice in the adult lifetime by measuring six
   behavioural traits tested in distinct contexts. 4. Depending on the
   context, different behavioural traits were specifically affected by the
   host plant, the sex and/or the age. Beetles fed on cabbage became more
   active with age. Furthermore, the boldness tested in an unprotected
   environment context was influenced by the host, with beetles fed on
   cabbage being bolder, whereas the boldness in a hiding or predator
   attack context was affected by the age and/or the interaction of host
   plant x sex. 5. In conclusion, beetles fed on the crop cabbage develop a
   different behavioural phenotype compared to beetles fed on watercress.
   Previous results showed that beetles reared on cabbage have a higher
   reproductive output. Thus, beetles fed on the crop potentially express a

Title = {{Clustering and correlates of screen-time and eating behaviours among
   young adolescents}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{MAY 31}},
Abstract = {{Background: Screen-time and eating behaviours are associated in
   adolescents, but few studies have examined the clustering of these
   health behaviours in this age group. The identification of clustered
   health behaviours, and influences on adolescents' clustered health
   behaviours, at the time when they are most likely to become habitual, is
   important for intervention design. The purpose of this study was to
   assess the prevalence and clustering of health behaviours in
   adolescents, and examine the sociodemographic, individual, behavioural,
   and home social and physical environmental correlates of clustered
   health behaviours.
   Methods: Adolescents aged 11-12 years (n = 527, 48\% boys) completed a
   questionnaire during class-time which assessed screen-time (ST), fruit
   and vegetable (FV), and energy-dense (ED) snack consumption using a Food
   Frequency Questionnaire. Health behaviours were categorised into high
   and low frequencies based on recommendations for FV and ST and median
   splits for ED snacks. Adolescents reported on their habits,
   self-efficacy, eating at the television (TV), eating and watching TV
   together with parents, restrictive parenting practices, and the
   availability and accessibility of foods within the home. Behavioural
   clustering was assessed using an observed over expected ratio (O/E).
   Correlates of clustered behaviours were examined using multivariate
   multinomial logistic regression.
   Results: Approximately 70\% reported having two or three health risk
   behaviours. Overall, O/E ratios were close to 1, which indicates
   clustering. The three risk behaviour combination of low FV, high ED, and
   high ST occurred more frequently than expected (O/E ratio = 1.06 95\% CI
   1.01, 1.15. Individual, behavioural, and social and physical home
   environmental correlates were differentially associated with behavioural
   clusters. Correlates consistently associated with clusters included
   eating ED snacks while watching TV, eating at the TV with parents, and
   the availability and accessibility of ED snack foods within the home.
   Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of screen time and unhealthy
   eating, and screen time is coupled with unhealthy dietary behaviours.
   Strategies and policies are required that simultaneously address
   reductions in screen time and changes to habitual dietary patterns, such
   as TV snacking and snack availability and accessibility. These may
   require a combination of individual, social and environmental changes
   alongside conscious and more automatic (nudging) strategies.}},

Abstract = {{R{*}{*}esults from animal gambling models have highlighted the
   importance of dopaminergic neurotransmission in modulating decision
   making when large sucrose rewards are combined with uncertainty. The
   majority of these models use food restriction as a tool to motivate
   animals to accomplish operant behavioral tasks, in which sucrose is used
   as a reward. As enhanced motivation to obtain sucrose due to hunger may
   impact its reward-seeking effect, we wanted to examine the
   decision-making behavior of rats in a situation where rats were fed ad
   libitum. For this purpose, we chose alcohol-preferring AA (alko alcohol)
   rats, as these rats have been shown to have high preference for sweet
   agents. In the present study, AA rats were trained to self-administer
   sucrose pellet rewards in a two-lever choice task (one pellet vs. three
   pellets). Once rational choice behavior had been established, the
   probability of gaining three pellets was decreased over time (50\%,
   33\%, 25\% then 20\%). The effect of D-amphetamine on decision making
   was studied at every probability level, as well as the effect of the
   dopamine D-1 receptor agonist SKF-81297 and D-2 agonist quinpirole at
   probability levels of 100\% and 25\%. D-Amphetamine increased
   unprofitable choices in a dose-dependent manner at the two lowest
   probability levels. Quinpirole increased the frequency of unprofitable
   decisions at the 25\% probability level, and SKF-82197 did not affect
   choice behavior. These results mirror the findings of probabilistic
   discounting studies using food-restricted rats. Based on this, the use
   of AA rats provides a new approach for studies on reward-guided decision
   making. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term studies on rodents have been conducted for longer periods (up
   to 70 years) and more generations (up to 88 generations) than for most
   other mammalian taxa. These studies have been instrumental in furthering
   our understanding of ecophysiology, social systems, and population and
   community processes. Studies on African striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio)
   revealed that basal blood glucose levels span a far greater homeostatic
   range than previously thought. Studies on American red squirrels
   (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) demonstrated how endocrine pathways underlying
   phenotypic plasticity allow individuals to respond to different
   environments. Long-term studies on African striped mice, marmots
   (Marmota), tuco-tucos (Ctenomys sociabilis), and degus (Octodon degus)
   revealed that ecological constraints on dispersal are drivers of group
   formation in some species but not others. Social flexibility, when the
   social system of an entire population can change due to individuals
   changing their social tactics, has been demonstrated in striped mice.
   Long-term studies on prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) found that
   males and females often live in pairs, leading to subsequent studies of
   the neural mechanisms underlying social monogamy. Long-term studies on
   other arvicoline rodents contributed more to our understanding of the
   factors influencing population dynamics than studies on any other
   mammalian order. While food availability and predation have been
   identified as factors influencing population dynamics, no single factor
   alone drives population dynamics in any species. We encourage
   researchers to incorporate manipulative experiments into long-term
   studies and to take integrative approaches to inform cross-disciplinary
   theory.}},

Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{Hunger and thirst are fundamental biological processes that drive
   consumption behavior in humans and non-human animals. While the existing
   literature in neuroscience suggests that these satiety states change how
   consumable rewards are represented in the brain, it remains unclear as
   to how they change animal choice behavior and the underlying economic
   preferences. Here, I used combined techniques from experimental
   economics, psychology, and neuroscience to measure food preferences of
   marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus), a recently developed primate
   model for neuroscience. Hunger states of animals were manipulated by
   scheduling feeding intervals, resulting in three different conditions:
   sated, non-sated, and hungry. During these hunger states, animals
   performed pairwise choices of food items, which included all possible
   pairwise combinations of five different food items except for same-food
   pairs. Results showed that hunger enhanced economic rationality, evident
   as a decrease of transitivity violations (item A was preferred to item
   B, and B to C, but C was preferred to A). Further analysis demonstrated
   that hungry monkeys chose more-preferred items over less-preferred items
   in a more deterministic manner, while the individual food preferences
   appeared to remain stable across hunger states. These results suggest
   that hunger enhances consistent choice behavior and shifts animals
   towards efficient outcome maximization.}},

Title = {{Exploring parent-reported barriers to supporting their child's health
   behaviors: a cross-sectional study}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Parents can influence the health behaviors of their children
   by engaging in supportive behaviors (e.g., playing outside with their
   child, limiting recreational screen time). How, and the extent to which
   parents engage in supportive behaviors may be influenced by perceived
   barriers. The purpose of this study is to explore whether the frequency,
   and types, of barriers to providing parental support are dependent on
   the type of child health behavior being supported (i.e., physical
   activity, recreational screen time reduction, healthy eating, and
   sleep).
   Methods: Study participants were 1140 Ontario parents with at least one
   child under the age of 18 who completed a Computer Assisted Telephone
   Interview (CATI) survey about parental support behaviors. Open-ended
   responses about perceived barriers to parental support were coded, and
   aggregated to meta-categories adopted from the social-ecological model
   (i.e., individual child, individual parent, interpersonal,
   environmental). Freidman rank sum tests were used to assess differences
   across child behaviors. Wilcoxon rank sum tests with Bonferroni
   adjustments were used as a post hoc test for significant Freidman
   results.
   Results: There were more barriers reported for supporting physical
   activity than for any other child behavior (ps < .01, As >= .53).
   Parents reported more parent level and environmental level barriers to
   supporting child physical activity versus other behaviors (ps < .001, As
   >= .55), child level barriers were more frequently reported for
   supporting healthy eating and sleep (ps < .001, As >= .57), and
   interpersonal barriers were more frequently reported for supporting
   recreational screen time reduction (ps < .001, As >= .52). Overall,
   parents reported more child and parent level barriers versus
   interpersonal and environmental barriers to supporting child health.
   Conclusions: Parents experience a variety of barriers to supporting
   their children's health behaviors. Differences in types of barriers
   across child health behaviors emerged; however, some frequently reported
   barriers (e.g., child preferences) were common across behaviors.
   Interventions promoting parental support should consider strategies that
   can accommodate parents' busy schedules, and relate to activities that
   children find enjoyable. Creating supportive environments that help
   facilitate support behaviors, while minimizing parent level barriers,
   may be of particular benefit. Future research should explore the impact
   of barriers on parental support behaviors, and effective strategies for
   overcoming common barriers.}},

Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},

Abstract = {{It has often been proposed that bolder, more explorative or more active
   individuals also have a higher resting metabolic rate (RMR), indicating
   metabolic costs of these personality types. However, such individuals
   might often be restless and thus excluded from RMR datasets, leading to
   a significant sampling bias. We tested (1) whether such a bias occurs
   when animals are measured for a relatively common but short time period
   of 3 h, and if so, (2) whether alternative measures of metabolic rate,
   that allow the incorporation of non-resting individuals, would reveal
   associations between metabolism and personality. For this, we studied
   free-living individuals of the African striped mouse (Rhabdottlys
   pumilio) both during the moist season (N = 25 individuals) with high
   food availability and the dry season (N = 48 individuals) with low food
   availability. We assessed variation in the latency to explore a novel
   object, and the time spent active and time spent in the centre of a
   neutral arena. We examined links between personality and (i) RMR and
   (ii) four alternative metabolic rate (MR) metrics: average MR, highest
   MR, lowest MR and span of MR. Twenty-nine percent of the measured
   individuals had to be excluded from our RMR study because they remained
   restless during respirometry trials. Striped mice showed a behavioural
   syndrome where fast explorers also spent more time in centre and more
   time active than slow explorers. Individuals that did not rest during
   respirometry trials were faster explorers and in the moist season, they
   were also more active and spent more time in the centre than individuals
   that rested. We found no relationship between RMR and the behavioural
   syndrome, which might be due to the exclusion of individuals with a
   certain behavioural type, leaving a subset of compliant individuals. In
   the moist season, we found positive relationships between the
   behavioural syndrome and span of MR and lowest MR. In the dry season,
   low food availability may mask links between the behavioural syndrome
   and alternative MR measures due to reduced overall activity in striped
   mice. Our study demonstrated the importance to consider personality when
   measuring RMR and suggests that some alternative MRs may be useful to
   examine relationships between metabolism and personality when it is
   impossible to measure individuals over extended time periods. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a cluster of signs that increases the risk to
   develop diabetes mellitus type 2 and cardiovascular disease. In the last
   years, a growing interest to study the relationship between MS and

   obtaining conflicting results. Diet-induced MS rat models have only
   examined the effects of high-fat or mixed cafeteria diets to a limited
   extent. We explored whether an anxiety-like behavior was associated with
   MS in non-stressed rats chronically submitted to a high-sucrose diet
   (20\% sucrose in drinking water) using three different anxiety
   paradigms: the shock-probe/burying test (SPBT), the elevated plus-maze
   (EPM) and the open-field test (OFT). Behaviorally, the high-sucrose diet
   group showed an increase in burying behavior in the SPBT. Also, these
   animals displayed both avoidance to explore the central part of the
   arena and a significant increase in freezing behavior in the OFT and
   lack of effects in the EPM. Also, high-sucrose diet group showed signs
   of an MS-like condition: significant increases in body weight and body
   mass index, abdominal obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia,
   hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia. Plasma leptin and resistin levels
   were also increased. No changes in plasma corticosterone levels were
   found. These results indicate that rats under a 24-weeks high-sucrose

   the mechanisms underlying this behavioral outcome remain to be
   investigated, the role of leptin is emphasized.}},

Journal = {{BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A selection for behavioural traits has been practised since man tamed
   the aurochs. Compared with other areas of breeding (evaluation and
   selection with regard to milk yield traits, conformation traits etc.),
   however, only relatively little work is done on behavioural genetics in
   cattle.
   The reason for this is: behavioural traits are often difficult to
   measure accurately and the associated observed values often do not
   follow a normal distribution. In addition, cattle are kept in herds
   which are structured by the owner of the livestock, and thus learning
   from members of the herd regularly has an effect on the genetic
   components.
   The present study aims to provide an overview of more recent findings on
   the behavioural genetics of cattle. The focus is primarily on genetic
   aspects of feeding, reproductive and social behaviour, and on
   temperament. In selected functional cycles, behavioural changes can be
   supported by a further increase in the yield of highly productive cows.
   When all other variables are constant, the increased energy needs and
   nutritional requirements of the high-yield cows lead to the high-yield
   animals taking comparatively longer to feed than lower-yield animals.
   Thus, the high-yield cow has less time to rest. This conflict situation
   is likely to be exacerbated by a further intensive selection for a
   higher milk yield. Thus, the daily amount of time available for
   particular behaviours at a stock level (high-yield dairy cows) could be
   a valuable management tool in the future for detecting the risk of a
   `fatigue syndrome' and thus for assessing the well-being of high-yield
   dairy cows in practice.
   Livestock management systems always represent a compromise between
   different requirements. Animal welfare, and thus the well-being of the
   animals, is becoming increasingly important for the acceptance of
   livestock farming in society. The consumer must recognise that
   animal-friendly livestock management methods cannot be had at ``zero
   cost{''}. The creation of transparency and thus the verifiability of the
   livestock management act as a guide for the consumer.
   The establishment of a consensus between the farmer, the vet and the
   consumer about the livestock management method to be applied
   demonstrably leads to a stabilisation of the market share and the
   standing of the farmers who use animal-friendly livestock management
   systems.}},

Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{43-51}},

Abstract = {{Alarm calling is a widespread antipredator behaviour, but it is not
   always a reliable indication of real danger. Individuals must decide
   when to respond to alarm calls as a function of the relative costs and
   benefits, but experiments investigating contextual influences are rare.
   We used playback experiments in conjunction with supplementary feeding
   and the presentation of direct predator cues to examine variation in
   receiver responses to alarm calls in a habituated population of wild
   dwarf mongooses. First, we investigated whether individuals adjust their
   response to alarm calls depending on their own satiation level and
   spatial position of the caller. Individuals were more likely to respond
   to alarm calls when they had received supplementary food, and hence
   could prioritize minimization of predation risk over starvation. There
   was also increased responsiveness to alarm calls given by individuals
   from elevated positions compared to those on the ground; sentinels
   (raised guards) are more likely to detect potential predators than
   foragers, and alarm calls from elevated positions are probably perceived
   as more reliable. When individuals did respond, they were more likely to
   flee following an alarm call given from ground level; foragers are
   likely to detect predators in closer proximity than sentinels, requiring
   more urgent escape responses. Second, we examined how individuals
   combine social information provided by alarm calls with personal
   information relating to predator presence. Receiver responses to
   terrestrial and aerial alarm calls did not differ when they followed
   interaction with an olfactory predator cue compared to an olfactory
   control cue. Following interaction with a terrestrial predator cue,
   however, latency to nonvigilance was significantly longer after hearing
   an aerial alarm call than after hearing a terrestrial alarm call,
   potentially because of social information novelty. Our results provide
   experimental evidence that receivers respond flexibly to alarm calls
   depending on receiver, signaller and external factors. (C) 2017 The

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{53-66}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Arboreality has evolved in a wide range of taxa, but its adaptive
   significance has rarely been examined in natural ecosystems. Euhadra
   brandtii sapporo is an arboreal land snail distributed in a restricted
   area of Hokkaido, Japan. We hypothesized that arboreality provides the
   species with significant survival advantages, which we tested via field
   observations and experiments. A monitoring census showed that E. b.
   sapporo hibernates in winter in the ground litter, climbs into the
   canopy in early spring and returns to the ground in late autumn. This
   seasonal movement appears to be effective for escaping from predation by
   ground-dwelling carabine beetles, whose activity was high during the
   summer based on a pitfall-trap census. Manipulative field experiments
   were conducted to compare survival rates in arboreal and ground-dwelling
   environments. We collected 120 E. b. sapporo individuals in summer and
   tethered 40 in tree canopies and 80 on the ground; half those on the
   ground were covered by baskets to prevent predation by large animals.
   The survival rate after 11 days was highest in the canopy, followed by
   that on the ground with a basket and was lowest on the ground without a
   basket. Predation was the main cause of death, but some died from other
   causes. Similar results were obtained in autumn, except for higher
   survival rates of the ground treatments. Analyses of carbon and nitrogen
   isotope ratios suggest that the land snail uses epiphytic lichens and
   mosses as food resources. In conclusion, arboreality has a marked
   advantage in reducing mortality in E. b. sapporo and is probably
   supported by food availability as well. (C) 2017 The Association for the

   the adaptive or maladaptive nature of behavioural shifts. Yet, in the
   short term, implications of novel behaviour are often uncertain, as they
   were for a newly formed urban nesting colony of pied imperial-pigeons
   (PIPs) on the mainland coast of north-eastern Australia. It represented
   unprecedented behaviour, as most of PIPs, also known as Torresian
   imperial-pigeons, Ducula bicolor/spilorrhoa, breed colonially on remote
   small islands.
   Aims The present study would (1) determine whether aggregated mainland
   nesting continued, (2) evaluate reproductive success, (3) evaluate
   spatial distribution of nests and (4) explore possible association of
   reproductive success with predator presence and broad indicators of food
   availability.
   Methods With assistance from volunteers, we found mainland PIP nests and
   revisited them intermittently to monitor progress. We calculated
   quantitative estimates of nest survival by the Mayfield method and
   evaluated reproductive output in relation to environmental data from
   independent sources.
   Key results During the 2012, 2013 and 2014 breeding seasons, we recorded
   436, 387 and 417 PIP nest events at the new mainland colony. Daily
   nest-survival rates declined progressively and estimated fledgling
   output decreased over successive seasons from 0.66 to 0.44 per nest
   event. The highest mainland output was below that estimated for an
   island PIP colony (0.78) on the basis of sparse prior data. Across
   potential foraging grounds, there was no negative change in land use and
   no widespread adverse weather to account for diminishing success. We
   identified important causes of nest failure among mainland nesting PIPs
   to be predation, predominantly by birds, and anthropogenic hazards,
   including tree pruning and collisions with vehicles and windows of
   buildings.
   Conclusions With ongoing exposure to these hazards, mainland nesting
   PIPs cannot be expected to increase productivity; hence, the new colony
   may be a short-term phenomenon. We infer that the historic success of
   PIP populations in Queensland stems from their selection of breeding
   sites on remote islands that are largely free of relevant predators and
   anthropogenic activity.
   Implications Future conservation of extant PIP abundance will depend
   crucially on protection of island breeding sites, because multiple
   hazards of mainland nesting make it an unfavourable alternative
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Predator avoidance depends on prey being able to discern how risk varies
   in space and time, but this is made considerably more complicated if
   risk is simultaneously present from multiple predators. This is the
   situation for an increasing number of mammalian prey species, as large
   carnivores recover or are reintroduced in ecosystems on several
   continents. Roe deer Capreolus capreolus in southern Norway illustrate a
   case in which prey face two predators with contrasting patterns of
   predation risk. They face a catch-22 situation: spatially avoiding the
   risk from one predator (lynx Lynx lynx in dense habitat) implies
   exposure to the other (hunters in open habitat). Using GPS-data from 29
   roe deer, we tested for daily and seasonal variation in roe deer
   selection for habitat with respect to the habitats' year-round average
   risk level. Generally, roe deer altered their habitat selection between
   night and day in a pattern consistent with being able to avoid predicted
   risk from the nocturnal lynx during night and predicted risk from human
   hunters during day. However, seasonal variation in habitat selection
   only partially corresponded with the predicted seasonal variation in
   risk. Whereas roe deer avoided areas with high risk from hunters more
   strongly during the hunting season than in other seasons, there was a
   lack of selection towards areas and time periods lowering the risk of
   lynx predation during winter. It seems likely that the risk of
   starvation and thermal stress constrain roe deer habitat selection
   during this energetically challenging season with cold temperatures,
   snow cover and limited natural forage. The habitat selection pattern of
   roe deer fits thus only partly with the two contrasting risk gradients
   they face. Adjusting risk-avoidance behavior temporally can be an
   adaptive response in the case of several predators whose predation
   patterns differ in space and time.}},

Abstract = {{While competing males and choosy females may be common in animal mating
   systems, male choice can evolve under certain conditions. Sexual
   cannibalism is such a condition because of the high mortality risk for
   males. In mantids, female body condition is associated with male mate
   preference, with fat females preferred, due to at least two reasons:
   females in poor nutritional condition are likely to attack and predate
   males, and fat females can potentially increase the number of offspring.
   Thus, the risk of cannibalism and female fecundity can influence male
   mating behavior. In this study, we attempted to separate these factors
   by using the praying mantid Tenodera angustipennis to examine whether
   male preference for fat female mantids was based on avoiding sexual
   cannibalism (cannibalism avoidance hypothesis) or preference for female
   fecundity (fecundity preference hypothesis). The feeding regimes were
   experimentally manipulated to discriminate between the effects of female
   fecundity and female hunger status on male and female mating behaviors.
   We found that recently starved females more frequently locomoted toward
   the male, and that male abdominal bending was less intensive and escape
   was sooner from recently starved females. These female and male
   behavioral responses to female hunger condition may reveal male
   avoidance of dangerous females in this mantid.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundInappropriate dietary eliminations may impair quality of life,
   affect children's growth and unnecessarily impact on healthcare costs.
   Previous retrospective studies reported that around 25\% of children
   continue a food-avoidance diet despite a negative oral food challenge
   (OFC). A definite pattern has not been found yet for patients not
   reintroducing the food. This study aimed to examine the role of child's
   nutritional attitudes and maternal anxiety in reintroducing food after a
   negative OFC.
   MethodsA prospective study was conducted involving 81 mothers of
   children with IgE-mediated food allergy. They completed a survey on
   nutritional behaviour and attitudes and the State-Trait Anxiety
   Inventory on the day of OFC and 6months later.
   ResultsIn total, 11.1\% of children never or rarely ate the food after a
   negative OFC. Consumption of the reintroduced food is positively
   correlated to child's interest in tasting new foods before and after OFC
   and to changes in child's nutritional habits after OFC. It is negatively
   correlated to monotony of the diet after OFC. No correlations were found
   with other participants' characteristics or maternal anxiety. State
   anxiety significantly decreased after the OFC. A correlation was found
   between trait and state anxiety and the degree of change in nutritional
   habits after OFC.
   ConclusionsEvaluating child's approach towards food before the OFC is a
   promising approach to identify patients at risk of food reintroduction
   failure. Furthermore, it underlined the importance of reassessing food
   consumption in all patients after a negative OFC and supporting patients
   in the reintroduction of food.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Changes in food availability usually have an effect on the
   fitness-related traits of anuran larvae, such as body shape,
   developmental rate, and body size.
   Organism: Hypsiboas pulchellus, the South American common tree frog.
   Aim: Analyse the effect of food availability on larval survival,
   developmental rate (Gosner stage at the end of the experiment), body
   size (body mass and total length), body shape (the ratio between body
   length and total length), and intestine size (gut dry mass and gut
   length).
   Methods: We exposed tadpoles of H. pulchellus, all from a single clutch,
   to different levels of food availability. We set up eight food
   availability groups of five individuals each. After 39 days, we measured
   all phenotypic variables studied. We used linear and logistic
   regressions to analyse the data. We also used a structural equation
   modelling approach to evaluate the likelihood of ten causal models of
   covariation among the phenotypic traits (derived from four major
   biological hypotheses).
   Results: Three traits were observed to vary positively with food
   availability: developmental stage, body size, and gut size. Tadpole
   survival did not change with food availability. The results of
   structural equation modelling indicate that: (1) food availability acts
   directly on body size and gut size, (2) body size directly affects
   developmental rate, and (3) developmental rate acts directly on body
   shape.
   Conclusions: The present study supports the idea that anuran larvae are
   strongly affected by food availability. It also illustrates how
   structural equation modelling can increase our understanding of
   phenotypic integration among several traits that respond to changes in
   food availability.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescent psychiatric patients are vulnerable to weight problems and
   show an overrepresentation of overweight compared to the healthy

   overweight is higher impulsivity. As of yet, it is unclear whether it is
   a general impulse control deficit or weight-related aspects such as
   lower impulse control in response to food that have an impact on body
   weight. As this may have therapeutic implications, the current study
   investigated differences between overweight and non-overweight
   adolescent psychiatric inpatients (N = 98; aged 12-20) in relation to
   trait impulsivity and behavioral inhibition performance. The Barratt
   Impulsiveness Scale and two go/no-go paradigms with neutral and
   food-related stimulus materials were applied. Results indicated no
   significant differences concerning trait impulsivity, but revealed that
   overweight inpatients had significantly more difficulties in inhibition
   performance (i.e. they reacted more impulsively) in response to both
   food and neutral stimuli compared to non-overweight inpatients.
   Furthermore, no specific inhibition deficit for high-caloric vs.
   low-caloric food cues emerged in overweight inpatients, whereas
   non-overweight participants showed significantly lower inhibition skills
   in response to high-caloric than low-caloric food stimuli. The results
   highlight a rather general, non-food-specific reduced inhibition
   performance in an overweight adolescent psychiatric population. Further
   research is necessary to enhance the understanding of the role of
   impulsivity in terms of body weight status in this high-risk group of

Abstract = {{Cognitive performance is based on brain functions, which have energetic
   demands and are modulated by physiological parameters such as metabolic
   hormones. As both environmental demands and environmental energy
   availability change seasonally, we propose that cognitive performance in
   free-living animals might also change seasonally due to phenotypic
   plasticity. This is part of an emerging research field, the
   `ecophysiology of cognition': environmentally induced changes in
   physiological traits, such as blood glucose and hormone levels, are
   predicted to influence cognitive performance in free-living animals.
   Energy availability for the brain might change, and as such cognition,
   with changing energetic demands (e.g. reproduction) and changes of
   energy availability in the environment (e.g. winter, drought).
   Individuals spending more energy than they can currently obtain from
   their environment (allostatic overload type I) are expected to trade off
   energy investment between cognition and other life-sustaining processes
   or even reproduction. Environmental changes reducing energy availability
   might thus impair cognition. However, selection pressures such as
   predation risk, mate choice or social demands may act on the trade-off
   between energy saving and cognition. We assume that different
   environmental conditions can lead to three different trade-off outcomes:
   cognitive impairment, resilience or enhancement. Currently we cannot
   understand these trade-offs, because we lack information about changes
   in cognitive performance due to seasonal changes in energy availability
   and both the resulting changes in homeostasis (for example, blood
   glucose levels) and the associated changes in the mechanisms of
   allostasis (for example, hormone levels). Additionally, so far we know
   little about the fitness consequences of individual variation in
   cognitive performance. General cognitive abilities, such as attention
   and associative learning, might be more important in determining fitness
   than complex and specialized cognitive abilities, and easier to use for
   comparative study in a large number of species. We propose to study
   seasonal changes in cognitive performance depending on energy
   availability in populations facing different predation risks, and the
   resulting fitness consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Addiction is a mental illness in which psychiatric conditions imply a
   prominent burden. Psychopathological symptoms in substance use disorder
   (SUD) patients are usually viewed as being assignable to the sphere of a
   personality trait or of comorbidity, leaving doubts about the presence
   of a specific psychopathology that could only be related to the
   toxicomanic process. Our research group at the University of Pisa has
   shed light on the possible definition of a specific psychopathological
   dimension in SUDs. In heroin use disorder patients, performing an
   exploratory principal component factor analysis (PCA) on all the 90
   items included in the SCL-90 questionnaire led to a five-factor
   solution. The first factor accounted for a depressive ``worthlessness
   and being trapped{''} dimension; the second factor picked out a ``
   somatic symptoms{''} dimension; the third identified a
   ``sensitivity-psychoticism{''} dimension; the fourth a
   ``panic-anxiety{''} dimension; and the fifth a `` violence-suicide{''}
   dimension. These same results were replicated by applying the PCA to
   another Italian sample of 1,195 heroin addicts entering a Therapeutic
   Community Treatment. Further analyses confirmed the clusters of
   symptoms, independently of demographic and clinical characteristics,
   active heroin use, lifetime psychiatric problems, kind of treatment
   received, and, especially, other substances used by the patient such as
   alcohol or cocaine. Moreover, these clusters were able to discriminate
   patients affected by addiction from those affected by psychiatric
   diseases such as major depressive disorder. Our studies seem to suggest
   the trait-dependent, rather than the state-dependent, nature of the

Abstract = {{Glucose is considered the primary energy source for all cells, and some

   expression. We further show that ZEB1 induced NNMT, rendered cells
   resistant to glucose deprivation and recapitulated metabolic adaptations

   NNMT depletion reversed metabolic plasticity in glucoserestricted cells
   and prevented de novo formation of glucose-restricted colonies. In
   addition to its role in glucose independence, we found that NNMT was
   required for other ZEB1-induced phenotypes, such as increased migration.
   NNMT protein levels were also elevated in metastatic and recurrent
   tumors compared to matched primary carcinomas, while normal ovary and

Abstract = {{King rails experience a wide range of temperatures during the course of
   the breeding season throughout their rapidly contracting geographic
   range. Incubating parent birds are adapted to keep their eggs within a
   temperature range appropriate for embryo development, but king rail
   clutches are at risk of exceeding lethal temperatures in the latter half
   of the nesting season. We investigated whether behavioral plasticity
   during incubation enables parents to maintain clutch temperature within
   tolerable limits for embryo development. Video revealed that king rail
   parents interrupted incubation to stand above and shade their eggs. We
   tested the hypothesis that the onset of shading was a direct response to
   ambient temperature (adaptive plasticity). We monitored clutch
   temperature directly by experimentally adding into clutches a model egg
   embedded with a programmable iButton. We measured ambient temperature at
   the nest site simultaneously. Parents spent proportionately more time
   shading and less time incubating their eggs at higher ambient
   temperatures. Shading may primarily function in cooling the parent. The
   frequency and duration of shading bouts were significantly greater at
   higher ambient temperatures. Parents also took more frequent but shorter
   recesses in hotter conditions. Diurnal recesses exposed eggs to direct
   sunlight, and the highest clutch temperatures were recorded under these
   conditions. Complete hatching failure in at least one nest was
   attributable to high clutch temperature for an extended period. Because
   mean ambient temperature increases throughout the breeding season, we
   investigated seasonal patterns in onset of incubation and its effect on
   hatching rate. Later in the season, parents tended to initiate
   incubation earlier, and hatching asynchrony increased significantly.
   Together these results suggest that breeding king rails may be
   constrained in their ability to cope with sustained high temperatures
   should seasonal averages continue to rise as predicted.}},

   demonstrated with woodland caribou and wildfire}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Natural resource management professionals require adaptable spatial
   tools for conserving and managing wildlife across landscapes. These
   tools should integrate multiple components of habitat quality and
   incorporate local disturbance regimes. We provide a spatial modeling
   framework that integrates three components of habitat (nutritional
   resources, connectivity, and predation risk) into indices of habitat
   quality under a simulated wildfire disturbance regime. Woodland caribou
   (Rangifer tarandus caribou), a species of conservation concern, is used
   to illustrate our framework. We simulated disturbance from wildfire on
   two boreal forest landscapes to produce stand ages, from which we
   computed and integrated the three habitat indicator components using
   different schemes. Spatial variation in the influence of wildfire and
   the distribution of the three components of habitat resulted in
   heterogeneous patterns of habitat quality. The inclusion of disturbance
   led to a different habitat quality landscape than that of a static model
   in which the influence of wildfire on vegetation communities was not
   considered, incorporating the likelihood of persistence into the overall
   representation of habitat quality. The integration of nutrition,
   connectivity, and predation risk into a single index of habitat quality
   produced spatial patterns distinct from maps of the individual
   components. Regardless of whether the components were combined through
   additive, multiplicative, or minimum habitat quality threshold methods,
   areas of very high- and poor-quality habitat were found at consistent
   locations across the landscape, suggesting that these two types of
   regions provide opportunities for long-term management interventions.
   The framework presented here is adaptable and modular; it could be
   modified and applied to other species, regions, and disturbance regimes.
   It provides a nuanced representation of persistent habitat and has the
   potential to be a useful tool for conservation planning.}},

Title = {{Circadian Rhythms and Sleep in Drosophila melanogaster}},
Journal = {{GENETICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{205}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1373-1397}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The advantages of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, including
   low genetic redundancy, functional simplicity, and the ability to
   conduct large-scale genetic screens, have been essential for
   understanding the molecular nature of circadian (similar to 24 hr)
   rhythms, and continue to be valuable in discovering novel regulators of
   circadian rhythms and sleep. In this review, we discuss the current
   understanding of these interrelated biological processes in Drosophila
   and the wider implications of this research. Clock genes period and
   timeless were first discovered in large-scale Drosophila genetic screens
   developed in the 1970s. Feedback of period and timeless on their own
   transcription forms the core of the molecular clock, and accurately
   timed expression, localization, post-transcriptional modification, and
   function of these genes is thought to be critical for maintaining the
   circadian cycle. Regulators, including several phosphatases and kinases,
   act on different steps of this feedback loop to ensure strong and
   accurately timed rhythms. Approximately 150 neurons in the fly brain
   that contain the core components of the molecular clock act together to
   translate this intracellular cycling into rhythmic behavior. We discuss
   how different groups of clock neurons serve different functions in
   allowing clocks to entrain to environmental cues, driving behavioral
   outputs at different times of day, and allowing flexible behavioral
   responses in different environmental conditions. The neuropeptide PDF
   provides an important signal thought to synchronize clock neurons,
   although the details of how PDF accomplishes this function are still
   being explored. Secreted signals from clock neurons also influence
   rhythms in other tissues. SLEEP is, in part, regulated by the circadian
   clock, which ensures appropriate timing of sleep, but the amount and
   quality of sleep are also determined by other mechanisms that ensure a
   homeostatic balance between sleep and wake. Flies have been useful for
   identifying a large set of genes, molecules, and neuroanatomic loci
   important for regulating sleep amount. Conserved aspects of sleep
   regulation in flies and mammals include wake-promoting roles for
   catecholamine neurotransmitters and involvement of hypothalamus-like
   regions, although other neuroanatomic regions implicated in sleep in
   flies have less clear parallels. Sleep is also subject to regulation by
   factors such as food availability, stress, and social environment. We
   are beginning to understand how the identified molecules and neurons
   interact with each other, and with the environment, to regulate sleep.
   Drosophila researchers can also take advantage of increasing mechanistic
   understanding of other behaviors, such as learning and memory,
   courtship, and aggression, to understand how sleep loss impacts these
   behaviors. Flies thus remain a valuable tool for both discovery of novel
   molecules and deep mechanistic understanding of sleep and circadian
   rhythms.}},

Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{150-159}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Ignoring the inertia effects on transport-mode choice behavior may lead
   to erroneous decisions in transport policy. Around changes in the
   transport system, the majority of studies on inertia have relied on
   combining Revealed Preferences (RP) and Stated Preferences (SP) obtained
   prior to the introduction of new transport modes and measuring inertia
   as the effect that the real choices have on the choices in the
   hypothetical new scenarios. In this study, we analyze the role of the
   inertia using a novel panel data from the same set of individuals
   composed of two waves. The first wave was gathered before a new tram
   came into service and consisted of a RP survey and a SP survey which
   included the new public tram as a hypothetical alternative. The second
   wave consisted of a RP survey conducted two years later, after the tram
   started operating. Using these two waves, we estimate panel mixed logit
   models and found a significant inertia effect only between the RP waves
   which, having accounted for changes in other factors, increases the
   probability of choosing the car after the tram implementation. However,
   we did not find inertia effect on SP, hence taking into account only the
   RP-SP outcomes before tram might have led to wrong conclusions about the
   effect of the transport intervention on the modal share. Furthermore, we
   compare models with and without inertia effect and conclude that the
   models with inertia provide better fit to data, smaller direct car
   elasticities and increasing asymmetric effects between the car and
   public transport. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the breeding biology of the south temperate Cape Penduline
   Tit (Anthoscopus minutus) in order to compare its life history traits
   with those of related north temperate members of the family Remizidae,
   namely the Eurasian Penduline Tit (Remiz pendulinus) and the Verdin
   (Auriparus flaviceps). We used this comparison to test key predictions
   of three hypotheses thought to explain latitudinal variation in life
   histories among bird species-the seasonality and food limitation
   hypothesis, nest predation hypothesis and adult mortality hypothesis.
   Contrary to the general pattern of smaller clutch size and lower adult
   mortality among south-temperate birds living in less seasonal
   environments, the Cape Penduline Tit has a clutch size larger than that
   of the Verdin and similar to that of the Eurasian Penduline Tit, and
   higher adult mortality than both of the other two species. The most
   notable difference between the Cape Penduline Tit and the two other
   species is in parental behavioural strategy, with the former exhibiting
   bi-parental care at all stages of nesting together with facultative
   cooperative breeding, whereas the Eurasian Penduline Tit has
   uni-parental care and the Verdin has a combination of female-only
   incubation but bi-parental nestling care. Consequently, in comparison to
   the other two species, the Cape Penduline Tit exhibits greater nest
   attentiveness during incubation, a similar per-nestling feeding rate and
   greater post-fledging survival. Its relatively large clutch size, high
   parental investment and associated high adult mortality in a less
   seasonal environment are consistent with key predictions of the adult
   mortality hypothesis but not with key predictions of the seasonality and
   food limitation hypothesis in explaining life history variation among
   Remizidae species. These results add to a growing body of evidence of
   the importance of age-specific mortality in shaping life history
   evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Species interactions are often context-dependent, where outcomes require
   an understanding of influences among multiple biotic and abiotic
   factors. However, it remains unclear how abiotic factors such as
   temperature combine with important biotic factors such as
   density-dependent food limitation and predation to influence species
   interactions. Using a native grassland - grasshopper - wolf spider model
   food chain in tallgrass prairie, we conducted a manipulative field
   experiment to examine how predator-prey interactions respond to
   manipulations of temperature, grasshopper density, and food chain
   length. We find that grasshopper performance responses to temperature
   and predator treatments were density dependent. At high densities,
   grasshopper survival decreased with increased temperature when no
   spiders were present. When spiders were present, grasshopper survival
   was reduced, and this effect was strongest in the cooled treatment. In
   contrast, grasshopper survival did not vary significantly with spider
   presence or among temperature treatments at low grasshopper densities.
   Our results indicate that context-dependent species interactions are
   common and highlight the importance of understanding how and when key

Abstract = {{The arid and semi-arid zones of Australia are characterized by highly
   variable and unpredictable environmental conditions which affect
   resources for flora and fauna. Environments which are highly
   unpredictable in terms of both resource access and distribution are
   likely to select for a variety of adaptive behavioral strategies,
   intrinsically linked to the physiological control of behavior. How
   unpredictable resource distribution has affected the coevolution of
   behavioral strategies and physiology has rarely been quantified,
   particularly not in Australian birds. We used a captive population of
   wild-derived zebra finches to test the relationships between behavioral
   strategies relating to food access and physiological responses to stress
   and body condition. We found that individuals that were in poorer body
   condition and had higher peak corticosterone levels entered baited
   feeders earlier in the trapping sequence of birds within the colony. We
   also found that individuals in poorer body condition fed in smaller
   social groups. Our data show that the foraging decisions which
   individuals make represent not only a trade-off between food access and
   risk of exposure, but their underlying physiological response to stress.
   Our data also suggest fundamental links between social networks and
   physiological parameters, which largely remain untested. These data
   demonstrate the fundamental importance of physiological mechanisms in
   controlling adaptive behavioral strategies and the dynamic interplay
   between physiological control of behavior and life-history evolution.

Abstract = {{Common reports of over-response to food cues, difficulties with calorie
   restriction, and difficulty adhering to dietary guidelines suggest that
   eating behaviors could be interrelated in ways that influence weight
   management efforts. The feasibility of identifying robust eating
   phenotypes (showing face, content, and criterion validity) was explored
   based on well-validated individual eating behavior assessments. Adults
   (n = 260; mean age 34 years) completed online questionnaires with
   measurements of nine eating behaviors including: appetite for palatable
   foods, binge eating, bitter taste sensitivity, disinhibition, food
   neophobia, pickiness and satiety responsiveness. Discovery-based
   visualization procedures that have the combined strengths of heatmaps
   and hierarchical clustering were used to investigate: 1) how eating
   behaviors cluster, 2) how participants can be grouped within eating
   behavior clusters, and 3) whether group clustering is associated with
   body mass index (BMI) and dietary self efficacy levels. Two distinct
   eating behavior clusters and participant groups that aligned within
   these clusters were identified: one with higher drive to eat and another
   with food avoidance behaviors. Participants' BMI (p = 0.0002) and
   dietary self-efficacy (p < 0.0001) were associated with cluster
   membership. Eating behavior clusters showed content and criterion
   validity based on their association with BMI (associated, but not
   entirely overlapping) and dietary self-efficacy. Identifying eating
   behavior phenotypes appears viable. These efforts could be expanded and
   ultimately inform tailored weight management interventions. Published by

Abstract = {{The regulation of gene expression in response to environmental and
   behavioural cues is critical for many biological processes. Histone tail
   modifications are dynamic and, as such, can regulate gene expression in
   response to extracellular conditions. Many of the enzymes involved in

   products of intermediary metabolism pathways, thus linking cellular
   metabolism to the regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, the
   expression and activity of such enzymes are influenced by the cellular
   concentrations of metabolic products. Under- and overnutrition can
   induce epigenetic changes that influence chromatin structure and define
   a metabolic program. Importantly, recent studies have demonstrated that
   such changes during the pre- and perinatal periods can be long- lasting,
   influencing the disease risk later in life and could be transmitted to
   subsequent generations. Moreover, damaging gene expression patterns

Abstract = {{The global increase in rates of obesity has been accompanied by a
   similar surge in the number of autism diagnoses. Accumulating
   epidemiological evidence suggest a possible link between overweight and
   the risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), as well as autism
   severity. In laboratory animals, several studies have shown a connection
   between various environmental factors, including diet induced obesity,
   and the development of autism-related behaviors. However, the effect of
   high-fat or imbalanced diet on a pre-existing autism-like phenotype is
   unclear. In this study, we employed the BTBR inbred mouse strain, a well
   established mouse model for autism, to assess the impact of inadequate
   fattening nutrition on the autism-related behavioral phenotype. Male
   mice were fed by high-fat diet (HFD) or control balanced diet (control)
   from weaning onward, and tested in a series of behavioral assays as
   adults. In addition, we measured the hypothalamic expression levels of
   several genes involved in oxytocin and dopamine signaling, in search of
   a possible neurobiological underlying mechanism. As an internal control,
   we also employed similar metabolic and behavioral measures on
   neurotypical C57 mice. Compared to control-fed mice, BTBR mice fed by
   HFD showed marked aggravation in autism-related behaviors, manifested in
   increased cognitive rigidity and diminished preference for social
   novelty. Moreover, the total autism composite (severity) score was
   higher in the HFD group, and positively correlated with higher body
   weight. Finally, we revealed negative correlations associating dopamine
   signaling factors in the hypothalamus, to autism-related severity and
   body weight. In contrast, we found no significant effects of HFD on
   autism-related behaviors of C57 mice, though the metabolic effects of
   the diet were similar for both strains. Our results indicate a direct
   causative link between diet-induced obesity and worsening of a
   pre-existing autism-related behavior and emphasize the need for adequate
   nutrition in ASD patients. These findings might also implicate the
   involvement of hypothalamic dopamine in mediating this effect.}},

   patients. Data were analysed through content analysis.
   ResultsSeven cultural themes emerged from the qualitative data: the
   values placed on health and illness, customary way of life, preference
   for folk care and the Chinese healthcare system, and factors related to
   kinship and social ties, religion, economics and education.
   ConclusionsDietary change and management in response to illness,
   including heart failure, is closely related to individuals' cultural
   background. Healthcare providers should have a good understanding of
   cultural aspects that can influence patients' conformity to medical
   recommendations.
   Relevance to clinical practiceHeart failure patients need support that
   considers their cultural needs. Healthcare providers must have a good
   understanding of the experiences of people from diverse cultural
   backgrounds.}},

Abstract = {{Risk-taking decisions in front of a predator are crucial for the fitness
   of the animals. Risk-taking behaviour can be hypothesised to depend on
   escape ability, which is difficult to study in the wild. In this field
   study, we investigated whether escape ability (i) is a consistent
   individual-specific characteristic and (ii) can explain
   between-individual variation in risktaking behaviour in male collared
   flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis). We estimated escape ability by the
   time that was needed to capture individuals by hand in an outdoor aviary
   during both the courtship and the nestling feeding phases. We estimated
   risk-taking by human-induced flight initiation distance (FID) and
   parental nest-defence behaviour. We also measured variables that reflect
   individual quality and condition to assess how these affect escape
   ability. Time to capture was weakly repeatable in the within-and
   between-season contexts, but was considerably repeatable within a day.
   We found that time to capture decreased between courtship and nestling
   feeding phases, probably due to parallel changes in body condition (as
   shown by the systematic decline of individual body mass between phases
   correlating with within-individual changes in time to capture). Overall,
   time to capture was not significantly related to risk-taking behaviour,
   but we found a negative correlation between time to capture and FID in
   yearlings. In conclusion, escape ability in flycatchers seems to be a
   condition-dependent plastic trait, and it has the potential to affect
   immediate risk-taking decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Predators can influence prey traits and behavior (nonconsumptive effects
   {[}NCEs]), often with cascading effects for basal resources and
   ecosystem function. But critiques of NCE experiments suggest that their
   duration and design produce results that describe the potential
   importance of NCEs rather than their actual importance. In light of
   these critiques, we re-evaluated a toadfish (predator), crab (prey), and
   oyster (resource) NCE-mediated trophic cascade. In a 4-month field
   experiment, we varied toadfish cue (NCE) and crab density
   -(approximating variation in predator consumptive effects, CE). Toadfish
   initially benefitted oyster survival by causing crabs to reduce
   consumption. But this NCE weakened over time (possibly due to prey
   hunger), so that after 2 months, crab density (CE) dictated oyster
   survivorship, regardless of cue. However, the NCE ultimately re-emerged
   on reefs with a toadfish cue, increasing oyster survivorship. At no
   point did the effect of toadfish cue on mud crab foraging behavior alter
   oyster population growth or sediment organic matter on the reef, which
   is a measure of benthic-pelagic coupling. Instead, both decreased with
   increasing crab density. Thus, within a system shown to exhibit strong
   NCEs in short-term experiments (days) our study supported predictions
   from theoretical models: (a) within the generation of individual prey,
   the relative influence of NCEs appears to cycle over longer time periods
   (months); and (b) predator CEs, not NCEs, drive longer-term resource
   dynamics and ecosystem function. Thus, our study implies that the
   impacts of removing top predators via activities such as hunting and
   overfishing will cascade to basal resources and ecosystem properties
   primarily through density-mediated interactions.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Rats and mice exposed to repeated stress or a single severe stress
   exhibit a sustained increase in energetic, endocrine, and behavioral
   response td subsequent novel mild stress. This study tested whether the
   hyper-responsiveness was due to a lowered threshold of response to
   corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) or an exaggerated response to a
   standard dose of CRF. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 3 h of
   restraint on each of 3 consecutive days (RRS) or were non-restrained
   controls. RRS caused a temporary hypophagia but a sustained reduction in
   body weight. Eight days after the end of restraint, rats received
   increasing third ventricle doses of CRF (03.0 mu g). The lowest dose of
   CRF (0.25 mu g) increased corticosterone release in RRS, but not control
   rats. Higher doses caused the same stimulation of corticosterone in the
   two groups of rats. Fifteen days after the end of restraint, rats were
   food deprived during the light period and received increasing third
   ventricle doses of CRF at the start of the dark period. The lowest dose
   of CRF inhibited food intake during the first hour following infusion in
   RRS, but not control rats. All other doses of CRF inhibited food intake
   to the same degree in both RRS and control rats. The lowered threshold
   of response to central CRF is consistent with the chronic
   hyper-responsiveness to CRF and mild stress in RRS rats during the
   post-restraint period. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: A meeting of multidisciplinary biobehavioral scientists and
   National Institutes of Health (NIH) program staff was convened by the
   Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, Division of Program
   Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives, Office of the
   Director, NIH to examine mechanisms associated with humans' ability to
   self-regulate appetite and appetitive behavior.
   Methods: Based upon prior discussions of the NIH Obesity Research Task
   Force Behavioral Phenotyping Work Group, the premise was adopted that,
   in modern society, multiple factors on multiple levels interact to
   create circumstances wherein self-control of appetite is difficult,
   leading to overconsumption of unhealthy foods versus healthy eating
   patterns, contributing to our current levels of obesity. Through
   presentations and group discussions, the panel examined how foundational
   processes/ mechanisms directly and indirectly affect appetitive behavior
   and how these processes can be manipulated to affect food intake and
   thereby weight. The meeting identified evidence-based mechanisms with
   the potential to impact self-regulation of appetite and appetitive
   states (hunger, satiety, food wanting, restraint, reward) and associated
   behaviors such as overconsumption, eating in the absence of hunger, food
   seeking, and decision-making that could inform novel weight intervention
   strategies in free-living, nonlaboratory settings.
   Conclusion: The three summary papers contained in this issue represent
   the synthesis of the material presented at the meeting and the panel's
   recommendations on how existing evidence regarding mechanisms and
   pathways to appetitive behavior can be used to inform future research
   and novel prevention and intervention strategies to impact prevalence of

Abstract = {{In most countries producing milk, industry-or other stakeholder-driven
   initiatives are in place to improve welfare and overall dairy farming
   sustainability. Those initiatives typically include a system of
   verification of reaching targets and progress over time. Reliable
   indicators are a fundamental requirement to provide public assurance and
   allow improvement on farms. Assessing dairy cattle welfare through
   outcome measures of welfare is done today through visual evaluations,
   including those of lameness, injuries, hygiene, and body condition.
   Numerical scoring charts for visual evaluation have been validated, and
   training programs have been developed to achieve high repeatability of
   assessors. Sampling strategies have been validated to determine how many
   animals and how many days are required to obtain reliable estimates of
   prevalence. However, visual evaluations require long periods of data
   collection, and multiple visits on farm, along with repeated checks of
   assessors to ensure repeatability over time, are, in turn, very costly
   to implement. An attractive alternative is relying on automated measures
   as activity monitors are becoming common on commercial farms; among
   those, lying time retains the most attention. The use of herd lying time
   in both freestall and tie-stall situations has been validated. Current
   research is looking at relationships between lying time and other
   outcome measures of welfare, as well as lying time and risk factors for
   welfare in the environment (e.g., poor stall configuration or hoof
   trimming routine). We are not quite yet ready to rely solely on lying
   time to assess welfare; however, activity monitoring could certainly
   contribute to early detection of health and welfare issues (e.g.,
   frequency of visits to the robotic milking system). Another interesting
   avenue is the development of early outcome measures of welfare and,
   possibly, remote indicators, for example, performance data collected
   routinely in Dairy Herd Improvement agencies' databases. The rationale
   is that a herd with good health and high longevity should be at lower
   risk of poor welfare. Research is needed to identify predictors and
   their conditions of use, allowing us to discriminate good vs. poor
   welfare status, at both the individual and herd levels. Finally, milk
   samples are already collected routinely to check quality and safety. It
   would be convenient to be able to predict cow welfare status directly
   with the milk using biomarkers, but again, we are not there yet.}},

Abstract = {{Moving shadows signify imminent threat to foraging juvenile crayfish,

   behaviors: They either freeze in place or rapidly flex their tails,

   Although a freeze might be the more risky choice, it keeps the animal
   near the expected food reward, while a tail-flip is effective in
   avoiding the shadow, but puts critical distance between the animal and
   its next meal. We manipulated the satiation level of juvenile crayfish
   to determine whether their behavioral choices are affected by internal
   energy states. When facing the same visual danger signal, animals fed to
   satiation produced more tail-flips and fewer freezes than unfed animals,
   indicating that intrinsic physiological conditions shape value-based
   behavioral decisions. Escape tail-flip latencies, however, were
   unaffected by satiation level, and an increase in food quality only
   produced a minor behavioral shift toward more freezing in both fed and
   unfed animals. Thus, satiation level appears to be the dominant factor
   in regulating decision making and behavioral choices of crayfish.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Studies have established a strong genetic component in
   eating behavior. The Taql Al polymorphism (rs1800497) has previously
   been associated with obesity and eating behavior. Additionally, this
   polymorphism has been associated with diminished dopamine D2 receptor
   (DRD2) density, higher body mass, and food reinforcement. The aim of
   this study was to evaluate the association between the DRD2 rs1800497
   polymorphism and eating behavior in Chilean children.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in which we selected 258
   children (44\% girls, 56\% boys; ages 8-14 y) with a wide variation in
   body mass index. Anthropometric measurements were performed by standard
   procedures. Eating behavior was assessed using the Eating in Absence of
   Hunger Questionnaire (EAHQ), Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and
   the Food Reinforcement Value Questionnaire. Genotype of the rs1800497
   was determined by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length
   polymorphism. Association of the Taql Al variant (T allele) with eating
   behavior was assessed using nonparametric tests.
   Results: Compared with normal -weight children, the obese group
   demonstrated higher scores on the External Eating and Fatigue/Boredom
   subscales of the EAHQ. Higher scores were assessed in Food
   Responsiveness, Emotional Overeating, Enjoyment to Food and Desire to
   Drink subscales (P < 0.001) and lower scores of the Satiety
   Responsiveness and Slowness in Eating (P < 0.05). In the sex -specific
   analysis, the Taql Al allele was associated with higher scores on
   Satiety Responsiveness and Emotional Undereating subscales in obese
   girls, and higher scores of Enjoyment of Food subscale in boys.
   Conclusion: The Taql Al polymorphism may be a risk factor for eating
   behavior traits that may predispose children to greater energy intake
   and obesity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: We assessed the impact of a family history of diabetes on
   type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and behavioral traits in young
   Korean adults.
   Methods: Subjects aged 25-44 years were included, and the presence of a
   family history of diabetes was obtained by a self-reported questionnaire
   (the Korea National Health and Nutrition Survey 2010). We compared the
   prevalence of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and other
   metabolic parameters, including blood pressure and lipid profile.
   Results: Of 2059 participants, those with a family history of diabetes
   involving first-degree relatives (n = 489, 23.7\%) had a significantly
   higher prevalence of impaired fasting glucose (14.3 vs. 11.7\%) and type
   2 diabetes (6.7 vs. 1.8\%), compared to those without a family history
   (P < 0.001). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (21.3 vs. 12.1\%, P <
   0.001) and its components (except for high-density lipoprotein
   cholesterol) were greater in subjects with a family history of diabetes.
   Among subjects exhibiting normal glucose tolerance (n = 1704), those
   with a family history of diabetes had higher fasting glucose (89.0 vs.
   87.8 mg/dL, P < 0.001) and triglyceride (100.5 vs. 89.0 mg/dL, P <
   0.001), and lower beta cell function by the homeostasis model assessment
   (HOMA-beta; 134.2 vs. 137.5, P = 0.020). The obesity indices (body mass
   index, waist circumference, and triglyceride) were significantly
   correlated with those of both parents (P < 0.01 for all variables).
   Risk-reducing behavior, including regular exercise (18.2 vs. 19.7\%, P =
   0.469) and calorie intake (2174.8 vs. 2149.1 kcal/day, P = 0.636), did
   not markedly differ according to a family history of diabetes.
   Conclusions: Young adults with a family history of diabetes had an
   increased risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, even though
   they currently exhibited a normal glycemic profile. Proactive lifestyle
   consultation is requested especially among healthy young population with
   a family history of diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of latencies and interresponse times (IRTs) of rats was
   compared between two fixed-interval (FI) schedules of food reinforcement
   (FI 30 s and FI 90 s), and between two levels of food deprivation.
   Computational modeling revealed that latencies and IRTs were well
   described by mixture probability distributions embodying two-state
   Markov chains. Analysis of these models revealed that only a subset of
   latencies is sensitive to the periodicity of reinforcement, and
   prefeeding only reduces the size of this subset. The distribution of
   IRTs suggests that behavior in FI schedules is organized in bouts that
   lengthen and ramp up in frequency with proximity to reinforcement.
   Prefeeding slowed down the lengthening of bouts and increased the time
   between bouts. When concatenated, latency and IRT models adequately
   reproduced sigmoidal FI response functions. These findings suggest that
   behavior in FI schedules fluctuates in and out of schedule control; an
   account of such fluctuation suggests that timing and motivation are
   dissociable components of FI performance. These mixture-distribution
   models also provide novel insights on the motivational, associative, and
   timing processes expressed in FI performance. These processes may be
   obscured, however, when performance in timing tasks is analyzed in terms

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{243}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Many species show individual variation in neophobia and stress hormones,
   but the causes and consequences of this variation in the wild are
   unclear. Variation in neophobia levels could affect the number of
   offspring animals produce, and more subtly influence the rearing
   environment and offspring development. Nutritional deficits during
   development can elevate levels of stress hormones that trigger longterm
   effects on learning, memory, and survival. Therefore measuring offspring
   stress hormone levels, such as corticosterone (CORT), helps determine if
   parental neophobia influences the condition and developmental trajectory
   of young. As a highly neophobic species, jackdaws (Corvus monedula) are
   excellent for exploring the potential effects of parental neophobia on
   developing offspring. We investigated if neophobic responses, alongside
   known drivers of fitness, influence nest success and offspring hormone
   responses in wild breeding jackdaws. Despite its consistency across the
   breeding season, and suggestions in the literature that it should have
   importance for reproductive fitness, parental neophobia did not predict
   nest success, provisioning rates or offspring hormone levels. Instead,
   sibling competition and poor parental care contributed to natural
   variation in stress responses. Parents with lower provisioning rates
   fledged fewer chicks, chicks from larger broods had elevated baseline
   CORT levels, and chicks with later hatching dates showed higher
   stress-induced CORT levels. Since CORT levels may influence the
   expression of adult neophobia, variation in juvenile stress responses
   could explain the development and maintenance of neophobic variation
   within the adult population. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{697-706}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In social insects, the efficiency of exploitation of resources and
   colony defence are mediated by chemical communication. In colonies
   dependent on nutritionally limited resources, corpses represent both a
   food resource and a risk of pathogens. Because this risk vs. reward
   changes with time after death, behavioural plasticity in the response to
   corpses would be advantageous. How social insects regulate this
   trade-off remains unknown. We conducted quantitative behavioural
   bioassay and chemical analysis to study corpse management in the eastern
   subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes. We hypothesized that R.
   flavipes responds differently towards corpses with prolonged post-mortem
   time, and this behavioural plasticity is mediated by the dynamic change
   in death cues. We show that R. flavipes uses a post-mortem signalling
   system that depends on an early death cue that stimulates corpse
   retrieval and cannibalism, and late death cues that stimulate
   recruitment and burial. A blend of 3-octanone and 3-octanol is released
   immediately after death, with the alcohol (possibly in conjunction with
   the ketone) playing a clear role as a death cue. This cue enables the
   colony to recycle nutrients before decomposition occurs and before risk
   of pathogens increases. The accumulation of late death cues,
   decomposition products shared by diverse arthropods, elicits a
   behavioural switch from cannibalism to burial. The ability to detect and
   respond to the dead is vital to group-living animals. Our study reveals
   a behavioural shift in corpse management triggered by the interplay of
   an early death cue and late death cues, which balances risks and rewards
   associated with corpses. The post-mortem chemical communication
   highlights the adaptation of a social insect to its ecological niche.}},

   modulates appetite reactivity; (ii) appetite reactivity increases the
   risk of excess BMI, whereas self regulation in eating limits this risk.
   One hundred and four children aged between 7 and 12 years completed four
   behavioural tasks to assess scores for two components of appetite
   reactivity (i.e. appetite arousal and appetite persistence) and two
   components of self-regulation in eating (i.e. self-regulation in eating
   without hunger and self-regulation in eating speed). Their heights and
   weights were measured in order to calculate their BMI-for-age. T-tests
   and regression analysis were used to verify our hypotheses. None of the
   scores of self-regulation in eating was directly associated with BMI but
   we observed a significant impact of self-regulation in eating without
   hunger on appetite arousal (p-value = 0.04), together with a modest but
   significant association between appetite persistence and BMI (p value =
   0.02). We can thus conclude that our behavioural measures could be used
   for the determination of the child's eating temperament. Further studies
   are needed to investigate how to use these measures to improve the
   treatment of overweight in children. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Purpose of Review This review examines the concepts of fussy eating and
   food neophobia in the context of key determinants of the development of
   children's food preferences. We discuss the evidence for genetic versus
   parental and other environmental influences on the ontogeny of these
   behavioural traits and the implications of current knowledge for
   interventions that attempt to lessen the impact of these traits on
   children's diets. Finally, we consider whether these traits increase the
   risk of a child becoming obese, or alternatively, underweight and
   malnourished.
   Recent Findings Fussy eating and neophobia are related concepts with
   both genetic and environmental aetiologies. Parentchild correlations and
   heritability estimates are moderate to high for both traits, but aspects
   of the family environment remain influential in young children, although
   no longer in young adults. Parental strategies based around repeat
   tasting opportunities can improve acceptance of disliked foods in even
   the fussiest children. Fussy eating and neophobia are not risk factors
   for obesity but could limit growth in severe cases.
   Summary Fussy eating and food neophobia are common concerns for parents,
   though health risks are low. Dissemination of evidence-based strategies
   to parents that can encourage a more varied diet in young children would
   be helpful.}},

Title = {{Seasonal biotic and abiotic factors affecting hunting strategy in
   free-living Saharan sand vipers, Cerastes vipera}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{40-44}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Sit-and-wait ambushing and active hunting are two strategies used by
   predators to capture prey. In snakes, hunting strategy is conserved
   phylogenetically; most species employ only one strategy. Active hunters
   encounter and capture more prey but invest more energy in hunting and
   have higher risks of being predated. This trade-off is important to
   small predators. The small Cerastes vipera employs both modes of
   hunting, which is unlike most viperids which use only sit-and wait
   ambushing. This species hibernates in October and emerges in April.
   Energy intake should be high prior to hibernation to overcome the
   non-feeding hibernation period and for reproduction on their emergence.
   We predicted that more individuals would hunt actively towards
   hibernation and an abiotic factor would trigger this response.
   Furthermore, since more energy is required for active hunting, we
   predicted that snakes in good body condition would use active hunting to
   a greater extent than snakes in poor body condition. To test our
   predictions, we tracked free-living snakes year round and determined
   their hunting strategy, estimated their body condition index (BCI), and
   calculated circannual parameters of day length as environmental cues
   known to affect animal behaviour. Two novel findings emerged in this
   study, namely, hunting strategy was affected significantly by 1) the
   circannual change in day length and 2) by BCI. The proportion of active
   hunters increased from 5\% in April to over 30\% in October and BCI of
   active foragers was higher than that of sit-and-wait foragers and,
   therefore, our predictions were supported. The entrainment between the
   proportion of active hunting and the abiotic factor is indicative of an
   adaptive function for choosing a hunting strategy. A trend was evident
   among life stages. When all life stages were present
   (September-October), the proportion of active foragers increased with
   age: 0.0\% among neonates, 18.2\% among juveniles and 31.4\% among
   adults. We concluded that vulnerable small neonates used sit-and-wait
   ambush not only as a hunting strategy but also as a hiding technique.

Journal = {{CHILDHOOD OBESITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{44-52}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: As a group, bottle-fed infants are at higher risk for rapid
   weight gain compared with breast-fed infants. However, little is known
   about individual differences in feeding behaviors of bottle-feeding
   infants, as well as maternal and infant characteristics associated with
   bottle-feeding outcomes.
   Methods: We conducted a 2-day, within-subject study of 21
   formula-feeding dyads; the within-subject factor was feeding condition:
   mother-led (ML; mothers were given the instruction to feed their infants
   as they typically would) vs. infant-led (IL; the experimenter ensured
   feeding began when infants signaled hunger and ended when they rejected
   the bottle on three consecutive occasions). Intake was determined by
   bottle weight; feedings were video-recorded and later analyzed to
   determine feeding duration and types of satiation behaviors displayed.
   Percent difference scores were calculated for each outcome as {[}((ML -
   IL)/IL) x 100] to standardize differences among dyads. Mothers completed
   questionnaires of feeding styles and infant temperament.
   Results: On average, infants consumed 42\% more formula during the ML-
   than IL-condition (p=0.03). However, notable variation existed in
   difference scores for intake (range=-52.8\% to 268.9\%; higher scores
   reflect greater intake during ML than IL). Stepwise regression
   illustrated that greater intakes during the ML-condition were predicted
   by the combination of: (1) higher infant age; (2) lower levels of infant
   rhythmicity and adaptability; (3) higher levels of infant positive mood;
   and (4) lower levels of maternal restrictive and responsive feeding
   styles.
   Conclusions: This objective, experimental approach illustrated that
   variation in bottle-feeding outcomes is associated with characteristics
   of both members of the dyad.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{845-854}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Human presence in natural environments is often a source of stress that
   is perceived by large ungulates as an increased risk of predation.
   Alternatively, disturbance induced by hikers creates a relatively
   predator-free space that may serve as a refuge. We measured the
   behavioral responses of female caribou to disturbance associated with
   the presence of hikers during summer in the Gaspesie National Park. We
   used those data to determine whether caribou responded negatively to
   human activity (i.e., the predation risk hypothesis) or whether human
   activity resulted in a decrease in the magnitude of perceived risk
   (i.e., the refuge hypothesis). Female caribou with a calf spent nearly
   half of their time feeding, regardless of the presence of a trail or the
   number of hikers. They also decreased their vigilance near trails when
   the number of hikers increased. Conversely, lone females fed less
   frequently and almost doubled the time invested in vigilance under the
   same circumstances. However, both groups of females moved away from
   trails during the day, especially in the presence of hikers. We
   demonstrated that risk avoidance was specific to the maternal state of
   the individual. Lactating females accommodated the presence of hikers to
   increase time spent foraging and nutritional intake, providing support
   for the refuge hypothesis. Alternatively, lone females with lower
   energetic requirements and no maternal investment in a vulnerable calf
   appeared less tolerant to risk, consistent with the predation risk
   hypothesis. Synthesis and applications: Hikers influenced the
   vigilance-feeding trade-off in caribou, underlining the importance of
   appropriate management of linear structures and human activities,
   especially across the critical habitat of endangered species. Even if
   some individuals seemed to benefit from human presence, this behavioral
   adaptation was not sufficient to reduce annual calf mortality associated
   with predation.}},

Journal = {{HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{31-40}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We tested the two main evolutionary hypotheses for an association
   between immunity and personality. The risk of-parasitism hypothesis
   predicts that more proactive (bold, exploratory, risk-taking)
   individuals have more vigorous immune defenses because of increased risk
   of parasite exposure. In contrast, the pace-of-life hypothesis argues
   that proactive behavioral styles are associated with shorter lifespans
   and reduced investment in immune function. Mechanistically, associations
   between immunity and personality can arise because personality
   differences are often associated with differences in condition and
   stress responsiveness, both of which are intricately linked with
   immunity. Here we investigate the association between personality
   (measured as proactive exploration of a novel environment) and three
   indices of innate immune function (the non-specific first line of
   defense against parasites) in wild superb fairy-wrens Malurus cyaneus.
   We also quantified body condition, hemoparasites (none detected),
   chronic stress (heterophil:lymphocyte ratio) and circulating
   corticosterone levels at the end of the behavioral test (CORT, in a
   subset of birds). We found that fast explorers had lower titers of
   natural antibodies. This result is consistent with the pace-of-life
   hypothesis, and with the previously documented higher mortality of fast
   explorers in this species. There was no interactive effect of
   exploration score and duration in captivity on immune indices. This
   suggests that personality-related differences in stress responsiveness
   did not underlie differences in immunity, even though behavioral style
   did modulate the effect of captivity on CORT. Taken together these
   results suggest reduced constitutive investment in innate immune
   function in more proactive individuals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The understanding of consistent individual differences in behavior,
   often termed ``personality,{''} for adapting and coping with threats and
   novel environmental conditions has advanced considerably during the last
   decade. However, advancements are almost exclusively associated with
   higher-order animals, whereas studies focusing on smaller aquatic
   organisms are still rare. Here, we show individual differences in the
   swimming behavior of Daphnia magna, a clonal freshwater invertebrate,
   before, during, and after being exposed to a lethal threat, ultraviolet
   radiation (UVR). We show consistency in swimming velocity among both
   mothers and daughters of D. magna in a neutral environment, whereas this
   pattern breaks down when exposed to UVR. Our study also, for the first
   time, illustrates how the ontogenetic development in swimming and
   refuge-seeking behavior of young individuals eventually approaches that
   of adults. Overall, we show that aquatic invertebrates are far from
   being identical robots, but instead they show considerable individual
   differences in behavior that can be attributed to both ontogenetic
   development and individual consistency. Our study also demonstrates, for
   the first time, that behavioral consistency and repeatability, that is,

Abstract = {{Studies conducted in monozygotic and dizygotic twins have established a

   between the MC4R rs17782313 polymorphism with homeostatic and
   non-homeostatic eating behavior patterns in Chileans children. This is a
   cross-sectional study in 258 Chilean children (44 \% female, 8-14 years
   old) showing a wide variation in BMI. Anthropometric measurements
   (weight, height, Z-score of BMI and waist circumference) were performed
   by standard procedures. Eating behavior was assessed using the Eating in
   Absence of Hunger Questionnaire (EAHQ), the Child Eating Behavior
   Questionnaire (CEBQ), the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ), and
   the Food Reinforcement Value Questionnaire (FRVQ). Genotype of the
   rs17782313 nearby MC4R was determined by a Taqman assay. Association of

   responsiveness (p value = 0.02) and higher scores of uncontrolled eating
   (p value = 0.01). Obese boys carrying the C allele showed lower

Abstract = {{Background: Youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a disease that is newly
   emerging and behavioral strategies for its prevention are limited.
   Interventions that target the lifestyle behaviors of adolescents, to
   improve poor dietary quality and reduce excessive sedentariness, promise
   to reduce the risk of developing T2D. Health coaching is effective for
   promoting healthy behaviors in patients who have chronic disease, but
   few experimental studies are in adolescents. This randomized controlled
   trial, in adolescents with prediabetes, will determine the effectiveness
   of a health coaching intervention to facilitate adoption of healthy diet
   and activity behaviors that delay or prevent development of T2D.
   Methods/design: The Dietary Intervention for Glucose Tolerance In Teens
   (DIG IT) trial will involve an evaluation of a health coaching
   intervention in adolescents with prediabetes. Eligible participants will
   be randbmized to receive 6 months of health coaching or a single dietary
   consultation that is standard-of-care. The primary outcome will be
   2-hour oral glucose tolerance test concentration. Secondary outcomes
   will include measures of glycemia and insulin action as well as dietary,
   physical activity and sedentary behaviors measured using an electronic
   food record, and by inclinometer. Data will be collected before and
   after the intervention (at 6 months) and at 12 months (to assess
   sustainability).
   Discussion: This trial will determine whether a health coaching
   intervention, a personalized and low-cost approach to modify dietary and
   activity behaviors, is effective and sustainable for prevention of
   youth-onset T2D, relative to standard-of-care. Health coaching has the
   potential to be widely implemented in clinical or community settings.

Abstract = {{How energetic cost of locomotion affects foraging decisions, and its
   metabolic consequences are poorly understood. In several groups of
   animals, including hermit crabs, exploratory walking enhances the
   efficiency of foraging by increasing the probability of finding more and
   better food items; however, the net gain of energy will only be enhanced
   if the costs of walking are lower than the benefits of enhanced food
   acquisition. In hermit crabs, the cost of walking increases with the
   mass of the shell type occupied. Thus, we expected that hermit crabs
   should adjust their foraging strategy to the cost of movement in
   different shells. We assessed the foraging, the quantity and quality of
   food intake, and the energetic cost of maintenance of hermit crabs
   paying different costs of foraging in the wild. The exploratory walking
   negatively correlated with shell mass, showing that hermit crabs use
   different foraging strategies in response to the expenditure required to
   move. Hermit crabs deal with high energetic costs of foraging in heavy
   shells by reduces their exploratory walking and overall metabolic rate,
   as a strategy to maximize the net energy intake. This study integrates
   behavioral and metabolic compensations as a response to foraging at

Abstract = {{Human activity alters natural habitats for many species. Understanding
   variation in animals' behavioural responses to these changing
   environments is critical. We show how signal detection theory can be
   used within a wider framework of state-dependent modelling to predict
   behavioural responses to a major environmental change: novel, exotic
   species. We allow thresholds for action to be a function of reserves,
   and demonstrate how optimal thresholds can be calculated. We term this
   framework `state-dependent detection theory' (SDDT). We focus on
   behavioural and fitness outcomes when animals continue to use formerly
   adaptive thresholds following environmental change. In a simple example,
   we show that exposure to novel animals which appear dangerous-but are
   actually safe-(e.g. ecotourists) can have catastrophic consequences for
   `prey' (organisms that respond as if the new organisms are predators),
   significantly increasing mortality even when the novel species is not
   predatory. SDDT also reveals that the effect on reproduction can be
   greater than the effect on lifespan. We investigate factors that
   influence the effect of novel organisms, and address the potential for
   behavioural adjustments (via evolution or learning) to recover otherwise
   reduced fitness. Although effects of environmental change are often
   difficult to predict, we suggest that SDDT provides a useful route
   ahead.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Epidemiological studies suggest that hyponutrition during
   the fetal period increases the risk of mental disorders such as
   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism-spectrum disorder,

   previous experimental hyponutrition or protein-restricted (PR) diets
   affected stages other than the fetal stage, such as formation of the egg
   before insemination, milk composition during lactation, and maternal
   nursing behavior.
   Results: We conducted in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer in mice
   and allowed PR diet and folic acid-supplemented PR diet to affect only
   fetal environments. Comprehensive phenotyping of PR and control-diet
   progenies showed moderate differences in fear/anxiety-like,
   novelty-seeking, and prosocial behaviors, irrespective of folic-acid
   supplementation. Changes were also detected in gene expression and

   nutritionally vulnerable, often consuming insufficient energy, macro-and
   micronutrients to sustain their health and function. Multiple factors
   are proposed to influence food intake, yet our understanding of these
   diverse factors and their interactions are limited. The purpose of this
   paper is to fully describe the protocol used to examine determinants of
   food and fluid intake among older adults participating in the Making the
   Most of Mealtimes (M3) study.
   Methods: A conceptual framework that considers multi-level influences on
   mealtime experience, meal quality and meal access was used to design
   this multi-site cross-sectional study. Data were collected from 639
   participants residing in 32 LTC homes in four Canadian provinces by
   trained researchers. Food intake was assessed with three-days of weighed
   food intake (main plate items), as well as estimations of side dishes,
   beverages and snacks and compared to the Dietary Reference Intake.
   Resident-level measures included: nutritional status, nutritional risk;
   disease conditions, medication, and diet prescriptions; oral health
   exam, signs of swallowing difficulty and olfactory ability; observed
   eating behaviours, type and number of staff assisting with eating; and
   food and foodservice satisfaction. Function, cognition, depression and
   pain were assessed using interRAI LTCF with selected items completed by
   researchers with care staff. Care staff completed a standardized
   person-directed care questionnaire. Researchers assessed dining rooms
   for physical and psychosocial aspects that could influence food intake.
   Management from each site completed a questionnaire that described the
   home, menu development, food production, out-sourcing of food, staffing
   levels, and staff training. Hierarchical regression models, accounting
   for clustering within province, home and dining room will be used to
   determine factors independently associated with energy and protein
   intake, as proxies for intake. Proportions of residents at risk of
   inadequate diets will also be determined.
   Discussion: This rigorous and comprehensive data collection in a large
   and diverse sample will provide, for the first time, the opportunity to
   consider important modifiable factors associated with poor food intake
   of residents in LTC. Identification of factors that are independently
   associated with food intake will help to develop effective interventions
   that support food intake.}},

Title = {{You are what you eat: diet shapes body composition, personality and
   behavioural stability}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Behavioural phenotypes vary within and among individuals.
   While early-life experiences have repeatedly been proposed to underpin
   interactions between these two hierarchical levels, the environmental
   factors causing such effects remain under-studied. We tested whether an
   individual's diet affected both its body composition, average behaviour
   (thereby causing among-individual variation or `personality') and
   within-individual variability in behaviour and body weight (thereby
   causing among-individual differences in residual within-individual
   variance or `stability'), using the Southern field cricket Gryllus
   bimaculatus as a model. We further asked whether effects of diet on the
   expression of these variance components were sex-specific.
   Methods: Manipulating both juvenile and adult diet in a full factorial
   design, individuals were put, in each life-stage, on a diet that was
   either relatively high in carbohydrates or relatively high in protein.
   We subsequently measured the expression of multiple behavioural
   (exploration, aggression and mating activity) and morphological traits
   (body weight and lipid mass) during adulthood.
   Results: Dietary history affected both average phenotype and level of
   within-individual variability: males raised as juveniles on high-protein
   diets were heavier, more aggressive, more active during mating, and
   behaviourally less stable, than conspecifics raised on high-carbohydrate
   diets. Females preferred more protein in their diet compared to males,
   and dietary history affected average phenotype and within-individual
   variability in a sex-specific manner: individuals raised on high-protein
   diets were behaviourally less stable in their aggressiveness but this
   effect was only present in males. Diet also influenced individual
   differences in male body weight, but within-individual variance in
   female body weight.
   Discussion: This study thereby provides experimental evidence that
   dietary history explains both heterogeneous residual within-individual
   variance (i.e., individual variation in `behavioural stability') and
   individual differences in average behaviour (i.e., /personality'),
   though dietary effects were notably trait-specific. These findings call
   for future studies integrating proximate and ultimate perspectives on
   the role of diet in the evolution of repeatedly expressed traits, such
   as behaviour and body weight.}},

Abstract = {{Eating disorders (EDs) are characterized by intense preoccupation with
   shape and weight and maladaptive eating practices. The complex of
   symptoms that characterize EDs often arise through the activation of
   latent genetic potentials by environmental exposures, and epigenetic
   mechanisms are believed to link environmental exposures to gene
   expression. This chapter provides an overview of genetic factors acting
   in the etiology of EDs. It then provides a background to the hypothesis
   that epigenetic mechanisms link stresses such as obstetric complications
   and childhood abuse as well as effects of malnutrition to eating
   disorders (EDs). The chapter then summarizes the emerging body of
   literature on epigenetics and EDs-mainly studies on DNA methylation in
   samples of anorexia and bulimia. The available evidence base suggests
   that an epigenetically informed perspective contributes in valuable ways
   to the understanding of why people develop EDs.}},

Abstract = {{Television (TV) audience research can provide various accurate and
   reliable approaches to investigate TV ratings and viewer behavior.
   However, extant research ignores the issue of how the episodic nature of
   TV watching influences viewer behavior and program selection. The
   purpose of this paper is to elucidate the impact of an audience's
   dynamic decisions under two interactive behaviors: learning behavior and
   forgetting behavior. Learning behavior refers to updating drama quality
   assessment using information, while forgetting behavior disturbs the use
   of information. Based on a deep exploration of viewing behavior in a
   longitudinal context, we construct an innovative methodology employing
   Bayesian rules to model the dynamic process, and test its performance by
   comparing with three benchmark models. Through empirical work of model
   calibration based on the people meter data from the Hong Kong TV
   industry, we show that the learning and forgetting behaviors are two
   important factors determining the fit and predictive ability of our
   model. Some managerial implications are then discussed in order to
   provide useful insights to guide advertiser and TV broadcaster
   decision-making.}},

Title = {{How dependent are bell miners (Manorina melanophrys) on lantana (Lantana
   camara) as part of their habitat?}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{613-622}},
Abstract = {{Context. The bell miner (Manorina melanophrys) is thought to prefer the
   dense vegetation of Lantana camara, a dominating noxious weed, to nest
   in compared with native plant communities in northern New South Wales
   and southeastern Queensland. As miner numbers seemed to have increased
   with increased availability of nesting habitat, larger numbers of
   despotic bell miners territorially reduce native avian diversity. The
   resultant high insect numbers in the canopy lead to dieback. It is
   unknown to what extent the native bell miner relies on lantana for
   nesting sites and if restoration through removal of lantana, resulting
   in an influx of native species, changes food availability and thus
   foraging behaviours.
   Aims. The objective of our study was to understand the relationship
   between the presence of lantana and bell miners by determining: (1) bell
   miner behaviours in response to different understorey types; (2) bell
   miner nesting choices on a broad scale; (3) nesting preference for each
   site on a broad scale; and (4) whether nest height is related to
   fledging success.
   Methods. Fifty individual bell miners were observed within five colonies
   (four containing comparison quadrats of treated and intact lantana as
   part of a restoration study and one containing water vine for comparison
   as a pristine site; n =10 per treatment) during four seasons. Five bouts
   of gleaning, probing or sallying were observed, noting height and plant
   species. Nest sites were examined over a large area, noting plant
   species present, nest height and plant height.
   Key results. Bell miners used gleaning as the primary foraging tactic
   primarily in eucalypts (93\%; n = 600, mean = 13.6 m +/- 0.29, s.e.).
   Bell miners generally nested in understorey vegetation (83.5\% of nests
   observed) at a mean height of 2.7 m in 37 different plant species,
   native and exotic. Nest height did not influence the probability of
   broods fledging.
   Conclusions. Bell miners exhibit considerable nest plasticity, and the
   removal of lantana as an oft-used nesting habitat is unlikely to lead to
   relocation by this species.}},

Abstract = {{Childhood malnutrition and maltreatment (abuse, neglect) are both
   prevalent, particularly in resource-limited settings. Despite their
   known negative impact on child development, there is surprisingly little
   research documenting their interrelationships. To address this gap, we
   administered the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire - Short Form (CTQ-SF), a
   retrospective structured self-report of childhood abuse and neglect, in
   a Barbadian cohort of 77 adult survivors of infant malnutrition, limited
   to the first year of life, and 62 healthy controls from the same
   classrooms and neighborhoods (mean age +/- SD = 43.8 +/- 2.3 years).
   This cohort has been followed since birth. Using factor analysis and
   comparison with archival data addressing similar constructs, we found
   evidence for reliability and validity of the CTQ-SF in this population.
   Linear regression analyses, with and without adjusting for childhood
   household standard of living at three childhood ages, revealed that a
   history of infant malnutrition was significantly associated with
   increased levels of self-reported physical neglect in childhood, and, to
   a somewhat lesser degree, emotional neglect. This study highlights the
   co-occurrence of infant malnutrition and self-reported maltreatment in
   childhood in Barbados, with potential public health implications.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The clinical evidence shows that the onset of eating
   disorders is increasing in the prepubescent phase or even in childhood.
   Already starting from the prepubescence the certainties related to the
   body start to unwind and the individual is encouraged to build new ones,
   based both on the anatomic transformation of his/her own body and on the
   social expectation according to the identity.
   The onset of a Eating Disorders is normally between 13 and 25 years, but
   in the last years we recorded a lowering in the onset threshold to an
   age between 11 and 13 years, with some earlier cases at 7 years
   (Franzoni et al. 2012).
   Many theories consider body dissatisfaction as the immediate antecedent
   to the development of this eating disorder. Different studies have
   confirmed that a strong concern for physical appearance could sometimes
   precede an eating disorder (Cuzzolaro 2004). The alteration of the body
   image is the major predictive factor for the relapse, the patients
   themselves refer that it is one of the major obstacles for the
   realization of a lasting recovering. In the following study one hundred
   kids between 10 and 15 years old, without any Eating Disorders
   diagnosis, have been tested to evaluate whether if already from this age
   there is a concern about body image starting at this age, the fear of
   gaining weight and the desire to be slimmer. It is known, indeed, that
   these factors, if significantly present in a subject, can turn into
   predictive factors of a psychopathology.
   We need to build our body image over time; changing our percertion of
   reality can change also what we see, in particular the body image we
   strive for changes (Bianchini 2008).
   Method: 100 teenagers split in 53 females and 47 males aged between 10
   and 14 years, randomly picked in the secondary school.
   Results: The results of the study show that in the age between 10 and 15
   years the concern for the body shape is already present, without
   difference between the genders.
   Although 45\% of the sample is underweight, the Figure Raiting Scale
   test both males and females want to be of lesser weight. 91 subjects
   reached a BSQ test score of over 34, so most of the sample has a strong
   concern for their physical appearance. The results obtained by
   administering the BUT test also highlighted concern about the body with
   moderate gravity.
   Discussion: Body dissatisfaction, as so many studies have confirmed, can
   be considered a precursor of psychopathology. Concerns concern both
   female gender and male gender. It is also necessary to pay close
   attention to the pressure exerted by family members, friends and the
   media towards a difficult to reach thinness ideal. That is why we need
   to focus on strengthening protective factors in adolescents with
   prevention and awareness campaigns which are properly targeted.
   Conclusion: The work resulted a useful reflection on the building of the
   body image as an early risk factor for the onset of pathologies linked
   to this concept. We need to commit to an educative practice of support
   for adolescent, recognition and sharing, which does not avoid the
   presence of the adults, but in fact it is enriched.
   It would be appreciated if we could introduce in the school, in the
   program of different subjects, the discussion regarding different
   aspects of a healthy nutrition and the formation of a solid self-esteem
   in order, for the students, to have a critical interpretation of the
   media message on food, body and beauty.
   It is desirable to promote the emancipation of the adolescents from a
   condition of dependence to discover their own place in the world. The
   educative action can help developing the research of the meaning of the
   own personality.}},

   Main outcome measures: Mothers (N = 197, Mage = 34.39, SD = 5.65) of
   children aged 2-3 years completed a main questionnaire assessing
   planning constructs and intentions, and a one-week follow-up of the
   target behaviours - `healthy eating' and `discretionary choices'.
   Results: Intention was the strongest predictor of behaviour for both
   dietary behaviours. For healthy eating, intention moderated the indirect
   relationship between intention-behaviour via planning; coping planning
   was less important when intention was strong. Further, intention was not
   a direct predictor of behaviour when intention was relatively low.
   Action planning was not a direct predictor of either behaviour after
   accounting for intention and coping planning; action planning on
   behaviour was mediated by coping planning (only for healthy eating).
   Intention was not a direct predictor of coping planning; intention on
   coping planning was mediated by action planning. Neither type of

   behaviour of wild Sapajus to access water from non-food sources may
   enable them to circumvent the risk of dehydration in environments with
   reduced availability of fleshy fruits and with ephemeral and rare water
   sources. Our findings contribute to the still scarce but accumulating

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{183}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{821-829}},
Abstract = {{It is well known that predators often influence the foraging behaviour
   of prey through the so-called ``fear effect{''}. However, it is also
   possible that predators could change prey behaviour indirectly by
   altering the prey's food supply through a trophic cascade. The
   predator-sea urchin-kelp trophic cascade is widely assumed to be driven
   by the removal of sea urchins by predators, but changes in sea urchin
   behaviour in response to predators or increased food availability could
   also play an important role. We tested whether increased crevice
   occupancy by herbivorous sea urchins in the presence of abundant
   predatory fishes and lobsters is a response to the increased risk of
   predation, or an indirect response to higher kelp abundances. Inside two
   New Zealand marine reserves with abundant predators and kelp,
   individuals of the sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus were rarer and
   remained cryptic (i.e. found in crevices) to larger sizes than on
   adjacent fished coasts where predators and kelp are rare. In a mesocosm
   experiment, cryptic behaviour was induced by simulated predation (the
   addition of crushed conspecifics), but the addition of food in the form
   of drift kelp did not induce cryptic behaviour. These findings
   demonstrate that the `fear' of predators is more important than food
   availability in promoting sea urchin cryptic behaviour and suggest that
   both density-and behaviourally mediated interactions are important in
   the predator-sea urchin-kelp trophic cascade.}},

Journal = {{NUTRITION \& FOOD SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{721-730}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The number of researches that evaluate how behavioural and
   personality issues affect consumers' acceptance and perception of food
   is increasing. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of
   nutritional information and health claims related to soya and cashew nut
   beverages over consumers' acceptance and perception regarding
   nutritional value and healthiness and to verify whether behavioural and
   personality issues affect such evaluation.
   Design/methodology/approach - The samples were evaluated in two phases,
   with (blind phase) and without information (informed phase) about their
   composition, nutritional characteristics and functional claims related
   to some of their ingredients. The sensory evaluation data were analysed
   by means of the analysis of variance for repeated measures, applying 2
   (information) x 2 (beverage) and generalised linear model to evaluate
   the effect of information over the acceptance averages, as well as over
   the perception of healthy food and nutritional value.
   Findings - Information on composition, nutritional characteristics and
   functional claims related to the cashew nut and soya beverages did not
   influence flavour acceptance (p-value = 0.250) and overall impression
   (p-value = 0.316), but had a positive impact on consumers' perception
   regarding healthiness (p-value < 0.001) and nutritious value (p-value <
   0.001) of both beverages, the cashew nut beverage being perceived as
   more nutritious and healthier than the soya beverage. Consumers'

Journal = {{NORTHERN CLINICS OF ISTANBUL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{117-123}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine an orthorexia nervosa
   scale score for and evaluate orthorexic tendency among students of
   nutrition and dietetics according to various sociodemographic
   characteristics.
   METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out in May and June of
   2016 among 208 students in the nutrition and dietetics department at a
   university in Istanbul. After receiving the approval of the university
   ethics committee, of a total of 300 students, 208 agreed to join the
   study. Participants completed a questionnaire related to individual
   characteristics and the ORTO-11 scale during a face-to-face interview.
   The ORTO-11 scale is a verified Turkish scoring system in which a low
   score indicates orthorexic tendency. The Mann-Whitney U test,
   independent samples t-test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and analysis of
   variance were used to assess the data. P<0.05 was accepted as
   statistically significant.
   RESULTS: Orthorexic tendency was significantly higher in males (p=0.050)
   and students who lived with their family (p=0.002). Mean ORTHO-11 scale
   score did not differ significantly between groups when the participants
   were grouped by parameters of smoking, alcohol consumption, chronic
   disease status, body mass index, diet observance, or use of nutritional
   supplement products.
   CONCLUSION: The orthorexic tendency was higher in men and in students
   who lived with their family. Additional assessment of individual eating
   habits, eating behavior, and personality characteristics would shed
   light on the reasons for the difference between gender groups.
   Qualitative studies should be carried out and possible confounding
   factors should be determined.}},

Abstract = {{Recognizing which phenotypic traits are predictors for habitat choice

   This study determined whether body size, sex, activity level, or origin

   level and food availability. Combining field and laboratory experiments,
   this study indicated a significant difference in body size and activity
   level of crabs between habitats. Further investigation of phenotypic
   dependency on habitat preference resulted in interactions between origin
   habitat and carapace width and activity level. When split by origin
   habitat, habitat preference for the open mudflat was predicted by body
   size for crabs originating from the open mudflat and by activity level
   for the crabs originating from the Spartina marsh. These results suggest
   that, for U. pugilator, body size plays a large role in the preference
   for exposed habitat.}},

Title = {{Senior consumers and risk/benefit trade-off in functional foods}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1232-1246}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how French senior
   consumers deal with duality between perceived risk and perceived value
   associated with functional foods (FFs) and to analyze whether the
   risk-value trade-off may help to derive different consumer profiles.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 220 senior
   consumers (50-70). A two-step clustering analysis was carried out on
   factor scores of perceived value and perceived risk. Discriminant
   analysis was then employed to verify the classification reliability, and
   analysis of variance was performed to profile the clusters on the basis
   of additional variables.
   Findings - Four distinctive profiles of FF senior consumers were
   identified. Significant differences were found to be attributed to
   personality traits. Interestingly, the ``Trustful enthusiasts{''} and
   the ``Ambivalents{''} consumers do not differ in their repurchase
   intention, despite a significant discrepancy in risk perception.
   Practical implications - The study is an opportunity to offer a
   segmentation of this attractive growing target of health-enhancing
   products. The typology can help the practitioners to find out a new
   valuable scope of messages to better communicate to elderly market.
   Originality/value - The research seeks to contribute to the existing
   knowledge on seniors' nutrition-related behavior, by proposing a
   segmentation still lacking in research works. Since FF perceived value
   appears to be multidimensional and not only utilitarian, the study
   provides a new insight into the experiential approach of
   health-enhancing eating. Also, it shows how the differences between FF
   consumers could be attributed to certain personal variables.}},

   analysed. The key barriers found included: male apathy towards diet;
   unhealthy diet of friends and family; expected consumption of unhealthy
   foods in certain situations; relative low cost of unhealthy foods; lack
   of time to plan, shop, prepare and cook healthy foods; lack of
   facilities to prepare, cook and store healthy foods; widespread presence
   of unhealthy foods; lack of knowledge and skills to plan, shop, prepare

   support/encouragement of friends and family to eat healthy; desire for
   improved health; desire for weight management; desire for improved
   self-esteem; desire for attractiveness to potential partners and others;
   possessing autonomous motivation to eat healthy and existence and use of

Abstract = {{Leadership is an important process shaping collective movement in some
   species. Recent work has demonstrated that experienced or motivated
   individuals can emerge as leaders, and provides insight into the
   mechanisms by which this occurs. Ultimately, leadership depends on the
   effectiveness with which would-be leaders can entrain followers, and
   although the properties of leaders have received much attention, less is
   known about the factors that affect the propensity of their groupmates
   to follow them. Here, the roles of experience and state (hunger) in
   shaping leader and follower behavior were investigated using shoals of
   sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). A first experiment revealed that
   individuals trained to approach a target could entrain and lead their
   naive groupmates out of a refuge toward it, and that they did so more
   effectively when they (the trained fish) were food deprived. In the
   second experiment, the hunger level of the trained fish was held
   constant, whereas that of the naive fish was varied. Here, leadership by
   trained fish was only apparent when the hunger levels of the naive group
   members were intermediate. When naive fish were recently fed, they took
   a long time to visit the target and their arrival times were not
   affected by the presence of a trained individual. Very hungry groups
   recruited to the target most rapidly, but again with no evidence of
   influence by their trained groupmates. These experiments demonstrate
   that leadership in animal groups depends not only on the state and
   experience of the leader but also on that of the potential followers.}},

Abstract = {{Despite recent progress in elucidating the genetic basis for behavioral

   during development affected behavioral variation and covariance between
   activity in an open field test and response to cues of predator presence
   in the house cricket (Acheta domesticus). We provided 98 juvenile
   crickets with either a high or low quality diet during development,
   throughout which we measured body mass, activity in a modified
   open-field, and response to predator excreta twice every week for 3
   weeks. Diet quality affected growth rate but not average activity or
   response to cues of predator presence, nor the correlation between the
   2. However, repeatability (t) in response to cues of predator presence
   was reduced by 0.24 in individuals exposed to the high quality diet
   versus the low quality diet. Larger individuals also increased their
   response to predator cues when reared on a high quality diet, suggesting
   negative feedbacks between growth rate and antipredator behaviors. Our
   results also indicate that changes in the developmental environment are
   not sufficient to collapse behavioral syndromes, suggesting a genetic
   link between activity and predator cue response in house crickets, and
   that nutritional stress early in life can lead to more consistent
   behavioral responses when individuals faced predatory threats. Our

Abstract = {{Binge eating (BE) and drug seeking share similar behavioral features,
   including loss of control over consumption and compulsive seeking of the

   complex interaction between `state' BE, produced by intermittent access
   to a palatable diet, and `trait' BE, a phenotypical proneness towards
   overeating. In the present study, we examined the relationship between
   state and trait BE and cocaine seeking. We used Otsuka Long Evans
   Tokushima Fatty rats, a genetic model for obesity that demonstrates
   BE-like behavior, and Long Evans Tokushima Otsuka controls. They
   received a schedule of limited access to a palatable diet (3 days/week
   or 5 days/week access to Ensure for a month). Next, they underwent
   cocaine self-administration training (1 mg/kg, 1 hour/day for 10 days)
   followed by extinction sessions (7 days). We found that the degree of
   BE-like behavior and the state and trait BE combination predicted
   cocaine craving patterns. Lower levels of dopamine D2 receptors in the
   prefrontal cortex were correlated with increased drug craving. Moreover,
   restricted access to an attractive diet was found to be a risk factor
   for heightened cocaine craving, particularly in trait binge eaters, as
   rats on the 3 days/week access schedule persistently failed to cease
   cocaine seeking throughout extinction. Hence, we postulate a joint role
   of state and trait BE as risk factors for heightened cocaine craving.}},

Abstract = {{Plovers (subfamily: Charadriinae) are visual foragers that rely on
   ambient light for detection of invertebrates, as demonstrated by their
   foot-stirring behaviour used to stimulate a flight response in prey. At
   night, although ambient light is minimal, predation pressure from
   diurnal raptors is reduced and invertebrate prey availability increases,
   thus creating fitness benefits to nocturnal foraging by invertivores.
   The Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus) is a widespread yet understudied
   Plover that primarily inhabits agricultural fields throughout North
   America during the winter. Because nocturnal ambient light is directly
   dependent upon the lunar cycle, I hypothesized that Killdeer exploit
   nights with greater lunar illumination to be able to forage when
   predation risk is low and prey availability is enhanced. I predicted
   that nocturnal activities by Killdeer would be reflected in their
   diurnal behaviour the subsequent day, with decreased diurnal foraging
   following lighter nights. I also considered the additive effect of lower
   ambient temperatures and precipitation. I used an information-theoretic
   framework to compare these hypotheses and found the model with greatest
   support revealed a clear negative relationship between diurnal foraging
   and the amount of lunar illumination the preceding night. Interestingly,
   I found the opposite trend in diurnal roosting behaviour, suggesting
   that if nocturnal light levels suffice, Killdeer forage at night and
   roost during the day. I propose that this behaviour is driven by
   differential predation risk and food availability perceived by Killdeer
   at night vs. day. I also discuss the potential functional importance of
   energetic demands. Taken together, these results highlight the potential
   for avian diurnal behaviour to be closely tied to natural variation in
   nocturnal light availability, a finding with potential relevance to the
   increasing threat of artificial light pollution in our era of
   industrialization.}},

Abstract = {{Failure to participate in a cognitive test may result in sampling biases
   when measuring inter-individual variation in cognitive performances in
   both captive and wild populations. This would be problematic if
   particular classes of individuals consistently fail to participate,
   skewing data and making generalisations or comparisons difficult. We
   presented 144 pheasant chicks, raised under standardised conditions,
   with a battery of cognitive tests to investigate whether sex, body
   condition or personality traits, measured by differences in latencies to
   explore a novel object, novel environment or unknown conspecific,
   predicted individual variation in voluntary participation across 37 test
   sessions. In general, participation increased across testing sessions,
   yet patterns of participation differed with sex and body condition.
   Males with a high body condition were more likely to participate in
   early test sessions compared to males with a low body condition or
   females. While participation among males in high body condition was
   consistent across sessions, males with a low body condition and females,
   regardless of body condition, were more likely to participate in later,
   rather than earlier sessions. Individuals also showed repeatable
   behaviours across time and different contexts, revealing not only that
   the exploration of novelty, but also that the order that subjects
   entered the testing arena and their latencies to acquire a freely
   available meal-worm reward may be considered valid proxies for different
   personality traits. During each test session, those individuals that
   were among the first to voluntarily enter the testing arena were more
   likely to participate in subsequent trials. Moreover, when isolated in
   the testing arena, individuals that rapidly acquired a freely available
   meal-worm, positioned on the testing apparatus, were also more likely to
   participate in a cognitive test. Our findings therefore reveal that sex,
   body condition and personality traits, along with habituation to the
   testing paradigms, all play important roles in determining whether or
   not particular individuals participate in cognitive tests. Sampling
   biases may therefore misrepresent our understanding of variation in
   cognitive performance in wild and captive populations, making individual
   differences in cognition difficult to interpret. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Natal dispersal outcomes are an interplay between environmental
   conditions and individual phenotypes. Peripheral, isolated populations
   may experience altered environmental conditions and natal dispersal
   patterns that differ from populations in contiguous landscapes. We
   document nonphilopatric, sex-biased natal dispersal in an endangered
   small mammal, the Mt. Graham red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus
   grahamensis), restricted to a single mountain. Other North American red
   squirrel populations are shown to have sex-unbiased, philopatric natal
   dispersal. We ask what environmental and intrinsic factors may be
   driving this atypical natal dispersal pattern. We test for the influence
   of proximate factors and ultimate drivers of natal dispersal: habitat
   fragmentation, local population density, individual behavior traits,
   inbreeding avoidance, competition for mates, and competition for
   resources, allowing us to better understand altered natal dispersal
   patterns at the periphery of a species' range. A juvenile squirrel's
   body condition and its mother's mass in spring (a reflection of her
   intrinsic quality and territory quality) contribute to individual
   behavioral tendencies for movement and exploration. Resources, behavior,
   and body condition have the strongest influence on natal dispersal
   distance, but affect males and females differently. Male natal dispersal
   distance is positively influenced by its mother's spring body mass and
   individual tendency for movement; female natal dispersal distance is
   negatively influenced by its mother's spring body mass and positively
   influenced by individual tendency for movement. An apparent feedback
   between environmental variables and subsequent juvenile behavioral state

Abstract = {{Personality exists in non-human animals and can impact fitness. There
   is, however, a shortage of empirical studies in certain areas within the
   field, and fundamental evolutionary theory on personality remains
   largely untested. For example, little is known on how variation in
   personality is maintained over evolutionary time. Theory suggests that
   fluctuating selection pressures due to spatiotemporal variation in
   conditions, e.g. food availability, is a possible mechanism and a few
   studies have shown that the success of different personality types
   varies with spatiotemporal conditions. However, it remains unknown
   whether different mechanisms can maintain personality within a species.
   Here we use a reintroduction programme for the critically endangered
   European mink (Mustela lutreola) to test whether multiple personality
   trait domains (boldness, exploration and sociability) affected survival
   in two different years and islands. This was done through pre-release
   personality tests and post-release radio-tracking monitoring. Survival
   was positively correlated with boldness, whereas the relationship with
   exploration was either negative or positive depending on year/island.
   The results show a complex relationship between personality and survival
   and suggest that exploration can be maintained over evolutionary time
   via spatiotemporal variation in conditions. However, in contrast to
   exploration, boldness did not vary spatiotemporally and sociability had
   no impact on survival. This indicates that different personality trait
   domains might be maintained by different mechanisms. To date,
   personality has been studied primarily within behavioural sciences, but
   through empirical findings we highlight the importance of personality
   also in ecology and conservation biology.}},

   experiment}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{It has been proposed recently that labile state variables (e.g. energy
   reserves) can have a key role in the development and maintenance of
   consistent between-individual behavioural variation (i.e. animal
   personality) within population. In male Carpetan rock lizards
   (Iberolacerta cyreni), the provitamin D-3 component of femoral gland
   secretion acts as an honest signal in sexual communication. Further,
   vitamin D-3 has many important metabolic functions in reptiles.
   Therefore, by employing a factorial experiment with food (high vs. low)
   and vitamin D-3 (supplemented vs. control) treatments in wild-caught
   reproductive male I. cyreni, we tested whether changing labile
   components of individual state affected (i) behavioural consistency (the
   degree of between-individual difference) and (ii) behavioural type (mean
   behaviour). Animal personality in activity was present in all
   treatments; however, personality was present only in the high food x
   vitamin D-3 supplementation treatment in shelter use and it was present
   in all but the low food x placebo treatment in risk taking. Lizards (i)
   decreased activity in the high food treatment, (ii) increased shelter
   use in the vitamin D-3 supplementation treatment and (iii) increased
   risk taking in the low food x vitamin D-3 supplementation treatment. We
   conclude that short-term changes in individual state affect both
   behavioural consistency and behavioural type of reproductive male I.
   cyreni. Unfavourable conditions resulted in decreased behavioural
   consistency, while high-state individuals became less active in general.
   Individuals with high specific (vitamin D-3) but low general (energy
   reserves) state took higher risk. We discuss several evolutionary
   explanations for the reported patterns.
   Significance statement
   The evolutionary and developmental mechanisms resulting in consistent
   between-individual behavioural differences across time and situations
   (i.e. animal personality) are of high scientific interest. It has been
   recently proposed that links between individual state (e.g. how well-fed
   the individual is) and behaviour can maintain such between-individual
   differences even on an evolutionarily timescale. However, whether
   short-term state changes are able to affect animal personality in adults
   is an open question. In a manipulative experiment, we found that the
   amount of food and vitamin D-3 (known to increase physiological quality
   and attractiveness of male Carpetan rock lizards, I. cyreni) affected
   the expression of animal personality and the actual behavioural types of
   reproductive male Carpetan rock lizards. Therefore, we provide evidence
   that short-term environmental variation does induce or suppress animal
   personality, and it also affects individual behaviour.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Invasive species must respond appropriately to novel habitats as they
   expand their ranges. The degree of habitat novelty is likely to be the
   highest immediately following human-mediated range-expansion, which can
   move an individual very large distances beyond its home range within a
   short space of time. How does translocation affect those critically
   important initial colonists? We collected cane toads (Rhinella marina)
   in eastern Australia in heath and woodland habitats, simulated either
   short-distance or long-distance transport (level of transport stress)
   and then either returned toads to their exact collection point or
   reciprocally translocated them to a novel site. Following release, we
   radio-tracked toads for 5 days and recorded their shelter types and
   microhabitat use daily. We also examined the thermal and hydric
   conditions experienced by toads and tested if prey intake, stomach mass
   and body condition of translocated toads differed from those of resident
   conspecifics. Translocated toads used different types of diurnal
   shelters, were more exposed by day and experienced higher diurnal
   temperatures (but not more desiccating conditions). Analysis of stomach
   contents indicated that translocation per se did not reduce feeding
   rates, nor reduce body condition. However, toads exposed to higher
   transport stress (simulating long-distance displacement) exhibited
   changes to body condition and hydric balance. Shifts in toad shelter
   site use induced by translocation may increase the toads' visibility to
   diurnal predators, thereby reducing toad survival but also exacerbating
   the ecological impact of toads during the initial phase of
   post-translocation dispersal.
   Significance statement
   Each stage of the invasion process poses unique challenges for invading
   taxa, and very few species possess the full suite of behavioural,
   physiological or morphological traits required to pass through all
   stages of the invasion pathway. Although the study of invasion biology
   has grown exponentially, most research has focused on the determinants
   of invasion success during the later stages of establishment and spread,
   neglecting the earlier stages of transport and introduction.
   Understanding how species respond to all stages of the invasion process
   can clarify the non-random traits that allow certain species to become
   successful invaders.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Paternal care is less common than maternal care because male fitness
   usually depends on the number of mating opportunities with distinct
   females. Yet, males also invest in parental care when offspring survival
   depends on paternal contribution for protection and/or brood nutrition
   and mating opportunities with new females are scarce. Although the
   second condition is common in spiders, male contribution to the survival
   of spiderlings is very rare. However, males of Manogea porracea build
   their webs above female webs, where they capture prey throughout the
   reproductive period. In addition, both sexes may have contact with
   eggsacs and attack predators that approach them. This unusual extended
   period of co-occurrence between males and their offspring may favour the
   establishment of paternal care. Here, we investigated (1) the mortality
   factors influencing offspring survival, (2) how the presence of parents
   affects offspring survival, (3) how males affect web integrity and
   protect eggs against predation and (4) variations in operational sex
   ratio (OSR) during the reproductive season, along with the proportion of
   eggsacs in webs occupied by males alone before the dispersal of
   spiderlings. We found that (1) four kleptoparasitic/araneophagic spider
   species invaded webs and attacked eggsacs, (2) parental care
   significantly improved offspring survival, (3) males maintained web
   integrity and protected offspring against the attacks of two
   araneophagic species and (4) the OSR became quickly biased towards
   males, and that these remaining males assumed exclusive care of 68\% of
   the eggsacs produced during the season. The ability of males to protect
   the offspring and the reduced availability of receptive females at the
   end of the reproductive season might represent the possible causes of
   male care in M. porracea. We propose that web building by males and
   their rapid access to the eggsacs create unique conditions that may
   favour the evolution of paternal care in Cyrtophorinae. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Prey animals must balance antipredatory behaviour with foraging
   behaviour. According to the risk allocation hypothesis, prey increase
   antipredatory behaviour and reduce foraging activity during pulses of
   high risk, but with continuous risk, other activities must continue and
   antipredatory behaviour decreases despite the risk. We studied the
   impact of lynx presence on the vigilance behaviour of wild roe deer
   under conditions of (i) a pulsed elevated risk by experimentally
   spreading lynx urine as an olfactory cue, and (ii) continuous risk by
   comparing an area where lynx was eradicated 160years ago to an area
   where lynx has been re-introduced 30years ago. Roe deer were extremely
   vigilant in response to the predator olfactory cue; however, roe deer
   vigilance did not differ measurably among areas with or without
   potential lynx presence. Deer were more vigilant before sunset than
   during the night at both study areas, probably due to long-term
   adaptation of roe deer to human hunting during daytime. Vigilance
   decreased from August to September even though activity of lynx
   increases in autumn, which may be a result either of increased foraging
   due to decrease in food quality in autumn, or of changes in social
   organization of the deer. Our results suggested that the degree of
   vigilance depends on environmental cues. We found that roe deer respond
   to lynx urine despite a long absence of lynx in the ecosystem. Our
   results support the risk allocation hypothesis for responses to pulses

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Solid epidemiological evidence indicates that part of the risk of
   obesity in adulthood could be programmed during prenatal development by
   the quality of maternal nutrition. Nevertheless, the molecular
   mechanisms involved are mostly unknown, which hinders our capacity to
   develop effective intervention policies. Here, we discuss the hypothesis
   that mechanisms underlying prenatal programming of adult risk are
   epigenetic and sensitive to environmental cues such as nutrition. While
   the information encoded in DNA is essentially stable, regulatory
   epigenetic mechanisms include reversible, covalent modifications of DNA
   and chromatin, such as methylation, acetylation etc. It is known that
   dietary availability of methyl donors has an impact on the patterns of
   gene expression by affecting DNA methylation at regulatory regions, a
   likely basis for reprogramming developmental plasticity. The Agouti and
   Axin-Psed genes, as well as the embryonic growth factor IGF2/H19 locus
   are examples of diet-induced modulation of phenotypic traits by
   affecting methylation of gene-regulatory regions. Recent work has
   evidenced an unsuspected role for chromatin as metabolic sensor.
   Chromatin is susceptible to a number of post-translational modifications
   that modulate gene expression, among them the GIcNAcylation of histone
   proteins and other epigenetic regulators. Intracellular levels of the
   precursor molecule UDP-GIcNAc, and hence the degree of global chromatin
   GIcNAcylation, depend on the energetic state of the cell, making
   GIcNAcylation a functional link between nutrition and regulation of gene
   expression. Dietary interference with these regulatory mechanisms could
   effectively counteract the early-life programming of adult risk. (C)

Abstract = {{Movement of organisms is an important activity that has ecological and
   evolutionary implications, including individual reproductive success and

   dispersal and measured relative to home ranges. This simplistic approach
   belies the complexity of the process. Movement of freshwater stream fish
   has been at times viewed as predominantly restricted in nature, but
   recent research challenges this paradigm since some distribution of
   movement exists in every population. A better research approach is to
   understand the drivers that promote or limit movement. Drivers of
   movement can be categorized as extrinsic ecological factors (context
   dependent), e.g., habitat quality, habitat variability, and the presence
   of predators, and intrinsic traits of the fish (condition dependent),
   such as body size and condition. One intrinsic trait that has received
   relatively little attention is the inherent personality to be sedentary
   or mobile, and how this interacts with the suite of traits and behaviors
   to drive movement. Future movement behavior research should focus on the
   interaction of extrinsic and intrinsic drivers to better understand the

Abstract = {{Behavioral plasticity is a key feature allowing animals to broaden their
   dietary niche when novel food resources become available, and
   long-fingered bats provide an appropriate model system to study the
   underpinnings of behavioral plasticity, since although generally being
   an insectivorous species, some individuals have been reported to catch
   fish. Aiming to get insight into the origin of fishing behavior in
   long-fingered bats, we studied in the field the differences in sensorial
   and mechanical reactions to insect-like (stationary) and fish-like
   (temporary) prey stimuli between well-known piscivorous and strictly
   insectivorous individuals. Both piscivorous and insectivorous
   individuals exhibited a qualitatively similar reaction to temporary
   target stimuli (longer and deeper dips and terminal echolocation phase
   skewed towards buzz I compared to stationary stimuli). Nevertheless, the
   quantitative differences observed in the sensorial and mechanical
   features (the intensity of the shift was significantly greater in
   piscivorous than in insectivorous individuals) show that piscivorous
   individuals have honed their capture technique likely enhancing the
   fishing success. Thus, our results suggest that the fishing technique
   was developed from a primary reaction shared by all long-fingered bats.
   All individuals seem to be mechanically and sensorially adapted to
   detect and capture fish, although under appropriate environmental
   conditions, they would further improve their technique by experience

   tested exogenous ketone supplements added to food and fed chronically
   for 83 days in SPD rats and administered sub-chronically for 7 days in
   both rat models by daily intragastric gavage bolus followed by
   assessment of anxiety measures on elevated plus maze (EPM). The groups
   included standard diet (SD) or SD + ketone supplementation. Low-dose
   ketone ester (LKE: 1,3butanediol-acetoacetate diester, similar to 10
   g/kg/day, LKE), high dose ketone ester (HKE; 25 g/kg/day, HKE),
   beta-hydroxybutyrate-mineral salt (beta HB-S; 25 g/kg/day, KS) and beta
   HB-S + medium chain triglyceride (MCI similar to 25 g/kg/day, KSMCT)

   sub-chronically on SPD rats (KE, KS and KSMCT; 5 g/kg/day) and on
   WAG/Rij rats (KE, KS and KSMCT; 2.5 g/kg/day). At the end of treatments
   behavioral data collection was conducted manually by a blinded observer
   and with a video-tracking system, after which blood beta HB and glucose
   levels were measured. Ketone supplementation reduced anxiety on EPM as
   measured by less entries to closed arms (sub-chronic KE and KS: SPD rats
   and KSMCT: WAG/Rij rats), more time spent in open arms (sub-chronic KE:
   SPD and KSMCT: WAG/Rij rats; chronic KSMCT: SPD rats), more distance
   traveled in open arms (chronic KS and KSMCT: SPD rats) and by delayed
   latency to entrance to closed arms (chronic KSMCT: SPD rats), when
   compared to control. Our data indicates that chronic and sub-chronic
   ketone supplementation not only elevated blood beta HB levels in both
   animal models, but reduced anxiety-related behavior. We conclude that
   ketone supplementation may represent a promising anxiolytic strategy
   through a novel means of inducing nutritional ketosis.}},

Title = {{Applying neurobiology to the treatment of adults with anorexia nervosa}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Anorexia nervosa is a severe, biologically based brain
   disorder with significant medical complications. It is critical that
   new, effective treatments are developed to interrupt the persistent
   course of the illness due to the medical and psychological sequelae.
   Several psychosocial, behavioral and pharmacologic interventions have
   been investigated in adult anorexia nervosa; however, evidence shows
   that their impact is weak and treatment effects are generally small.
   Method: This paper describes a new neurobiological anorexia nervosa
   model that shifts focus from solely external influences, such as social
   and family, to include internal influences that integrate genetic and
   neurobiological contributions, across the age span. The model serves as
   a theoretical structure for a new, five-day treatment, outlined in this
   paper, targeting anorexia nervosa temperament, which integrates
   neurobiological dimensions into evidence-based treatment interventions.
   The treatment is in two phases. Phase I is a five day, 40 hour treatment
   for anorexia nervosa adults. Phase II is the follow-up and is currently
   being developed.
   Results: Preliminary qualitative acceptability data on 37 adults with
   anorexia nervosa and 60 supports (e.g., spouses, parents, aunts,
   friends, partners, children of anorexia nervosa adults) are promising
   from Phase I. Clients with anorexia nervosa and their supports report
   that learning neurobiological facts improved their understanding of the
   illness and helped equip them with better tools to manage anorexia
   nervosa traits and symptoms. In addition, nutritional knowledge changed
   significantly.
   Conclusions: This is the first neurobiologically based, five-day
   treatment for adults with anorexia nervosa and their supports. It is a
   new model that outlines underlying genetic and neurobiological
   contributions to anorexia nervosa that serves as a foundation to treat
   both traits and symptoms. Preliminary qualitative findings are
   promising, with both clients and supports reporting that the
   neurobiological treatment approach helped them better understand the
   illness, while better conceptualizing how to respond to their traits and
   manage their symptoms. Data in Phase I shows promise as a
   neurobiologically based intervention for anorexia nervosa, and it serves
   as a foundation for the development of Phase II. Evidence of ongoing
   program efficacy will be described as data are reported on Phase II.}},

   the morphological traits of snails influence their risk of predation by
   crayfish, inferred by crush resistance, and how those same traits also
   influence their patch use in the absence and presence of predator cues.
   Using model selection, we found that a large shell width increased crush
   resistance. We also found that other morphological traits interacted
   with predator cues to influence the use of high resource patches,
   however shell width had almost no influence. Aperture length and
   aperture width both strongly interacted with cue: larger aperture length
   and larger aperture width snails decreased their use of the high
   resource patch substantially. Additionally we used a composite model to
   test whether estimated crush resistance, predator cue, or their
   interaction best predicted space use, and found no support that our
   estimate for crush resistance affected space use. Generally we found
   strong support that morphology effects crush resistance and also that
   morphology influences snail space use. However, crush resistance and
   space use are influenced by very different morphological traits.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives Describe themes characterizing feeding behaviors of
   low-income women participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition
   Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and identify the
   attitudes, beliefs, and sources of information that inform these

   groups and semi-structured individual phone interviews with a total of
   68 low-income women participating in WIC. Qualitative data were
   recorded, transcribed, imported into NVivo 8.0, and analyzed for common
   themes. Results Mothers reported feeding behaviors inconsistent with
   guidance from WIC and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Three main
   themes were identified. First, mothers reported receiving conflicting
   messaging/advice from medical professionals, WIC nutritionists, and
   family members, which was confusing. Mothers also reported
   dissatisfaction with the ``one size fits most'' approach. Lastly,
   mothers reported relying on their ``instincts'' and that ``all babies
   are different'' when deciding and rationalizing what feeding guidance to
   follow. Conclusions Future interventions targeting this high-risk
   population should consider developing personalized (individualized)
   messaging, tailored to the needs of each mother-child dyad. Focused
   efforts are needed to build partnerships between WIC providers and other
   health care providers to provide more consistent messages about
   responsive feeding to prevent early obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Female college students are prone to unhealthy eating patterns that can

   Specifically, the theory of reasoned action, prototype/willingness

   reasoned (logical) and reactive (impulsive) factors relate to dietary
   decisions. Females (N= 583, M-age = 20.89 years) completed measures on
   reasoned cognitions about foods (attitudes, subjective norms, nutrition
   knowledge, intentions to eat foods), reactive cognitions about foods
   (prototypes, affect, willingness to eat foods), dieting, and food
   consumption. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed the new
   reasoned/reactive model to be the preeminent model for examining eating
   behaviors. This model showed that attitudes were related to intentions
   and willingness to eat healthy and unhealthy foods. Affect was related
   to willingness to eat healthy and unhealthy foods, whereas nutrition
   knowledge was related to intentions and willingness to eat healthy foods
   only. Intentions and willingness were related to healthy and unhealthy

Abstract = {{Antipredator responses often involve changes in several phenotypic
   traits and these changes interactively influence fitness. However,
   gaining insight into how the overall fitness effect of the overall
   response comes about is notoriously difficult. One promising avenue is
   to manipulate a single defensive trait and observe how that modifies
   fitness as well as the expression of other inducible responses. In
   chemically-defended animals, toxins are likely to be costly to produce
   but it is still unknown how their depletion influences other
   characteristics. In the present study, we artificially depleted
   bufadienolide toxin stores in common toad (Bufo bufo) tadpoles, and
   assessed the effect of this with respect to the interaction with
   predator presence and limited food availability. We found that toxin
   depletion in tadpoles did not significantly affect any of the measured
   life-history traits. Tadpoles in the predator treatment exhibited an
   elevated development rate, although this was only apparent when food
   availability was limited. Also, body mass at metamorphosis was lower in
   tadpoles exposed to chemical cues indicating a predation threat and when
   food availability was limited. These results provide evidence that, in
   larval common toads, the expression of inducible defences may incur
   fitness costs, whereas chemical defences are either expressed
   constitutively or, if inducible, elevated toxin production has
   negligible costs.}},

   coma recovery in Drosophila melanogaster}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{89-97}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Chill susceptible insects like Drosophila lose the ability to regulate
   water and ion homeostasis at low temperatures. This loss of hemolymph
   ion and water balance drives a hyperkalemic state that depolarizes
   cells, causing cellular injury and death. The ability to maintain ion
   homeostasis at low temperatures and/or recover ion homeostasis upon
   rewarming is closely related to insect cold tolerance. We thus
   hypothesized that changes to organismal ion balance, which can be
   achieved in Drosophila through dietary salt loading, could alter whole
   animal cold tolerance phenotypes. We put Drosophila melanogaster in the
   presence of diets highly enriched in NaCI, ICCI, xylitol (an osmotic
   control) or sucrose (a dietary supplement known to impact cold
   tolerance) for 24 h and confirmed that they consumed the novel food.
   Independently of their osmotic effects, NaCI, KCl, and sucrose
   supplementation all improved the ability of flies to maintain K+ balance
   in the cold, which allowed for faster recovery from chill coma after 6 h
   at 0 degrees C. These supplements, however, also slightly increased the
   CTmin and had little impact on survival rates following chronic cold
   stress (24 h at 0 degrees C), suggesting that the effect of diet on cold
   tolerance depends on the measure of cold tolerance assessed. In contrast
   to prolonged salt stress, brief feeding (1.5 h) on diets high in salt
   slowed coma recovery, suggesting that the long-term effects of NaCI and
   KC1 on chilling tolerance result from phenotypic plasticity, induced in
   response to a salty diet, rather than simply the presence of the diet in
   the gut lumen. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Animals generally adjust their behavior in response to bodily state
   (e.g., size and energy reserves) to optimize energy intake in relation
   to mortality risk, weighing predation probability against the risk of
   starvation. Here, we investigated whether brown trout Salmo trutta
   adjust their behavior in relation to energetic status and body size
   during a major early-life selection bottleneck, when fast growth is
   important. Over two consecutive time periods (P1 and P2; 12 and 23 days,
   respectively), food availability was manipulated, using four different
   combinations of high (H) and low (L) rations (i.e., HH, HL, LH, and LL;
   first and second letter denoting ration during P1 and P2, respectively).
   Social effects were excluded through individual isolation. Following the
   treatment periods, fish in the HL treatment were on average 15-21 \%
   more active than the other groups in a forced open-field test, but large
   within-treatment variation provided only weak statistical support for
   this effect. Furthermore, fish on L-ration during P2 tended to be more
   actively aggressive towards their mirror image than fish on H-ration.
   Body size was related to behavioral expression, with larger fish being
   more active and aggressive. Swimming activity and active aggression were
   positively correlated, forming a behavioral syndrome in the studied
   population. Based on these behavioral traits, we could also distinguish
   two behavioral clusters: one consisting of more active and aggressive
   individuals and the other consisting of less active and aggressive
   individuals. This indicates that brown trout fry adopt distinct
   behavioral strategies early in life.
   This paper provides information on the state-dependence of behavior in
   animals, in particular young brown trout. On the one hand, our data
   suggest a weak energetic state feedback where activity and aggression is
   increased as a response to short term food restriction. This suggests a
   limited scope for behavioral alterations in the face of starvation. On
   the other hand, body size is linked to higher activity and aggression,
   likely as a positive feedback between size and dominance.
   The experiment was carried out during the main population survival
   bottleneck, and the results indicate that growth is important during
   this stage, as 1) behavioral compensation to increase growth is limited,
   and 2) growth likely increases the competitive ability. However, our
   data also suggests that the population separates into two clusters,
   based on combined scores of activity and aggression (which are
   positively linked within individuals). Thus, apart from an active and
   aggressive strategy, there seems to be another more passive behavioral
   strategy.}},

   Control Linked to Dietary Adherence in Hemodialysis Patients}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) often require regular
   hemodialysis (HD) to prolong life. However, between HD sessions,
   patients have to restrict their diets carefully to avoid excess
   accumulation of potassium, phosphate, sodium, and fluid, which their
   diseased kidneys can no longer regulate. Failure to adhere to their
   renal dietary regimes can be fatal; nevertheless, non-adherence is
   common, and yet little is known about the psychological variables that
   might predict this dietary behavior. Thus, this study aimed to assess
   whether dietary adherence might be affected by a variety of
   psychological factors including stress, personality, and health locus of
   control, as well as dietary knowledge, in chronic HD patients. Fifty-one
   patients (30 men; age range 25-85) who had undergone HD for at least 3
   months and had been asked to restrict at least one of potassium,
   phosphate or fluid, were recruited from a hospital renal unit. Measures
   of adherence to each of potassium, phosphate, and fluid were derived
   from standard criteria for these physiological indices in renal
   patients. Knowledge of food/drink sources of these dietary factors, and
   their medical implications in relation to HD and CKD were assessed by a
   bespoke questionnaire. Psychological factors including stress,
   personality and health locus of control beliefs were measured by
   standardized questionnaires. Having to restrict a particular nutrient
   was associated with better knowledge of both food sources and medical
   complications for that nutrient; however, greater dietary knowledge was
   not linked to adherence, and knowledge of medical complications tended
   to be associated with poorer adherence to potassium and phosphate
   levels. Adherence to these two nutrient requirements was also associated
   with lower reported stress in the past week. Adherence was associated
   with differences in locus of control: these differences varied across
   indices although there was a tendency to believe in external loci. For
   potassium, phosphate, and fluid restriction, adherers were less likely
   to be sensation seekers but did not differ from non-adherers on
   impulsivity, anxiety sensitivity, or hopelessness. In conclusion, the
   links between dietary adherence and stress, locus of control and
   personality suggests that screening for such psychological factors may
   assist in managing adherence in HD patients.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Scatter-hoarding rodents can act as both predators and dispersers for
   many large-seeded plants because they cache seeds for future use, but
   occasionally forget them in sites with high survival and establishment
   probabilities. The most important fruit or seed trait influencing rodent
   foraging behavior is seed size; rodents prefer large seeds because they
   have higher nutritional content, but this preference can be
   counterbalanced by the higher costs of handling larger seeds. We
   designed a cafeteria experiment to assess whether fruit and seed size of
   Myrcianthes coquimbensis, an endangered desert shrub, influence the
   decision-making process during foraging by three species of
   scatter-hoarding rodents differing in body size: Abrothrix olivaceus,
   Phyllotis darwini and Octodon degus. We found that the size of fruits
   and seeds influenced foraging behavior in the three rodent species; the
   probability of a fruit being harvested and hoarded was higher for larger
   fruits than for smaller ones. Patterns of fruit size preference were not
   affected by rodent size; all species were able to hoard fruits within
   the entire range of sizes offered. Finally, fruit and seed size had no
   effect on the probability of seed predation, rodents typically ate only
   the fleshy pulp of the fruits offered and discarded whole, intact seeds.
   In conclusion, our results reveal that larger M. coquimbensis fruits
   have higher probabilities of being harvested, and ultimately of its
   seeds being hoarded and dispersed by scatter-hoarding rodents. As this
   plant has no other dispersers, rodents play an important role in its
   recruitment dynamics.}},

   systems leading to cardiometabolic diseases. This phenomenon can be
   understood in the context of the phenotypic plasticity and refers to the
   adjustment of a phenotype in response to environmental input without
   genetic change, following a novel, or unusual input during development.
   Experimental studies indicate that fetal exposure to an adverse maternal
   environment may alter the morphology and physiology that contribute to
   the development of cardiometabolic diseases. It has been shown that both
   maternal protein restriction and overnutrition alter the central and
   peripheral control of arterial pressure and metabolism. This review will
   address the new concepts on the maternal diet induced-cardiometabolic
   diseases that include the potential role of the perinatal malnutrition.}},

Title = {{General Habit Propensity Relates to the Sensation Seeking Subdomain of
   Impulsivity But Not Obesity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{According to dual-system theory, instrumental learning and performance
   depend on the balance between goal-directed and habitual action control.
   Overreliance on habits has been argued to characterize clinical
   conditions such as drug addiction or obsessive-compulsive disorder as
   well as obesity and excessive impulsivity. A tendency toward habitual
   action control in obesity has already been indicated in the food domain.
   However, impairments might not be restricted to eating behavior. This
   has been suggested by domain-general obesity-associated disturbances in
   executive function as well as alterations in corticostriatal circuits
   underlying the goal-directed and habitual systems. In this study we
   examined the balance of goal-directed and habitual action control in a
   sample of normal-weight, overweight, and obese participants (n = 105)
   using the slips-of-action test in a non-food context. We tested for
   continuous or group-based associations between body weight status (BMI)
   and the devaluation sensitivity index (DSI), a parameter representing
   the balance of the goal-directed and habitual systems in action control.
   As personality differences in the domain of impulsivity might affect
   this relationship, we also examined whether the interaction between BMI
   and self-reported impulsivity, based on the UPPS Impulsive Behavior
   Scale, was related to the DSI. In addition to that, we tested for
   direct, i.e., weight status independent, relationships between UPPS
   subdomains of impulsivity and the DSI. We failed to find evidence for a
   relationship between weight status and sensitivity to devaluation as
   indexed by the DSI. However, independent of weight status, we observed
   lower sensitivity to devaluation in sensation seekers, a subtype of
   impulsivity. To conclude, behavioral flexibility in the sense of
   disturbances in the balance between the habitual and goal-directed
   systems seems to be unaffected by weight status in a non-food context.
   Consequently, stimuli and behavior might not be generally excessively
   linked in overweight or obesity. However, according to ceiling effects
   we cannot rule out subtle effects the paradigm was not able to
   disentangle. Further, future studies are needed to clarify the role of
   specific subtypes of obesity (e.g., food addiction). The indicated habit
   propensity in sensation seekers may account for previous reports of weak
   avoidance behavior and risky decision making.}},

Title = {{Contexts Paired with Junk Food Impair Goal-Directed Behavior in Rats:
   Implications for Decision Making in Obesogenic Environments}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{The high prevalence of obesity and related metabolic diseases calls for
   greater understanding of the factors that drive excess energy intake.
   Calorie-dense palatable foods are readily available and often are paired
   with highly salient environmental cues. These cues can trigger
   food-seeking and consumption in the absence of hunger. Here we examined
   the effects of palatable food-paired environmental cues on control of
   instrumental food-seeking behavior. In Experiment 1, adult male rats
   received exposures to one context containing three ``junk{''} foods (JFs
   context) and another containing chow (Chow context). Next, rats were
   food-deprived and trained to perform instrumental responses
   (lever-press) for two novel food rewards in a third, distinct context.
   Contextual influences on flexible control of food-seeking behavior were
   then assessed by outcome devaluation tests held in the JF, chow and
   training contexts. Devaluation was achieved using specific satiety and
   test order was counterbalanced. Rats exhibited goal-directed control
   over behavior when tested in the training and chow-paired contexts.
   Notably, performance was habitual (insensitive to devaluation) when
   tested in the JF context. In Experiment 2 we tested whether the
   impairment found in the JF context could be ameliorated by the
   presentation of a discrete auditory cue paired with the chow context,
   relative to a second cue paired with the JF context. Consistent with the
   results of Experiment 1, the devaluation effect was not significant when
   rats were tested in the JF context with the JF cue. However, presenting
   the chow cue increased the impact of the devaluation treatment leading
   to a robust devaluation effect. Further tests confirmed that performance
   in the chow context was goal-directed and that sensory-specific satiety
   in the JF context was intact. These results show that environments
   paired with palatable foods can impair goal-directed control over
   food-seeking behavior, but that this deficit was improved by a cue
   paired with chow. This has promising implications for assisting
   individuals in controlling their eating behavior in environments
   designed to dysregulate it.}},

Title = {{A personality trait contributes to the occurrence of postoperative
   delirium: a prospective study}},
Journal = {{BMC PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although various physical risk factors for delirium have
   been identified, the effect of psychological aspects is currently
   unknown. This study aimed to examine psychological risk factors for
   postoperative delirium and to identify hidden subgroups of delirium in
   clinical and psychological feature space.
   Methods: Among 200 patients with hip fracture, 78 elderly patients were
   prospectively evaluated for clinical and psychological assessments
   before surgery. As delirium was assessed from the next day to the 7th
   day after surgery, postoperative delirium was found in 40 patients, but
   not in 38 patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression
   analyses were used to explore risk factors for postoperative delirium.
   Phenotypic subgroups of delirium were assessed using Topological Data
   Analysis, in which the significant risk factors were used for evaluating
   filter and distance metrics.
   Results: Mini-Mental State Examination, neuroticism, conscientiousness,
   and regional anesthesia were identified as a predictive risk factor for
   postoperative delirium. The filter metric showed significant negative
   correlations with nutrition-related factors such as total protein and
   albumin. When filter metric and Euclidean distances were entered,
   delirious patients were bifurcated as a function of personality traits
   and anesthesia method in the patient-patient network.
   Conclusions: A personality trait of neuroticism and conscientiousness
   may predispose elderly patients to postoperative delirium and this
   influence may be amplified by regional anesthesia. This study verifies
   the contribution of psychological risk factors to delirium and provides
   new insight for complex etiologies of delirium by mapping various
   clinical variables in the topological space.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Nutrition behaviors of adolescent girls is of serious health concerns.
   Although nutrition education interventions in Iran have met with some
   success, most of them could not promote nutrition behavioral changes.
   The aim of our study is to determine a school-based nutrition education
   intervention to improve adolescents' nutrition behaviors and behavioral
   mediators based on the social cognitive theory (SCT).
   Materials and Methods
   This study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. Eligible
   participants will be all student girls in grade 6 and 7, their parents
   and teachers in Isfahan governmental schools. This multi component
   school-based intervention include adolescents' nutrition education
   package, parents' nutrition massages, participatory homework, parents
   and teachers nutrition education package, supportive group, and
   collaboration with decision makers. Changing in nutrition behaviors
   including breakfast, fruit and vegetable, snack and fast food
   consumption will be examined, as primary outcome. Secondary outcome will
   be behavioral mediators such as knowledge, self-efficacy, intention,
   situation, self-regulation, social support, outcome expectations and
   expectancies, in adolescent girls. The outcomes will be assessed at
   baseline, and after 3 and 6-month follow-up.
   Discussion
   This study evaluates a school-based, guided SCT intervention, designed
   to improve healthy dietary behaviors, nutrition knowledge of adolescent
   girls. Few behavioral interventions have targeted this high-risk
   population in Iran. The intervention seems to be promising and has the
   potential to bridge the gap of the limited program outcomes of nutrition
   education in Iranian adolescents.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Increasing competitive ability of individuals can create a
   Tragedy of the Commons ending in extinction. Theory has not yet
   evaluated what role adaptive habitat selection might play in the tragedy
   and its outcome.
   Methods: We used modified Ricker population models to simulate the
   long-term population dynamics emerging from a pure strategy of despotic
   habitat choice versus a mixed strategy of despotic and ideal-free
   habitat selection. Density in the better of two habitats was reduced by
   the threat of dominance in the pure strategy. Habitat selection switched
   to an ideal-free distribution at low densities in the mixed strategy. We
   used patterns of density and dispersal, giving-up densities,
   personalities and condition of meadow voles to search for the predicted
   switch in habitat selection.
   Results: Extinction probabilities in simulated stochastic environments
   were always higher for pure than for mixed strategies. Experiments on
   meadow voles were only partially consistent with a density-dependent
   transition from ideal-free to despotic habitat selection. Densities and
   giving-up densities of voles in adjacent habitats were nearly identical
   when resources were equal and population size was small. Giving-up
   densities diverged dramatically when supplemental food was added to one
   habitat and not to the other. Despite biased dispersal from high-to
   low-quality habitat, there was no associated difference in population
   density, personality or body condition.
   Conclusions: Pure habitat selection based on dominance places
   populations at greater risk of extinction than does a mixed strategy in
   which dominance disappears at low population sizes. Experiments on
   meadow voles yielded limited but nevertheless tantalizing support for
   such a density-dependent switch in habitat selection.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted three studies to examine the relationship between spicy

   task indicated that people were more inclined to attribute a higher
   level of risk seeking to individuals who enjoy spicy foods. The second
   study examined whether people who like spicy foods are actually more
   risk seeking. In fact, people who reported a preference for spicy tastes
   scored higher on risk taking, as assessed via the Domain-Specific
   Risk-Taking Scale (Chinese version). Finally, Study 3 employed an
   experimental design to manipulate risk-seeking tendencies by having
   participants experience spicy food tastes in the lab. Momentarily
   savoring spicy foods increased participants' risk taking in the Iowa
   Gambling Task. The present findings suggest that preferences for spicy
