abstract={This study demonstrates that working as a manager in the National Health Service (NHS) can create strain and lead to poor mental health and reduced wellbeing which has considerable implications for the economic and productivity costs to the NHS. The study also demonstrates that three main sets of variables - environmental, social and personality centred - jointly influence the experience of work stress for the managers. A Core Conceptual Category found is the 'fit manager'. The study reveals that the most psychologically fit managers are those who cope with stress using a combination of male and female, rather stereotype attitudes and behaviours, including pragmatism, assertiveness, control, awareness, reciprocal relationships, support, communication, listening, balancing work/home life and a body/mind, health/nutrition/exercise practical and attentional focus. The 'unfit manager' lacks balance, particularly between work and home life. They may be over-involved, over-committed, over-worked and under-aware of the psycho-physiological consequences of workplace strain. However, they may be confident and have self-efficacy but do not set boundaries on workload and hours of work.},

abstract={Objective: Vertigo is one of the most frequent complaints in general medical practice and is often linked to psychiatric disorders. A longitudinal study of 67 patients with an acute vestibular disorder was undertaken to clarify if, after experiencing acute vestibular vertigo, certain patients have a higher likelihood of developing chronic, debilitating dizziness despite no evidence of a damaged peripheral vestibular system. Method: The severity of dizziness was determined in 67 patients with vestibular neuronitis, 6 months after their release from hospital, using the Vertigo Symptom Scale from Yardley et al. The intensity of anxiety directly after vertigo was experienced, body-related cognitions, illness coping, personality structure, and the recovery of the organ of equilibrium were recorded in order to explain the severity of vertigo that occurred after 6 months. The function of the organ of equilibrium was assessed by using a caloric test. Results: Over a period of 6 months, 13 of the 67 patients (19.4%) reported continuing dizziness after neuropathia vestibularis. Eleven of the 13 patients showed high scores on a scale for measuring vertigo-related symptoms, which can be interpreted as being equivalent to anxiety. The variables of gender, catastrophic thoughts and a dependent personality accounted for 35% of why vertigo became chronic. Conclusion: Neuropathia vestibularis represents a risk factor for the development of chronic vertigo. Chronic vertigo after neuropathia vestibularis appears to be equivalent to anxiety and is partly conditional on catastrophic thoughts at the beginning.},

abstract={Objective: To examine mother and child's touch patterns in infant feeding disorders within a transactional framework. Method: Infants (aged 9-34 months) referred to a community-based clinic were diagnosed with feeding disorders (n = 20) or other primary disorder (n = 27) and were case matched with nonreferred controls (n = 47). Mother-child play and feeding were observed and the home environment was assessed. Microcoding detected touch patterns, response to partner's touch, and proximity at play. Relational behaviors were coded during feeding. Results: Compared with infants with other primary disorder and case-matched controls, less maternal affectionate, proprioceptive, and unintentional touch was observed in those with feeding disorders. Children with feeding disorders displayed less affectionate touch, more negative touch, and more rejection of the mother's touch. More practical and rejecting maternal responses to the child's touch were observed, and children were positioned more often out of reach of the mothers' arms. Children with feeding disorders exhibited more withdrawal during feeding and the home environment was less optimal. Feeding efficacy was predicted by mother-child touch, reduced maternal depression and intrusiveness, easy infant temperament, and less child withdrawal, controlling for group membership. Conclusions: Proximity and touch are especially disturbed in feeding disorders, suggesting fundamental relationship difficulties. Mothers provide less touch that supports growth, and children demonstrate signs of touch aversion. Touch patterns may serve as risk indicators of potential growth failure.},

abstract={1. Agricultural developments over recent decades have had significant negative effects on wildlife. Modern European agriculture faces many further developments in technology, finances and climate. A framework for predicting the consequences of these developments and for informing management that mitigates previous depredation of wildlife is essential. 2. Field trials, monitoring and experimental approaches are all invaluable tools for predicting the consequences of proposed agricultural practices. However, such trials are time-consuming and expensive, with limited spatial and temporal scope. Increasingly, it is recognized that predictive modelling using computer simulations is essential for assessing the likely impacts of novel management practices. 3. Many agricultural developments are likely to have impacts on the availability of food for farmland wildlife. In this paper, we review modelling techniques that are available for predicting the consequences of changing food supplies for farmland birds, a group already shown to be sensitive to agricultural management. 4. We focus on two broad types of simulation modelling: phenomenological approaches (using aggregative responses or full population models), and behavioural depletion models (including daily ration and functional response approaches). We assess the strengths and weaknesses of each, particularly with regard to available data. 5. We conclude that given the constraints on current information, daily ration models probably represent the most useful form of simulation modelling for farmland birds. Few phenomenological population models link demography explicitly to food supply and collecting data on these links should be a priority of autecological studies. More empirical data on aggregative and functional responses is needed to identify the generality of these functions, and to confront uncertainties in their use. 6. Synthesis and applications. Modelling techniques available for predicting the consequences of changing food supply for farmland birds have largely outstripped the availability of data required to parameterize them. We recommend the best available techniques given current constraints on data. Predictive models of biodiversity response should be more widely used when considering proposals for agricultural developments or agri-environment schemes. Models will provide a basis for selecting between competing proposals, whilst their widespread usage will both permit more frequent model validation and aid in model development.},

abstract={Trading food for safety is more apparent in animals offshore than elsewhere, because distinct gradients in underwater illumination permit a clear distinction between habitat profitability in regard to the 2 components which determine an individual's fitness: its ability to survive by avoiding the risks of predation, and its ability to assimilate enough resources for fast growth to maturation and high reproductive effort. Day-to-day life history and hour-to-hour behavioral decisions have to be made under the constant risk of predation and the never-ending hazard of starvation; each subsequent decision is made after the magnitudes of both risks have been assessed. The magnitudes are related to the vertical gradient of light intensity, and its shift with the change in incipient radiation in the course of the day. An animal's instantaneous decisions concern the depth it selects and the intensity of its feeding activity, both of which are factors important to safety and food assimilation. In zooplankton, they are mediated by long-term life history decisions on age and body size at maturation and on number and size of the offspring. In fishes, they are mediated by ontogenetic shifts in diet and by changes in the timetable of habitat use. The subordination of behavioral and life history traits to the vertical gradient of environmental factors relevant to individual fitness is more apparent in planktonic animals than in fishes. The nektonic way of life resulting from the more powerful locomotion of large bodies greatly increases the ability of fishes to explore resources and safety on a horizontal plane. Horizontal heterogeneity, albeit negligible in offshore habitats, is more apparent in the patchy distribution of fishes than in that of zooplankton; to join a shoal or school is adaptive in fishes because of increased safety, while aggregating is maladaptive in zooplankton since zooplankton swarms are highly profitable patches of prey to optimally foraging fishes.},

These include amines, acetylcholine, purines, GABA and glutamate, as well as nutritional-metabolic, circadian-photic, immunological and neuroendocrine-peptidergic influences. Basic and clinical evaluation of drugs interfering with the orexin system will lead to a better understanding of the molecular prerequisites that control behavioral state, stress responses, energy homeostasis and survival, and yield therapeutic advances for the treatment of narcolepsy and other disorders of sleep, eating, mood and memory. ¬© 2003 Prous Science.

abstract={Oxidative stress has been implicated in mechanisms leading to neuronal cell injury in various pathological states of the brain. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive disorder with cognitive and memory decline, speech loss, personality changes and synapse loss. Many approaches have been undertaken to understand AD, but the heterogeneity of the etiologic factors makes it difficult to define the clinically most important factor determining the onset and progression of the disease. However, increasing evidence indicates that factors such as oxidative stress and disturbed protein metabolism and their interaction in a vicious cycle are central to AD pathogenesis. Brains of AD patients undergo many changes, such as disruption of protein synthesis and degradation, classically associated with the heat shock response, which is one form of stress response. Heat shock proteins are proteins serving as molecular chaperones involved in the protection of cells from various forms of stress. Recently, the involvement of the heme oxygenase (HO) pathway in antidegenerative mechanisms operating in AD has received considerable attention, as it has been demonstrated that the expression of HO is closely related to that of amyloid precursor protein (APP). HO induction occurs together with the induction of other HSPs during various physiopathological conditions. The vasoactive molecule carbon monoxide and the potent antioxidant bilirubin, products of HO-catalyzed reaction, represent a protective system potentially active against brain oxidative injury. Given the broad cytoprotective properties of the heat shock response there is now strong interest in discovering and developing pharmacological agents capable of inducing the heat shock response. Increasing interest has been focused on identifying dietary compounds that can inhibit, retard or reverse the multi-stage pathophysiological events underlying AD pathology. Alzheimer's disease, in fact, involves a chronic inflammatory response associated with both brain injury and Œ≤-amyloid associated pathology. All of the above evidence suggests that stimulation of various repair pathways by mild stress has significant effects on delaying the onset of various age-associated alterations in cells, tissues and organisms. Spice and herbs contain phenolic substances with potent antioxidative and chemopreventive properties, and it is generally assumed that the phenol moiety is responsible for the antioxidant activity. In particular, curcumin, a powerful antioxidant derived from the curry spice turmeric, has emerged as a strong inducer of the heat shock response. In light of this finding, curcumin supplementation has been recently considered as an alternative, nutritional approach to reduce oxidative damage and amyloid pathology associated with AD. Here we review the importance of the heme oxygenase pathway in brain stress tolerance and its significance as an antidegenerative mechanism potentially important in AD pathogenesis. These findings have offered new perspectives in medicine and pharmacology, as molecules inducing this defense mechanism appear to be possible candidates for novel cytoprotective strategies. In particular, manipulation of endogenous cellular defense mechanisms such as the heat shock response, through nutritional antioxidants or pharmacological compounds, represents an innovative approach to therapeutic intervention in diseases causing tissue damage, such as neurodegeneration. Consistent with this notion, maintenance or recovery of the activity of vitagenes, such as the HO gene, conceivably may delay the aging process and decrease the occurrence of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract={Background: Adolescence is a decisive period in human life due to the multiple physiological and psychological changes that take place. These changes will condition both nutritional requirements and eating/physical activity behavior. It has been demonstrated that these "adolescence" factors are of significant influence in health status during adult life. Due to its importance and adequate development the project has been granted by the Fondo de Investigaci√≥n Sanitaria of the Institute of Health Carlos III. Objective: To develop a methodology to evaluate the health and nutritional status of a representative population of Spanish adolescents. Specific attention is paid to three specific health problems: obesity, anorexia nervosa/ bulimia, dislipidemia. Methodology: The following magnitudes will be studied: 1) dietary intake, food habits and nutrition knowledge; 2) daily physical activity and personal approach; 3) physical condition; 4) anthropometry and body composition; 5) hematobiochemical study: plasma lipid phenotypic and metabolic profile, blood cell counts; 6) genotipic profile of cardiovascular risk lipid factors; 7) immune function profile related to nutritional status; 8) psychological profile. Conclusion: This project includes the co-ordinate activity of five Spanish centers of five different cities (Granada, Madrid, Murcia, Santander, Zaragoza). Each center is specialized in a specific area and will be responsible for the corresponding part of the study. From the data obtained, we will elaborate a specific intervention program in order to improve nutrition and neutralize the risk for nutritional related problems in adolescence. By this, we will contribute to improve the health status of the Spanish population in the new millennium.},

abstract={Neuromedin U (NMU), a hypothalamic peptide, has been known to be involved in feeding behavior as a catabolic signaling molecule. However, little is known about the participation of NMU in the neuronal network. One NMU receptor, NMU2R, is abundantly expressed in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, where corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) is synthesized. The functions of CRH, regulation of stress response and feeding behavior, are comparable with those of NMU. Here, we have investigated the functional relationships between NMU and CRH using CRH knockout (KO) mice. Intracerebroventricular administration of NMU suppressed dark-phase food intake and fasting-induced feeding in wild-type mice. In contrast, these suppressions were not observed in CRH KO mice. NMU-induced increases in oxygen consumption and body temperature were attenuated in CRH KO mice. These results suggest that NMU plays a role in feeding behavior and catabolic functions via CRH. This study demonstrates a novel hypothalamic pathway that links NMU and CRH in the regulation of feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. ¬© 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Parental care should evolve only if fitness benefits exceed fitness costs. In Cheirogaleus medius, a small nocturnal lemur of western Madagascar, we found the peculiar situation of considerable parental care by both sexes, combined with an extremely high rate of extra-pair young (EPY). In this paper, we try to elucidate the costs and benefits of parental care in C. medius, and we discuss hypotheses as to why males might actively participate in raising young, especially with regard to the high rate of EPY. The study was carried out in the dry deciduous forest of western Madagascar between 1996 and 2001. The most important components of parental care in C. medius are babysitting and guarding of the young. Observational data suggest that thermoregulatory demands during the first days after birth and defence from predators may be the driving factors selecting for this infant care behaviour. The reproducing individuals of both sexes incur considerable energetic costs by this behaviour, resulting in reduced fat stores and body condition in comparison to non-reproducing individuals. The reason why males also care for EPY remains elusive. We propose that males might not be able to detect individual relatedness and that they would jeopardise the survival of their own young if they gave no parental care. Alternatively, they might gain advantages other than direct fitness from raising EPY, for example if caring behaviour increases their chances in further reproduction, or if EPY are fathered by close kin.

abstract={Rooting behaviour appears to be an important part of the behavioural repertoire in pigs. It is suggested that it is in fact a behavioural need. The present study investigated whether nose-ringed gilts, which are unable to root, can satisfactorily substitute rooting with other exploratory activities. The behaviour of 24 gilts in groups of three, half of them nose-ringed, was studied on undisturbed days as well as on days of exposure to four different tests: (1) delayed feeding; (2) double feeding; (3) removal to an unknown area; (4) removal to an unknown area supplied with a trough with stones. The gilts' posture and their behaviour were recorded by 1-min scan samplings, whereas pawing, aggression, and comfort behaviour were recorded by all occurrence sampling. Observations took place for 2.5 h in the morning and 2.5 h in the afternoon. On undisturbed days no significant differences were found between ringed and unringed gilts as regards the percentage of scans in which the gilts were active and foraging or exploring. However, the unringed gilts rooted significantly more than the ringed gilts (P < 0.01). The kind of foraging and exploratory behaviours that the ringed gilts chose as substitutes for rooting depended on the replicate in question, maybe due to more or less nutrition in the grass. On an undisturbed day, there was no significant difference as regards the number of times ringed and unringed gilts were observed performing any behaviour that could be considered a sign of frustration. During delayed and double feeding, ringed and unringed gilts reacted similarly. When exposed to an unknown area, ringed gilts increased the levels of alertness and comfort behaviour, which might indicate frustration. We conclude that in a stable environment ringed gilts were able to substitute other exploratory behaviours for rooting in a satisfactory way. However, it was clear that the gilts that were able to root did so for a large part of their active time, indicating that the experience obtained by rooting was rewarding. ¬© 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={In addition to seasonal changes in morphology, physiology and behaviour that occur in predictable annual cycles, there are facultative responses to unpredictable events known as labile (i.e. short-lived) perturbation factors. These rapid behavioural and physiological changes have been termed the 'emergency life-history stage' and serve to enhance lifetime fitness. There are four major components: (1) proactive/reactive coping styles for responding to psychosocial stress, predation, and so forth; (2) fight-or-flight responses to rapid emergencies such as an attack by a predator or sudden severe storm; (3) 'take-it-or-leave-it' behavioural and physiological responses to longer-term perturbations of the physical environment; and (4) sickness behaviour and fever designed to respond to infection. Glucocorticosteroids interact with cytoklnes and with other hormones in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal cascade and in the autonomic nervous system to initiate and orchestrate the emergency life-history stage within minutes to hours. Some traits of the emergency life-history stage include: redirection of behaviour from a normal life-history stage to Increased foraging, irruptive-type migration during the day, enhanced restfulness at night, elevated gluconeogenesis, and recovery once the perturbation passes. These physiological and behavioural changes allow an individual to avoid potential deleterious effects of stress that may result from chronically elevated levels of circulating glucocorticosteroids over days and weeks. Thus, acute rises in glucocorticosteroids following perturbations of the environment may serve primarily as 'antistress' hormones, potentially allowing individuals to avoid chronic stress. Several field studies in diverse habitats indicate that individuals in free-living populations show elevated circulating levels of corticosteroids when they are in an emergency life-history stage. Some simple models based on food availability, body condition, social status and life-history stage, may allow predictions of sensitivity of the hypothalamopituitary-adrenal axis to labile perturbation factors. Although there is now extensive evidence for behavioural components of the emergency life-history stage in birds, there remains much to be learned about how other vertebrate groups, especially fish, cope with perturbations of the environment. Because of the unpredictable nature of these perturbations, systematic study of behavioural responses to them is not possible and investigators need to be 'opportunistic'. There is also a growing need to expand our knowledge of these phenomena because human disturbance, global climate change and pollution are all major perturbations of the environment. How vertebrates respond to the unpredictable in general will thus have important conservation value for the future. ¬© 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={In response to increased exposure to predators when searching for food, many prey increase the frequency of antipredator behaviors, potentially reducing foraging rate and food intake. Such direct, nonlethal interactions between predators and prey resulting in reduced food intake can indirectly influence lifecycle development through effects on growth, developmental rate, and survival. We investigated the general hypothesis that individual performance of a herbivorous insect can be negatively affected when exposed to nonlethal predation risk, and that the response can be mediated by food quality. This hypothesis was tested using the common rangeland grasshopper Ageneotettix deorum with and without exposure to common wolf spider predators (Lycosidae, Schizocosa spp.) on both untreated natural and fertilized vegetation. All spiders were rendered temporarily incapable of direct feeding by restricting function of the chelicerae with beeswax. Detectable responses by grasshoppers to spiders indicate indirect consequences for lifecycle development. Grasshopper performance was measured as hind femur growth, duration of nymphal lifecycle stages, and survivorship in a caged field experiment conducted over 2 years. Grasshoppers developed faster and grew 3-5% larger when allowed to forage on fertilized vegetation in the absence of risk from a spider predator. Failure-time analysis illustrated enhanced survival probability in response to elevated food quality and the negative effects of grasshopper susceptibility to nonlethal predation risk. Performance on food of relatively low, ambient quality with no predation risk equaled that of grasshoppers caged with high quality vegetation in the presence of a modified spider. Increased resource quality can clearly moderate the negative life history responses caused by the behavioral modification of grasshoppers when exposed to spider predation risk, a compensatory response.},

abstract={The ability to discriminate between more dangerous and less dangerous predators can have serious fitness advantages for fish juveniles. This is especially true for hatchery-reared fish young used for stocking, because their post-release mortality is often much higher than that of wild-born conspecifics. We tested whether two coexisting fish predators and their different diets induce innate behavioral responses in predator-naive Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) young originating from an endangered hatchery-bred population used for reintroductions. We predicted the antipredator responses of charr to be stronger towards chemical cues of brown trout (Salmo trutta) and pikeperch (Stizostedion lucioperca) than towards odorless control water. More pronounced antipredator behavior was predicted in treatments with predators fed on charr than when their diet consisted of another sympatric salmonid, European grayling (Thymallus thymallus), or when they were food-deprived. The Arctic charr young showed strong antipredator responses in all brown trout treatments, whereas odors of the less likely predator pikeperch were avoided with conspecific diet only. Freezing was the most sensitive antipredator behavior, as it was completely absent in control treatments. We found considerable individual variation in the amount and strength of antipredator responses. Although almost half of the charr failed to show antipredator behavior towards the piscivores, those with the innate ability showed highly sensitive recognition of predator odors. Our results indicate that the innate antipredator behavior of the juvenile fish is already finely tuned to respond specifically to chemical cues from different fish predators and even their diets.},

abstract={The beneficial effect of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on developing hypertension has been repeatedly demonstrated. However, related changes in brain membrane composition and its cognitive correlates have remained unclear. Our study aimed at a comprehensive analysis of behavior and cerebral fatty acid concentration in hypertension after long-term PUFA-rich dietary treatment. Hypertensive and normotensive rats were provided a placebo, or one of two PUFA-enriched diets with a reduced (n-6)/(n-3) ratio for 75 weeks. Exploratory behavior and spatial learning capacity were tested. Systolic blood pressure (BP) was repeatedly measured. Finally, brain fatty acid composition was analyzed by gas chromatography. Hypertensive rats exhibited more active exploration but impaired spatial learning compared to normotensives. Both diets reduced BP, increased PUFA and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) concentration, and reduced saturated fatty acid content in brain. The level of cerebral PUFAs and MUFAs was lower in hypertensive than in normotensive rats. Furthermore, BP positively, while spatial learning negatively correlated with cerebral (n-6)/(n-3) PUFA ratio. We concluded that regular n-3 PUFA consumption could prevent the development of hypertension, but reached only a very delicate improvement in spatial learning. Furthermore, we consider a potential role of metabolically generated MUFAs in the beneficial effects of PUFA supplementation. ¬© 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Several confounding factors may influence the outcome of an experiment and the extent of inter-individual variation. The aim of this study was to investigate if cage enrichment induces an effect on experimental mean values and on inter-individual variation in the light/dark paradigm using diazepam as the anxiolytic drug. The behaviour of 216 naive adult male mice of two different strains (BALB/c and C57BL/6) was studied. The animals were housed in groups of four in 'non-enriched', 'enriched' (nesting material) or 'super-enriched' (nest-box, nesting material, wooden gnawing stick and PVC tube) cages. After 5 weeks the animals were assigned to one of three treatments: control (no injection), sham (saline injection i.p.) or diazepam (1 mg/kg bw i.p.) and tested in the light/dark test for 5 min. Variation data were analysed using three different methods (mean absolute deviation, coefficient of variation and power analysis). The C57BL/6 mice scored higher than BALB/c mice in activity related measurements and showed a less 'emotional' behaviour profile in the pharmacological control situation of the light/dark test. In this study the anxiolytic effect of diazepam was clear in BALB/c mice but absent in C57BL/6 mice. Mice housed in enriched and super-enriched cages gained more weight than mice in non-enriched cages, although food intake was not affected. Generally, the strain of mouse had the greatest impact on both mean values and variation. However, there was no consistent increase for one particular strain. The choice of statistical method for analysing variation may influence the interpretation of within-group variability, but none of the methods showed any significant differences between standard and enriched conditions on variability in any of the parameters measured.},

abstract={Environmental enrichment is intended to improve the well-being of laboratory animals. Although many researchers have indicated that environmental enrichment may enhance animal well-being, there is some evidence that enrichment differs in its effects on physiology and behaviour between species and strains. The present study focuses on the effects of different enrichment designs on the physiology and behaviour of male and female DBA/2 mice. A total of 48 DBA/2J mice, 24 males and 24 females were used for this experiment. Upon arrival at about 3 weeks of age, the animals were randomly allotted to three experimental groups: NE, non-enrichment; E1, enriched with nest box, wooden climbing bar and nest material according to Scharmann (1993); E2, enriched with horizontal and vertical dividers, modified from Haemisch and G√§rtner (1994). Same-sex groups of four mice were housed for 12 weeks in type III Makrolon cages with (E1 or E2) or without (NE) enrichment objects. Behavioural performance (Open Field, Food Drive and Elevated Plus Maze tests) and physiological traits (haematological variables, body weight and organ weights, corticosterone and thyroxine levels) were measured. This study observed that enrichment had significant effects on the mean values of body weight (females), Open Field and Food Drive tests. The most significant housing differences were found between the E2 and NE/E1 groups. Furthermore, sex differences in the NE, E1 and E2 groups were not consistent for several variables (growth rate, relative weights of spleen, kidney and heart, Food Drive and Elevated Plus Maze behavioural performance). There was often a higher coefficient of variation (CV) in the E1 and E2 groups as compared to the NE group, chiefly in physiological traits and in the Open Field and Food Drive tests. The results of this study indicate, that the effects of enrichment designs used in the present study are not consistent, but vary according to sex and the variable studied.},

abstract={Organisms in nature are both proximate (operating by rules of thumb) and adapted (the rules influenced by natural selection). We introduce new methods that can be used to study in silico versions of organisms behaving according to proximate adapted rules. Our approach goes beyond neural networks and offers an alternative to optimization methods. It is based on the idea that organisms receive signals from the environment, that the signals are modified by internal (state-dependent) factors to create feelings (which we refer to as hedonic tones), and that behavioural processes (decisions) are a response to the hedonic tones. We illustrate these ideas through a model of a fish moving in a vertically structured environment, subject to predation and competition from conspecifics. The fish in our model responds to food, light, temperature and conspecifics, without any reference to current or future fitness. We use a combination of hedonic modelling to process the response, and genetic algorithms to modify the response via natural selection, according to internal needs and evolutionary history. We show that many different combinations of genes can lead to similar fitnesses, so that this approach generates genetic diversity. We compare our results with those of a variety of empirical studies and show that our approach can lead to new links between empirical and simulation studies.},

abstract={This study tests the hypothesis that high hostility is associated with increased peripheral blood leukocyte count. Hostility and peripheral blood leukocyte count have been independently associated with cardiovascular and all cause mortality but their association has not been reported in a population-based sample. Participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition in Norfolk (EPIC-Norfolk), aged 40-80 years, were identified through age-sex general practice registers. White blood cell counts and a measure of hostility were available from 11,367 participants and, after a mean interval of 44 months, from 11,857 at a second health check. The measure of hostility was completed between health checks. Age-adjusted associations were found between hostility and lymphocyte counts assessed at both health checks. Sex differences in these associations were not observed. There was an incremental elevation in mean lymphocyte cell counts with increasing hostility such that there was a 4.6% difference between top and bottom quintiles of hostility at the first (P<0.0001) and 5.0% difference at the second health check (P<0.0001). While half of this association was explained in terms of smoking behaviour, these results support an association between hostility and lymphocyte count, independent of age, sex, smoking history, alcohol intake and social class (1.9% difference, P=0.02 and 2.9% difference, P=0.0007 at the first and second health checks, respectively). If these findings can be replicated, study of inflammation as a plausible pathway linking hostility to health endpoints would be warranted. ¬© 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={There is increasing interest in home visits by phycisians, nurses or occupational therapists which offer health promotion or preventive care to older people. However, the practical performance of home visits, the targeting, and the effectiveness are ambigious. The collaboration in the EU-study 'disability prevention' gave the opportunity to recruit non-selected people 60 years and older from 14 general practitioners' patient lists in Hamburg. The study participants were offered different programs of health promotion, i.e., group sessions at the geriatric center and preventive home visits. The home visits were made by a nurse who received special training, and a curriculum was established. Seventy-seven elderly persons were visited because they were not able to attend the group sessions at the geriatric center due to self-reported problems in mobility. The investigations revealed combined risks for development of functional decline and dependency in the majority of these community-dwelling elderly persons. These findings were unknown to the general practitioners. For example, the risk of falling as recorded by assessment was elevated in more than half of the persons visited. Screening and assessment are useful for planing measures of health promotion and prevention. There are still questions open to discussion. The targeting, practicability, and prerequisites in structure of service provision are considered with regard to the present study's results and an up-to date literature review.},

abstract={The nucleus accumbens (NAc) subserves behaviors governed by natural rewards, i.e., feeding or exploration, and has been implicated in control of prepulse inhibition (PPI), a measure of sensorimotor gating. The present study sought to determine whether a tonic stimulation of adenosine A2A receptors in the rat NAc is involved in control of spontaneous locomotor activity, feeding behavior, and PPI. To this end, bilateral microinfusions of a prodrug (MSX-3) (3 Œºg and 5 Œºg in 1 Œºl per side) of the selective A2A receptor antagonist MSX-2 or vehicle (1 Œºl per side) were administered into the NAc. Results show that blockade of intra-NAc adenosine A2A receptors by a high (5 Œºg), but not by a low (3 Œºg), dose of MSX-3 increased locomotor activity in an open field, reduced food intake, and delayed intake onset in food-deprived rats examined in a test cage with standard laboratory chow. Furthermore, PPI was significantly disrupted after intra-NAc infusion of 5 Œºg, but not 3 Œºg, MSX-3. These findings suggest that locomotor activity as well as intact PPI and feeding behavior rely on tonic activation of intra-NAc A2A receptors. The data add further support to the view that adenosine is a tonically active modulator of striatal function through actions on A2A receptors. ¬© 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={While there are many examples of people who live for 100 years or more with little evidence of a decline in brain function, many others are not so fortunate and experience a neurodegenerative disorder, such as Alzheimer disease or Parkinson disease. Although an increasing number of genetic factors that may affect the risk for neurodegenerative disorders are being identified, emerging findings suggest that dietary factors play major roles in determining whether the brain ages successfully or experiences a neurodegenerative disorder. Dietary factors may interact with disease-causing or predisposing genes in molecular cascades that either promote or prevent the degeneration of neurons. Epidemiologic findings suggest that high-calorie diets and folic acid deficiency increase the risk for Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease; studies of animal models of these disorders have shown that dietary restriction (reduced calorie intake or intermittent fasting) and dietary supplementation with folic acid can reduce neuronal damage and improve behavioral outcome. Animal studies have shown that the beneficial effects of dietary restriction on the brain result in part from increased production of neurotrophic factors and cytoprotective protein chaperones in neurons. By keeping homocysteine levels low, folic acid can protect cerebral vessels and prevent the accumulation of DNA damage in neurons caused by oxidative stress and facilitated by homocysteine. Although additional studies are required in humans, the emerging data suggest that high-calorie diets and elevated homocysteine levels may render the brain vulnerable to age-related neurodegenerative disorders, particularly in persons with a genetic predisposition to such disorders.},

abstract={During courtship and mating, males of some invertebrate predators risk being killed and consumed by females, who in turn can obtain a foraging benefit from feeding on males. In these invertebrates, the sex ratio at the end of the mating season is usually female biased, probably due to sexual cannibalism and other sources of male mortality. Thus, at the end of the mating season males can be a limited resource to females as both mates and prey. Because of the high risk incurred when approaching females, males should show mate choice. To date there are little data on the costs and benefits of sexual cannibalism in natural populations. For one month we followed the mating patterns of 60 late-maturing Mediterranean tarantula, Lycosa tarentula L., females in a desert grassland population. The later a female matured, the shorter was her cohabitation time with males and the lower her probability of cohabiting with a male at all, suggesting that late-maturing females may be limited in their access to males as mates. At the end of the mating season, nonsexually cannibalistic late-maturing females also had poorer body conditions than did both sexually cannibalistic late-maturing females and early-maturing females, suggesting that late-maturing females may be also limited in their access to males as food. Females had higher mating success if they were smaller or in better condition (better fed). This pattern may reflect either male choice, or the possibility that small, well-fed females have higher mating success because they are less aggressive towards males. ¬© 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The 5-HT3 receptor for serotonin is expressed within limbic structures and is known to modulate neurotransmitter release, suggesting that this receptor may influence learning and memory. Perturbations in serotonergic neurotransmission lead to changes in the ability to attend, learn, and remember. To examine the role of 5-HT3 receptors in learning, memory, and attention, 5-HT3 receptor overexpressing (5-HT3-OE) transgenic mice and their wild-type littermates (WT) were tested in Pavlovian contextual and cued fear conditioning, fear extinction, and latent inhibition (LI) paradigms. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) was assessed to reveal changes in sensorimotor gating. Additionally, anxious behaviors, shock sensitivity, and reactions to novel stimuli were evaluated. 5-HT3-OE mice displayed enhanced contextual conditioning, whereas cued conditioning remained the same as that of WT mice. 5-HT3-OE mice did not differ from WT in extinction rates to either the context or cue. LI was enhanced for 5-HT 3-OE mice compared to WT. PPI remained unchanged. No differences in sensitivity to footshock of startle were found. However, 5-HT3-OE mice demonstrated heightened exploratory behavior in response to novel environmental stimuli and decreased anxiety as measured in the elevated plus-maze. Results indicate that overexpression of the 5-HT3 receptor in mouse forebrain results in enhanced hippocampal-dependent learning and attention. Enhanced inspective behavior in response to novelty may contribute to the observed improvements in learning, memory, and attention due to 5-HT3 receptor overexpression.},

abstract={Keeping pigs in lairage provides a buffer to supply the slaughter line and allows the pigs to recover from the stress of transport. It has implications for the pigs' welfare by influencing their behaviour and ease of handling. In terms of pork quality, optimal lairage times for most pigs in the UK are probably one to three hours. Shorter lairage times are associated with more pale, soft, exudative (PSE) meat and longer times are associated with more dark, firm, dry (DFD) meat, more skin blemishes caused by fighting, and a lower carcase yield. However, when pigs have not been previously stressed by handling procedures, resting them in lairage may have no beneficial effects on the pigs' welfare or meat quality. At very high environmental temperatures there is evidence that a holding period of less than one hour may help to reduce the number of PSE carcases. At temperatures above 10¬∞C showering the pigs with water is beneficial. Fasting times need to be controlled to minimise the potential loss of carcase yield while reducing the volume of gut contents to reduce the risk of carcase contamination. Lairages can act as reservoirs of infection by pathogenic bacteria and there is evidence that longer holding times increase the risk of cross-contamination.},

abstract={Effects of metabolic load and 12h of food deprivation on the behavioural and physiological responses toward novel food were examined in dairy cows provided with 4 kg of carrots as novel food and observed using video for the initial 10 min. In Experiment I, effects of 12 h of food deprivation were tested using dairy cows provided with 4 kg of carrots as novel food after 0 h versus 12 h of food deprivation (N = 22). Food deprivation did not affect the approach-avoidance behaviour toward novel food but led to increased attempts to steal usual food from neighbours (P < 0.05) as well as decreased self-grooming (P = 0.05). In Experiment II, effects of milking frequency and energy density in the food on behavioural and physiological responses toward novel food were examined in a 2 √ó 2 factorial experiment (N = 40). The two factors were: (a) milking frequency: milked twice daily (04:30 and 15:30h) (2) versus three daily milkings (04:30, 12:45 and 21:30h) (3); and (b) energy density in the food after calving: low (25% concentrates) (L) versus high (75% concentrates) (H). An extra daily milking affected the approach-avoidance behaviour of the cows as shown by reduced time spend away from the novel food (P = 0.01) and reduced frequency of sniffing the novel food (P < 0.05). Low energy density in the food led to increased time spent away (P = 0.07), increased latency to eat novel food (P < 0.05), decreased food intake (P = 0.09) and a higher proportion of cows performing self grooming (P < 0.05). Provision of novel food did not affect the plasma concentration of cortisol sampled at t = 0, 10 and 20 min after food provision, and no differences were found between treatments. In conclusion, 12 h of food deprivation did not affect behavioural responses toward novel food in dairy cows, suggesting that this test of behavioural responses toward novelty is rather insensitive toward day-to-day changes in eating motivation. Low energy density in the daily ration and increased milking frequency affected the behavioural, but not the adrenocortical responses toward novelty but there was no evidence for a simple relationship between the energy balance of dairy cows and their responses toward novel food. ¬© 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={Pigeons pecked keys on concurrent-chains schedules that provided a variable interval 30-sec schedule in the initial link. One terminal link provided reinforcers in a fixed manner; the other provided reinforcers in a variable manner with the same arithmetic mean as the fixed alternative. In Experiment 1, the terminal links provided fixed and variable interval schedules. In Experiment 2, the terminal links provided reinforcers after a fixed or a variable delay following the response that produced them. In Experiment 3, the terminal links provided reinforcers that were fixed or variable in size. Rate of reinforcement was varied by changing the scheduled interreinforcer interval in the terminal link from 5 to 225 sec. The subjects usually preferred the variable option in Experiments 1 and 2 but differed in preference in Experiment 3. The preference for variability was usually stronger for lower (longer terminal links) than for higher (shorter terminal links) rates of reinforcement. Preference did not change systematically with time in the session. Some aspects of these results are inconsistent with explanations for the preference for variability in terms of scaling factors, scalar expectancy theory, risk-sensitive models of optimal foraging theory, and habituation to the reinforcer. Initial-link response rates also changed within sessions when the schedules provided high, but not low, rates of reinforcement. Within-session changes in responding were similar for the two initial links. These similarities imply that habituation to the reinforcer is represented differently in theories of choice than are other variables related to reinforcement.},

We measured the frequency of attack flights, intensity of alarm calling and total time spent in view, and then combined these for each individual, in a single defence factor by principal component analysis. All the females arrived to defend the nest while only 21 males arrived, and females defended the nest more intensely than males. We analysed, by stepwise regression, the relationship of male defence factor to female behaviour and phenotype (breast patch size, a measure of quality) and brood properties (size, mass, phenology). Male defence factor was significantly related only to female breast patch size. We argue that male rock sparrows apparently make parental investment decisions according to their mate's quality, and examine possible alternative hypotheses.},

Body weight gain, exploratory motor activity (EMA) rota-rod motor coordination, dental structure, brain acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity, and serum fluoride and serum calcium concentration were determined 24 hr after the last treatment. Serum fluoride concentration increased markedly in the NaF-treated animals and was accompanied by decreased food intake, reduced body weight gain, impairment of EMA and motor coordination, dental lesions, inhibition of brain AchE activity, and hypocalcemia. Administration of vitamin D along with NaF prevented hypocalcemia. However, the toxic action fluoride on motor coordination, brain AchE activity, and the teeth was not prevented in these animals, probably because vitamin D is not able to decrease the level of fluoride in the serum.

abstract={1. Because of the large numbers within a colony and their aggressive nature, red wood ants (Formica rufa group) have a potential to greatly influence the cold-temperate forest ecosystem. Wood ants are omnivorous and hunt in trees as well as on the forest floor. 2. A field experiment in a mixed forest in central Sweden was carried out to examine (i) the foraging behaviour of wood ants on the forest floor and (ii) the impact of increased numbers of wood ants on the soil fauna. The foraging behaviour of wood ants was manipulated by excluding the ants from their food resources in the tree canopy, with the intention to increase ant activity on the forest floor. To estimate this activity, the number of trees with foraging ants, the numbers of ants going to and from their nests and the prey carried by home-running wood ants were determined during the summer period. Pitfall traps were placed in the soil to determine effects on mobile soil invertebrates. 3. When excluded from local trees, wood ants searched other trees further away from the nests rather than searching more intensively for prey on the forest floor. By contrast to the initial hypothesis, more soil-living prey were caught by ants in the control plots than in the plots where the local trees were not accessible to the wood ants. The proportion of soil-living to tree-living prey tended to be greater in the control plots. 4. In the treated plots (no access to the trees), wood ants had a negative effect on the activity of Linyphiidae spiders. There was little effect of wood ants on other soil invertebrates. 5. This study suggests that the role of wood ants as top predators in the forest soil food-web in central Sweden is limited.},

abstract={Protein malnutrition induces structural, neurochemical and functional alterations in the central nervous system, leading to alterations in behavioral function.

Rat pups were fed by lactating females receiving 16% (control) or 6% (malnourished) protein diets during the lactation period. After weaning the animals received the same diets until 49 days of age, when all animals started receiving a lab chow diet. Behavioral tests were started at 70 days of age. ETM results showed lower inhibitory avoidance in malnourished animals, without differences in escape behavior. SAP test results showed higher exploration and lower risk assessment behaviors in malnourished animals compared to control. These results suggest that malnourished animals are less anxious and/or more impulsive as measured by these two animal models and that malnutrition seems to affect differently behavioral strategies underlying fear and anxiety responses.},

abstract={Many air-breathing aquatic foragers may be killed by aerial or subsurface predators while recovering oxygen at the surface; yet the influence of predation risk on time allocation during dive cycles is little known in spite of numerous studies on optimal diving. We modeled diving behavior under the risk of predation at the surface. The relationship between time spent at the surface and the risk of death is predicted to influence the optimal surface interval, regardless of whether foragers accumulate energy at a constant rate while at the food patch, deplete food resources over the course of the dive, or must search for food during the dive. When instantaneous predation risk during a single surface interval decreases with time spent at the surface, a diver should increase its surface interval relative to that which maximizes energy intake, thereby increasing dive durations and reducing the number of surfacings per foraging bout. When instantaneous risk over a single surface interval does not change or increases with increasing time at the surface, divers should decrease their surface interval (and consequently their dive duration) relative to that which maximizes energy intake resulting in more dives per foraging bout. The fitness consequences of selecting a suboptimal surface interval vary with the risk function and the way divers harvest energy when at depth. Finally, predation risk during surface intervals should have important consequences for habitat selection and other aspects of the behavioral ecology of air-breathing aquatic organisms. ¬© 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is a structural analog of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide, which does not activate cannabinoid receptors. The biosynthesis of OEA in rat small intestine is increased by feeding and reduced by fasting. Moreover, OEA decreases food intake in food-deprived rats via a mechanism that requires intact sensory fibers (Rodr√≠guez de Fonseca, 2001). These results suggest that OEA may contribute to the peripheral regulation of feeding. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of systemic OEA administration (1-20 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) on meal pattern in free-feeding and food-deprived rats. In free-feeding animals, OEA delayed feeding onset in a dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on meal size or postmeal interval. In food-deprived animals, OEA both delayed feeding onset and reduced meal size. The selective effects of OEA in free-feeding rats are strikingly different from those of the serotonergic anorexiant d-fenfluramine (which delayed feeding and reduced meal size) and the intestinal peptide cholecystokinin (which reduced meal size). These results suggest that OEA may participate in the regulation of satiety and may provide a chemical scaffold for the design of novel appetite-suppressing medications. ¬© 2003 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

We report on a series of five studies of feeding behavior in rats. Rats were fed low protein diets for 5-7 d and then exposed to diets with and without essential amino acids. Rats consistently demonstrated recognition of essential amino acid deficiency within the first meal by a significant reduction in first meal duration, rejecting the deficient diets after just 12-16 min exposure.

abstract={1. Although parasitoids are used widely as a biological models for understanding the evolution of animal behaviour, most studies have been constrained to the laboratory. The dearth of field studies has been compounded by the almost complete ignorance of the physiological parameters involved in foraging and dispersal, in particular of the energetic constraints imposed by resource limitation. 2. We estimated the dynamics of carbohydrates and lipids reserves of Venturia canescens (Gravenhorst) females by releasing individuals of known nutritional status in a natural environment and recapturing them using host-containing traps. The recapture rate was around 30%. These results were compared with the reserves of caged animals kept under different experimental conditions (freshly emerged, starved to death, fed ad libitum and partially starved). Wild animals were also sampled in order to estimate the resource levels of the local population. 3. The results show that: (i) wasps are able to maintain a nearly constant level of energy over an extended foraging period; (ii) V. canescens takes sugars in the field; and (iii) the lipid reserves accumulated during the larval life may be limiting as lipogenesis does not take place in adults even under conditions of high sugar availability. 4. These results demonstrate that wasps can forage for hosts and food and disperse in this habitat for hours and days without running into a severe risk of energy limitation.},

abstract={The response latencies of the biting response in the tail-pinch test and step-through response in the passive avoidance test were measured in mice. 1) Scopolamine decreased the latency of the step-through response in the passive avoidance test, but diazepam did not. 2) Morphine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) was given 30 min before the test for 4 consecutive days in novel environments by sessions. The decrease in biting response latency was attenuated and delayed in the groups in which contexts were changed daily compared to the groups that were maintained in the same context throughout the conditioning period. The latency of step-through response was increased with morphine in both groups regardless of the change or lack of change in context. 3) Morphine was repeatedly administered to animals in the same environment and then the context was changed. The decreased latency in the tail-pinch test was significantly reversed by the change in context, but the response in the passive avoidance test maintained a longer latency. These findings indicate that morphine develops associative and nonassociative antinociceptive tolerance, indicating that antinociceptive tolerance to morphine has contextual specificity, but the facilitation of memory does not. The results indicate that the facilitation of memory with morphine may contribute to associative learning in antinociceptive tolerance to morphine.},

abstract={Theoretical models of the evolution of sex allocation generally assume a negative genetic correlation between components of male and female investment or function. To test this assumption, and to determine whether the expression of the correlation is sensitive to environmental conditions, we conducted an artificial selection experiment targeting primary sexual traits in the autogamous herb, Spergularia marina. Mass selection favouring individuals with high (or low) pollen and ovule production per flower had previously been conducted for two generations under uniform conditions. Following a third episode of selection (reported here) within the high-pollen-, high-ovule-, low-pollen- and low-ovule-producing lineages, selected maternal seed families were replicated and cultivated in three nutrient treatments. With this design, we observed the effects of nutrient availability on: floral phenotype, the realized response to selection and the expression of genetic variation in, and covariation between, male and female investment. The first two episodes of selection Mazer et al. 1999 (Evolution 53:717-731) detected evidence for a genetically based negative correlation between ovule and anther production. Following the third episode of selection, phenotypic differences among the selected lines were maintained in all treatments, but evidence for a negative correlation between male and female investment nearly disappeared. Only under low-nutrient conditions, in which plants selected for low ovule production exhibited elevated anther production, was a genetic trade-off expressed. Either genetic drift or the combination of novel growing conditions (relative to previous generations) and G x E interactions may have caused the change in the expression of the genetic correlation. This experiment also allowed us to test the prediction that autogamous sellers should exhibit higher canalization of the ratio of male to female investment than of its components. Supporting this prediction, the A:O ratio was more strongly buffered against environmental variation than either anther or ovule production per flower.},

abstract={Behavioral adaptations and the underlying neural plasticity may not simply result from peripheral information conveyed by sensory inputs. Central neuronal networks often spontaneously generate neuronal activity patterns that may also contribute to sensorimotor integration and behavioral adaptations. The present study explored a novel form of sensory-induced plasticity by which the resulting changes in motor output depend essentially on the preexisting functional state of an identified neuron of an endogenously active central network. In the isolated lobster stomatogastric nervous system, electrical stimulation of a mechanosensory nerve transiently inactivated rhythmic spike bursting in the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the pyloric motor pattern-generating network. Repeated sensory nerve stimulation gradually and long-lastingly strengthened the bursting of the LP neuron to the detriment of sensory-elicited inactivation. This strengthening of pyloric-timed rhythmic activity was enhanced by experimental depolarization of the neuron. Conversely, when the LP neuron was hyperpolarized, the same sensory stimulation paradigm now gradually increased the susceptibility of the pyloric-timed bursting of the network neuron to sensory-elicited inactivation. Modulation of depolarization-activated and hyperpolarization-activated ionic conductances that underlie the intrinsic bursting properties of the LP neuron may contribute via differential voltage-dependent recruitment and effects to the respective adaptive processes. These data therefore suggest a novel state-dependent mechanism by which an endogenously active central network can decrease or increase its responsiveness to the same sensory input.},

abstract={Fiddler crabs are organism with an extreme sexual dimorphism. Male crabs have an enlarged claw used for sexual display and combat but not for feeding, which place them in foraging disadvantage when are compared with females. Given that avoiding disturbance (e.g., predators or human activity), courting, and feeding are incompatible behaviors, males should have different time budget to balance all the activities. In this study we experimentally evaluated the hypothesis that males of the Southwestern Atlantic fiddler crab Uca uruguayensis have a sex-specific response to disturbance. We performed an experiment where we applied an artificial disturbance (created by addition of flags). During a tidal cycle we found that males were more affected by disturbance than females. During the ebb tide, more males than females remained into their burrows because of the artificial disturbance. After disturbance (i.e., when flags were removed) the male-to-female sex ratio on the surface increased in disturbed plots. However, once disturbance was interrupted the male-to-female sex ratio on previously disturbed plots differed from the observed in control plots, being smaller during the ebb tide and larger during the flood tide. The latter might indicate that male crabs increase their foraging effort to compensate the time they loss for feeding as consequence of disturbance. Disturbance also affected the proportion of courting males, but when disturbance was removed courtship returned to initial values of activity, which indicates that the cost of stop courting may be higher than cost of stop feeding. However, after 27 days of experimental disturbance comparison of body condition (dry weight in relation to their carapace width) showed no effect of disturbance, suggesting that males were able to compensate the decrease in feeding time.},

abstract={The degree to which foraging and vigilance are mutually exclusive is crucial to understanding the management of the predation and starvation risk trade-off in animals. We tested whether wild-caught captive chaffinches that feed at a higher rate do so at the expense of their speed in responding to a model sparrowhawk flying nearby, and whether consistently good foragers will therefore tend to respond more slowly on average. First, we confirmed that the time taken to respond to the approaching predator depended on the rate of scanning: as head-up rate increased so chaffinches responded more quickly. However, against predictions, as peck rate increased so head-up rate increased and mean length of head-up and head-down periods decreased. Head-up rate was probably dependent on peck rate because almost every time a seed was found, a bird raised its head to handle it. Therefore chaffinches with higher peck rates responded more quickly. Individual chaffinches showed consistent durations of both their head-down and head-up periods and, therefore, individuals that were good foragers were also good detectors of predators. In relation to the broad range of species that have a similar foraging mode to chaffinches, our results have two major implications for predation/starvation risk trade-offs: (i) feeding rate can determine vigilance scanning patterns; and (ii) the best foragers can also be the best at detecting predators. We discuss how our results can be explained in mechanistic terms relating to fundamental differences in how the probabilities of detecting food rather than a predator are affected by time. In addition, our results offer a plausible explanation for the widely observed effect that vigilance continues to decline with group size even when there is no further benefit to reducing vigilance.},

abstract={Nestling birds face a dilemma: they can increase parental provisioning by begging more intensively, but by doing so may also increase their risk of predation. Nestlings could deal with this dilemma by reducing begging intensity after parents have warned them of a nearby predator. We therefore tested experimentally whether nestling scrubwrens, Sericornis frontalis, increase begging intensity with hunger but reduce it after adult alarm calls. Single 5- and 8-day-old nestlings were temporarily taken into the laboratory for playback experiments. Over a 90-min period of food deprivation we simulated parental visits every 10 min by playing back adult feeding calls. Hungrier nestlings begged louder and longer to simulated parental visits, but contrary to expectation did not beg less if they had previously heard playback of alarm calls, and even begged to the alarm calls themselves. The results were similar for both 'mobbing' and 'flee' alarm calls. Nestlings also gave distinctive calls in the 10-min interval between simulated parental visits, and the number of these calls increased with hunger and after playback of alarm calls. We suggest that nestlings acquire the ability to respond appropriately to alarm calls late in the nestling period and that therefore parents might be selected to avoid alarm calling when defending young nestlings. ¬© 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={EC legislation requires the land to which free-range poultry have access to be 'mainly covered with vegetation', but the nature of this vegetation is not specified. In practice, most free-range land will be grass pasture. Modern poultry nutrition is a highly-developed science, and to house poultry in an environment in which they may consume an unknown quantity of vegetation, itself of unknown nutritive value, introduces uncertainty into a predictable system. In recent years the contribution of grazing to the nutrition of the birds has been considered negligible. However, birds on range appear to ingest a little grass, and therefore the quality of the pasture may affect their performance. If poultry consumed largely grass, then the nutritional value derived from it would be relatively poor. The grass would constitute a source of energy and fibre, but would make little contribution in terms of protein. The likely approach that poultry nutritionists would take is a precautionary one. They would need to know the full nutritive value of the pasture and the likely quantitative intake by the birds, and they would then make adjustments to feed formulations at what they considered to be a 'safe' level, in order to minimize the risks of impairing performance. A small (0-5) percentage contribution is probably the most that could be achieved, but given that feed accounts for about 70% of the variable costs of poultry production, such a contribution is economically important.},

abstract={As foraging becomes more unpredictable animals should increase their body reserves to reduce the risk of starvation. However, any increases in reserves may increase the risk of predation because extra mass probably compromises escape ability. Because of differences in foraging ability not all individuals will be affected in the same way by changes in foraging conditions. Relatively poor foragers will have more unpredictable foraging success for any given availability of food and therefore should carry larger body reserves. The mass-dependent predation hypothesis then predicts a negative correlation between levels of body reserves and foraging ability, although this may be modified by state-dependent compensation. I measured foraging rates and body masses of wintering European blackbirds, Turdus merula. Individuals with the lowest foraging rates had the largest gain in mass for the winter and had relatively high mass overall, independently of age and sex. That foraging rate determined mass rather than the reverse was demonstrated because foraging rate was independent of daily and seasonal mass change. Foraging rate within the experimental system was also independent of predation risk (as measured by distance from protective cover) and so the relation between mass and foraging rate was unlikely to have been confounded by any changes in vigilance to compensate for increased mass-dependent predation risk. The results suggest that blackbirds with high relative foraging rates have lower body reserves during the winter. Therefore there is probably a direct link between overwinter condition and fitness at least in blackbirds. ¬© 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={During competitive encounters protagonists are expected to use signals of individual quality particularly if there is a risk of injury or death. Lateral presentation of body profile, by which information regarding phenotypic characteristics associated with individual quality are displayed, may represent such a strategy. During aggressive interactions, male fallow deer frequently engage in parallel walking which is assumed to represent a mutual display of quality, as mediated by exposure of the maximal profile of the body or antlers. We examined the context and role of the parallel walk during competitive encounters to investigate whether there was evidence that dyads of competing males were assessing differences in phenotypic characteristics. There was no evidence to support the hypotheses that the parallel walk is a lateral display of body size or weaponry or that its use is associated with a reduced level of escalated or risky behaviours during fighting. Total time spent fighting was not shorter when a parallel walk was present than when there was no parallel walk. The parallel walk was highly associated with fighting and it was more likely to be initiated by the subsequent loser. Furthermore, parallel walking frequently followed bouts of fighting and as such may represent a strategy that permits an animal the opportunity to decide whether to continue fighting. Parallel walking was also associated with a failure to resolve contests in favour of one animal indicating that it may be a means of withdrawing from further fighting without incurring a loss in dominance status. ¬© 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Whole grains are important dietary constituents as they provide a plethora of nutrients and protective chemicals that may have synergistic actions in promoting health. Regular consumption of wholegrain foods has been associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases such as CHD and certain cancers, although their exact role in disease prevention is not yet fully elucidated. Studies reporting levels of whole grain consumption reveal that those subjects who include higher levels of whole grain foods in their diets also have many other favourable dietary and lifestyle practices. While the actions of these practices and whole grains may not be mutually exclusive, these variables do not appear to explain the reduction in risk of disease observed for high-whole grain consumers. Actual whole grain consumption levels are extremely low and many practical barriers exist to consumer uptake of these foods. Effective communication of the whole grain health message is an important strategy to increase awareness of the importance of whole grains in the diet. Increasing the variety and availability of acceptable wholegrain foods is also important. Whole grain consumption at breakfast can have an important impact on total daily nutrient intakes. This simple dietary modification is potentially relatively easy to achieve and could greatly contribute to increased whole grain intake for many individuals.},

abstract={Background: Clozapine has been demonstrated to be superior to typical neuroleptics in reducing refractory symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, but it has also been associated with hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus. This study was designed to investigate the proportion of undiagnosed impaired fasting glucose and diabetes mellitus in patients prescribed clozapine at 8 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers. Method: All patients diagnosed by the VA in New England with ICD-9 schizophrenia from Oct. 1, 1999, to Sept. 30, 2000, who received a prescription for clozapine were identified, and an attempt was made to obtain a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test. All patients were also characterized as to whether they were diagnosed as diabetic prior to the screening FPG. Patients not previously diagnosed as diabetic were divided into 2 groups: normal FPG (< 110 mg/dL) and elevated FPG (‚â• 110 mg/dL). Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of the 2 groups were compared using chi-square and t tests. Results: Overall, 121 patients were not previously diagnosed as diabetic and received an FPG. Ninety-three (77%) had a normal FPG, and 28 (23%) had an elevated plasma glucose including 17% with impaired fasting glucose and 6% with diabetes. Patients with hyperglycemia were significantly older (p =.007) and more commonly codiagnosed with bipolar disorder (p = .04). Conclusion: Hyperglycemia was common in patients receiving clozapine who had not been previously diagnosed as diabetic. These patients should be considered a group at high risk to develop diabetes mellitus and deserve both close monitoring and early intervention at the first sign of the onset of either diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance.
FreeText:Eligible patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia at VA medical centers in the New England region between October 1999 and September 2000 and received Leponex. Patients were evaluated if they were currently receiving Leponex, were not previously diagnosed as diabetic, and a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) result was available. Patients were divided into 2 groups, with normal (<110 mg/dl) or elevated (100 mg/dl or higher) FPG.
AuthorsConclusions:In sum, among nondiabetic patients with schizophrenia treated with clozapine in this study, nearly one quarter had an elevated fasting blood sugar screening. Given this proportion of previously undiscovered diabetes, we suggest that patients receiving clozapine should be considered a group at high risk to develop diabetes mellitus and that they deserve both close monitoring and early intervention at the first sign of the onset of either diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance.
TypeofStudy:Prevalence of hyperglycemia or diabetes among patients treated with Leponex. Open multicenter study.
Indications:121 patients with schizophrenia. Coexisting diseases: 21 substance abuse, 14 other psychoses, 16 bipolar disorder, 18 major depression, 16 dysthymia, 11 posttraumatic stress disorder, 13 other anxiety disorder, 7 personality disorder.
Patients:121 outpatients. Normal FPG group: 93 patients, 87 men and 6 women, mean age 46.2 years. Elevated FPG group: 28 patients, 27 men and 1 woman, mean age 51.2 years.
DosageDuration:Dosage and duration not stated.
Results:Of the 121 patients not previously diagnosed as diabetic for whom an FPG was obtained, 93 (77%) had normal fasting blood sugar results (< 110 mg/dL), and 28 (23%) had a fasting blood sugar ‚â• 110 mg/dL, with 21 (17%) having a result between 110 and 126 mg/dL and 7 (6%) having a result ‚â• 126 mg/dL. Of the 7 with a result ‚â• 126 mg/dL, 6 had second FPG of ‚â• 126 mg/dL. All 6 of these patients appeared clinically to have type 2 diabetes. When patients (N = 93) with a normal FPG value were compared with those (N = 28) with an FPG ‚â• 110 mg/dL, those with elevated FPG values were significantly older (51.21¬±9.34 vs. 46.16¬±8.30; p = .007) and were significantly more likely to have comorbid bipolar disorder (n = 7 [25%] vs. n = 9 [9.7%]; p = .04). There were no other significant differences between the 2 groups. When the patients not previously identified as diabetic were divided into 3 subgroups--normal (FPG<110 mg/dL), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG=110mg/dL to <126 mg/dL), and diabetic (FPG ‚â• 126 mg/dL)--those patients with IFG were observed to be significantly older than the diabetic group, whereas the diabetic group had a significantly (p < .05) greater body mass index than either the normal or IFG groups.
AdverseEffects:28 patients had hyperglycemia, 6 of whom appeared to have type 2 diabetes.},

abstract={Early in the co-evolution of plant-animal relationships, some arthropod species began to utilize the chemical defences of plants to protect themselves from their own predators and parasites. It is likely, therefore, that the origins of herbal medicine have their roots deep within the animal kingdom. From prehistoric times man has looked to wild and domestic animals for sources of herbal remedies. Both folklore and living examples provide accounts of how medicinal plants were obtained by observing the behaviour of animals. Animals too learn about the details of self-medication by watching each other. To date, perhaps the most striking scientific studies of animal self-medication have been made on the African great apes. The great ape diet is often rich in plants containing secondary compounds of non-nutritional, sometimes toxic, value that suggest medicinal benefit from their ingestion. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), bonobos (Pan paniscus) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) are known to swallow whole and defecate intact leaves. The habit has been shown to be a physical means of purging intestinal parasites. Chimpanzees and man co-existing in sub-Saharan Africa are also known to ingest the bitter pith of Vernonia amygdalina for the control of intestinal nematode infections. Phytochemical studies have demonstrated a wide array of biologically-active properties in this medicinal plant species. In light of the growing resistance of parasites and pathogens to synthetic drugs, the study of animal self-medication and ethno-medicine offers a novel line of investigation to provide ecologically-sound methods for the treatment of parasites using plant-based medicines in populations and their livestock living in the tropics.},

abstract={The main factors affecting the accumulation of potentially-toxic metals (PTM) by grazing animals are the presence of the metal, its concentration in herbage and at the soil surface, and the duration of exposure to the contaminated pasture and soil. In addition, the elapsed time between the contamination of the pasture and grazing, the quantity of soil ingested together with herbage, the mechanism of absorption of the metal into blood and the presence or absence of antagonistic metals can interact to influence the rate and extent of accumulation of heavy metals in edible body tissues. Models of the accumulation of metals by grazing animals may be used to determine the statutory limits of radionuclides and PTM in soils under grazed pastures. Meta-analysis of existing data, using a random-effects model, is a useful approach to understanding the factors affecting the accumulation of some metals, e.g. Cd. The target edible body tissues for the accumulation of most PTM are the liver and kidneys, with the exception of radiocaesium, which accumulates in muscle to a greater extent than in other tissues. The livers and kidneys of mature livestock that have been grazed on areas of pasture at the legal limit of contamination by Cd for more than one grazing season should be removed from the human food chain in order to reduce the risk of intake of Cd by the human population.},

abstract={Mortality profiles can be used to investigate modes of accumulation of fossil assemblages, including predation by ancient nonhuman and human (Homo) hunters. Prey age at death reflects hunting decisions and opportunities in terms of calories returned for energy spent and risks taken. Nonhuman carnivores commonly harvest vulnerable individuals (young and old), whereas humans consistently can take prime adults. As an example of how mortality profiles can be used to illuminate predator behavior, this article examines when the ability to select prime-age animals emerged during human behavioral evolution. Although it would be expected that the appearance of this behavior coincided with the appearance of morphologically and archaeologically modern humans, analyses of archaeological assemblages from western Europe and South Africa suggest that this trait was already present in archaic people who preceded modern humans. Studying age distributions in fossil assemblages is not without its limitations, including the difficulty of estimating age at death in fossil specimens, pre- and postdepositional biases, and reconstructing the age structure and behavior of prey herds. Nevertheless, valuable behavioral information can be gained by using controlled comparisons of many assemblages.},

abstract={Background: Certain aspects of the personality may be associated with the vulnerability to develop depression. A sib-pair method has been used to examine the familiality of the 7 scales of the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and whether this could be related to the genetic vulnerability to develop depression. Methods: Probands with depression and their nearest-aged siblings from Wales were compared with healthy control probands and their nearest-aged siblings on the TCI and measures of depressed mood. Results: All 7 scales of the TCI were familial, and scores on 6 of the scales were similar to US population scores. However, the Welsh subjects' scores on the self-transcendence scale were markedly lower than the US mean, suggesting strong cultural or national influences on this measure. Harm avoidance scores were substantially influenced by current and past depression, but this scale also showed stable traitlike characteristics that are likely related to the genetic vulnerability to depression. Novelty seeking and self-directedness were also partly state-dependent and were negatively correlated with low mood; high scorers may be resilient to the development of depression. High reward dependence may also protect against the development of depression and is unrelated to mood state. The cooperativeness, persistence, and self-transcendence scales appear to have a limited relationship with the development of depression. Conclusions: Harm avoidance, reward dependence, novelty seeking, and self-directedness have traitlike characteristics that are related to the familiality of depression. Cooperativeness, self-transcendence, and persistence are also familial, but this appears to be unrelated to depression.},

abstract={It has been suggested that saber-tooth species such as Smilodon fatalis were social because partially healed skeletal injuries were found at Rancho La Brea, California. This conclusion assumes injured animals would die without help. This paper will rebut assertions of sociality. First, cats use metabolic reserves to heal quickly without feeding. Second, dehydration is a more profound limitation than starvation as prey carcasses only provide a quarter of necessary water. Injured animals must be mobile enough to find water or die of dehydration. Their presence in a tar pit also strongly suggests locomotion. Finally, the relatively small brain found in Smilodon is not consistent with sociality. Another argument for sociality has been the large ratio of Smilodon to other species in the La Brea tar pits. However, the remains of a non-social species, the Golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetus), are about as common as Smilodon. Contrariwise, the highly social grey wolf (Canis lupus) and coyote (Canis latrans) are extremely rare. Available evidence does not support sociality in Smilodon. Copyright ¬© 2003 S.

abstract={Previously, we have shown that rats administered MDMA from postnatal (P) days 11-20 had reductions in body weight during the period of treatment and as adults they had deficits in sequential and spatial learning and memory. In the present study, to control for weight reductions, we used litters with double the number of offspring to induce growth restriction comparable to that of standard size litters treated with MDMA. Litters were treated twice daily from P11 to 20 with vehicle or MDMA (20 mg/kg) or only weighed. Males, but not females, exposed to MDMA had longer latencies and more errors in the Cincinnati water maze compared to males of the other treatments. In the Morris water maze (210 cm pool, 10√ó10 cm platform), the MDMA animals were impaired relative to all other treatments during acquisition. Only the MDMA females showed deficits when the platform was shifted to a new location, however, both MDMA males and females were impaired when the location of the platform was again shifted and a reduced platform (5√ó5 cm) used. No differences were observed in the ability to swim a straight channel, locate a platform with a cue, or the endocrine response to forced swim among the treatment groups. No differences were seen between animals injected with saline and those only weighed. The data suggest that factors, such as growth retardation, multiple injections, or the composition of the litter, do not affect the development of learning and memory impairments resulting from P11 to 20 MDMA exposure. The large litter approach offers a novel method to control for undernutrition during the preweaning period in rodents. ¬© Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Although group living can confer benefits to individuals in terms of reduced predation risk and enhanced foraging success, it may also be associated with costs, such as increased competition for food. The nutritional state of an individual could therefore affect its readiness to join or remain in groups. We investigated the shoaling behaviour of banded killifish by following marked individuals, whose nutritional state had been experimentally manipulated, and recording their shoaling behaviour in a field enclosure containing unmarked conspecifics. Overall, food-deprived fish spent more time alone, and therefore less time shoaling, than well-fed individuals. When shoaling, however, food-deprived fish were not found in smaller shoals than well-fed conspecifics. Furthermore, they did not show a greater latency to shoal initially. Having joined a shoal, however, food-deprived fish left shoals more frequently to be alone than fed fish. Rates of change in the membership size of shoals occupied by either well-fed or food-deprived fish did not differ. We conclude that nutritional state seems to affect an individual's decision to continue shoaling once an association has been made. This study is the first to investigate experimentally state-dependent changes in the size of social groups in fish under field conditions. ¬© 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

We manipulated the body condition of zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, during incubation by using prelaying diets of different protein content, and induced birds to lay a similar number of eggs. We tested the hypothesis that birds in better body condition would invest more in incubation than birds in poorer condition when incubating on the same diet. Females that had received a high-protein prelaying diet lost more body mass than those that had received a low-protein diet. They also increased the length of their incubation bouts between early and middle incubation, whereas females that had received a low-protein prelaying diet increased bout length only between middle and late incubation. There were no differences between males from the two diet groups, and males were responsible for a lesser proportion of incubation than females. These results indicate that incubation behaviour is state dependent in female zebra finches, and that birds of different body condition adopt different incubation strategies. We found no differences in incubation duration and hatching success between the two incubation strategies in captivity, but the potential risk of nest predation in the wild may differ. We suggest that only females in good condition can afford to adopt a strategy of increasing bout length early in incubation; females in poorer condition first have to recover their body condition after having produced a clutch. ¬© 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Bisphenol A (BPA) is an environmental estrogen with potentially averse effects on public health. We studied the long-term effects of perinatal exposure to BPA on later behavior in adult rats of both sexes. BPA or vehicle was administered orally to mother rats from mating to pups' weaning, at a concentration (0.040 mg/kg) within the range of human exposure. The offspring of both sexes were tested at adolescence (postnatal days 35-45) for novelty preference (experiment 1). After a 3-day familiarization to one side of a two-chamber apparatus, on day 4 rats were allowed to freely explore the whole apparatus. BPA-exposed females spent significantly less time than did controls in exploration of the novel side (i.e., increased neophobia), whereas no effect was found in the male group. At adulthood, the same animals were food deprived and tested for profiles of impulsive behavior (experiment 2), in operant chambers provided with two nose-poking holes (delivering either five or one food pellet). After the establishment of a baseline preference for the large reinforcer, a delay was introduced before the delivery of the five food pellets, which was progressively increased each day (10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 80, 100 sec). As expected, all animals exhibited a progressive shift toward the immediate but smaller reinforcer. A reduced level of impulsive behavior (i.e., a shift to the right in the intolerance-delay curve) was evidenced in BPA-treated rats. The frequency of inadequate responding (during the length of the delay) also provided a measure of restless behavior. Interestingly, the profile of BPA-treated males was feminized, strongly resembling that of control females. Animals were then tested (experiment 3) for the response to an amphetamine challenge (1 mg/kg, subcutaneously). The drug-induced increment activity was significantly less marked in BPA-treated male rats compared with controls. These findings provide clear indirect evidence of long-term alterations in brain monoaminergic function after perinatal BPA exposure. This may be a cause for concern for public health, confirming that exposure to a weak environmental estrogen in the period of sexual differentiation of the brain can influence adult behavior.},

abstract={Rating scales for difficulty in capturing and holding mice were devised that proved to be easy to use and highly sensitive to differences among mouse strains on the A and B priority lists of the Mouse Phenome Project. The simplicity of the scales makes it feasible to rate wildness during behavioral test sessions without adding much to testing time or distracting the technician from the principal task at hand. Overall wildness and placidity ratings obtained by combining capture and hold ratings provide a good impression of the difficulties encountered while working with lab mice in the course of complex experiments. Ratings of 21 inbred strains during the course of 15 behavioral tests in two laboratories demonstrated that the SPRET/Ei, PERA/Ei, CAST/Ei and SWR/J strains were particularly difficult to handle. The NOD/LtJ strain posed no special challenge in the Edmonton laboratory but was very difficult to handle in the Portland lab. The rating scales should be useful for judging the difficulties in working with novel targeted or induced mutations in mice as well as effects of a variety of environmental treatments or drugs.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that, during adulthood, the offspring of adolescent rats differ in emotionality, learning and memory from the offspring of adult rats. The behavior of the offspring of adolescent (age, 50-55 days) and adult rats (age, 90-95 days) was tested in the open field, activity cage, and passive and active avoidance apparatus. The latencies during training and testing in the passive avoidance apparatus of the offspring of adolescent parents were shorter than the latencies of control offspring (P<0.001 on both training and testing days). Offspring of adolescent parents showed shorter latency time in acquisition trials during active avoidance testing compared to control offspring (P<0.001). They also showed a higher number of active avoidance responses in the last four blocks of acquisition (P<0.001) and first two blocks of extinction trials (P<0.05 and P<0.001, respectively). The offspring of adolescent parents showed higher latency on the first day of testing in the open field (P<0.01) and a lower latency on the third day of testing (P<0.01). They also showed higher activity during all three days of testing (1st and 2nd day: P<0.01; 3rd day: P<0.05). The spontaneous activity of the offspring of adolescent parents in the activity cage was higher in the last three intervals of testing (P<0.001). In summary, the offspring of adolescent parents were less anxious and tended to be more active. The results of two learning and memory tests were opposite, but could be explained by a higher exploratory drive of the offspring of adolescent parents. This was probably due to chronic malnutrition stress and the disturbed mother-infant relationship in the litters of adolescent mothers.},

abstract={Background: A previous study reported no effect of binge exposure to ethanol during the brain growth spurt on the social acquisition of enhanced diet preference in male rats. The objective of this study was to replicate this finding by using the artificial rearing technique and to investigate whether delay-dependent mnemonic deficits previously observed in the water maze would extend to social memory of diet preference. We also addressed whether this naturalistic behavior was dependent on the presentation of diet odor in the context of a rat-produced component in ethanol-exposed rats, as it is in normal controls. Methods: Male rat pups were reared artificially from postnatal days 5 to 18, during which (postnatal days 6-9) they were fed either 6.5 g/kg/day of ethanol in a binge model or an isocaloric maltose-dextrin solution (gastrostomy controls). A third suckled control group was reared normally. These test rats were allowed to interact with conspecifics that had previously consumed a distinctive diet, X. Subsequently, the experimental rats were provided a choice between two novel diets, one of which was X, after delays of 0 hr (experiment 1), 24 hr, and 4 weeks (experiment 2). In experiment 3, the rats were again given the two-choice preference test, but after exposure to the diet odor alone. Results: All groups demonstrated a significant preference for the socially cued diet in experiments 1 and 2, and the strength of this inclination remained consistent across the 0-hr, 24-hr, and 4-week retention intervals. Moreover, all groups demonstrated sensitivity to the social context of this task, as shown by a lesser preference for the diet exposed alone in experiment 3. Conclusions: Intact performance on the ethologically meaningful diet-preference test supports specificity in the cognitive/behavioral effects of developmental exposure to ethanol. Interestingly, early isolation, as experienced in the artificial-rearing procedure, also did not impair performance on this social task.},

abstract={Elucidating the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up forces in communities of phytophagus insects has been a major historical focus. Current consensus is that both forces play a role, but it is poorly known if these forces act differently on herbivores in the same assemblage and what factors underlie this variation. Using manipulative experiment's with an assemblage of sap-feeding phytophagous insects (six species of planthoppers, leafhoppers, and heteropteran bugs) inhabiting intertidal Spartina marshes, we examined the association between herbivore behavior, risk of predation, and ultimately the relative impact of top-down (wolf spider predation) and bottom-up (host-plant nutrition) factors on the population density of each sap-feeding herbivore. A factorial experiment on open Spartina islets in the field (two levels of plant nutrition crossed with two levels of spider predation) showed that bottom-up and top-down manipulations differentially affected the various sap-feeders. Overall, bottom-up effects dominated in this sap-feeder community, whereby the density of all six sap-feeders increased when the nitrogen content of Spartina was elevated. By contrast, wolf-spider addition significantly suppressed populations of only the Prokelisia species and had little impact on the other four sap-feeder species in the community. Functional-response experiments and behavioral studies revealed that certain species (Prokelisia planthoppers) were at much higher risk of attack by wolf spiders than other sap-feeders in the assemblage and that risk of predation was associated with a species' particular "escape/defensive behavior." Moreover, risk of spider predation was roughly linked to the strength of top-down impacts in the field, because species with ineffective escape behaviors and a high risk of spider attack (Prokelisia planthoppers) were the only sap-feeders whose populations were suppressed by spider predation in the field. Thus, specific behavioral characteristics of the sap-feeders on Spartina influenced risk of predation and the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up impacts on their population dynamics. Notably, all herbivores in this system were positively influenced by elevated plant nutrition, only the common sap-feeder species (Prokelisia planthoppers) were adversely affected by spider predation, and it was the rarer sap-feeders in the assemblage that were least impacted by predation. These results call into question the overall pervasiveness of top-down forces and underscore the primacy of basal resources in structuring this community of phytophagous insects.},

abstract={Objective: To review the published socio-cultural determinants that put women in rural areas at greater risk of having an abnormal Pap test result. Design: Literature review. Conclusion: An Australian woman is at increased risk of developing cervical dysplasia if she lives in a rural area, identifies as an Indigenous Australian or is from a non-English speaking country. Being aged over 50 years, increases the risk of cervical cancer but not cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, which peaks in the 20-24 year age group. Other connections with cervical dysplasia relate to a woman or her partner's sexual history, her nutritional status and possibly even her personality type. Smoking, social isolation, high negative life change events and having lived a 'troubled' life are all identified in the literature as increasing a woman's risk of having an abnormal Pap test result. Receiving an abnormal Pap test result often leads to feelings of fear, anxiety, guilt, shock, vulnerability, powerlessness, depression, shame and feeling dirty for the woman concerned. Compounding these negative feelings are social, practical and financial difficulties that have to be addressed. It is argued that social and medical models of health must complement each other to improve the well being of rural women experiencing an abnormal Pap result.},

abstract={Rats use their vibrissae for a variety of exploratory tasks including location of objects and discrimination of texture. This study examines recovery in vibrissal function following a unilateral ischemic injury to the somatosensory cortex. Vibrissal function was examined in adult food-restricted rats performing on a two-texture discrimination device. Animals were trained and tested until the criteria of >80% correct choices was demonstrated on three consecutive days. Ischemic rats were constrained to use the affected whiskers by clipping the ipsilateral vibrissae. One group was tested after ischemia, a second group was trained before ischemia and then tested, and a third group was pre-trained and received whisker stimulation and tested post-ischemia. Na√Øve animals recovering from ischemia took longer to reach criteria than intact or unilateral trimmed control animals. Pre-trained animals with compression ischemia receiving whisker stimulation with sucrose water completed the task to criteria in the fewest number of trials. The results indicate that recovery of vibrissal function occurs following a unilateral ischemic injury. Histological analysis in animals without whisker stimulation indicates that the number of normal appearing cortical barrels following ischemia was inversely correlated to the number of trials needed to complete the behavioral task. This suggests that the natural recovery of the ability to discriminate textures is related to the degree of damage to the barrel cortex. The relationship between cortical barrels and behavioral recovery did not hold for the ischemic animals receiving whisker stimulation. This latter group demonstrated recovery despite marked anatomical lesions suggesting that the intervention influenced reorganization. ¬© 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The glutamate/N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist phencyclidine (PCP) has been shown to induce both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, as well as cognitive deficits, thus providing a relatively valid model of psychosis. Isolation rearing from weaning in the rat has been proposed as a non- pharmacological model of psychosis. The aim of the present study was to explore the validity of a combination of these techniques to model cognitive dysfunction associated with schizophrenia. The present study evaluates the effects of the novel antipsychotic ziprasidone and the typical antipsychotic haloperidol in their ability to reverse the cognitive deficit induced by PCP in isolation reared rats and social controls. Rats housed in social isolation (n = 25) or in groups of five (n = 25) from weaning were food deprived and trained to respond for food in an operant reversal learning paradigm. PCP at 1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg (intraperitoneally, i.p.) significantly and selectively impaired reversal task performance in both groups of rats. This impairment was not significantly improved following the coadministration of haloperidol (0.05 mg/kg, i.p.). Higher haloperidol doses (0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg, i.p.) were found to impair task performance, with the social animals being more sensitive than isolation-reared animals. In contrast, ziprasidone (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed the impairment caused by PCP. This was significant in social animals, while in isolates there was a non-significant enhancement in performance of the reversal task with ziprasidone compared to PCP alone. Thus, PCP produced a selective reversal learning deficit in rats, which was ameliorated following treatment with ziprasidone but not haloperidol. Rearing conditions did not influence performance of the test or the deficit produced by PCP.},

abstract={Purpose: FRESH START is a randomized controlled trial that will test whether a personally tailored, distance-medicine-based program will increase exercise and fruit and vegetable consumption, and decrease fat intake of individuals recently diagnosed with breast or prostate cancer. Methods: Early-stage breast and prostate cancer cases (N = 530) will be identified within 9 months of diagnosis from hospital cancer registries and large oncologic practices throughout the United States. These individuals will be sent a letter of invitation and screened for eligibility. After a baseline telephone interview, participants will be randomized into one of two arms that receive materials aimed at increasing exercise and fruit and vegetable intake, and decreasing dietary fat: 1) an experimental arm that receives a workbook and a series of six 4-page newsletters delivered every 7 wk and personally tailored on type of cancer, cancer coping style, race, age, self-efficacy, stage of readiness, and barriers and/or progress toward goal behavior (i.e., ‚â• 30 min of exercise at least 5 d¬∑wk-1, ‚â• 5 servings of vegetables and fruit per day, and ‚â§ 30% of calories from fat); or 2) a control arm that receives a series of nontailored health brochures. Follow-up interviews scheduled 1 and 2 yr postbaseline will determine short- and long-term efficacy and the effects of the interventions on other endpoints (quality of life, perceived health, etc.). Factors, such as gender, race, and social support, also will be explored to determine potential interactions with program efficacy. Conclusion: Given the growing number of cancer survivors, distance-medicine-based interventions addressing multiple behaviors and targeting this high-risk group have the potential to make a positive and broad public health impact.},

abstract={Traditional cardiology has taken a mechanistic approach to heart disease. But the new discipline of behavioral cardiology takes a broader view, concluding that heart disease is not inevitable, but develops largely from unhealthy lifestyles, such as smoking, overeating and physical inactivity, and from psychosocial stress. Physical inactivity and excessive caloric intake are also responsible for the epidemic of obesity, which is associated with a dramatic increase in the prevalence of diabetes. This increase in the incidence of diabetes may, in turn, reverse the recent decline of cardiovascular deaths in the US. A variety of psychosocial stressors have been implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease. These include occupational stress, anxiety, social isolation, hostility, anger, and type A behavior. There is clearly some overlap between these stressors, all of which may affect the heart adversely. Both the lifestyle and psychosocial factors can be altered by behavioral treatment, in which the patient and the practitioner work together. Unfortunately, various barriers can impair the successful implementation of behavioral treatment. These barriers include poor compliance by the patient, lack of skill in providing effective interventions by the health care provider, and lack of incentives within the health care system, particularly reimbursement.},

abstract={Perfectionism is a dimension which has been studied very little as a separate entity. It is not even considered as a nosological factor. No classification of the medical sciences underlines its importance other than to speak of a personality trait, of an aspect, or of a parameter. Nevertheless, perfectionism is related to multiple disorders such as depression (18, 20, 36), suicide (8, 16, 55), nutritional problems (11, 28), anxiety (3), obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (53), social phobia (2), as well as insomnia (46). Certain authors stress the possible role of perfectionism in the development or the persistence of a substantial number of these disorders (7, 22, 38). Given these facts, it is all the easier to understand the interest shown by clinicians and researchers in the subject. Better detection and evaluation of its impact on behaviour is important in putting therapies in place (6,53). Relationships between perfectionism and fear of failure have been approached (21, 51, 54). Correlations between perfectionism and high levels of state and trait anxiety have been demonstrated (23). The evaluation of perfectionism has been dealt with very little. Some questionnaires devote a sub-category to it, such as the Eating Disorder Inventory and the Irrational Beliefs Test. However, recently, it has been recognized that perfectionism is a multidimensional construct. Two Multidimensional Perfectionism Scales have been developed and investigated in relative isolation. Frost, Marten, Lahart and Rosenblate defined perfectionism as the setting of excessively high standards for performance associated with critical self-evaluation. Six dimensions are described: concern over making mistakes, high personal standards, parental expectations, parental criticism, doubt about quality of performance and organization. Internal consistency and validity have been established (25, 26). Hewitt and Flett (30, 31, 33, 35) have developed another approach where three dimensions of perfectionism are described: SOP (Self Oriented Perfectionism) related to high standards and self criticism, SPP (Socially Prescribed Perfectionism) related to the need of approval from others and fear of negative evaluation, OOP (Other-Oriented Perfectionism) reflecting a tendency to set high expectations for others and to evaluate them in a demanding way; this component is related, especially for males, to self-esteem, hostility and authoritarianism. Validity and internal consistency have been established too (30, 31, 35). The Frost and al's Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale and the Hewitt and Flett's scales are closely associated, except concerning the OOP. Because this component could provide new information, we have chosen the second scale, referring to the French translation and validation of Labrecque (45). EMP is the French name of MPS; it is a self-report questionnaire of 45 questions, in fact three subscales of 15 items rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale. MPS was administered to 617 first year students at the university of Li√®ge (table II). Differences are considered according to gender and experience of failure ie the fact of repeating an academic year. We realized a component analysis with promax rotation. Among the different possibilities offered by the scree-test the choice of a 4 factor solution stresses the original structure: SOP (14 items), SPP (12 items), OOP (9 items) and anti OOP (10 items); the last one is additional but allows for respecting semantics and saturation of the items. The first aim of confirming validity and internal consistency is satisfactory. In other respects the multidimensional structure of the concept leads to consideration of a positive, adaptive perfectionism and a more negative perfectionism, facilitating psychopathology (59, 60, 61). So it seems interesting to compare the different components of MPS in order to find an eventual sex-failure effect. The evaluation of perfectionism is obvious, considering it as a personality trait, but it can be used also in taking into account stress and its impact, for instance that of academic performance (29, 37, 39, 58). Conferring on MPS more pertinence in gender differentiation and failure evaluation is an other goal of this research. Through the particular choice of statistical results, sex and sex-failure effects can be demonstrated: a MANOVA underlines sex effect (Œª de Wilks = 0.96, p = 0.001) and sex-failure effect (Œª de Wilks = 0.98, p = 0.05). Structure of MPS is different in four groups (FE: women with failure, FnE: women without failure, ME: men with failure, MnE: men without failure). ANOVA show differences of MPS3, MPS1 and MPS2. Far more promising is the use of the LISREL method allowing for the construction of a coherent model of relationships between some dimensions of MPS and Test-Anxiety, approached here with THEE (test d'habilet√© aux √©tudes et √† leur √©valuation) French abbreviated version (49) of TASTE (Test for Ability to Study and Evaluation). In fact according to the literature of fear of failure, girls score higher on anxiety and procrastination but less on self-confidence. The structural model shows different pathways, more especially between SPP (socially prescribed perfectionism), T]2 (sense of incompetence) and T1 (anxiety). SOP (self oriented perfectionism) and SPP (socially prescribed perfectionism) by girls are very much correlated; it seems that they are more subjected to society and its exigencies of studying but consequently they are more at risk of anxiety and a sense of incompetence. SOP (self oriented perfectionism) by boys functions more indiscriminately of SPP (socially prescribed perfectionism) and is negatively correlated with self-incompetence; boys are more self-confident but they usually procrastinate more probably because failure expectancies would be particularly harmful for their self-esteem; consequently, failure should be related to something else than their own capacity; this maybe an explanation of the high rate of male dropouts and failure in the first year at the university of Li√®ge; also a factor explaining the female domination at the university.},

abstract={A central issue in ecology lies in identifying the importance of resources, natural enemies and behaviour in the regulation of animal populations. Much of the debate on this subject has focused on animals that show cyclic fluctuations in abundance. However, there is still disagreement about the role of extrinsic (food, parasites or predators) and intrinsic (behaviour) factors in causing cycles. Recent studies have examined the impact of natural enemies, although spatial patterns resulting from restricted dispersal or recruitment are increasingly recognized as having the potential to influence unstable population dynamics. We tested the hypothesis that population cycles in a territorial bird, red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus, are caused by delayed density-dependent changes in the aggressiveness and spacing behaviour of males. Here we show that increasing aggressiveness experimentally for a short period in autumn reduced recruitment and subsequent breeding density by 50%, and changed population trajectories from increasing to declining. Intrinsic processes can therefore have fundamental effects on population dynamics.},

abstract={Behavioral responses of prey to their predators can critically alter community dynamics. Whether or not a prey responds, clearly depends on the effectiveness of that response. The effectiveness on the other hand is predicted to depend on predator behavior. Actively searching predators can render the behavioral responses in their prey ineffective. Nevertheless, most studies investigating the optimal reaction of prey treated predators as immobile elements of the environment. I experimentally manipulated activity of poolfrog (Rana lessonae) tadpoles by keeping them at low and high food levels, and exposed them to three species of invertebrate predators (Aeshna cyanea, Anax imperator, and Dytiscus marginalis), whose activity also was manipulated through different food levels. Satiated, less active predators were more likely to kill hungry, more active tadpoles, but hungry predators killed hungry and satiated tadpoles about equally often. This result suggests that reducing their activity is a more effective strategy for tadpoles if the predators themselves are less active. On the other hand, against hungry, highly motivated predators, the behavioral avoidance strategies were essentially ineffective. Antipredator behavior is generally thought to stabilize the dynamics of predator-prey systems. The results presented here, however, suggest that the community dynamical consequences of antipredator behavior also critically depend on decisions made by predators.},

abstract={Several studies have shown that notoginsenoides improve diastolic function in hypertensive subjects, induce the fibrinolytic system in in vitro models and act as antiproliferative agents on vessel leiomyocytes. Our aim was to evaluate their effect on fibrinogen and lipid plasma levels compared with a well-known HMGCoA reductase inhibitor. Seventy Wistar male adult rats on a fat-enriched diet were treated orally with P. notoginseng pulverized root (43 mg/kg/day or 86 mg/kg/day; 20 animals per group), fluvastatin (3 mg/kg/day; 20 animals) or physiological saline (5 mL/kg/day; 10 animals). The ten rats on a normocaloric diet were also treated with 5 mL/kg/day of physiological saline. After a 28-day treatment, the rats were killed and their blood analysed with standard procedures. Treatment with 43 mg/kg/day of P. notoginseng or 3 mg/kg/day of fluvastatin showed similar activity in decreasing total cholesterol (-23.70%, -19.29%, respectively) and triglycerides (-21.59%, -18.55%). The most evident effect of P. notoginseng was the reduction of fibrinogenaemia in treated rats compared with the control values (-38.10%; p < 0.001), no dose-relationship being shown in this effect. Moreover, no significant variation in HDL cholesterol and glucose levels was observed nor did relevant behavioural changes occur in association with the root intake. Besides a moderate, non dose-related decrease in the plasma lipid levels, P. notoginseng appeared to induce a significant reduction in the rat fibrinogenaemia.

abstract={Background. Decreased food intake is an important risk factor for malnutrition, which is highly prevalent among geriatric patients. The emotional nature of the hospitalization experience and the complex organizational setting involved in meal production and delivery services in institutions increase the risk for decreased food intake. Everyday emotions are known to have a particularly strong influence on decision-making and behavior in the elderly, and have also been shown, in younger populations, to influence food intake and its psychological antecedents, such as quality perception and satisfaction judgments. The objective of this paper is to study the direct impact of elderly patients' everyday emotions on food intake and their indirect effects mediated by quality perceptions and satisfaction judgments. Methods. Thirty patients (20 women, 10 men, 65-92 age range) in a geriatric rehabilitation unit were observed on repeated meal episodes (average of 46 care episodes per patient) where they provided self-reports for emotions (positive emotions, anger, anxiety, and mild depressed feelings), perceived meal quality, and satisfaction. Food intake was measured in terms of energy and protein content. Results. The impact on food intake was favorable, and both direct and indirect for positive emotions, direct and negative for anxiety, direct and positive for mild depressed feelings, and indirect and negative for anger. Indirect effects were mediated by quality perception judgments but not by satisfaction, which was not significantly related to food intake. Conclusion. Results suggest that, given their impact on food intake, measuring and monitoring patients' everyday emotions may be an important innovative strategy to improve food intake of elderly patients in institutions.},

abstract={The foraging behavior of starved and non-starved adult and larval Coccinella septempunctata on groups of plants in the presence of Pandora neoaphidis-infected Acyrthosiphon pisum, uninfected aphids or a mixture of these two prey types was compared. In general results of these studies confirmed the results of previous work comparing foraging behavior on a smaller spatial scale in Petri dishes. However, behaviors were modified in response to spatial complexity, prey quality, and the host plant. Starved C. septempunctata adults and larvae fed for longer and consumed more aphids than non-starved coccinellids. Both larvae and adults fed on infected aphids and in some cases entirely consumed them. This was thought to be due to the ease of capture of infected (dead) aphids and the feeding stimuli provided by the presence of the host plant and, where there was a choice of prey, uninfected aphids in the environment. Both larvae and adults spent the majority of the time foraging in the upper regions of plants and visited more plants when they were not starved or when they were in the presence of less suitable, infected aphid prey. ¬© 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract={Basic research has revealed that the chemical sensory world of children is different from that of adults, as evidenced by their heightened preferences for sweet and salty tastes. However, little is known about the ontogeny of sour taste preferences, despite the growing market of extreme sour candies. The present study investigated whether the level of sourness most preferred in a food matrix and the ability to discriminate differences in sour intensity differed between 5- to 9-year-old children and their mothers, by using a rank-by-elimination procedure embedded in the context of a game. Mothers also completed a variety of questionnaires and children were asked several questions to assess whether children's temperament and food preferences and habits related to sour preferences. The results indicated that, although every mother and all but two of the children (92%) were able to rank the gelatins from most to least sour, more than one-third (35%) of the children, but virtually none of the adults, preferred the high levels of sour taste (0.25 M citric acid) in gelatin. Those children who preferred the extreme sour tastes were significantly less food neophobic (P < 0.05) and tended to experience a greater variety of fruits when compared with the remaining children (P = 0.11). Moreover, the children's preference for sour tastes generalized to other foods, such as candies and lemons, as reported by both children and mothers. These findings are the first experimental evidence to demonstrate that sour taste preferences are heightened during childhood and that such preferences are related to children's food habits and preferences. Further research is needed to unfold the relationship between the level of sour taste preferred and the actual consumption of sour-tasting foods and flavors in children. ¬© Oxford University Press 2003.

abstract={According to the optimal foraging theory, an animal is expected to enter into a given activity depending on associated costs and benefits. In line with this assumption, numerous studies have suggested that energetic reward is balanced by predation risk in foraging decisions. Therefore, the use of information about indirect cues of predation risk such as physical structure (e.g. cover, escape substrate) can give individuals a selective advantage. We studied foraging behaviour in the laboratory rat in an experimental maze; it allowed us to vary two environmental parameters: food availability and physical structure. In a first experiment, rats were offered a choice between two areas only differing in cover density. In a second experiment, the two areas only differed in food density. In a third experiment, we crossed both parameters. Our results showed that high "cover" patch was preferentially exploited (experiment 1) and that rats foraged more in the high food density patch (experiment 2). The last experiment showed that rats partially trade-off between cover density and food availability, even if the safest area was still preferred. Therefore, we suggest that foraging decisions depend primarily on safety needs, rather than food availability, at least when animals are not severely food-deprived. ¬© 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={Recent literature on embryonic and post-embryonic development, biology and behavioural ecology of juvenile cephalopods is reviewed. Emphasis is placed on biological processes. Life-history patterns and phylogenetic systematics, which are important for a proper understanding of the evolutionary history of the cephalopods, are only briefly touched upon. Egg sizes in cephalopods range from less than 1 mm to about 30 mm in diameter, so the hatchlings emerging from the largest eggs are bigger than the adults of pygmy squid, the smallest known cephalopods. Developmental durations from spawning to hatching range from a few days (for very small eggs developing at high temperatures) to one or possibly several years (for very large eggs developing at low temperatures). Such intportant differences notwithstanding, the morphogenetic processes are very similar in all cephalopod embryos, the major variant being the size of the so-called outer yolk sac, which may be rudimentary in extremely small embryos. Several questions concerning the timing of hatching in relation to the developmental stage attained, especially in terms of yolk absorption, need clarification. These questions concern the elimination of the transient closure of the mouth, the final differentiation of digestive gland cells, and the removal of the tranquilliser effect of the perivitelline fluid necessary for the onset of the hatching behaviour. Cephalopod hatchlings are active predators. They refine their behavioural repertoires by learning from individual experience in dealing with prey and would-be predators. There is no truly larval phase, and the ecologically defined term paralarva should be used with caution. Given the considerable resource potential of cephalopods, investigations into dispersal and recruitment are of particular interest to fishery biology, but they are also important for ecological biogeography. The related studies of feeding and growth involve field sampling and tentative age determination of caught specimens, in combination with laboratory studies to test food quality, measure feeding rates, and validation of periodicities in accretional growth structures (e.g. "daily rings" in statoliths).},

abstract={Most social foragers must search for food while avoiding predators. Group-foraging nutmeg mannikins engaged in a producer-scrounger game search for their own food (play producer) by hopping with the head down and search for others' food discoveries (play scrounger) by hopping with the head up. If the scrounger tactic is compatible with antipredatory vigilance, then an increase in antipredatory vigilance should lead to the detection of more joining opportunities, and hence to more joining by foragers. We tested this prediction as well as the extent to which stationary birds use head up exclusively for antipredatory purposes and hopping birds use head up for foraging purposes only. We observed three flocks of nutmeg mannikins searching for hidden clumps of food in an indoor aviary. We used a 2 x 2 factorial design in which both the distance to a safe refuge and the food distribution were manipulated. The use of head up by stationary and eating birds increased significantly with increased distance to cover. Distance to cover, however, had no effect on the use of the scrounger tactic or on the level of joining. We found no evidence of compatibility between the scrounger tactic and antipredatory vigilance. Our results provide the first unambiguous evidence for the existence of two distinct and incompatible patterns of vigilance for predators and for conspecifics. ¬© 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={The parasite manipulation hypothesis predicts that parasites should be selected to manipulate host behaviour to facilitate transmission to the next host. The bivalve Macoma balthica burrows less deep when parasitized by the trematode Parvatrema affinis. Shallow burrowing increases the likelihood of ingestion by birds, their final hosts, and therefore this has been interpreted as manipulation by the parasite. When unparasitized, M. balthica displays seasonal changes in burrowing depth, becoming less accessible to predators in winter. If shallow burrowing of parasitized individuals is due to direct manipulation by the parasite, the availability of parasitized individuals should be high throughout the year, or at least especially in the season when most birds are present and potential transmission rates are highest. We compared burrowing depths of parasitized and unparasitized individuals in a single population during seven consecutive years. Parasitized individuals showed reduced burrowing depths but, in contrast to the prediction, the effect of parasites on availability to predators was smallest, not largest, in the season with the highest bird numbers. The parasite P. affinis competes for energy with the host, and M. balthica with low energy stores are known to reduce depth of burrowing. When we included size-corrected somatic ash-free dry mass (as an estimate of the energy stores) in our statistical analysis, the effect of infection on burrowing depth disappeared. Thus the effect of infection on burrowing depth is likely to be an unavoidable, indirect effect of the channelling of energy towards the parasite, causing the starving individual to take greater risks in the acquisition of food. Since both the seasonal pattern and the magnitude of increased availability of parasitized individuals are inadequate, the increased exposure of parasitized M. balthica to the final host does not seem to represent an example of adaptive host manipulation by the parasite.},

abstract={Eating disorders are characterized by severe disturbances in eating behavior. This section includes two specific diagnoses: anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). AN is characterized by the refusal to maintain a minimally normal body weight. There are two subtypes: the restricting type (RAN) and the binge-eating/purging type (BPAN). BN is characterized by repeated episodes of binge eating followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics or other medications; fasting, or excessive exercise. Disturbances in body shape and weight perception are an essential feature of both diagnoses. Studies of AN among females in late adolescence and early adulthood have found a prevalence rate between 0.5%-1.0% in the general population. In recent decades, the incidence appears to increase. The prevalence of BN among adolescent and young adult females is approximately 1%-3%; the rate of occurrence of this disorder in males is approximately one-tenth of that in females. The argument for the study of the personality in the eating disorders is based in the observation of specific patterns of behaviors: in BN, a low tolerance for frustration and a peer impulse control; on AN, inflexibility and the need for having a severe control. Psychometric studies have consistently linked AN to a cluster of moderately heritable personality and temperamental traits, specifically: obsessionality, perfectionism, and harm avoidance. In this regard, it has been speculated that phenotype similarities between these traits of the anorexic's dietary restrain may be based upon shared genetic and environmental factors. While such traits may be exaggerated by starvation, their persistence after recovery supports the speculation that such traits may be risk factors for AN, rather than merely consequences of the disorder. Several analogies between eating disorders and depression, borderline personality, and obsessive-compulsive personality traits have been found. Nevertheless, it is very difficult to detect a single personality disturbance related to eating disorders. The presence of personality disorders in patients with eating disorders goes from 53% to 93%, and it has been observed that the presence of one or more personality disorders is more frequent in eating disorders than in the general population, but still more present in BN patients with a previous history of AN. Different studies in eating disorders patients had shown the presence of obsessive traits in approximately 27% to 61%, shy and dependence in 21% to 48%, and anxiety in 51% to 64% of the cases. Several studies had concluded that the predominant personality traits in eating disorders (69% to 87%) are a combination of obsessive traits, inhibition, and conformism. It has been described that almost 30% of the patients present obsessive personality traits and it has been demonstrated that the RAN presents a lower psychiatry comorbidity compared to any other eating disorder, even though these patients are more isolated and do not accept hunger sensations or distress. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Eysenck) and Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) had been used to rate personality traits of patients diagnosed with eating disorders. It has been found that social phobia disorder was more frequent in AN patients (14%-16%), followed by the dependent disorder (5%-10%), and finally, the obsessive-compulsive disorder (6% to 7%). It has been described that 30% of the patients have an obsessive personality. In fact, there are clinical similitudes between obsessive personality and eating disorders with restrictive behaviors. It is more common to detect several personality disorders in patients with BPAN while patients with RAN suffer of more anxiety and isolation. Typically, individuals with BN are within the normal weight range, although some may be slightly under or overweight. The disorder is uncommon among moderately and morbidly obese individuals. There is an increased frequency of depressive symptoms or mood disorders (43.5%), particularly dysthymic disorder and major depressive disorder. There may be also an increased frequency of anxiety symptoms or anxiety disorders (69%). Substance abuse, or dependence (18.5%), particularly involving alcohol and stimulants, occurs in about one-third of the individuals with BN. Probably between one-third and one-half of the individuals with BN also have personality features that meet the criteria for one or more personality disorders, specially the borderline personality disorder. Several clinical personality instruments agree to characterize BN patients as impulsive persons with a high sensibility toward interpersonal relationships with low self-esteem, unpredictable behaviors, aggressiveness, and poor impulse control. In conclusion, there are several personality risk factors for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, some of which are shared with other psychiatric disorders. Factors that increase the likelihood of impulsivity seem to have more influence for bulimia nervosa than for anorexia nervosa. Perfectionism and negative self-evaluation appear to be particularly common and characteristic of both eating disorders. However, while anorexia nervosa patients might have a higher persistence, bulimia nervosa patients seem to have an impulsive temperament. According to the conceptual model proposed by Cloninger, both anorexia and bulimia present lower scores in the self-directness dimension.},

abstract={Recent studies have shown that predator diet cues provide important information that prey animals can use to assess predation risk. Predator-na√Øve prey animals may even learn to recognize unknown predators when they detect conspecific cues in the predator's diet. We examined the importance of predator diet cues in the responses of juvenile brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) to chemical cues of predators. In our first experiment, we showed that charr respond to chemical cues of adult yellow perch (Perca flavescens) that were fed a diet of either brook charr or rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), but not to perch fed a diet of brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans). Responses to diet cues from perch fed both charr and trout may indicate that charr are responding to evolutionarily conserved salmonid alarm cues in the predator's diet. In a second experiment, we exposed charr to chemical cues from predatory northern pike (Esox lucius) that were fed charr, trout, or stickleback. Live-predation trials revealed that charr exposed to diet cues from pike fed salmonids exhibited higher survival than charr exposed to diet cues from pike fed a non-salmonid. These results are the first to document a survival benefit for prey exhibiting behavioural responses to predator diet cues.},

abstract={Epidemiological research has emphasized that adolescence is associated with some temperamental and behavioral traits that are typical of this age and that might substantially contribute to both psychological and psychobiological vulnerability. The contribution of the important developmental rearrangements in neurobiological and neuroendocrinological processes has received surprisingly little investigation. The present review summarizes recent work in animal models, indicating that adolescent rodents exhibit marked peculiarities in their spontaneous behavioral repertoire. When compared to adults, adolescents show an unbalanced and 'extremes-oriented' behavior, consisting of an increased novelty seeking, together with decreased novelty-induced stress and anxiety, an increased risk-taking behavior in the plus-maze, as well as elevated levels of impulsivity and restlessness. Age-related discontinuities in the function of monoaminergic systems, which are a main target of abused drugs, can perhaps account for such a profile. In particular, a peculiar function within reward-related dopaminergic brain pathways actually seems to underlie the search for novel and rewarding sensations, as well as changes in the magnitude of psychostimulant effects. The role played by early epigenetic factors in the shaping of novelty-seeking behavior of adolescent and adult rodents are also reviewed. Two examples are considered, namely, subtle variations in the hormonal milieu as a function of intrauterine position and precocious or delayed maturation of nutritional independence as a function of changes in time of weaning. As for spontaneous drug consumption, a prominent vulnerability to the oral intake of nicotine during early adolescence is reported. In conclusion, adolescence in rodents may represent a suitable animal model with enough face- and construct-validity. Actually, this model is able to show behavioral features that resemble those found in human adolescents, including vulnerability to the consumption of psychoactive drugs. ¬© 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={Two trials were conducted to test the hypothesis that broilers classified as good rather than poor feed converters (low vs. high feed-to-gain ratios, respectively) would show decreased activity (increased lethargy) and reduced fear of human caretakers. In both trials birds were reared to juvenile selection age when the 192 males with the "best" breast and leg conformation were placed into individual bird cages (46 x 60 cm), and their feed conversion ratio (FCR) was measured. In trial 1, birds remained in the cages for 7 d for assessment of feed conversion. During the feed conversion testing period, the birds were subjected to three behavioral tests. First, approach-avoidance responses to a novel object placed in the feeder were observed when feeding would be expected. Second, behavior patterns of individual birds were assessed by recording feeding, drinking, walking, pecking, preening, standing, and resting. Third, the 20 birds showing the best FCR and the 20 showing the worst were induced into tonic immobility (TI). Feed conversion was not related to either the novel object or the TI measures of fearfulness. Neither was FCR related to feeding, drinking, walking, or pecking. However, FCR was positively correlated with both standing and preening and negatively correlated with resting behavior. In trial 2, the FCR test lasted for 11 d. The birds were assessed for behavioral patterns (feeding, drinking, walking, pecking, preening, standing, and resting) as in the previous trial. As in trial 1, FCR was positively correlated with standing and negatively correlated with resting behavior. Contrary to expectations, the results of these two studies suggest that broilers with good FCR were actually less lethargic and no more fearful than those that showed poor FCR values.},

abstract={In this study, the hypothesis that Emiliania huxleyi, a cosmopolitan, bloom-forming coccolithophorid, produces chemical defenses against protist grazers was tested using four axenic strains of the alga. The putative chemical defense involves the cleavage of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) by the enzyme DMSP lyase to yield dimethylsulfide (DMS) and acrylate. Out of six tested protist grazer species, five (including ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates) showed lower feeding rates on E. huxleyi strains with high DMPS lyase activity than on low-lyase strains. Reductions in population growth rate were consistent with feeding reductions. These results suggest that high levels of DMSP lyase activity somehow promote reduced palatability, although covariation of E. huxleyi protein and carbohydrate content with DMSP lyase activity meant that prey "nutritional quality" could not be ruled out as a contributing factor. Additional experiments with the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Amphidinium longum demonstrated that (1) individuals need not ingest E. huxleyi cells to receive the "don't eat me" cue and (2) exposure to high-lyase E. huxleyi cells confers no harmful consequences in terms of the ability to feed and grow on alternate phytoplankton prey. Thus, factors promoting reduced grazing on high-lyase E. huxleyi are hypothesized to constitute signals rather than acute toxins. Furthermore, although cell surface carbohydrates (as assayed by lectin binding) showed few differences among strains, results of feeding studies indicate that the deterrent signal resides on the cell surface or in the near-cell dissolved phase. Behavior responses to such cues might play an important role in the outcome of encounters between protist grazers and their prey, with profound consequences for planktonic community structure.},

abstract={I developed two versions of the twin threshold model (TTM) to assess risk-sensitive foraging decisions by rufous hummingbirds. The model incorporates energy thresholds for both starvation and reproduction and assesses how three reward distributions with a common mean but different levels of variance interact with these critical thresholds to determine fitness. Fitness, a combination of survival and reproduction, is influenced by both the amount of variance in the distributions and the relative position of the common mean between the thresholds. The model predicts that risk-intermediate foraging is often the optimal policy, and that risk aversion is favoured as the common mean of the distributions approaches the starvation threshold, whereas risk preference is favoured as the common mean approaches the reproduction threshold. Tests with free-living hummingbirds supported these predictions. Hummingbirds were presented with three distributions of nectar rewards that had a common mean but Nil, Moderate or High levels of variance. Birds preferred intermediate levels of variance (Moderate) when presented with all three rewards simultaneously, and became more risk-averse as the mean of the distributions was decreased but more risk-prone as the mean was increased. Birds preferred Nil when it was paired with Moderate or with High, but preferred Moderate in the presence of Nil and High together. This reversal of preference is a violation of regularity, conventionally interpreted as irrational choice behaviour. I provide an alternative version of the TTM demonstrating that violations of regularity can occur when relative instead of absolute evaluation mechanisms are used. ¬© 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={The spatial position of young animals within a brood affects their survival, so that marginal individuals are at greater risk of predation. Spatial brood structuring may be caused by differences in offspring size, age, hunger, or active parental manipulation through aggression. Nepotistic manipulation of brood structure would confer fitness benefits for parents accepting nondescendant young. However, insufficient kin recognition has often been considered to preclude such nepotism in birds, particularly in precocial waterfowl. We explored the spatial structure of ducklings within broods of eiders, Somateria mollissima, a seaduck with frequent brood amalgamation. We compared the distribution of ducklings of different origin relative to reference females whose kinship to the ducklings was known. We also observed female aggression towards ducklings, to evaluate the role of parental manipulation of brood structure. We found a nonrandom distribution of ducklings within broods; a female's own young were on average closer to her than unrelated young were. We also found evidence for parental nepotism: whether the brood contained unrelated young was the strongest predictor of female aggression towards ducklings. The spatial position, hatch weight and relative size of ducklings showed no significant correlations with each other, suggesting that active parental manipulation may be needed to explain the observed spatial structure. Our study conflicts with previous anecdotal evidence suggesting that brood amalgamation in eiders results in the disintegration of parent-offspring bonds, preventing parental exploitation of nondescendant young. It also opens up the possibility that the spatial position of ducklings depends on their mother's status in the female dominance hierarchy. ¬© 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={Of the ionotropic glutamatergic receptors, the NMDA receptor is clearly implicated in the acute and chronic effects of ethanol; however, the role of the AMPA receptor in mediating the effects of ethanol in vivo is as yet unclear. Using mice deficient in the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 (GluR1-/- mice), we investigated whether the AMPA receptor had a significant role in mediating the effects of ethanol. GluR1-/- mice showed greater locomotor activity in a novel environment, but by the fifth day of repeated testing their activity was the same as that of wild-type mice. In contrast to their enhanced locomotor activity, on an accelerating rotarod GluR1-/- mice performed consistently worse than wild-types. With regard to the effects of ethanol on motor responses, GluR1-/- mice did not differ significantly from wild-type mice in ethanol's sedative or incoordinating effects. However, the GluR1-/- mice were insensitive to the hypothermic effects of a hypnotic dose of ethanol in contrast to wild-types; this effect was dissociable from the hypnotic effects of ethanol. Further, tolerance to ethanol developed equally for GluR1-/- mice versus wild-type mice. In terms of alcohol drinking behavior, compared to wild-types, GluR1-/- mice differed neither in the acquisition of voluntary ethanol consumption nor in stress-induced ethanol drinking, nor in the expression of an alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) which is used as a model of relapse-like drinking behavior. In summary, although the loss of a hypothermic effect of ethanol in GluR1-/- mice indicates a critical role for the AMPA receptors in this effect, the GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor does not seem to play a critical role in the etiology of alcohol dependence. However, changes observed in activity patterns may be related to the putative role of AMPA receptors in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. ¬© 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A new 'developmental' model for the origins of coronary heart disease and the related disorders of type 2 diabetes, hypertension and stroke is emerging. The finding that people who develop these disorders have altered growth in utero, during infancy and childhood provides a new starting point for research. The immediate prospect for prevention is through protecting infant growth and preventing accelerated weight gain in children made vulnerable to later disease by small size at birth and during infancy. Ultimately we need to optimize maternal diet and composition before and during pregnancy. Despite current levels of nutrition in Western countries the nutrition of many fetuses and infants remains suboptimal because the nutrients available are unbalanced or because their delivery is constrained by the long and vulnerable fetal supply line.

Additionally, the military has its own system of rules, regulations, and penalties. In essence, military service is a high-risk profession, and members cannot quit when dissatisfied.

abstract={The aim of this paper was to determine the frequency of occurrence of cardiovascular disease risk factors among the secondary school students in Ciechan√≥w. The study comprised 150 students attending high school, mechanical technical secondary school and a vocational school complex in Ciechan√≥w (province of Mazovia). All the examined students were 17-18 years of age. The study was in the form of an auditory questionnaire. It was conducted in February 2002. To evaluate the state of students' nourishment we used the so-called body mass index (BMI). For the needs of this paper, to examine the amounts of alcohol consumed, the following conversion factor was used: standard portion = 10g pure ethanol. The results were analyzed in accordance with the sex of the examined persons. Among the examined students no cases of obesity or diabetes were found. One third of the polled persons had inherited susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases. 27.3% of the polled secondary school students smoke cigarettes every day (usually 5-10 a day). This fact increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The problem of alcohol abuse concerned 6% students, but only every tenth of them declared being a teetotaler. Three fourths of the polled persons regarded the level of their physical activity as moderate. About one third of the examined students accomplish their physical activity exclusively within Physical Education classes. The form of exercise done on their own most frequently was slow and brisk walking. The students usually nourish regularly, eating breakfast, lunch and dinner every day. They eat fruit, cutting down on animal fats and salt. Most of the examined students are exposed to stressful situations, both in their home environment (56.6%) and at school (84.7%). Long-lasting and overlapping stress intensifies the risk of cardiovascular diseases. More than a half of the polled persons ascribe to themselves type A personality features, which makes them more susceptible to coronary heart disease, than type B personality.},

abstract={Objectives: To validate the concept of parent-reported picky eating using objective, laboratory-based measures and to identify both child and parental precursors and concomitants of picky eating. Method: One hundred thirty-five infants were monitored from birth to 5.5 years. Behavioral measures of picky eating were obtained from standardized feedings at ages 3.5 and 5.5 years in the laboratory and at home. Child precursors were measures of infant sucking behavior; parental precursors were disinhibition of eating, restrained eating, body dissatisfaction, and body mass index. Parentally reported attitudes and behaviors thought to be related to pickiness and parental concomitants were taken from the Stanford Feeding Questionnaire. Child Temperament was assessed by the Children's Behavior Questionnaire. Results: Picky eaters ate fewer foods and were especially more likely to avoid vegetables. Picky girls decreased their caloric intake between ages 3.5 and 5.5, whereas all other children increased their caloric intake. None of the included parental precursors was significantly related to pickiness. Picky eaters demonstrated a different sucking pattern with fewer sucks per feeding session at weeks 2 and 4. Finally, picky children displayed more parent-reported negative affect than nonpicky children. Conclusions: Parentally reported picky eating is associated with a consistent pattern of inhibited and selective eating beginning in infancy.},

abstract={In many fish species, some individuals are diurnal while others are nocturnal. Sometimes, the same individual can be diurnal at first and then switch to nocturnalism, or vice-versa. This review examines the factors that are associated with such plasticity. It covers the breakdown of activity rhythms during migration, spawning, and the parental phase; reversals of activity patterns during ontogeny or from one season to the next; effects of light intensity, temperature, predation risk, shoal size, food availability, and intraspecific competition. Case studies featuring goldfish (Carassius auratus), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), lake chub (Couesius plumbeus), salmonids, sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), and parental sticklebacks and cichlids illustrate some of these influences. It is argued that most species have a circadian system but that having such a system does not necessarily imply strict diurnalism or nocturnalism. Rigidity of activity phase seems more common in species, mostly marine, that display behavioral sleep, and for these animals the circadian clock can help maintain the integrity of the sleep period and ensure that its occurrence takes place at that time of day to which the animal's sensory equipment is not as well adapted. However, in other fishes, mostly from freshwater habitats, the circadian clock seems to be used mainly for anticipation of daily events such as the arrival of day, night, or food, and possibly for other abilities such as time-place learning and sun compass orientation, rather than for strict control of activity phase. In these species, various considerations relating to foraging success and predation risk may determine whether the animal is diurnal or nocturnal at any particular time and place.},

abstract={The response of foraging animals to human disturbance can be considered as a trade-off between the increased perceived predation risk of tolerating disturbance and the increased starvation risk of not feeding and avoiding disturbance. We show how the response of overwintering oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus to disturbance is related to their starvation risk of avoiding disturbance. As winter progresses, oystercatcher energy requirements increase and their feeding conditions deteriorate. To survive they spend longer feeding and so have less spare time in which to compensate for disturbance. Later in winter, birds approach a disturbance source more closely and return more quickly after a disturbance. Their behavioural response to disturbance is less when they are having more difficulty surviving and hence their starvation risk of avoiding disturbance is greater. These results have implications for studies which assume that a larger behavioural response means that a species is more vulnerable to disturbance. The opposite may be true. To more fully understand the impact of disturbance, studies should measure both behavioural responses and the ease with which animals are meeting their requirements. Conservation effort should be directed towards species which need to spend a high proportion of their time feeding, but still have a large response to disturbance.},

Nassarius reticulatus responded positively to all signals except the conspecific one. Positive responses to extracts were in the order (strongest to weakest): Gadus, Carcinus, Nucella, Mytilus, Asterias, Littorina. Starved Nassarius reticulatus buried in sand emerged rapidly to feed on crushed C. maenas, but remained buried when offered crushed conspecifics. These data confirmed the hypothesis that N. reticulatus would not respond positively to the smell of conspecific carrion, to avoid emerging from the substratum while neighbours were being predated. However, a second hypothesis, that strength of response to olfactory signal was proportional to taxonomic distance between N. reticulatus and the source of carrion was not supported by the data.},

abstract={In Australia, colorectal, prostate and breast cancers are the most frequently occurring cancers in our society, a pattern that is quite different from that of underdeveloped countries. While diet is largely responsible for these differences, technological advances mean that the solutions can be viewed as systematic, financial, lifestyle or technological. They range from those that require self-discipline and care for personal well-being through to those that are seemingly a quick technological fix that will work in spite of an unhealthy lifestyle. There are three main approaches available for prevention of these cancers: dietary lifestyle, chemoprevention and screening. It has been estimated that the potential for prevention by a healthy dietary lifestyle is excellent and might reduce the burden of breast, prostate and colorectal cancer by 33-55%, 10-20% and 66-75%, respectively. This should be safe and inexpensive and have collateral benefit such as reduced cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. But, population compliance with more plant-based, less calorie dense foods is uncertain, the most healthy are likely to be the most compliant and evidence for effectiveness when interventional programs are undertaken is disappointing. It is not clear how dependable the dietary approach would be where inherited genetic factors determine risk for one of these cancers. Chemoprevention, the administration of natural or synthetic agents that delay, slow down or inhibit the process of tumorigenesis, are still under development and study. Hormone receptor modulators for breast and derivatives of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for colorectal cancers seem to have most promise and may reduce tumour incidence or death by as much as 50%. These agents are simpler to comply with than changing dietary lifestyle and they are more potent, hence they may be of particular value in high-risk settings. But they are likely to be more costly and run the risk of adverse effects with few collateral benefits. Screening, or the testing of an individual for a disease when that individual does not have any symptoms or signs suggesting that the disease is present, aims to prevent or delay the development of the cancer. Screening impacts on mortality more so than on incidence, reducing colorectal cancer mortality in the range 15-60% and breast cancer mortality by 23-37%. Screening has the advantage of being effective in high-risk as well as average-risk groups and is an 'easy' solution for the person who elects not to follow a healthy dietary lifestyle. Nonetheless, it is expensive, demanding on resources, provides no collateral benefits and does not have the same potential to reduce incidence of disease as does the dietary approach. With these Western cancers, we are fortunate that there are options for prevention. At least choices are available and some will suite certain circumstances and personalities more than others.},

abstract={One method proposed for moderating the negative effects of habitat isolation is the preservation or restoration of linear landscape elements that structurally link isolated habitat remnants. An understanding of how animals react to landscape elements and move through the landscape is vital for species management and theory development. To achieve this understanding, detailed information on movement rates and specific movement behavior of individual animals in different ecosystems is essential. In an experimental study, we investigated whether individuals of Roesel's bush-cricket (Metrioptera roeseli) prefer to use corridors or move over the matrix when they leave a habitat patch. We examined whether movement rates and movement angles in corridors and matrix differed and whether individuals showed edge-avoidance behavior. Differences in these behaviors were analyzed in relation to the softness of habitat edges. We found that approximately 30% more individuals used the corridor than would be expected if dispersal behavior was random. All individuals using the corridor as a dispersal route moved to the end of the corridor and into the surrounding habitat, which is 1000% more than would be expected if dispersal was random. The edge type (hard or soft) did not influence whether individuals moved through corridors or the matrix. Individuals that moved through the corridor moved straighter but slower than individuals that moved over the matrix. A higher movement rate over the matrix than through corridors may be explained by an increased risk of predation, starvation, or dehydration in the open habitat causing individuals to move more quickly toward the higher vegetation. Our results suggest that individuals avoid the edge and the matrix and that the corridor is a preferred alternative for dispersal. We conclude that for this species, and probably other similar species of Orthoptera, linear elements in the form of corridors have a positive influence on the individual's dispersal through the landscape. This demonstrates the value of corridors in reducing the negative effect of habitat fragmentation on the persistence of local species.},

abstract={The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of barley-rich diets in the intestinal tract of rats. Four test groups (A-D) of 10 young male Wistar rats were fed diets containing 50 g/100 g barley extrudates (A, B and D) or mixtures (C) for 6 wk; the control diet contained no barley. The barley-containing supplements in the test diets were: A = cultivar "HiAmi"; B = "HiAmi" and "Prowashonupana" (50:50); C = "Prowashonupana" and Novelose (50:50); D = "Prowashonupana" and amylose from maize (60:40). These supplements contained 7-12 g/100 g Œ≤-glucan and 7-24 g/100 g resistant starch. Additionally, 5 g microcrystalline cellulose/100 g was present in all diets. Carbohydrate utilization (indirect calorimetry) was lower (P < 0.05) in rats fed the barley-containing diets C or D than in the controls. In the test groups, the following differences from the controls were found: greater food intake in the last 2 wk (P < 0.05); increased weight gain in wk 6 (P < 0.05); greater mass of the ceca (groups B-D; P < 0.05) and colons (P < 0.001) as well as masses of cecal (groups C and D; P < 0.01) and colon contents (P < 0.001); greater concentrations of resistant starch in cecal and most of the colon contents (P < 0.05); and more Œ≤-glucan in the small intestine, cecum and colon (P < 0.05). The numbers of coliforms and Bacteroides were lower than in the controls in groups B-D and those of Lactobacillus were greater in all test groups (P < 0.05). Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were higher in the cecal contents of the test groups (‚â• 800 Œºmol/g DM; P < 0.001) compared with the controls (‚àº 200 Œºmol/g DM). Similarly, SCFA were higher in colon and feces of the test groups. The concentrations of excreted bile acids increased up to 30% during the feeding period. The proportions of secondary bile acids were lower and the amounts of neutral sterols (P < 0.001) were greater in feces of rats fed the barley-containing diets for 6 wk than in the controls. Diets containing more soluble macromolecular dietary fibers such as Œ≤-glucans affected the excretion of bile acids and neutral sterols the most, whereas the fermentation of dietary fiber, including resistant starch, influenced the steroids in feces. These results suggest that dietary fiber-rich barley-containing diets have beneficial physiologic effects.},

The TDGS, the Child PTSD-Reaction Index (CPTSD-RI), and a questionnaire concerning risk factors related to the event (losses, injury, and witnessing death and injuries) were administered to school-aged children who had been directly exposed to the 1999 earthquakes in Turkey and to a nonexposed control group. Factor analysis of the TDGS yielded four factors: perceptual distortions, body-self distortions, irritability, and guilt and anhedonia. A moderate positive correlation was noted between the TDGS and the CPTSD-RI. Different sets of risk factors were associated with the different scale factors. The results suggest that the assessment of psychopathology in children following a disaster requires the complementary evaluation of symptoms of posttrauma, dissociation, and grief.},

abstract={Towards the end of the nineteenth century in America, a court that normally dealt with animal abuse found itself facing a very special problem: it had to discuss for the very first time a case of child abuse. It might seem a paradox to many that a matter of this nature should be discussed in a court set up for a quite different purpose, but it was not an error arising out of the lack of room in the civil court nor an error of competency: it happened to be the only place judged to be appropriate to discuss the rights of a child, mistreatment of whom was handled on a par with abuse of animals. In spite of the section expressly dedicated to children in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1789, the world had to wait for the Geneva Convention of 1924 before the first declaration of children's rights was promulgated. There were five main principles: the right to a healthy psychophysical development, the right to be nourished, cared for, returned to a normal life if demoralised, looked after and aided in the case of orphans. But only with the international Convention of children's rights of New York in 1989 was it possible to draft a text for the full, more comprehensive protection of infancy, two centuries after the first pronouncement on the occasion of the universal declaration of human rights. Two centuries of struggles and growing awareness of the problem of children (and at the same time of women and mothers) in the world, two centuries that have produced all over the world the complete idea of the child as having rights and being an active part of contemporary society. But the examination of the current situation brings us to the main problem: if a virtuous circle is not established between rights, infant culture and duties of adults, then the declarations of this century will have to wait many years more before becoming a practical part of our society. What then should be done to make sure that the declarations and conventions on rights do not remain a mere expression of principles? There can be no evolution in children's living conditions, nor protection of their rights, if we do not create a culture of infancy based on two premises: the rights of children and the duties of adults with respect to children. Today an exact and comprehensive knowledge of the rights of children is necessary above all starting with their right to freedom, experience, opinion, equal opportunity for development and education, defence against all types of abuse, and their right to a family. But at the same time it is necessary to act in the area of the duties of parents and adults: the question is one of building up a cultural system that includes the rights whereby the prerogatives of children are matched with corresponding duties of adults, a culture of values that responsibilises adults by way of a process of personal awareness and parent training. The adult must find himself personally in harmony in his relationship with life so as not to compromise on child training: the idea of a vulnerable future must be avoided; a future that is insecure and defenceless for children and adolescents who are future adults. A third factor must cater for this, namely modern society whose task it is to build structures (interconnected by means of an interdisciplinary project and through the possibility that modern technology also offers them) to supply opportunities and laws that favour and protect the personality of both child and adult. In this case considerable value would be taken on by the drafting of a "Charter of Duties of adults with respect to children and adolescents" that favours the birth of new standards and national and international conventions aimed at a new conception of society understood as a set of several parts, children, adolescents, adults, each subject of rights. By this approach the commitment of individual associations, organisations and institutions would start a process of social development which as of today is the last and only real revolution possible to improve the conditions of life of the person as such, and not only of the person as a citizen of one nation or another. In conclusion: no development is possible if we do not take steps as an international community to protect the first citizens of the world who are and always will bc children. In this sense, psychoanimation, which is a psychopedagogic-cultural intervention methodology based on a holistic approach and employs cognitive, creative, corporeal techniques to foster, in the individual and in the group, that "growth", that "awareness", that "responsibility" which have their "-roots" in self-awareness and in the possibility of acquiring cultural instruments that are scientifically and humanistically suitable to "act" individually and collectively, the "change" in human societies sets itself the diffusion of a Culture of Infancy and of Adolescence as an objective. In fact for Psychoanimation that means: ("give soul to the soul" employing all languages in interdisciplinary fashion for communication and social integration) in order to authentically permit knowledge, communication and exchange among human beings) the last "possible revolution" is that connected with the success, all over the world, of a Culture of Infancy and of Adolescence. What is the possibility that this converts into: "a world made to the measure of children": the children around us and the child within us!},

Among the predisposing factors, emphasis is given to a history of eating and/or mood disorders, personality traits, patterns of family interaction, alterations in brain monoamines and sociocultural overvalued drive for thinness. Dieting is the most frequently event present at the onset of an eating disorder. Nevertheless, dieting itself is not sufficient to precipitate an eating disorder. An interaction among risk factors and other precipitating events is necessary. Finally, the chronic or transitory course of an eating disorder is related to the persistence of distorted cognitions, to the occurrence of significant vital events, and to starvation-induced psychobiological alterations.},

abstract={Prolactin releasing peptide (PrRP) has been reported to reduce food intake in rats. We tested the effect of i.c.v. administration of PrRP-31 on food intake in both food deprived and free-feeding rats. We did not find any effect of PrRP-31 on food intake after single injections of up to an 8-nmol dose, but observed a marked decrease in food intake and body weight in rats that received a repeated twice daily administration of 8 nmol of PrRP-31. This effect was associated with an adverse behavioral pattern, indicating that the repeated high doses of the peptide caused non-specific effects inducing anorexia. We also tested several other behavioral parameters like locomotion and exploratory time, grooming and resting time, using lower doses of PrRP that did not cause the adverse behavior. Moreover, we carried out locomotor and sensory motor activity tests at the doses that exerted the most pronounced effect on the food intake. None of these tests suggested any specific behavioral effect of PrRP. We conclude that the behavioral pattern induced by PrRP is likely to be different from those induced by many other neuropeptides affecting food intake in rats. ¬© 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={Predation is a major force in shaping the behaviour of animals, so that precise identification of predators will confer substantial selective advantages on animals that serve as food to others. Because experience with a predator can be lethal, early researchers studying birds suggested that predator recognition does not require learning. However, a predator image that can be modified by learning and experience will be advantageous in situations where cues associated with the predator are highly variable or change over time. In this study, we investigated the response of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) to the underwater calls of different populations of killer whales (Orcinus orca). We found that the seals responded strongly to the calls of mammal-eating killer whales and unfamiliar fish-eating killer whales but not to the familiar calls of the local fish-eating population. This demonstrates that wild harbour seals are capable of complex acoustic discrimination and that they modify their predator image by selectively habituating to the calls of harmless killer whales. Fear in these animals is therefore focused on local threats by learning and experience.},

Much less attention has been focused on the psychological factors that motivate the continued use or abandonment of these critical weight maintenance behaviours. This paper reviews studies that have attempted to identify psychological characteristics that may be associated with weight maintenance and relapse in obesity. This is important because a better understanding of these factors may lead to the development of improved psychological treatments for obesity. The results of the studies suggest that a number psychological factors, such as having unrealistic weight goals, poor coping or problem-solving skills and low self-efficacy, may have an important effect on the behaviours involved in weight maintenance and relapse in obesity, and further research in this area is warranted. ¬© 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract={ACPC (1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid) is a partial agonist at the strychnine-insensitive glycine receptor site on the NMDA receptor complex, and a functional NMDA antagonist. A series of experiments was conducted to assess the effects of ACPC in a biased place conditioning paradigm. As previously reported, ACPC itself did not support either appetitive or aversive place conditioning. However, co-administration of ACPC (200 mg/kg) blocked the acquisition of place preferences conditioned using a variety of psychoactive drugs (amphetamine, cocaine, nomifensine, diazepam, morphine, nicotine). No tolerance was seen to this effect following two weeks of chronic ACPC administration. Overall, ACPC did not affect the expression of place conditioning when administered immediately before the post-conditioning test. However, these effects appeared somewhat variable between drugs, and further analysis showed that ACPC did block the expression of preferences conditioned with some drugs (diazepam, morphine, nicotine), but not others (amphetamine, cocaine, nomifensine). The effects of ACPC could not be accounted for by state dependence, as ACPC blocked morphine and cocaine place preferences when administered during both the acquisition and the expression phase of conditioning. In contrast to the blockade by ACPC of drug-induced place preferences, ACPC had no effect on the acquisition of place preferences conditioned using a variety of natural non-drug reinforcers (food, sucrose, social interaction, novelty). ACPC also had no effect on the acquisition of drug-induced place aversions (naloxone, picrotoxin). Thus, ACPC selectively blocked appetitive conditioning by drug reinforcers, without affecting either appetitive conditioning by natural reinforcers or drug-induced aversions. As place preference conditioning has been demonstrated to have high predictive validity for detecting compounds with an abuse potential in humans, this selective action suggests that ACPC might have some clinical utility in the treatment of addiction, without affecting responses to natural rewards. ¬© 2002 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

abstract={Orius majusculus (Reuter) is a polyphagous predator bug used to control western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande). As physiological factors may be highly influential upon the predatory behaviour of Orius spp. we studied the possible impact of starvation on the search path of this bug. Orius majusculus was maintained on a diet of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lep., Pyralidae) eggs in laboratory. Adults were collected immediately after the imaginal moult and were individually placed in Petri dishes with abundant food. Each adult was randomly assigned to one of the following five treatments: immediate observation or starved for 2, 6, 9 or 12 h prior to observation. The observation procedure consisted of placing a single O. majusculus adult at the centre of an empty arena. The displacement of each insect was recorded with a video camera until it had reached the limits of the arena. The recorded paths were digitized and the digitized search path was used to calculate the mean walking speed, the number of stops per second, the duration of stops and the diffusion rate. The results clearly show that, in comparison with unstarved bugs, insects that experienced 6 h of prey deprivation walked more slowly, stopped more frequently and for longer periods, and had a lower rate of diffusion away from the release point. In contrast, all search path variables returned to the levels measured in unstarved bugs in the group that experienced the longest period of starvation (12 h), whereas groups of O. majusculus that had experienced 2 or 9 h of prey deprivation presented intermediate values for all the variables tested. Starvation produced evident changes in the search path characteristics that we assume to be related to physiological states of hunger and energy availability. These behavioural changes related to physiological state could have consequences for the use of this pirate bug in biological control.},

abstract={Purpose: To evaluate self-reported quality of life in M√©ni√®re's disease patients by a multidimensional approach and to identify predictors of the results. Study Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Tertiary referral hospital centers. Patients: One hundred-twelve patients with M√©ni√®re's Disease. Main Outcome Measure: Questionnaires concerning quality of life: Short Form 12 (SF-12) including the Mental Component Summary (MCS-12) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS-12), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), the Function Level Scale (FLS) from the American Association of Otology's criteria for reporting results of treatment of M√©ni√®re's Disease, Vertigo Symptom Scale (VSS), Hearing Disability Handicap scale (HDHS), Tinnitus Severity Questionnaire (TSQ), and Sense of Coherence (SOC) Scale. Results: The M√©ni√®re's patients rated their quality of life significantly worse than did healthy reference groups in both the physical and the psychosocial dimensions. The SOC affected the results of the HAD, the MCS-12, and the psychosocial dimension of the SIP. The VSS affected the results of PCS-12, both dimensions of the SIP, and the FLS. The speech perception subscale of the HDHS affected the MCS-12, and tinnitus severity affected the HAD anxiety subscale. The results of the FLS correlated with the physical dimension of quality of life. Conclusion: The M√©ni√®re's patients experienced a worse quality of life than did healthy subjects. Vertigo mainly influenced the physical dimension, whereas tinnitus and hearing loss influenced the psychosocial dimension. Sense of coherence had an impact on the psychosocial dimension. The FLS was not sensitive enough to serve as an outcome of treatment results but needed to be complemented by quality of life instruments.},

abstract={The effect of progressive hypoxia on the structure and dynamics of herring (Clupea harengus) schools in laboratory conditions was investigated. The length, width and depth of schools of about 20 individuals were measured from video recordings to test the hypothesis that during hypoxia fish schools change their shape and volume. School shape (calculated as the ratios of length/depth, width/depth and length/width) did not change significantly during hypoxia. School length, width, depth, area and volume were all significantly increased at 20% oxygen saturation. Volume, area and width were more sensitive to hypoxia; volume and width were also increased at 25% and area at 30% oxygen saturation. The degree of position changing (shuffling) of individuals within the school was also analysed. Shuffling in normoxia was observed to occur largely through 'O-turn' manoeuvres, a 360¬∞ turn executed laterally to the school that allowed fishes in the front to move to the back. O-turn frequency during normoxia was 0.69 O-turns fish-1 min-1 but significantly decreased with hypoxia to 0.37 O-turns fish-1 min-1 at 30% oxygen saturation. Shuffling was also investigated by measuring the persistence time of individual herring in leading positions (i.e. the first half of the school). No significant changes occurred during hypoxia, indicating that the decrease in O-turn frequency does not affect shuffling rate during hypoxia, and that position shuffling in hypoxic conditions is mainly due to overtaking or falling back by individual fishes. School integrity and positional dynamics are the outcome of trade-offs among a number of biotic factors, such as food, predator defence, mating behaviour and various physical factors that may impose certain limits. Among these, our results indicate that oxygen level modulates schooling behaviour. Oxygen alters whole-school parameters at oxygen saturation values that can be encountered by herring in the field, indicating that oxygen availability is an important factor in the trade-offs that determine school volume. An increase in school volume in the wild may increase the oxygen available to each individual. However, shuffling rate is not affected by hypoxia, indicating that the internal dynamics of positioning is the result of the balance of other factors, for example related to the nutritional state of each individual fish as suggested by previous studies.},

abstract={Few studies have investigated foraging decisions in collectively foraging social insects with no studies in termites. In termites predation is assumed to be a key mortality factor. Therefore, we experimentally investigated the role of predation pressure in foraging decisions of the fungus cultivating, mound building termite Macrotermes bellicosus in two habitats of the Como√© National Park (Ivory Coast). We used the indirect approach of measuring the Giving up Density (GUD), which is the amount of food left when individuals stop foraging in a food patch, whilst experimentally varying predation pressure. Three different conditions were examined: (a) natural predation, (b) no predation, and (c) experimental predation through artificial removal of termites. In the shrub savanna, foraging termites responded to increasing predation with increasing GUDs. By contrast, in the gallery forest, there was no gradual response. Instead termites abandoned a food patch immediately after an attack by predators. Without predation GUDs were lower in the savanna than in the gallery forest indicating that food had a higher value in the former habitat. This, together with the differential behavioral responses to predation, was in accordance with high availability of food in the gallery forest and a limited supply of food in the savanna. Thus, according to our results termites traded off predation pressure differently, according to the availability of food in both habitats.},

abstract={Rationale: The relative reinforcing strength of cocaine can be characterized by the distribution of operant behavior during the availability of other reinforcing stimuli. Objective: To develop a procedure to rapidly evaluate the relative reinforcing strength of cocaine in monkeys. Methods: Monkeys were trained to respond on two levers under concurrent fixed-ratio 30 (FR30) schedules of reinforcement. Responding on one lever resulted in food delivery, responding on the alternative lever resulted in delivery of IV saline or cocaine (0.032 or 0.1 mg/kg per injection). Daily sessions consisted of three 30-min components separated by 10-min timeout periods. The availability of saline, 0.032, or 0.1 mg/kg per injection cocaine varied across components, and only in an ascending order. The relative reinforcing strength of 0.0032-0.32 mg/kg per injection cocaine was examined by substituting different unit doses for the training doses of cocaine. Effects of cocaine pretreatment on response distribution were determined by giving IM injections of 0.1-1.8 mg/kg cocaine 10 min prior to sessions of saline availability. Results: Increasing unit doses of cocaine monotonically increased the distribution of responding on the injection-lever and monotonically deceased response rates. Responding occurred predominantly on the food-lever during availability of saline or 0.0032 mg/kg per injection cocaine, whereas availability of 0.032-0.32 mg/kg per injection produced >90% of responding on the injection-lever. Availability of 0.01 mg/kg per injection cocaine resulted in approximately equal levels of responding on the food- and injection-levers. Presession IM cocaine injections dose-dependently increased responding on the injection-lever. Conclusions: Stable behavior can be maintained under concurrent FR schedules of food and cocaine presentation in monkeys, and the distribution of behavior on food- and injection-levers is dependent on the available dose of cocaine.},

abstract={The term ¬´ alexithymia ¬ªis derived from the Greek and means ¬´ no words for feeling¬ª and is used to describe a personality trait characterized by the inability to experience and express emotion. Alexithymia is a relevant feature in subjects with eating disorders. The Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS) is the more used scale to assess alexithymia. The TAS 20 represents the latest revised and short version of the TAS, with psychometric properties clearly superior to the other alexithymia scales. The TAS 20 is a 20-items self-administred questionnaire including three subscales: ability to identify feelings, ability to describe feelings and externally oriented thinking. The TAS 20 was sparsely used in obese people and its validity was not studied at the present time in this specific population. The aim of this study was to assess the internal consistency and the factorial structure of the TAS 20 in a group of obese women. Method - The TAS 20 was administred to 192 obese women willing to loose weight, aged from 18 to 60 years. Their body mass index (BMI) was ranged from 27.5 to 55,0 kg/m2. The patients also completed a depression scale (Beck Depression Inventory 13). Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to investigate the internal consistency of the scale. A confirmatory factorial analysis was performed to examine the validity of the initial three-factor structure in this population. The confirmatory factor analysis was conducted using STATISTICA5.0¬Æ Results - An exploratory factorial analysis using the principal components method was performed to search for a more relevant factorial structure. The global internal consistency value (Œ±) was 0,74 for the full scale. The Œ± coefficients were 0.78 and 0.67 respectively, for the two first subscales, (ability to identify feelings and ability to describe feelings), but was low (Œ± = 0.33) for the last subscale (externally oriented thinking). This result questionned the initial three-factor solution and conducted us to perform a exploratory factorial analysis. This analysis yielded a six factors solution, explaining 58.7% of the total variance, with the sole item 3 forming the sixth factor. The factor analysis yielding a five factors solution was retained. This solution explained 53.6% of the total variance. The first factor (22.3 % of the variance) was constituted by the majority of the first subscale's items (items 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14) and corresponded to the ability to identify feelings. Four items out of five of the second dimension ¬´ ability to describe feelings ¬ª (items 2, 4, 12, 17) constituted the fourth factor (7.1% of the variance) of the analysis. The third subscale (externally oriented thinking) was divided in three factors explaining respectively 10.7%, 7.5% and 6.0% of the variance. The first of them included the items 5, 10 and 18, the second one included the items 15, 16 and 20, and the last one included the items 8 and 19. We called these three factors ¬´ emotional avoidance ¬ª, ¬´ lack of interest in psychological comprehension ¬ª and ¬´ cognitive avoidance ¬ª, respectively. The parameter estimates of the confirmatory factorial analysis for this five-factor solution were: œá2 goodness-of-fit = 287.50 (df = 141; p &lt; 0.001), goodness-of-fit-index = 0.87, adjusted goodness-of-fit index = 0.82, root-mean-square-residual = 0.08. The different models were compared by testing the differences in the chi-squares. The five-factor solution was better than the other tested models. Discussion - The results of the present study indicate that the use of the TAS 20 to assess alexithymia in obese subjects willing to loose weight, requires a careful interpretation related to the features of this population. Exploratory factorial analysis suggests a five factors solution statistically and clinically more relevant than the three factors solution. The first dimension (ability to identify feelings) is retained. The second dimension (ability to describe feelings) could rather be linked to the common wishes of obese women to keep their own feelings to themselves than to a dimension of alexithymia. Our data suggest to divide the last initial dimension ¬´ externally oriented thinking ¬ª in three independant factors which we named: ¬´ emotional avoidance ¬ª, ¬´ cognitive avoidance ¬ª and ¬´ lack of interest in psychological comprehension ¬ª. Emotional and cognitive avoidance could be linked to the fact that our subjects wanted to loose weight and exhibited restrain eating. A positive correlation between restrain eating and alexithymia was previously reported. The last factor ¬´ lack of interest in psychological comprehension ¬ª would constitute an actual dimension of alexithymia: former studies found a negative correlation between alexithymia and psychologically oriented thinking.},

abstract={We investigated the ability of the water flea, Daphnia, to adapt the size and structure of its filtering apparatus as a response to experimentally increased biomass of inedible filamentous and colonial cyanobacteria in a large in situ enclosure experiment. Predator-induced phenotypic plasticity in Daphnia has been extensively documented, but only a small number of studies have focused on morphological changes induced by food quantity and quality. Here we show that Daphnia responded to increased biomass of inedible phytoplankton in its environment by enlarging the area and the mesh size of its filtering apparatus. These observations suggest that Daphnia responds to increased concentrations of inedible particles in the same fashion as it does in a very low food environment. In our study, daphnids exposed to a high biomass of inedible algae, in fertilized enclosures, had significantly larger (12-15%) filter screens attached to their third and fourth limbs in comparison to daphnids exposed to a low biomass of inedible algae. The mesh size also increased in the same conditions. These results suggest that daphnids used their phenotypic plasticity to respond to changes in their food quality and quantity. By using this strategy, daphnids can maximize their food uptake and hence compensate for the scarcity of suitable food encountered in very oligotrophic conditions or even in eutrophic conditions when phytoplankton communities are dominated by large inedible species.},

abstract={1. Patch marks that allow the subsequent avoidance of marked areas may be used by small animals to increase foraging efficiency. This study is the first to demonstrate the presence of a patch-marking system in insect predators. Furthermore, the marking system is found only in females, and factors such as hunger state and patch quality play a key role in determining whether a female will re-investigate a self-marked patch. 2. Females of the insect predator Orius sauteri avoided areas where the female itself had searched previously but did not avoid areas searched by conspecific females when deprived of prey for 24 h. There was no evidence that males use such a patch-marking system, indicating the presence of a sex difference in patch-mark use. 3. Females did not discriminate between patches visited previously and patches not visited when they were either well fed or when patches contained abundant prey. 4. The patch mark used by females was effective for ‚â§ 1 h and may be a reliable indicator of a recently visited area in which prey have been depleted. 5. These results suggest that O. sauteri females have the flexibility to adjust their behavioural responses to a previously searched area depending on their hunger state and the availability of prey in their foraging environment.},

abstract={Attempts to manage the outcome of pregnancy are ubiquitous among human societies. Those practices are becoming standardized as prenatal care under a biomedically trained practitioner has come to characterize the formal management of pregnancy. However, many women do not seek biomedical surveillance of their pregnancies, and, in many contexts, particularly in 'modernizing' or rural communities, prenatal care facilities are often poorly coordinated and under-utilized for a variety of reasons. This report illustrates widespread and increasing usage of biomedical services for prenatal care and birth among women in Ladakh, India, over the course of the past 20 years. This trend is at odds with that typical of other parts of South Asia, and can be attributed to the unique ecological, cultural, and historical characteristics of this region. These include the hypoxia of this high-altitude region, which poses substantial problems for successful birth outcome, along with the socio-ecology of maternal diet and work patterns that further compromise birth outcome. These risk factors exist in the context of the absence of involvement of traditional institutions such as Tibetan medicine or traditional birth attendants (TBAs) in pregnancy and birth, and government-sponsored efforts to establish institutions of modernity in Ladakh such as biomedical facilities. Hence, the penetration of biomedical services into the domain of reproductive health has been facilitated. Idiosyncratic aspects of the obstetrics practice itself, particularly the social position and personality of the obstetrician, have also played an important role in recruiting women to make use of hospital-based prenatal care and birth. However, despite broader usage of prenatal care and hospital births by Ladakhi women, there is little indication that birth outcomes have improved significantly. Reasons for this lack of measurable success are considered. ¬© 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper examines the complex and creative strategies employed in keeping beliefs, memories, and various other mental and bodily states effectively dissociated from normal waking consciousness. First, it examines cases of hypnotic anesthesia and hypnotically induced hallucination, which illustrate: (1) our capacity for generating novel mental contents, (2) our capacity for choosing a plan of action from a wider set of options, and (3) our capacity for monitoring and responding to environmental influences threatening to undermine a dissociative state. These observations are then extended to cases involving dissociated memories of trauma. The strategies needed to maintain a dissociated belief or memory are strikingly similar to those involved in preventing our lies from being exposed. Moreover, these strategies are complex, and they potentially affect seemingly remote aspects of a person's psychology. That point is illustrated by examining the dispositional nature of both memory and belief, the complex web of relations between our mental states and other elements of our psychology, and the interrelatedness of personality states and human capacities. ¬© 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

abstract={Rationale: At least 40,000 infants born each year in the U.S. are estimated to have been exposed to crack cocaine and, therefore, may be at risk for increased vulnerability to cocaine addiction. Objectives: The present study tested the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to cocaine significantly increased subsequent cocaine-taking behavior in mice. Methods: Swiss Webster male mice that had been exposed to cocaine in utero were tested at 5 months of age in the cocaine self-administration paradigm. They were the offspring of dams that received one of the following treatments during gestation days 8-17: cocaine (40 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg per day; COC40 and COC20 mice, respectively), saline with access to food ad libitum (SAL mice), or saline with access to food restricted to that of the COC40 dams (i.e., pair-fed; SPF40 mice). Mice were initially trained to lever press for a condensed-milk solution, were implanted with an indwelling intravenous (i.v.) catheter and, subsequently, allowed to self-administer cocaine (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg per injection) under a fixed ratio (FR) 1 schedule of reinforcement. Results: Latency for acquisition of food-reinforced responding appeared to be independent of prenatal treatment, as was acquisition of cocaine self-administration, which was found to be dose dependent. Both COC40 and SAL mice reached cocaine self-administration criteria at 1.0 mg/kg or 2.0 mg/kg per injection doses, while neither group did so at lower doses. It was also observed that, at each of the doses tested, a higher number of COC40 mice reached criteria for acquisition. A logistic regression analysis confirmed that the likelihood for acquiring cocaine self-administration was positively correlated to prenatal exposure to cocaine and the dose of cocaine tested. Conclusions: These data provide evidence, for the first time, that prenatal exposure to higher doses of cocaine increase the probability of acquiring cocaine self-administration at moderate doses during adulthood and modulate vulnerability to cocaine-taking behavior in mice.},

abstract={In recent decades society has been undergoing many changes and these have had a strong incidence on infant morbidity and mortality. Diseases that have practically vanished due to the impact of vaccinations and the improvement of the standard of living have given way to others derived from the changes in eating habits and life style; accidents, on the other hand, have come to be the first cause of morbidity and mortality after the first year of life has been passed. Strategies must be directed towards avoiding the causes of this new way of falling ill. We present a Spanish version of a game similar to "snakes and ladders" called "the healthy goose", which encourages healthy living habits. In order that the child should internalize safe habits by means of the game, certain squares in the game have been replaced by positive drawings, in which the child carries out healthy activities, receiving prizes for these, and others in which risky activities are performed, which are penalized. The areas dealt with are: habits (nutrition, sleep, study, games, etc.), Accidents at home, road safety (pedestrian, cyclist and automobile traveler), and swimming pools. The game starts with a child of 3-4 years and the goal is reached as a healthy adolescent. Given that the variation in personalities is enormous, we believe the family milieu should be the complement to legislative and educational measures and general campaigns in the means of communication, since it is what the child knows best and where he learns his deepest attitudes. This game could be a help to parents in this difficult task.},

abstract={Glucocorticoids have a bimodal effect on cognition, hippocampal pyramidal neurons and long-term potentiation (LTP). Transient increases in glucocorticoids improve performance at spatial memory tasks and facilitate synaptic efficacy, depending on the context. On the other hand, long-term elevations of glucocorticoids are associated with decreased cognitive performance, attenuated synaptic efficacy and neuronal atrophy. Elevation of glucocorticoids during aging is also associated with mild cognitive impairment and hippocampal atrophy. Caloric restriction (CR), a dietary manipulation which extends life-span in rodents, also increases free plasma corticosterone. Recent data suggests that CR attenuates many brain aging changes and increases resistance of neurons to toxins and injury. Thus, a paradox may be considered: if CR causes chronic elevation of glucocorticoids, and if glucocorticoids can increase the risk of neurodegeneration, how can CR be neuroprotective. We suggest that the neuroprotective effects of CR outweigh the deleterious effects of glucocorticoids. The neuroprotective effects of CR that are discussed here include decreased plasma glucose, attenuated free radical generation, alterations of the vasculature, increased expression of heat shock proteins and neurotrophic factors, and attenuation of age-related glial activation. ¬© 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract={Here we report an unequivocal arboreal coelurosaur, Epidendrosaurus ningchengensis gen. et sp. nov. This juvenile coelurosaur's third manual digit is extremely elongated, distinctively different from that of other known dinosaurs and birds. It represents certainly a type of adaptation previously unreported from the Mesozoic although the exact function of the third manual digit is unclear. The relatively long forelimb, penultimate phalanx of manual digit II, and pedal penultimate phalanges, are interpreted as evidence for the arboreal habit of Epidendrosaurus. Because Epidendrosaurus is more similar to advanced birds in some arboreal features than to Archaeopteryx, we suggest that the initial appearance of tree-adaptation in theropods was probably not directly related to flight but to other functions, such as seeking food or escaping from predators.

abstract={The interactions between humans and the ocean are significant, and necessitate more comprehensive study on an international scale. The world's oceans provide great health benefits to humans ranging from food and nutritional resources, to recreational opportunities and new treatments for human disease. However, recently, human health effects from exposure to substances present in the marine ecosystem such as synthetic organic chemicals (e.g., chlorobiphenyls, chlorinated dioxins and some industrial solvents), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), metals (both introduced and anthropogenic), marine toxins, and pathogens have been recorded and are of great concern. This paper reviews our state of knowledge of the interactions between oceans and human health and proposes indicators and a research strategy to investigate and monitor these relationships more closely. Four approaches to gathering information on indicators included here are: biomarkers; cellular pathology; physiological and behavioural responses; and changes in populations. All hold the potential to enhance our understanding of marine environmental quality and far-reaching effects on human health. Monitoring systems that include the rapid assessment of contaminants in the ecosystem and subsequent risk to human populations, with appropriate internationally distributed data bases, need to be developed and validated. Such tools would provide early detection of potential environmental threats, and enhance the ability to prevent human illness.},

abstract={Body size is one of the most important characteristics of any animal because it affects a range of behavioral, ecological, and physiological traits including energy requirements, choice of food, reproductive strategies, predation risk, range size, and locomotor style. This article focuses on the implications of being large bodied for Homo erectus females, estimated to have been over 50% heavier than average australopithecine females. The energy requirements of these hominins are modeled using data on activity patterns, body mass, and life history from living primates. Particular attention is given to the inferred energetic costs of reproduction for Homo erectus females based on chimpanzee and human reproductive scheduling. Daily energy requirements during gestation and lactation would have been significantly higher for Homo erectus females, as would total energetic cost per offspring if the australopithecines and Homo erectus had similar reproductive schedules (gestation) and lactation lengths and interbirth intervals). Shortening the interbirth interval could considerably reduce the costs per offspring to Homo erectus and have the added advantage of increasing reproductive output. The mother would, however, incur additional daily costs of caring for the dependent offspring. If Homo erectus females adopted this reproductive strategy, it would necessarily imply a revolution in the way in which females obtained and utilized energy to support their increased energetic requirements. This transformation is likely to have occurred on several levels involving cooperative economic division of labor, locomotor energetics, menopause, organ size, and other physiological mechanisms for reducing the energetic load on females. ¬© 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Neuroendocrine activation during stress is affected by many factors contributing to the variability of the stress response. The present study was aimed at evaluating long-term changes in hypothalamopituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis function and in hedonic behavior in adult offspring prenatally stressed by maternal food restriction, with attention on possible gender differences. Adult offspring were blood sampled via a tail artery cannula. Prenatally stressed females had significantly higher adrenal weights compared to males. Plasma ACTH levels, which rose in response to acute stress induced by handling, were significantly higher in females compared to those in males. A similar pattern was found in plasma corticosterone. The rise in ACTH levels was more pronounced in prenatally stressed rats though the rise in corticosterone failed to be modified. Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and proopiomelanocortin mRNA levels in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and anterior pituitary, respectively, were found to be unchanged. The present experiments failed to reveal a decrease in hedonic behavior in prenatally stressed rats. In contrast, in male offspring a tendency to a higher sucrose preference was observed. These data together with observed changes in hormone and CRH mRNA levels indicate that the gestational stress used did not result in a depression-like state in adult offspring.},

abstract={1. Ecological influences on social organization can best be measured by comparing populations of a socially variable species living in different environments. We examined causes of variability in social behaviour in a socially plastic small antelope, the oribi, Ourebia ourebi Zimmermann, in Ghana, West Africa. 2. In total, 161 individually identified oribi were observed at five sites along an ecological gradient through dry and rainy seasons. Behavioural observations and ecological data were used to test the relative influence of forage abundance and quality, habitat structure and predation pressure on female dispersion and male social behaviour. 3. Of nine ecological variables that were quantified, forage abundance and quality accounted best for variation in female dispersion among and within study populations. Specifically, female oribi formed larger groups and had smaller ranges where dry season forage was relatively abundant and low in fibre. 4. Male territorial behaviour differed among sites and was related to female home range size. Males were most active in territory maintenance where females had small home ranges, and males defended a female rather than a territory where females ranged widely. 5. These results show that variation in social organization among oribi subpopulations in Ghana reflects female responses to the availability and quality of dry season food resources and male responses to the variable distribution and ranging behaviour of females.},

abstract={The processes of food and fluid acquisition are necessary for the preservation of the animal's integrity. This review describes behavioral investigations concerning the role of one experiential factor in early infancy, that of, prior diet and its effect on the development of solid food preferences in cats. The results are presented in a broader investigative context, which includes behavioral data obtained both on precocial and altricial species. The emphasis of this review is on the two tendencies established by prior dietary experiences with nutritionally complete foods on later food preferences: the primacy effect and the novelty effect. The primacy effect is a preference of adult animals for their rearing diet, while the novelty effect is a preference for a novel diet. The latest attempt to explain these apparently contradictory effects is described. That is, if the taste environment is rich in many tastes of food in early life, the potential palatability of some foods may be masked or overshadowed; in contrast, if that environment is restricted to one specific food, the potential palatability of some foods may be revealed.},

abstract={Objective: To estimate the frequency of disordered eating behaviors among college students and associations by gender, ethnicity, participation in social organizations and college athletics and to determine whether responses to eight health behavior and attitude questions and body weight predicted a high score on the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT)-26, a screening instrument used to identify risks of developing an eating disorder. Methods: Subjects were a convenience sample of 1,899 college students (cleaned to 1620) who attended four classes, were members of 14 sororities or lived in five residence halls. Students reported height and weight and responded to the EAT-26 and eight items regarding health behaviors and attitudes. Results: Among women and men, 4.5% and 1.4%, respectively, reported previous treatment for an eating disorder, and 10.9% of women and 4.0% of men were at risk for eating disorders (scores ‚â• 20 on EAT). Among African-Americans, 8.3% of women were at risk. One group of women who lived separately in a social sorority had the highest risk of 15%. The frequency of ‚Äúweight concerns interfering with academic performance‚Äù and ‚Äúeliminating high fat foods‚Äù was moderately correlated to risk for disordered eating for both genders. Body mass only weakly related to risk for disordered eating and the association varied by subgroup. Conclusion: Students at risk for disordered eating report weight concerns interfering with their academic performance and include both men and African-Americans, as well as Caucasian American women. Sorority women living in separate residences might be at increased risk. ¬© American 2002 College of Nutrition.},

abstract={The aim of the present investigation was to compare temperament and eating attitudes in overweight versus "normal" weight samples of college students. In Study 1, the responses of women of normal and overweight status on measures of temperament and eating attitudes were analyzed. Overweight women were shown lower on self-rated "activity" and "oral control." Given the suggestive nature of the results, a larger sample including both women and men was obtained for Study 2. The results of the first study were replicated for the women, and overweight men were additionally found lower in "emotional distress" and "fear," with weight status related to all three aspects of eating behavior. That is, differences by weight status were discerned for both women and men on oral control, with overweight men also higher in "dieting" and "bulimia-food preoccupation." Further research on overweight men versus women, their perceptions of their own temperaments, and their attitudes toward eating, may be beneficial in understanding more about risk factors for the development of obesity. ¬© 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={Background: Little is known as to whether or not the seven personality dimensions of Cloninger's theory, particularly the three character dimensions newly included in the theory, are independent of the states of depression. Methods: One hundred and eight patients with major depression filled out the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) before and after a 16-week antidepressant treatment. Results: The level of depression, as assessed by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, was correlated positively to the harm avoidance score and negatively to the self-directedness and cooperativeness scores. During the treatment, the scores on these three dimensions significantly changed toward normal values in treatment-responders, but were stable in treatment-nonresponders. The changes in these dimensions were significantly explained by the change in the depression severity during treatment. Scores on novelty seeking, reward dependence, persistence, and self-transcendence were not correlated significantly to the level of depression and did not change significantly during the treatment in either treatment-responders or nonresponders. Limitations: The changes in the TCI scores during treatment in this study may reflect a non-specific tendency for the scores to change on retest. Conclusions: The results suggest that a depressive state can significantly affect assessments of harm avoidance, self-directedness, and cooperativeness in major depression. The administration of the TCI during a depressive episode may elevate the HA score, and may lower the SD and C scores. These findings highlight the importance of considering the state of depression before drawing conclusions about the TCI personality traits, when a patient with major depression is still experiencing a depressive episode. ¬© 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={In mammals, there exists only scant evidence of female mate choice in species mating on arenas, so-called leks. This has led to hypotheses of lek evolution that are based on benefits to females from reduced harassment by males, low predation risk, or improved availability of scarce nutrients. Here I report that female topi antelopes (Damaliscus lunatus) compete aggressively for matings with preferred males on central lek territories. Females fight at higher rates and more likely disrupt mating attempts of others in the lek center than elsewhere. Contrary to the predictions of the alternative hypotheses, food resources were insignificant, and harassment levels and estimated predation risk were higher on than off lek. These results clearly demonstrate female competition for mates in a lekking mammal in which a female chooses between males for the sole purpose of mating. The finding suggests that the forces leading to lek evolution in mammals and birds may be more similar than previously acknowledged.},

abstract={Elaborate secondary sexual traits offset the costs that they impose on their bearer by facilitating reproductive benefits, through increased success in intrasexual contests or increased attractiveness to choosy mates. Some traits enhance both strategies. Conversely, I show that spotted bowerbirds Chlamydera maculata may face a trade-off. The trait that best predicts their mating success, numbers of Solanum berries exhibited on a bower, also provokes increased intrasexual aggression in the form of bower destructions by neighbouring bower owners, which reduce the quality of the male's bower. At natural berry numbers, levels of mating success in the population are skewed, but levels of destruction do not vary with berry number. When berry numbers are artificially exaggerated, increased levels of destructions occur, but mating success does not increase. When offered excess berries, either to add to the bower or artificially placed on the bower, bower owners preferred to use numbers of berries related to the number that they displayed naturally. This decision is made without direct experience of the attendant changes in destruction or mating success. This indicates that bower owners may assess their own social standing in relation to their neighbours and modulate their display accordingly.},

abstract={Background: Eating when exposed to large portions of palatable foods in the absence of hunger has been suggested to contribute to overweight. Objective: This research evaluated whether young girls' eating in the absence of hunger was stable across a 2-y period in middle childhood, was associated with an increased risk of overweight, and could be predicted by parents' use of restriction in child feeding. Design: The participants were 192 non-Hispanic white girls and their parents, assessed when the girls were 5 and 7 y of age. The girls' eating when exposed to palatable foods in the absence of hunger was measured after they consumed a standard lunch and indicated that they were no longer hungry. Results: Eating in the absence of hunger showed moderate stability across the 2-y period for most of the girls. The girls who ate large amounts of snack foods in the absence of hunger at 5 and 7 y of age were 4.6 times as likely to be overweight at both ages. Parents' reports of restricting their daughter's access to foods at age 5 y predicted girls' eating in the absence of hunger at age 7 y, even when the girls' weight status and eating in the absence of hunger at age 5 y were controlled for. Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence that young girls' eating in the absence of hunger may represent a stable phenotypic behavior of young overweight girls. In addition, these findings are consistent with previous work indicating that parents' restrictive feeding practices may contribute to this behavior.},

abstract={In this study, we tested the hypothesis that baseline corticosterone levels increase with a change from constant to variable feeding schedules. Captive red knots, Calidris canutus, were presented with food that was either available during the same time each day (constant) or starting at variable times during the day. Food intake rates, frequency of aggressive interactions, and baseline levels of corticosterone were measured. In the majority of cases, red knots showed higher plasma corticosterone concentrations during feeding schedules that were irregular than when food was available at consistent times. These findings are supported by a previous study that showed that red knots take a long time to adjust to the newly offered, predictable conditions of their aviary environment. The frequency of conflicts in the different groups and (size-corrected) body mass were not correlated with average corticosterone level. The results are examined in the light of literature showing that increases in corticosterone in response to acute, unpredictable events mediate behavioral responses such as increased explorative behavior and memory. For red knots that have to find their food on the temperate-zone mudflats in Western Europe, an increased circulating corticosterone level may be adaptive during periods when the patchily distribution of buried bivalves and the burying behavior of such prey presents them with a variable and unpredictable food supply. ¬© 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

In parallel, psychological parameters such as irritability (p &lt; .05) and cognitive control (p &lt; .0001) increased, whereas feelings of hunger (p &lt; .05), externality (p &lt; .05), interpersonal sensitivity (p &lt; .01), paranoid ideation (p lt; .05), psychoticism (p &lt; .01), and global severity index (p &lt; .01) decreased. Prospectively, differences in body fat (percent) were correlated to nervousness (p &lt; .05). Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) differences were significantly correlated to sociability (p &lt; .05) and inversely to emotional instability (p &lt; .05), whereas emotional instability was inversely correlated to differences in insulin sensitivity (p &lt; .01). Discussion: Weight reduction may lead to better somatic risk factor control. Women with more nervousness and better sociability at the beginning of a diet period may lose more weight than others. ¬© 2002 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Refuge use by animals provides greater safety from predation. A refuging animal continuously must decide whether to stay in the refuge or to emerge into open habitat. This decision may depend on its energetic state and vulnerability to predation, both of which can vary with individual body size. We experimentally tested the concurrent effects of body size and nutritional (hunger) state on refuge use in the banded killifish (Fundulus diaphanus). Individual killifish were "attacked" in an open laboratory habitat (containing food) by either a trout predator model or a control model that did not resemble a trout. Frightened fish typically fled into a foodless refuge nearby. The amount of time that killifish spent in the refuge before emerging increased significantly with body length, but was not affected by their current nutritional state or the threatening stimulus (type of model). Smaller killifish were thus more risk-prone than larger conspecifics irrespective of their current nutritional state. Such size-mediated risk-taking behaviour has important consequences for individual fitness and implications for population and community composition and dynamics in nature.},

abstract={Background and Purpose - It has been proposed that the novel spin trap agent disodium-[(tert-butylimino)methyl]benzene-1,3-disulfonate N-oxide (NXY-059) may be useful in the treatment of ischemic stroke. However, there is little information concerning the neuroprotective properties of NXY-059 when administered after an embolic stroke. Moreover, there is no information available concerning the combination of NXY-059 with the only. Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacological agent for the treatment of acute stroke, the thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Thus, we determined the effects of NXY-059G, a generic form of NXY-059, on behavioral outcome after an embolic stroke when administered alone or in combination with tPA. Methods - Male New Zealand White rabbits were embolized by injecting a suspension of small blood clots into cerebral circulation via a carotid catheter. NXY-059G (100 mg/kg) was infused intravenously 5 minutes or 3 hours after embolization, whereas control rabbits received infusions of the saline vehicle. In tPA studies, the thrombolytic was administered intravenously starting 60 minutes or 3 hours after embolization (3.3 mg/kg). In combination studies, NXY-059G was given 5 minutes after embolization, followed by the administration of tPA beginning either 60 minutes or 3 hours after embolization. Behavioral analysis was conducted 24 hours after embolization. Results - In the vehicle control group, the ES 50 value (calculated as the amount of microclots [milligrams] that produce neurological dysfunction [impairment] in 50% of the rabbits within a specific treatment-group) measured 24 hours after embolism was 1.04¬±0.31 mg, and this was increased by 153% to 2.54¬±0.72 mg if NXY-059G was administered beginning 5 minutes after embolization. However, if NXY-059G was administered beginning 3 hours after embolization, the ES 50 was 2.01¬±0.40 mg. The rabbits treated with tPA alone had an ES 50 of 2.64¬±0.66 or 0.63¬±0.35 mg if tPA administration started 60 minutes or 3 hours after embolization, respectively. If tPA was administered after NXY-059G (started at 5 minutes), the ES 50 values were 3.15¬±0.50 or 2.66¬±0.82 if tPA administration started 60 minutes or 3 hours after embolization, respectively. Conclusions - This study suggests that NXY-059G is neuroprotective and can increase behavioral ratings if administered early after an embolic stroke. In addition, the study shows that NXY-059G can be used in combination with tPA without negative side effects. The drug combination can improve behavioral function and increase ES 50 values. However, during the short time course of the behavioral analysis, the combination was not statistically better than either drug alone.},

abstract={We study the consequences of omnivory on the dynamic behaviour of a three species food web under chemostat conditions. The food web consists of a prey consuming a nutrient, a predator consuming a prey and an omnivore which preys on the predator and the prey. For each trophic level an ordinary differential equation describes the biomass density in the reactor. The hyperbolic functional response for single and multi prey species figures in the description of the trophic interactions. There are two limiting cases where the omnivore is a specialist; a food chain where the omnivore does not consume the prey and competition where the omnivore does not prey on the predator. We use bifurcation analysis to study the long-term dynamic behaviour for various degrees of omnivory. Attractors can be equilibria, limit cycles or chaotic behaviour depending on the control parameters of the chemostat. Often multiple attractor occur. In this paper we will discuss community assembly. That is, we analyze how the trophic structure of the food web evolves following invasion where a new invader is introduced one at the time. Generally, with an invasion, the invader settles itself and persists with all other species, however, the invader may also replace another species. We will show that the food web model has a global bifurcation, being a heteroclinic connection from a saddle equilibrium to a limit cycle of saddle type. This global bifurcation separates regions in the bifurcation diagram with different attractors to which the system evolves after invasion. To investigate the consequences of omnivory we will focus on invasion of the omnivore. This simplifies the analysis considerably, for the end-point of the assembly sequence is then unique. A weak interaction of the omnivore with the prey combined with a stronger interaction with the predator seems advantageous. ¬© 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE - The present study was designed to determine whether hostility is differentially related to measures of glucose metabolism in African-Americans and Caucasians. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - The relationship of hostility, as measured by a subset of the Cook-Medley hostility scale (CMHOST) inventory items, to various parameters of glucose metabolism were examined in a young, healthy sample of male and female African-American and Caucasian volunteers. Fasting blood samples were collected during an inpatient admission, at which time the CMHOST was also administered. RESULTS - In the entire sample, the CMHOST was found to be significantly correlated with fasting glucose and insulin sensitivity, as measured by the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA). However, the relationship of hostility to these parameters of glucose metabolism was different in African-American and Caucasian subjects. Hostility was significantly related to fasting glucose in African-Americans and to insulin sensitivity and fasting insulin in Caucasian subjects. The relationship of hostility to insulin sensitivity and fasting insulin was partially dependent on BMI in Caucasians, but the relationship of hostility to fasting glucose was unrelated to BMI in African-Americans. CONCLUSIONS - Our data suggest that the relationship of hostility to measures of glucose metabolism is mediated differently in these two ethnic groups. Therefore, hostility seems to be part of a constellation of risk-related behaviors related to BMI in Caucasians but independently related to fasting glucose in African-Americans.},

abstract={Background: This article selectively reviews the biological bases of antisocial and aggressive behavior in children with a focus on low autonomic functioning, prefrontal deficits, and early health factors. Results: Low resting heart rate is thought to be the best-replicated biological correlate of antisocial and aggressive behavior in child and adolescent populations and may reflect reduced noradrenergic functioning and a fearless, stimulation-seeking temperament. Evidence from neuropsychological, neurological, and brain imaging studies converges on the conclusion that prefrontal structural and functional deficits are related to antisocial, aggressive behavior throughout the lifespan. A prefrontal dysfunction theory of antisocial behavior is advanced. This argues that social and executive function demands of late adolescence overload the late developing prefrontal cortex, giving rise to prefrontal dysfunction and a lack of inhibitory control over antisocial, violent behavior that peaks at this age. Birth complications and minor physical anomalies are selectively associated with later violent behavior, especially when combined with adverse psychosocial risk factors for violence. Cigarette smoking during pregnancy may increase the risk for antisocial and violent behavior in later life by disrupting noradrenergic functioning and enhancement of cholinergic receptors that inhibit cardiac functioning. Malnutrition during pregnancy is associated with later antisocial behavior and may be mediated by protein deficiency. Conclusions: It is argued that early health intervention and prevention studies may provide the most effective way of reversing biological deficits that predispose to antisocial and aggressive behavior in children and adults.},

abstract={The rarest and least understood of the muscarinic receptors is the M5 subtype. Recombinant methods were used to create mutant mice with a deletion in the third intracellular loop of the M5 receptor gene. Salivation induced by the nonselective muscarinic agonist pilocarpine (1 mg/kg sc) was reduced in homozygous mutants from 15 to 60 min after injection as compared with wild-type mice. After 18-h food and water deprivation, drinking was increased in homozygous mutants, but feeding was not increased. The mutant and wild-type mice had similar responses in tests of open-field exploration, seizures induced by pilocarpine (300 mg/kg) or hypothermia induced by pilocarpine (1-3 mg/kg). These results indicate that M5 muscarinic receptors are important for fluid intake and suggest that M5 receptors are involved in slow secretory processes. ¬© 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract={We present a dynamic programming model which is used to investigate hypothermia as an adaptive response by small passerine birds in winter. The model predicts that there is a threshold function of reserves during the night, below which it is optimal to enter hypothermia, and above which it is optimal to rest. This threshold function decreases during the night, with a particularly sharp drop at the end of the night, representing the time and energy costs associated with returning to normal body temperature. The results of the model emphasise the trade-off between energy and predation, not just between foraging options, but also between foraging during the day and entering hypothermia at night. The value of being able to use hypothermia represents not just energy savings, but also reduced predation risk due to changes in the optimal foraging strategy. Conditions which give a high value of hypothermia are short photoperiod, variable food supply, low temperatures, poor and scarce food supplies.},

abstract={Man has a major impact on marine environments through exploitation of fish resources. Fisheries can induce different selective pressures, either directly, i.e., through elevated mortality (which is often highly selective) or through ecosystem-level responses, as exploitation affects food availability and predation risk in both target and nontarget species. Responses to selection can be observed at two levels. First, at the community level, some species may suffer more from effects of harvesting than others; some may even increase in abundance. Responses by species to exploitation are associated with their life histories. In particular, species with late maturation at large size and with low population growth rate tend to undergo more pronounced declines than early-maturing species with rapid growth. Second, the phenotypic composition within species may also change. If phenotypic variability has a genetic basis, then fisheries-induced selection can result in evolutionary change in life-history traits influencing sustainable yields, behavioral traits (e.g., gear-avoidance behavior), and morphological traits. We discuss the possible implications of fisheries-induced adaptive changes for sustainable fisheries management.},

abstract={Fisheries managers have often suggested that survival of trout during the winter is a major factor affecting population densities in many stream ecosystems in the Rocky Mountains. In Wyoming, trout population reductions from fall to spring in excess of 90% have been documented in some reservoir tailwaters. Though biologists have surmised that these reductions were the result of either mortality or emigration from some river sections, the specific mechanisms have not been defined and the factors leading to the trout loss are unknown. This is a review of four studies that were conducted or funded between 1991 and 1998 by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to understand the extent of overwinter losses, identify some of the mechanisms leading to those conditions and develop management strategies to help avoid those impacts. Winter studies were conducted on tailwater fisheries in the Green, North Platte, Bighorn and Shoshone rivers to document trout population dynamics, assess physical habitat availability, evaluate trout movement and habitat selection, and understand the relationships between food availability and bioenergetic relationships. Results indicate that winter trout losses are extreme in some years, that trout movement and habitat selection are affected by supercooled flows, and that mortality is probably not directly due to starvation. The combination of physiological impairment with frequently altered habitat availability probably leads to indirect mortality from predators and other factors.

abstract={A trait database based on habitat, behavioural and morphological characteristics of invertebrates enabled invertebrates known to have differential vulnerability to salmonid predation to be discriminated. Among all of these traits the most important were associated with invertebrate spatial proximity to salmonids (macrohabitat preference), potential conspicuousness and accessibility (e.g. flow exposure, mobility, tendency to drift, trajectory and agility) and handling efficiency (body flexibility and size). Data on benthos assemblages and brown trout Salmo trutta diets collected over two consecutive summers in different macrohabitat types (e.g. pools, runs and riffles) of two Pyrenean streams demonstrated that: (i) decrease in torrential flow characteristics of habitats was associated with changes in invertebrate body shape and movement, and a decrease in body flexibility and tendency to drift; (ii) brown trout tended to feed on the most vulnerable invertebrates (e.g. those living in exposed microhabitats and with a high tendency to drift, agility and aggregation), except in faster flowing habitats. The results suggest that the potential vulnerability of benthic invertebrates increased with increases in flow (torrential) characteristics. Also, the database compiled on traits explained differences among brown trout diets, especially in slow flowing areas. ¬© 2002 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

abstract={Whether or not bird ornaments are a signal for direct (e.g. good parents) or indirect (e.g. good genes) benefits to prospective partners in sexual selection is controversial. Carotene coloration in Parus species is directly related to the ingestion of caterpillars, so that a brightly carotene-coloured tit may be signalling its ability to find caterpillars, a main high-quality food source for good fledgling development, and hence its parental abilities. If carotene-based plumage coloration is related to the good-parent hypothesis, we predict that yellow plumage brightness of tit fathers should be positively correlated to their investment in offspring provisioning. Here, we use cross-fostering experiments in blue tits (Parus caeruleus) to show that chick development (as measured by tarsus length) is related to yellowness of the foster father, but not to that of the genetic parents. Using these data, we were able to measure, for the first time to our knowledge, the separate contribution of genetic and environmental factors (i.e. parental plumage coloration) to chick development, and hence parental investment. Our data, which relate carotenoid coloration to models of good parents, and data from other authors, which relate ultraviolet coloration to good-genes models, stress that different kinds of coloration within an individual may provide different units of information to prospective females.},

abstract={Factors affecting dispersal and recruitment and recruitment in animal populations will play a prominent role in the dynamics of populations. This is particularly the case for subdivided populations where the dispersal of individuals among patches may lead to local extinction and 'rescue effects'. A long-term observational study carried out in Brittany, France, and involving colour-ringed Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) suggested that the reproductive success of conspecifics (or some social correlate) could be one important factor likely to affect dispersal and recruitment. By dispersing from patches where the local reproductive success was low and recruiting to patches where the local reproductive success was high, individual birds could track spatio-temporal variations in the quality of breeding patches (the quality of breeding patches can be affected by different factors, such as food availability, the presence of predators or ectoparasites, which can vary in space and time at different scales). Such an observational study may nevertheless have confounded the role of conspecific reproductive success with the effect of a correlated factor (e.g. the local activities of a predator). In other words, individuals may have been influenced directly by the factor responsible for the low local reproductive success or indirectly by the low success of their neighbours. Thus, an experimental approach was needed to address this question. Estimates of demographic parameters (other than reproductive success) and studies of the response of marked individuals to changes in their environment usually face problems associated with variability in the probability of detecting individuals and with non-independence among events occurring on a local scale. Further, very few studies on dispersal have attempted to address the causal nature of relationships by experimentally manipulating factors. Here we present an experiment designed to test for an effect of local reproductive success of conspecifics on behavioural decisions of individuals regarding dispersal and recruitment. The experiment was carried out on Kittiwakes within a large seabird colony in northern Norway. It involved (i) the colour banding of several hundreds of birds; (ii) the manipulation (increase/decrease) of the local reproductive success of breeding groups on cliff patches; and (iii) the detailed survey of attendance and activities of birds on these patches. It also involved the manipulation of the nest content of marked individuals breeding within these patches (individuals failing at the egg stage were expected to respond in terms of dispersal to the success of their neighbours). This allowed us to test whether a lower local reproductive success would lower (1) the attendance of breeders at the end of the breeding season; (2) the presence of prospecting birds; and (3) the proportion of failed breeders that came back to breed on the same patch the year after. In this paper, we discuss how we dealt with (I) the use of return rates to infer differences in dispersal rates; (II) the trade-off between sample sizes and local treatment levels; and (III) potential differences in detection probabilities among locations. We also present some results to illustrate the design and implementation of the experiment.},

abstract={Microphallus papillorobustus is a manipulative trematode that induces strong behavioural alterations in the gamaridean amphipod Gammarus insensibilis, making the amphipod more vulnerable to predation by aquatic birds (definitive hosts). Conversely, the sympatric nematode Gammarinema gammari uses Gammarus insensibilis as a habitat and a source of nutrition. We investigated the conflict of interest between these two parasite species by studying the consequences of mixed infection on amphipod behaviour associated with the trematode. In the field, some amphipods infected by the trematode did not display the altered behaviour. These normal amphipods also had more nematodes, suggesting that the nematode overpowered the manipulation of the trematode, a strategy that would prolong the nematode's life. We hypothesize that sabotage of the trematode by the nematode would be an adaptive strategy for the nematode consistent with recent speculation about co-operation and conflict in manipulative parasites. A behavioural test conducted in the laboratory from naturally infected amphipods yielded the same result. However, exposing amphipods to nematodes did not negate or decrease the manipulation exerted by the trematode. Similarly, experimental elimination of nematodes from amphipods did not permit trematodes to manipulate behaviour. These experimental data do not support the hypothesis that the negative association between nematodes and manipulation by the trematode is a result of the "sabotage" hypothesis.},

abstract={Mathematical models of predator-prey population dynamics are widely used for predicting the effect of predators as biocontrol agents, but the assumptions of the models are more relevant to parasite-host systems. Predator-prey systems, at least in insects, substantially differ from what is assumed by these models. The main differences are: (i) Juveniles and adults have to be considered as two different entities, as the former stay within a patch and do not reproduce, while the latter move between patches of prey and reproduce there. (ii) Because of their high mobility, food availability is likely to be less restrictive for adults than juveniles, which are confined to one patch. Therefore, a functional response to prey abundance may not be important for adults. (iii) Egg and larval cannibalism are common in insect predators. Therefore, the quality of patches of prey for their larvae determines the reproductive strategy of adult predators more than the availability of food for the adults. Here we develop a new model, based on the above considerations, which is suitable for modelling these interactions. We show that selection should favour mechanisms that enable predators to avoid reproducing in patches with insufficient prey and those already occupied by predators. ¬© 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={Under predation risk, prey may prioritize antipredator behaviours and sacrifice feeding. However, energetically constrained animals may choose to sacrifice or change antipredator responses and accept relatively greater risk in order to secure food. In this last case, the antipredator tactics chosen must balance safety and feeding in such a way that costs are minimized and benefits maximized. We studied the antipredator behaviour of pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) subjected to different periods of food deprivation, against the parasitoid Aphidius ervi (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). As the energetic internal stress of aphids increased, the predominant antipredator response changed from walking away and dropping to kicking behaviour, and parasitization avoidance decreased. Parasitoids did not show preference between food-deprived and nonfood-deprived aphids. Dropping and walking away reduced parasitization from 50 to 33%. These results support the hypothesis that the antipredator behaviour of an aphid changes as a function of internal stress. By performing less costly behaviour such as kicking under energetically constrained conditions, aphids seem to minimize their probability of energy shortfall. Given that aphid antipredator behaviour is a function of nutritional state, its occurrence under natural conditions may match host quality spatial distribution. ¬© 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={This study examined the effects of 2 manipulations - a brief regular period of human contact and diet - on the behavior of dogs confined in a public animal shelter. A behavioral battery designed to assess reactions to novel situations, and a test of responsiveness to an unfamiliar human were administered both prior to (pretest) and immediately following (posttest) the 8-week intervention period. Overall, the regular periods of increased human contact together with a diet that contained augmented levels of digestible protein, fat, calories, and animal-derived ingredients reduced signs of behavioral reactivity from pretest to posttest. In some cases, the comparison diet appeared more effective, but only for dogs receiving minimal human interaction. The results indicate that a combination of human interaction and high quality diet may positively affect the behavior of dogs in animal shelters.

abstract={Behaviour and microhabitat use of young-of-the-year Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) was studied in six trials of four subsequent days between 8 September-20 November 2000 (13.8¬∞C to 1.8¬∞C) in artificial flumes. When the temperature decreased, movements and aggressions by young salmon also decreased. Although the decline in activity was more evident in daytime compared to nighttime, salmon remained more active and aggressive during the day than the night throughout the study. Temperature also affected microhabitat use; salmon used gradually lower water velocities, were located closer to cover and increased their use of low velocity shelters as the temperature decreased. The most pronounced changes in behaviour and microhabitat use took place in temperatures near 10¬∞C. Juvenile salmon also changed their behaviour and microhabitat use gradually during the four subsequent study days of each trial. Salmon showed a diel pattern of behaviour, they were found closer to cover at night compared to during the day, irrespective of temperature. Temperature is a major factor affecting both behaviour and habitat use of young Atlantic salmon, fish can adapt to decreasing temperatures by minimising their energy expenditure and possible risk. However, other factors, such as food availability, may also interact with temperature in determining behavioural patterns.},

abstract={Animals living in environments of different quality will have different expectations of their future reproductive success and survival. This may affect the individual's risk-taking behaviour as manifest in the cost of predation. We investigated the foraging behaviour of starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, when perceived predation risk varied between patches. Short-term food availability varied between treatments and long-term differences in perceptions of environmental quality varied between groups of individuals. This corresponds to variation in the three components of the cost of predation (P): the predation risk (Œº); the change in reproductive value with energy gain (‚àÇF‚àÇe); and the reproductive value or fitness factor (F). The birds showed that they experienced a higher cost of predation while using the risky food patches (Œº component) and in the high food treatment (‚àÇF/‚àÇe component). Furthermore, birds from a high-reward habitat revealed a higher P than birds from a poor habitat (F component). The results show that the costs of predation are possible to tease apart by using behavioural indicators. The method presented allows measurement of fitness prospects of individuals, which may have consequences for conservation, for example, to identify low-quality habitat. ¬© 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Purpose. To examine the stages of change, decisional balance, and self-efficacy constructs in relation to fruit and vegetable intakes by young adults 18-24 years old. Design. A cross-sectional project was conducted by 10 states in January-July 2000 to examine decisional balance and self-efficacy in relation to stage of change for increasing fruit and vegetable intake among young adults. Subjects. in all, 1545 usable surveys were returned (response rate = 55%). More non-respondents were men and precontemplators than respondents. Sixty-one percent of respondents were women, 90.3% were white, and 49.7% were current students. Setting. Alabama, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Nebraska, New York, Rhode island, Oregon, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Measures. A telephone screening interview and a self-administered mail survey. Analysis. Analysis of variance, principal components analysis, cluster analysis, and X2 test. Results. From precontemplation to maintenance, a significant linear trend was found toward higher food intake and self-efficacy for fruits and vegetables. The patterns of shifts in the pros and cons across the stages resembled those of other health behaviors. The decisional balance items were further classified into five component factors that varied significantly in importance across the stages. Four subject clusters were derived (unconcerned, reluctant, exploring, and action-oriented); distribution of the clusters agreed with that of the five stages. Conclusions. This study supports applicability of the Transtheoretical Model for assessing fruit and vegetable consumption by young adults. Derivation of the four clusters implies the importance of including decisional balance and self-efficacy as outcome measures besides dietary behavior for evaluating the effectiveness of nutrition interventions.},

abstract={The possession of armour may affect escape behaviour in two ways. On one hand, by decreasing vulnerability to predators, armour may permit individuals to use habitats and behaviours that are too risky for unarmoured individuals. Alternatively, the possession of armour may have negative trade-offs on other traits involved in antipredator behaviour, such as sprint speed, thus constraining antipredator options relative to those available to unarmoured individuals. To examine these contrasting predictions, we examined species in the lizard family Cordylidae, which contains remarkable morphological diversity, ranging from completely unarmoured to heavily defended species. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicates that armour has been an evolutionarily labile trait. We found support for the second prediction. Degree of body armature was inversely correlated with distance run from a predator: heavily armoured species always entered refuges after short distances, whereas many unarmoured lizards continued to flee and could not be induced to enter a refuge. Possession of armour was also negatively related to use of vertical surfaces during escape behavour. These results were unchanged when analysed in a phylogenetic context. Thus, we conclude that the morphological requirements for active flight and armoured defence are incompatible. Heavily armoured species are bulky, have short legs and run more slowly than less armoured species. Rather than constituting an alternative to behavioural antipredator tactics, we conclude that the possession of armour is part of an antipredator syndrome that includes habitat use and behaviour as well as morphology. ¬© 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={Objective: Most studies of dietary change during aging have focused on maintaining adequate intake by impaired elderly, and little is known about factors affecting dietary change for preventive purposes in older individuals. The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine the major behavioral influences on older women's adherence to a dietary fat reduction intervention. Method: A diverse sample of 92 women aged 55 to 80 was recruited from two East Coast sites of the Women's Health Initiative. All the women were participating in the dietary modification arm of WHI, had received the same dietary instruction, and were in the maintenance phase of the intervention. The women were classified by nutritionists as adherent or nonadherent to a diet limiting fat intake to <20% of total calories. Focus groups and telephone interviews were conducted, and textual data were coded and sorted using content analysis techniques within the four categories of the Stimuli-Organismic Factors-Response Repertoire-Consequences (SORC) behavioral model. Frequencies of responses within categories were tabulated and compared qualitatively. Results: Adherent women were more likely to report assertiveness, a lifelong commitment to reduced dietary fat, satisfaction with their lifestyle changes, and having applicable knowledge and skills. Nonadherent women reported more difficulty resisting negative emotions and prior food preferences and habits; they were also more concerned about negative responses from others. Conclusions: Enhancing adherence of older women to a dietary fat reduction program will require shifting priorities away from conforming to social pressure and using high-fat foods for personal satisfaction and moving toward enhancing motivation and commitment to long-term health.},

abstract={Shared parental care resulting from brood amalgamation is often considered beneficial to parents. However, the benefit of grouping (a decline in individual vigilance despite an increase in collective vigilance, with a concomitant increase in individual feeding time) has not been evoked as a factor promoting shared care. Eider females, Somateria mollissima, are subject to substantial energetic costs during breeding, and sometimes share brood-rearing duties. We compared the activity budgets and feeding behaviour of lone tenders and multifemale tenders. We also measured the collective vigilance of multifemale tenders and examined whether the coordination of feeding activity among females changes with time. As expected, the proportion of time spent feeding increased, and the proportion of time spent vigilant decreased, as the number of females attending the brood increased. None the less, the collective vigilance of multifemale tenders was at least 20% higher than the vigilance of lone tenders. Furthermore, multifemale tending allowed females to feed more optimally, as dive duration increased with the number of females tending the brood. The level of parental investment by individual females after hatching of the eggs is therefore related to the number of tending females and, based on previous work, a female's body condition when the eggs hatch is also logically connected with the number of tending females. Whether females sharing brood care on a permanent basis coordinate their feeding activity, so as to increase the potential protection of ducklings against predation, remains equivocal. ¬© 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={Objective: To compare children's food preferences longitudinally and identify factors related to food preferences. Design: Mothers completed the Food Preference Questionnaire for children at 2 to 3 years of age (T1), 4 years (T2), and 8 years (T3) and for themselves at T 1 and T3. Both groups completed a Food Neophobia Scale at T3. Subjects: 70 child/mother pairs who had participated continuously in the longitudinal study. Statistical analyses performed: Changes in food preferences over time were tested with paired t tests and correlations. Consistency percentages were calculated by summing the consistent matches (like/like) for each food between two time periods. Similarly, concordance percentages were calculated for child/mother pairs by summing the concordant matches for each food. General linear models were developed to identify influences on children's food preferences. Results: Although children liked most foods, the number of liked foods did not change significantly during the 5 to 5.7 years of the study. The strongest predictors of the number of foods liked at age 8 years (R2=0.74) were the number liked at 4 years (P&lt;.0001) and the food neophobia score (P=.0003). Newly tasted foods were more likely to be accepted between T1 and T2 than T2 and T3. Mothers' and children's food preferences were significantly but moderately related. Foods disliked by mothers tended not to be offered to children. Applications/Conclusions: The important role of children's early food preferences is confirmed by this study. Mothers influence children via their own preferences, which may limit foods offered to children.},

abstract={We artificially invaded a set of small islands with the large lizard Leiocephalus carinatus to determine effects on food-web elements including an intermediate predator, the lizard Anolis sagrei; the latter was previously found to have major, mostly direct effects on web spiders, as well as detectable indirect effects on aerial arthropods (including parasitoids) and leaf damage. In addition to these food-web elements, we monitored ground-surface arthropods; they are expected to be affected directly, as well as indirectly via A. sagrei, by L. carinatus. Five islands were randomly selected for invasion while six others served as controls. In addition, four islands without A. sagrei were monitored to determine the natural state of the sagrei-free food web. We also monitored a variety of A. sagrei's traits, from behavioral through physiological and demographic to morphological, to elucidate the mechanisms whereby L. carinatus might affect the smaller lizard and to evaluate trait-mediated as well as density-mediated effects. Comparison of unmanipulated islands with and without A. sagrei showed that A. sagrei appeared to be affecting web-spider density and diversity, numbers of small aerial arthropods, number of large ground-surface arthropods, and two types of leaf damage, scars and mines. All effects were negative save one: Small aerial arthropods were more abundant with A. sagrei; this variable and parasitoid abundance were negatively related to web-spider density, implicating an indirect effect pathway from A. sagrei via web spiders. Introduction of L. carinatus had major and immediate effects on A. sagrei density and perch height; effects on perch diameter, percentage hatchlings, and the width of the body-size distribution followed over time. Behavioral shifts in habitat use continued to the end of the experiment, after changes in population density had mostly leveled off. Adult-male body condition became poorer after introduction of L. carinatus. Among islands, percentage use of the ground was correlated negatively with percentage vegetated area of the island and positively with premanipulation relative hindlimb length. We hypothesize that longer-legged individuals do better on the ground because they are faster there. Conditional evidence for an increase in adult-male relative hindlimb length suggested that, when the ground-inhabiting L. carinatus was introduced, such individuals were differentially able to escape predation. Introduction of L. carinatus significantly reversed A. sagrei's effect on number of species and density of web spiders but had no other major effects on lower level food-web elements. Thus, a relatively short-chained (two links) effect, with a relatively strong second link (A. sagrei on spiders), showed the greatest indirect effect of the manipulation. Another potentially strong indirect effect, that on large ground-surface arthropods, did not occur, possibly because of compensatory (direct) predation by L. carinatus. Thus presence of omnivory may also be relevant to whether reversal of effects occurs. Although most A. sagrei effects were not reversed in the time available for the experiment, this may be typical, as natural L. carinatus colonizations can dwindle away to extinction over about the same time span, producing at best only short-term indirect effects. Population-density estimates from other sites and comparisons to other experimental studies suggest that, in general, predators on Anolis may have erratic effects in space and time.},

abstract={Foraging decisions may reflect a trade-off between food intake and safety and can also be influenced by the animal's internal state. Foraging in the web-building spider Stegodyphus lineatus depends on a capture web associated with a retreat (the nest). The relocation of nests, including the take-over of conspecific nests, may be viewed as a foraing decision, which depends on risk of exposure, cost of silk production and hunger state. We investigated a possible state-dependent trade-off in nest site choice of S. lineatus spiderlings. The philopatric nature of S. lineatus implies a high risk of encounters with potentially cannibalistic conspecifics and a potential loss of inclusive fitness because encountered conspecifics are likely to be kin. To test for state dependence of foraging decisions, we compared preferences of well-fed and hungry spiders for their own nests and those of siblings and nonsiblings. We expected satiated spiders to prefer their own to conspecific nests and hungry spiders to choose the risky option of a conspecific nest. Since S. lineatus is less aggressive towards kin, we tested the ability of spiders to discriminate kin by silk-bound cues. Because of this reduced aggression, preference for kin nests should be safer than preference for nonkin nests. A strong preference for self-nests demonstrated self-recognition in well-fed spiders. However, neither well-fed nor hungry spiders discriminated between nests of siblings and nonsiblings. Well-fed spiders preferred self-nests to empty chambers, but showed no discrimination between nonself-nests and empty chambers. Hungry spiders showed a reduced preference for self-nests, suggesting that hunger elicits a more risky foraging strategy. A tendency of hungry spiders to adopt the nests of conspecific spiders may reflect a silk-saving strategy. We conclude that S. lineatus spiders show state-dependent decision making in nest site selection. ¬© 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

This theoretical and clinical reflection analysis is carried out taking into account recent research into animal and human learning applied to the clinical practice of alcoholism. We suggest the need for greater flexibility with regard to the inclusion of the different alternatives in the treatment, taking into consideration the therapeutical goals of the patient himself/herself. In addition, we assume that controlled drinking and interventions in damage and risk reduction are based on the same principles with regard to the modification of the consumption response parameters and associated behaviours, although they have a different purpose - moderate and controlled consumption in one case, and damage and risk reduction in the other.},

abstract={Few data exist on post-release survival of rehabilitated oiled wildlife, fueling the controversy surrounding wildlife rehabilitation efforts following oil spills. In 1998, we initiated a captive study to assess the effects of exposure to crude oil on physiological and behavioral processes in coastal river otters (Lontra canadensis). This study provided the opportunity to explore the effects of oiling and rehabilitation separately from those of captivity by comparing post-release survival rates of control and oiled river otters held in captivity, with those of wild free-ranging otters. Fifteen wild-caught male river otters were assigned to 3 groups, of which 2 were given weathered crude oil in food (i.e., control, low dose, high dose) under controlled conditions at the Alaska Sealife Center. At the end of the rehabilitation period, animals were surgically implanted with radiotransmitters and released at the original site of capture or at an adjacent site in Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA. Concurrendy, survival of 55 coastal river otters radiotagged in the wild was monitored in the same geographical area. Our results indicated that the captive, newly released animals (i.e., experimental otters) had a significantly lower survival rate than wild animals. We found no effect from exposure to hydrocarbons once rehabilitation was accomplished, but noted that lower levels of hemoglobin (a likely condition of rehabilitated oiled wildlife) were negatively correlated with survival and likely resulted in death from starvation. Therefore, rehabilitation may be a viable option for animals that have the potential for full recover. We detected no relationship between location of release or estimated age of the experimental animals and their subsequent survival, although these results may be an artifact of small sample sizes. We recommend that future studies evaluate the effects of the length of captivity on post-release survival to produce additional guidelines for release. Information on the potential for full recovery and the length of the captive period required for achieving this rehabilitation will provide professionals with tools necessary for deciding whether to rehabilitate or euthanize individual animals.},

abstract={Birds species, like plants and other animals are facing an unprecedented decline. About 11% of bird species are threatened with extinction. Captive breeding as a conservation tool can be used as a substitute for wild populations in research and education, to provide demographic and genetic reservoirs for reinforcing or founding wild populations, and as a last resort for species that have no immediate opportunity for survival in nature. Candidates for captive propagation are zoos, private breeders, state agencies, conservation foundations and research centres within or outside of universities. The problems in managing endangered species have motivated conservation biologists to conduct research in many disciplines such as behaviour, physiology, endocrinology, genetics, husbandry, nutrition and veterinary medicine. In addition, an increasing number of techniques for increasing reproductive success, improving genetic management and enhancing reintroduction success have been employed. Breeding success has been improved by improved knowledge of factors that trigger reproduction and stimulate replacement clutches, as well as by improvements in artificial incubation and artificial insemination. Assuming that the correct social behaviour group is constituted and the animals start to breed, genetic problems are likely to occur in species with only a few remaining individuals. Once numbers are low, genetic variability is reduced and this brings about diminished ability to respond to environmental change. Recent advances in molecular genetics have enabled studies in taxonomy to be carried out in order to determine species, subspecies and population boundaries. They have also contributed to the theoretical development of small population genetics and demographics aimed at improving ex-situ population management. Captive birds are often hand-reared, but since many behaviours are acquired from the parents, or by experience in the wild, artificial rearing by hand could affect the survival potential of released animals. In order to prevent imprinting on humans and other detrimental effects of hand-rearing techniques, parents, foster-parents, puppets or costumes have been used to rear chicks. Finally, recent developments in research on training programmes to find food, to fly, to avoid specific dangers, or to recognise and to avoid predators, appear to have substantially increased release success in reintroduction programmes.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: It is universally accepted that atherosclerosis originates in childhood and that high LDL and low HDL serum cholesterol, hypertension and obesity are some of the main risk factors. In the past few years, increasing importance has been attributed to the deleterious effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on lipids, on the endothelial lining of arteries, and on the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. The relationship between blood pressure, active renin (AR) and the genetic polymorphism of haptoglobin in a population of adolescents was studied using pro-oxidant status markers, and also using some enzyme systems involved in the antioxidant defense mechanism of the body. METHODS: 51 healthy children, 9 to 12 years of age, were evaluated. The following examinations were performed: nutritional status (weight, height, skinfolds and body mass index) and blood pressure; note was made of any family history of cardiovascular disease. The biological parameters assessed by internationally recommended methods included haptoglobin phenotyping and determination of active renin (AR), the Na+/Li+ countertransport system (Na+/Li+ CTR), antioxidant enzyme systems, metahemoglobin reductase (MetHbRed) and transmembrane reductase (TMR) and indicators of oxidative status, namely activity of plasma epinephrine oxidase (EO) and erythrocytic acid phosphatase (LMW-PTP). RESULTS: The study of the behavior of AR, Na+/Li+ CTR, EO and erythrocyte enzymes (MetHbRed, TMR and LMW-PTP) according to haptoglobin genetic phenotypes, only showed a significant difference for renin, with lower values for allele 1 carriers (homo- and heterozygous) (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in blood pressure as regards the haptoglobin genetic phenotypes. The analysis of the behavior of the same biochemical parameters considering a family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) showed higher values of TMR and lower values of EO in individuals with negative family history. Linear multiple regression showed some biological (Na+/Li+ CTR and MetHbRed) and genetic parameters (haptoglobin and family history of cardiovascular disease) to be stronger determinants of systolic blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: It would appear that there is a tendency for some intermediate biochemical phenotypes to express early on in childhood in individuals with a family history of CVD, which would point to an evident genetic disposition towards this type of pathology.},

abstract={In disturbance ecology there is a tension between ecological and evolutionary viewpoints, because while disturbances often cause mortality in populations (an ecological effect), populations may also evolve mechanisms that ameliorate mortality risk (an evolutionary effect). Flash floods cause high mortality in the juvenile aquatic stage of desert stream insects, but these ecological effects may be mitigated by the evolution of life-history strategies that allow the terrestrial adult stage to avoid floods. Life-history theory predicts that, to balance trade-offs between juvenile growth and mortality risk from floods, (1) most individuals should emerge before the peak of the flood season, (2) optimal body size at emergence should decline as flood probability increases, and (3) a second decline in body size at emergence should occur as the reproductive season ends. These predictions were tested with data on body mass at and timing of emergence of the caddisfly Phylloicus aeneus measured in three montane Chihuahuan Desert (Arizona, USA) streams over two years. P. aeneus that had not reached the adult stage were eliminated from site-years that experienced flash floods, suggesting that timing of emergence is an important fitness component. On average 86% of emergence occurred before the long-term (‚àº100 yr) mean arrival date of the first seasonal flood, supporting prediction 1. The presence of two consecutive declines in body mass at emergence in most site-years was congruent with predictions 2 and 3. To test whether the two declines were associated with increasing flood probability and end of the reproductive season, respectively, maximum-likelihood methods were used to compare five body-size models: a null model that contains no parameters related to flood regime or reproductive season, a seasonal model that incorporates a reproductive time constraint, and three disturbance models that incorporate both reproductive time constraints and flood dynamics. The disturbance models outperformed the other models, suggesting that at least some of the body-mass pattern was influenced by flood dynamics. The timing of the first flood of the season was the most important determinant of observed emergence patterns. Overall, this study demonstrates that aquatic insects can compensate for flash floods by using state-dependent emergence strategies that are synchronized with long-term flood dynamics.},

abstract={Purpose. To examine the effects of 10 youth developmental assets on adolescent tobacco use. Design. Survey of a randomly selected sample using in-home interviewing methodology. Setting. Inner-city areas of two midsized Midwestern cities. Subjects. The researchers studied 1,350 teen-parent pairs. Measures. Demographic information, adolescent self-reported tobacco use, eight developmental asset Likert scales, and two one-item developmental asset measures. Results. The response rate was 51%. Logistic regression results indicate that youth who possess nine of 10 developmental assets examined are significantly less likely to report tobacco use than youth with low levels of assets. Adjusting for youth age, race, gender, parental income and education, and family structure, significant odds ratios include the following: nonparental adult role model, 2.09 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.45, 3.02); peer role models, 2.48 (95% CI = 1.87, 3.29); family communication, 1.73 (95% CI = 1.29, 2.31); use of time (organized groups), 1.77 (95% CI = 1.28, 2.44); use of time (religion), 2.49 (95% CI = 1.86, 3.33); good health practices (exercise/nutrition, 1.61 (95% CI = 1.21, 2.14); community involvement, 1.66 (95% CI = 1.07, 2.58); future aspirations, 2.06 (95% CI = 1.42, 2.99); and responsible choices, 2.21 (95% CI = 1.55, 3.15).

abstract={Since early history, human beings have been closely exposed to several types of traumatic events. Although modern societies have developed a more acceptable kind of convivence, these traumatic events have become increasingly present in the everyday life of any individual in underdeveloped societies. This is due to extended problems, like a lower income per capita, which gives rise to such conducts as violent robbery, kidnapping, or murder. Similarly, family desintegration is a likely factor leading to the development of interfamily violence, and illegal substances traffic and abuse; even weather phenomena (e.g., "El Ni√±o") may trigger a higher incidence of PTSD given the suffering brought about by hurricanes or tornados. At the Fourth Consensus Group International Meeting on Depression and Anxiety, held in Montecatini, Italy, in April 1999, PTSD was regarded as the main issue, because of its high prevalence, social impact, and financial burden on society. For these reasons, it represents an enormous public health problem in both underdeveloped and developed countries. During the last three decades, biological guidelines for PTSD have been studied and proposed, together with the development of new effective treatments. Epidemiological studies allow us to calculate the rates of specific disorders and their impact on the community and health system. The prevalence of the exposure to traumatic events themselves is an important part of PTSD study. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that about 40 to 90% individuals from adult community samples have been exposed to a traumatic event. Prevalence life rates of PTSD vary from 5 to 15% in developed countries. Nowadays, 4 to 6% of the population presents PTSD symptoms, considering only the worst traumatic event (8, 9, 13, 20, 29, 32, 39). In the last two decades, PTSD is an anxiety disorder-which has called the attention in research and clinical areas due to several reasons. One of these is that the rates of violence have had a dramatic increase all over the world; another one is the identification of their subdiagnosis in several places. However, not everyone who has been exposed to a traumatic event develops PTSD. Several risk factors increase the possibility of its expression and chronicity -for instance, to experience the event at early life stages, multiple traumatic events, their severity, gender experiencing the event, personal stress and behavior, or psychological problems history, comorbid psychopathology, parents' PTSD history, or subsequent exposure to reactivant environmental events. Likewise, risk factors can be classified according to the person involved and the traumatic event experienced (19, 22). In this sense, different studies have shown women have a higher risk than men to develop PTSD, in spite of men having an increased exposure to traumatic events (13, 20, 37). The psycho-biological development level is important when a traumatic event appears, since it has been demonstrated that age is a significative factor to develop PTSD: traumatic events in childhood have been associated with a higher risk of PTSD and more severe symptoms (10). The clinical course of PTSD is often chronic, with only 50% of the patients recovering within two years after the incident. Most of those unable to recover will still show symptoms 15 years later (32). The situation in underdeveloped countries is particularly interesting, since traumatic events frequently associated with long wars, hunger, politic opression, and sectary violence seem to make PTSD more chronic and the profile of its symptoms more complex and disabling than in developed countries (21, 23, 38, 45, 46). PTSD has a relevant impact on different areas of life, as is revealed for instance in its enormous social costs. Generally, individuals who suffer PTSD earn a lower income, present high scholar failure rates, and more interpersonal problems compared to the overall population. In addition, the age of onset of the mental disorders has a predictive value over educational, birth, marriage, and economic accomplishments (8, 23, 24, 27, 28, 30, 32). A research conducted among the overall American population estimated that 38% of the individuals with PTSD received some form of treatment during a given year. The reason more commonly reported by the remaining 62% to refuse getting medical attention was that they did not think they had any problem at all (31). Often, the traumatic reaction adapts over several years and becomes part of the individual's coping style. People at risk of PTSD commonly ask for medical help early, but do not do so in the psychiatric area. Finally, PTSD brings about less stigmatization compared to another psychiatric disorders, because their symptoms are considered as natural consequences of a severe traumatic event (32). Apparently, the presence of psychiatric disorders other than PTSD is the rule rather than the exception. According to clinical and general populations studies, between 50-90% of PTSD patients show comorbid psychiatric disorders (14-18, 33, 42, 43). PTSD is frequently associated with comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as High Depressive Disorder (HDD), Anguish Disorder (AD), Social Phobia (SP), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Substance Use Disorder -mostly alcohol- (SUD), Personality Disorders (PD) (e.g., borderline, avoidance, antisocial), and Dissociative Disorders (4, 5, 9, 29, 32, 48). In brief, the relevance of PTSD study becomes clear due to several aspects. Apparently, PTSD is more common than it is thought so. The life prevalence of PTSD among the general population is about 8 to 9%, and women have a higher risk to develop PTSD (22). Also, PTSD is more frequent after certain kinds of traumatic events (e.g., rape), not considering in this case the survivor's gender (29). This discussion is divided in two parts. In this first article we will analyze some general aspects like the introduction of this disorder in the American classification, together with its definition, epidemiology, clinic course, effect on the individual's general functioning, and comorbidity with different psychiatric disorders.},

abstract={The fetal origins hypothesis proposes that adult cardiovascular and metabolic disease originate through developmental plasticity and fetal adaptations arising from failure of the materno-placental supply of nutrients to match fetal requirements. The hypothesis is supported by experimental data in animals indicating that maternal nutrition can programme long term effects on the offspring without necessarily affecting size at birth. There is now evidence linking body composition in pregnant women and the balance of nutrient intake during pregnancy with raised levels of cardiovascular risk factors in the offspring. Maternal body composition and diet are thought to affect fetal development and programming as a result of both direct effects on substrate availability to the fetus and indirectly through changes in placental function and structure. Alterations in placental growth and vascular resistance, altered nutrient and hormone metabolism in the placenta, and changes in nutrient transfer and partitioning between mother, placenta and fetus all have important effects on the fetal adaptations thought to be central to programming. Future interventions to improve placental function are likely to have lifelong health benefits for the offspring. ¬© 2002 IFPA and Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract={This article describes infant mental health from two perspectives: why it is relevant and how to implement interventions, including preventive ones. Topics covered are based on evidence available in scientific literature. The first section addresses areas that justify the importance assigned to infants and their emotional well-being. One of them deals with new information about brain development. Recent available information emphasizes the crucial role of sensory/experiential input for the development of the brain in terms of determining the formation of new synapses, influencing cell migration and the "pruning" of refined and dedicated neuronal pathways. Experiences (exposure to language, contingent responses by the caregiver, motion in space) influence the development of the brain. Also, negative and anxiety provoking events as well as psychological trauma cause a negative outcome through this effect. Prolonged and/or severe trauma has been shown to influence negatively the functioning of the limbic system and the capacity of the child to feel empathy and/or compassion, to regulate emotions and to learn new information. New evidence is reviewed from longitudinal research. Several studies have demonstrated that it is possible to "trace back" which elements are necessary during early childhood, to put a child at a high risk of becoming a criminal or severe offender. These include attributes in the child him or herself (restlessness, impulsiveness, lack of fear) together with a history of maltreatment and chronically adverse experiences. Excessive shyness is another fairly persistent trait from early infancy to adulthood. Since these "risk factors" are known, particular children could be targeted for early intervention programs. A follow up study conducted by some of the authors with infants seen in a mental health clinic and followed up to age four, indicates that the strongest predictor of the outcome and functioning of the child at age four is not the severity or type of problems for which the child was originally evaluated. The strongest predictor was the quality of parenting and parenting behaviors of the caregivers as assessed during infancy. This finding suggests the importance of helping parents as early as possible to cope with infant problems in a benign and sensitive way, before negative circles of interaction are entrenched and spiral into an ongoing negative relationship. Together with the studies of risk, those focusing on resilience are summarized. Knowing which traits or experiences are protective against psychopathology is crucial, in order to promote their flourishing in early childhood. Studies with children at high psychosocial risk from Kauai, Hawaii as well as with children from other groups in the world converge in describing resilient traits in early childhood: an easy temperament, a "social orientation", sense of humor, attractiveness and the ability to communicate with others, as well as intelligence. Several experiences are protective, such as having few separations from the mother and having had a sibling when the index child was at least three years old. This knowledge can be used to promote resilient features in children and to develop interventions for those at most risk. Epidemiological evidence suggests that infancy disturbances are not rare, but frequent (15 to 20% of the population). Studies of the prevalence of problems like feeding and sleeping disturbances, excessive crying and disruptive behavior in infancy point in this direction. This justifies the need for early recognition and identification, particularly when they are severe. Excessive crying increases the risk of the child being abused or shaken; likewise sleep disturbance is associated with irritability and hyperactive behavior in the infant. Parents who are deprived of sleep are prone to be more negative and to feel exhausted. Eating disturbances can be associated with failure to thrive. Early malnutrition has been associated with hypertension in middle age, as well as with a higher risk of coronary disease. Maternal depression and domestic violence are rampant in the perinatal period. Maternal depression is associated with more crying and sleeping problems in infancy, and hyperactivity and negative behavior in the school age child. The findings of a survey in a "well-baby clinic" (health surveillance clinic) conducted by some of the authors concur in the finding that parents are worried about their baby's behavior in all these areas and that they readily identify the problems, when asked. Furthermore, their worries are justified. This is in sharp contrast with the tendency in most pediatric settings to "wait and see" hoping that problems in the baby will be solved by themselves. The second part of the review focuses on two issues: techniques of clinical intervention and preventive strategies and their results. There is scant scientific evidence on the efficacy of parent infant psychotherapies. Techniques vary widely in their content and their focus or target population. Strategies like brief parent-infant psychotherapy and the therapeutic consultation are framed psychodynamically and focus on the transgenerational transmission of "fantasmatic" interactions and projections placed on the infant. These appear more suitable for families that are relatively healthier and lacking massive stressors. On the other side of the spectrum, techniques such as interactive guidance and infant-parent psychotherapy are designed for families under more stress, and when the parent child relationship is very negative. These strategies are used with "unreachable families". Interactive guidance attempts to focus on what the parents are doing well through a videotaped feedback given to them, and gradually expanding their repertoire of sensitive and empathic behaviors towards the baby. Infant-parent psychotherapy is long term and involves interventions that are non traditional, like psychotherapy at home, practical help to the parents, and the promotion of a long term relationship of trust between the caregivers and the therapist. The focus is to achieve a "corrective attachment experience" in the parents, which will in turn tender them more sensitive and responsive towards their baby. Multi-modal and flexible techniques are advocated in order to tailor the intervention to the particular needs and style of each family. Finally, evidence on the effectiveness of various prevention programs is reviewed. These are grouped according to the timing of the intervention, from pregnancy to toddlerhood. Evidence suggests that improving marital communication and promoting conflict resolution before the baby is born may enhance maternal sensitivity and lead to a more secure attachment in the infant. There is research on interventions in the perinatal period. These include having psychosocial support during the delivery process. In addition, "bonding" between newborn and mother (without undue intrusion by health care personnel) has positive effects. This involves skin to skin contact and early breast-feeding. These simple interventions have been shown to promote maternal sensitivity, more patience and less behavioral difficulties several months later. The mere demonstration of the abilities of the newborn, his or her uniqueness and preferences as well as an observation of the baby's perceptual abilities, is associated with long term positive behavioral effects. All this points to the importance of conducting an intervention during a "sensitive period". Several meta-analytic studies on home visitation conclude that these programs are most effective if the intervention has a clear focus, is brief and practical help and advice are given to the parents on site. By contrast, with families having a high risk of abusing their child, home visitations are the only hopeful strategy so far.},

abstract={Introduction: The association between type A behavior pattern (TABP) and physical activity is unclear, with studies reporting both positive and negative results and some reporting no association. Because previous studies have looked primarily at the relationship between TABP and exercise, the purpose of this study was to assess the association between TABP and (1) total activity, (2) activity at work, (3) exercise, (4) household chores, (5) leisure activity, and (6) inactivity. Methods: Two hundred twenty-seven women (111 African American, 116 Hispanic) from a larger study (Women on the Move) were used in the analysis for this study. The mean age was 49.3 years (SD 7 years), mean weight 77 kg (SD 17.6 kg), and mean body mass index (BMI) 30 (SD 6.5). As part of the Women on the Move Study, participants completed a 7-day diary and a 10-item Activity Temperament Scale. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to test the relationship between TABP and daily activity. Significant findings were observed for total activity and leisure activity with the Activity Temperament Scale summary score. Both had positive associations, indicating that those who had a higher score on the Activity Temperament Scale also had higher total activity kilocalories (kcal) and leisure activity kilocalories. Significant positive findings were also observed for total activity, leisure activity, and exercise with individual items on the Activity Temperament Scale. Household chores, work, and inactivity had significant negative associations with one or more of the individual items on the Activity Temperament Scale. Conclusions: Although previous studies have reported on TABP and physical activity (primarily exercise), these findings provide new information specific to daily living activity by dimension in an older minority population. Results suggest a positive association between TABP and daily living activity with a general pattern of higher scores associated with higher activity and lower scores associated with higher inactivity. However, even though some significant findings were observed, the overall models did not reveal meaningful associations.},

abstract={Introduction: There is evidence to suggest that the polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) plays a critical early step in the development of the ischaemia-reperfusion syndrome, the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis. The PMN receptor CD16 plays an important role in phagocytosis, cell-mediated cytotoxicity and the release of free radicals and proteolytic enzymes. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is any relationship between PMN CD16 expression, phagocytosis and the development of sepsis. Methods: Fifty patients who underwent elective infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair were studied. Venous blood was taken before operation, throughout surgery and for 7 days after operation. CD16 expression was measured, unstimulated and following further stimulation, by means of flow cytometry. Phagocytosis was determined using flow cytometry. Results: Some 36 patients had an uncomplicated recovery; 14 developed SIRS or sepsis. There was no difference between the two groups with respect to nutritional, co-morbid or technical factors. In the group that developed septic complications after operation, the level of PMN CD16 expression was significantly higher before surgery (mean channel fluorescence (MCF) 30.2 versus 10.4; P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test) and throughout the postoperative period. Surgery produced no change in CD16 expression. After operation, stimulation of PMNs in the septic group resulted in a fall in CD16 expression (40.8 versus 20.4 MCF; P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test); surgery produced no change in the level of expression in the uncomplicated group. Conclusion: This study provides evidence of phenotypic and functional differences in neutrophil behaviour in patients who develop sepsis following aneursym surgery.},

abstract={Given the current global epidemic of obesity there is a demand for new anti-obesity drugs to overcome the problem. Many pharmacological agents reduce food intake and significantly decrease body mass when administered to animals but affect feeding behaviour in a profoundly different way indicating the variety of biological mechanisms by which such agents act (appetite verses non-appetite). More limited clinical data demonstrates that some of the same drugs produce decreases in food intake and weight loss in humans. A few of these drugs do so by modifying the functioning of the appetite system as measured by subjective changes in feelings of hunger and fullness (indices of satiety). These drugs that modify the daily flux of appetite could be considered as 'appetite suppressants' with clinical potential as anti-obesity agents. Drugs that can be considered suitable candidates for appetite suppressants are agents that enhance peripherally satiety peptide systems (such as CCK, Bombesin/GRP, Enterostatin and GLP-1), alter the CNS levels of various hypothalamic neuropeptides (NPY, Galanin, Orexin, CART and Melanocortins) or monoamine neurotransmitters (such as serotonin, nor-adrenaline and possibly dopamine). Recently, the hormone leptin has become regarded as a key hormonal signal linking adipose tissue status with a number of key central nervous system circuits (NPY, CART, CRF, Melanocortins and possibly Orexins). This tonic system may also provide drug targets for the control of appetite. Any changes induced by a potential appetite suppressant should be considered in terms of the (i) psychological experience and behavioural expression of appetite, (ii) metabolism and peripheral physiology, and (iii) functioning of CNS neural pathways. In humans, such modulation of appetite will involve changes in total caloric consumption, subjective changes in feelings of hunger and fullness, preferences for specific food items, and general macronutrient preferences. These may be expressed behaviourally as changes in meal patterns, snacking behaviour and food choice. Within the next 20 years it is certain that clinicians will have a new range of anti-obesity compounds available to choose from. Such novel compounds may act on a single component of the appetite system or target a combination of these components detailed in this review. Such compounds used in combination with life style changes and dietary intervention may be critical in dealing with the rising world epidemic of obesity.},

abstract={Peptides from cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) reduce food intake in rats when injected into the lateral ventricle. Hypothalamic and hindbrain sites important in the control of feeding contain CART-immunoreactive fibers. To further define the site of CART's anorectic action, we compared feeding and other behavioral responses to third or fourth ventricular (3V, 4V) CART-(55-102) in 6-h food-deprived rats, both before and after cerebral aqueduct occlusion. 3V CART reduced the volume of Ensure consumed and resulted in fewer observations of eating and grooming within the 30-min test session. These reductions were significantly attenuated by aqueduct obstruction. 4V CART suppressed Ensure intake and resulted in decreased observations of feeding both with and without aqueduct blockade. 3V CART produced flat-backed postures and movement-associated tremors that were prevented by aqueduct obstruction. 4V CART also produced these signs, both with and without aqueduct blockade. We conclude that the major hypophagic effect of intracerebroventricular CART is mediated at a hindbrain site. The association of CART-induced feeding suppression with altered motor behavior questions the specificity of intracerebroventricular CART for actions on feeding.},

abstract={We report on the first case in which sequestered secondary plant compounds determine an insect's external appearance in the ultraviolet spectrum and thereby influence visually mediated mate choice. Larvae of the common blue butterfly Polyommatus icarus specifically sequester flavonoids in different amounts and types, depending on the part or species of food plant. During late pupal development the majority of ultraviolet-absorbing flavonoids are deposited in the wing scales. The flavonoid content of the larval diet thereby determines ultraviolet wing patterns. In laboratory and field experiments, male butterflies clearly preferred flavonoid-rich, ultraviolet-absorbing female dummies. This preference is mediated visually by the ultraviolet pattern of the wings. Food-plant parts and species vary in value as a food source, so ultraviolet wing patterns may signal mate quality and are not a species-specific characteristic. We discuss the use of principal component analysis in analysing spectral data in the context of visual communication. We propose the alternative application of confidence intervals of averaged spectra as a novel straightforward statistical method for comparing groups of spectra in a manner that is independent of assumptions about the visual system of the receiver. In addition, they can be used to give confidence intervals to derived measures of colour such as quantum catch by photoreceptors.},

Each individual was scored according to its response to (i) an approaching human when alone and feeding, (ii) a taxidermist's model fox when alone and feeding, and (iii) an approaching human when alone in a 9 m annulus, and its nearest neighbour distance in the home pen, competitiveness for food in a series of paired encounters, running ability and physical characteristics. 3. Each flock was herded around a 7 m diameter annulus in separate trials by a human walking at 0.5ms-1. The distance maintained by each duckling from the human, and hence its relative flock position, was calculated. 4. Individual flight distance maintained from an approaching human when alone in an annulus was the attribute that predicted distance maintained from an approaching human when part of a flock. 5. Some ducklings had reduced average distances from an approaching human when they were in a flock compared to when they were tested alone, and inter-individual variation in distance from the human was greatly reduced when birds were part of a flock.},

abstract={Animals seem to learn and use internal models; they learn to anticipate predictable events, and their behavior in the sensory preconditioning paradigm reflects formation of novel associative chains. To investigate possible neural correlates, the temporal difference model (TD model) was extended to an internal model approach. The proposed model learns reward prediction error signals that resemble dopamine neuron activity. In contrast to the original TD model, the reward prediction error signals of the proposed model are influenced by the formation of novel associative chains in the sensory preconditioning experiment. This is consistent with experimental findings, as striatal dopamine concentration is influenced by the formation of novel associative chains in this paradigm. Comparison of the model architecture with biological neural networks suggests that chains of neurons with tonic anticipatory activity may underlie the formation of novel associative chains. These findings suggest that dopamine neuron activity may reflect the processing of an internal model.},

abstract={Water, because of its special characteristics of high thermal conductivity and high specific heat, is a hypothermic medium for human beings. Man, as a homoeothermic animal, must maintain his core temperature within very tight margins, since, if core temperature falls below 35 ¬∞C it can lead to a situation of hypothermia. When diving in cold water, we must control two groups of factors: firstly, those which lead to hypothermia, such as, water temperature and immersion time; and secondly, those processes which lead to heat loss in the diver, such as conduction, convection and evaporation. Conduction and convection mechanisms can be controlled through the appropriate choice of diving suit, whereas heat loss through evaporation is inevitable, given that the air mixture is necessarily healed by the respiratory system. Other factors to be taken into account are: a good state of health, correct nutrition, level of adaptation to diving in cold water and the type of immersion. Objective: To observe the body's behaviour and response to diving in cold water. Material and Method: Immersion in a hydraulic tank in the Sub-aquatic Research Unit in the Naval Diving Centre, carrying out three immersions at different depths and times with a water temperature of between 0¬∞ C and -1.8¬∞C. In order to study the response of the body, the following readings were taken: temperature, ECG, spirometry, ORL test and Doppler studies. Results: Immersions in cold water suppose a risk for divers, given the very high danger of hypothermia and the very serious consequences which accompany this. Various factors should be taken into account before diving in this kind of environment; choice of suitable diving equipment, with gloves and face protection, air supply equipment and a good state of health verified by a medical check prior to this kind of dive.},

abstract={The threat-sensitivity hypothesis predicts that prey individuals will increase antipredator behaviors as apparent predator risk increases. An implicit assumption of the threat-sensitivity hypothesis is that predator risk is additive. In other words, all characteristics of a predator that indicate risk should contribute in an additive way to determine the degree of risk-sensitive behavior. We tested this assumption in the laboratory by presenting live predators (green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus) to groups of western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). We examined effects of predator diet, hunger level, and size on predator avoidance and inspection behavior of mosquitofish. Both predator diet and predator hunger level were significant and additive determinants of distance maintained from a predator, resulting in a graded response to combinations of these predator cues. In contrast, whereas predator diet was the most important determinant of general avoidance distances, predator hunger level was more important in determining mosquitofish vertical distribution and inspection behavior. Thus, the relationship between predator cue and the antipredator behavior that it elicits is dependent on which cues and behaviors are examined. Our data suggest that during risky behaviors, such as predator inspection, mosquitofish rely mainly on visual cues (behavior differences between hungry and satiated predators), whereas general avoidance behavior is determined by additive responses from visual and chemical cues.},

abstract={Environmental conditions in a lake vary on different time scales, from years to minutes. Organisms faced with environmental changes, which are ecosystem properties, must evolve survival strategies in order to persist in cuch a syctem. Predictability and velocity of environmental changec determine the most profitable (in terms of fitness) ctrategies. In response to predictable environmental varriations, organisms can evolve fixed life-history traits; unpredictable changes should favor the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. However, recurrent moderately predictable conditions can also lead to shifts in genotypic frequencies in a population. Different strategies can co-exist if the environment fluctuates at varying time scales simultaneously. Daphnia is used as a model organicm to explain various adaptations to changec in bottom-up and top-down forces. They live in a nutritionally dilute environment, thus reactions to cudden changes in food resources are essential. Phenotypic placticity of the filter screens is used to optimize energy input. On the other hand, daphniids are subject to strong, size selective predation pressure by fish and invertebrate predators, which require different defenses. The relative importance of these predators and, thus, the optimum defense ctrategies vary during the season. Daphniids react to changes in predator pressure with life-history changes, e. g. variable size at first reproduction (SFR). Clonal replacement, phenotypic recponses to specific predator signals, and maternal effects determine the seasonal shift of SFR in the lake. Experiments in large indoor mesocosms are reported to demonstrate the interaction of phenotypic and genotypic responses in the exprecsion of diel vertical migration (DVM), a behavioral strategy of avoidance of fish predation. Daphniids can gain the same fitness from either migrating deeper during the day or maturing at a smaller size. It is concluded that natural selection, although it must act on individuals, creates ecosystem properties through shaping the characteristics and interactions of populations. ¬© Asociaci√≥n Espa√±ola de Limnolog√≠a.},

abstract={Aim. To study the predictive value for long-term outcome of cognitive distortions, as assessed by the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI), in Anorexia Nervosa (AN) patients. Methods. The 6-10-year outcome of 54 consecutive malnourished AN patients was prospectively recorded according to the EDI score obtained at inclusion. We selected only patients with full 6-month's assessments from more than 5 years (mean 8.4 years). Eating behaviour, quality of life, autonomy and insight capacity outcome were prospectively assessed (Morgan-Russell scale, semi-structured interview). At the end of follow-up, 29 patients were classified as recovered and the 25 others as having a bad outcome. Three in each group were bulimic. Results. In a monovariate analysis, high initial EDI total score (P < 0.0007) and high initial scores for perfectionism (P < 0.001), interpersonal distrust (P < 0.004), ineffectiveness (P < 0.002), interoceptive awareness (P < 0.03) and drive for thinness (P < 0.05) were significantly associated with a bad long-term outcome. In a multivariate analysis, only total score (F = 10.14; P = 0.002) and high initial scores for perfectionism (F = 11.6; P = 0.006) and for interpersonal distrust (F = 9.92; P = 0.009) were significantly associated with bad outcome. Discussion. EDI's total score and subscales for perfectionism and interpersonal distrust could predict the long-term outcome of AN, at least in the restrictive form of the disease, suggesting that the degree of cognitive distortions is of pronostic value for long-term outcome.},

abstract={As well as there being a direct physical effect of the state (for example fat reserves, or size) of an animal on the risk of being caught by a predator, state also has an effect on predation risk indirectly through changes in behaviour. We present a mathematical model which looks at these two components of the effect of state on predation risk. We focus on two different models, (i) where the animal must achieve a fixed state and its fitness depends on the time at which this state is reached and (ii) where the animal must survive until a fixed time and its fitness depends on its final state. We investigate conditions under which the indirect effect of increased state is to increase or decrease predation risk, and give some numerical illustrations. Under certain conditions in the fixed-state model, the indirect effect of state is to increase predation risk, whereas under certain conditions in the fixed-time model the indirect effect of state is to decrease predation risk. We discuss the implications of our results for empirical investigations into the effect of state on predation risk. ¬© 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract={As the obesity epidemic escalates, increasing numbers of patients present with serious comorbidities related to excess body weight. Obesity should be recognized and treated as a primary medical condition that is progressive, chronic, and relapsing. Effective treatment of obesity has been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk factors and comorbid conditions. Physician involvement is necessary for medical assessment, management, counseling, and coordination of multidisciplinary obesity treatment. Obese patients who receive counseling and weight management from physicians are significantly more likely to undertake weight management programs than those who do not. Obesity treatment guidelines and materials are available from various health organizations. A comprehensive weight management program must include dietary adjustments, increased physical activity, and behavioral modification. Nutritional modifications should take into account the diet's energy content, composition, and suitability for the individual patient. The physical activity component should be safe and practical, including aerobic activity, strength training, and increased daily lifestyle activities. Various behavioral strategies enable the patient to make lifestyle changes that will promote weight loss and management. Adjunct therapies may serve to support lifestyle modifications in severe or resistant cases of obesity. Models for multidisciplinary care vary depending on whether they are designed for an individual medical practice or as part of the health care services of a larger facility. Lifestyle changes for healthy weight management must be permanently incorporated into a patient's daily lifestyle to reduce obesity and its associated health risks. Such intervention is necessary if the growing epidemic of obesity is to be slowed and reversed.},

abstract={Drugs of abuse such as cocaine induce a paradoxical aversive effect when paired with a novel taste. When a novel gustatory cue is paired with drugs of abuse the resulting conditioned effect is the avoidance of the novel taste. A conditioning paradigm was developed in order to pair saccharin with self-administered cocaine. Rats were trained to lever-press for sweetened milk in an operant chamber and then implanted with an intrajugular catheter for cocaine self-administration (SA). After recovery from surgery, food and water access were restricted and the operant behavior was reestablished using contingent milk. Pairings of 10-min saccharin access followed by 1-h cocaine (0.125 mg/kg per injection) SA sessions were alternated daily with pairings of 10-min water access followed by 30-min SA sessions of oral milk and i.v. saline, delivered simultaneously. Pairings were conducted once a day for 10 days. After four sessions of cocaine self-administration there was no significant decrease in saccharin intake. However, rats that avoided saccharin also self-administered more cocaine than non-avoiding rats. These results suggest that the development of taste aversion is accompanied by an acceptance of the drug rather than an aversion to it. ¬© 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

They showed similar responses to fish smells and food shortage: Lowered juvenile growth rate, reduced mature size, elongated maturation time, reduced brood size and increased offspring size. The life-history changes induced by the fish smell might be a result of deleterious effects of the factor. Although it has been considered that fish-induced life-history shes in Daphnia are positive responses to predators, our results suggest that they are negative responses of animals that show some other positive responses to fish, such as behavioural and morphological changes to reduce mortality due to predation. Synergism was detected in the effects of the fish smell and food deficiency, which suggests that fish smell reduces the tolerance of Daphnia to an environmental stress, food shortage.},

Results of that study showed that perpetrators exhibited exaggerated lactate-induced fear, panic and rage. In this current study, we compared the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and testosterone obtained from perpetrators of domestic violence and a group of healthy comparison subjects. All subjects were assessed for DSM-III-R diagnoses. Perpetrators with alcohol dependence (DV-ALC) (n = 13), perpetrators without alcohol dependence (DV-NALC) (n = 10) and healthy comparison subjects (HCS) (n = 20) were clinically assessed using the Spielberger Trait Anxiety, Brown-Goodwin Aggression Scale, Buss Durkee Hostility Inventory and Straus Conflict Tactics. Following an overnight fast and bed rest, subjects received a lumbar puncture to obtain CSF concentrations of 5-HIAA and testosterone. Perpetrators scored significantly higher on measures of aggression than HCS. DV-NALC had significantly lower concentrations of CSF 5-HIAA and higher Straus Conflict Tactics (CT) physical violence scores than DV-ALC and HCS. DV-ALC had significantly higher concentrations of CSF testosterone than DV-NALC. DV-ALC also had significantly higher Straus CT physical violence scores than HCS. DV-NALC and DV-ALC differed on 5-HIAA concentrations, testosterone concentrations, Straus CT physical violence scores and alcohol dependence. These results suggest that DV-NALC and DV-ALC groups could have different biological mechanisms mediating domestic violence. ¬© 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

In contrast, swimming speed was significantly reduced at high algal concentrations and in the presence of green colour, Moreover, starved animals had lost theft rheotaxis, Neither Daphnia magna nor Daphnia pulex had a preference for either clean medium or medium that had contained conspecifics, but D. magna significantly chose clean medium when medium which had been inhabited by D. pulex was the alternative. No avoidance of medium from Chaoborus cultures was found, but D. magna significantly avoided medium that had been inhabited by ides (Leuciscus idus L.). The responses observed could result in aggregation of animals by reduced swimming speed at high algal densities and by avoidance of areas with predators. When these cues have become less important due to food depletion and decreased predation pressure, the interspecific-competitorrelated cues might result in desegregation.},

abstract={Human activities can affect the behaviour of mammals through the modification of habitats, changes in predation pressure or alterations in food distribution and availability. We analysed the association and ranging patterns of 242 individually identified bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in eastern Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia, and distinguished two separate communities of dolphins. Unlike bottlenose dolphins elsewhere, the communities' core areas overlapped substantially. There was a correlation between the dolphins' responses to fishing activities and community membership - members of one community feed in association with trawlers and members of the other do not. Apart from feeding mode, the communities differed in habitat preference and group sizes. Inadvertent anthropogenic impacts on animals' societies are likely to be far more widespread than just this study and can increase conservation challenges. In this instance, managers need to consider the two communities' differing habitat requirements and their behavioural traditions in conservation planning.},

abstract={Of two native Australian fishes na√Øve to the introduced toad Bufo marinus most barramundi Lates calcarifer rapidly learned to avoid B. marinus tadpoles, while sooty grunter Hephaestus fuliginosus exhibited considerable intraspecific variation in their learning ability. Some sooty grunter learned to avoid tadpoles after only a few attacks, while other individuals continued to attack and reject tadpoles throughout the entire laboratory trials. Individuals of both species recognized and avoided tadpoles 1 day after their previous encounter. None of the fishes died during the trials. The observed variation in behavioural responses of fishes to B. marinus may be due to differences in (1) learning ability, (2) fish hunger levels, and or (3) tadpole palatability and toxicity. The results demonstrate that most barramundi and sooty grunter learn to avoid B. marinus tadpoles with minimal trauma. Consequently, it is anticipated that the toads are unlikely to have a significant negative impact on wild populations of these fishes through direct toxic effects. ¬© 2001 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

abstract={The optimal amount of reserves that a small bird should carry depends upon a number of factors, including the availability of food and environmental predation risk levels. Theory predicts that, if predation risk increases, then a bird should maintain a lower level of reserves. Previous experiments have given mixed results: some have shown reduced reserves and some, increased reserves. However, the birds in these studies may have been interpreting a staged predation event as a period when they were unable to feed rather than a change in predation risk: theory predicts that, if the food supply within the environment is variable, then reserves should be increased. In the present study, we presented blue tits (Parus caeruleus) with a potential predator and compared this response (which could have been potentially confounded by perceived interruption effects) with a response to an actual interruption in the environment during both long and short daytime lengths. During long (but not short) days, the birds responded in line with theoretical predictions by increasing their reserves in response to interruption and reducing them in response to predation. These results are examined in the light of other experimental manipulations and we discuss how well experimental tests have tested the predictions made by theoretical models.},

abstract={Neurophysiological and neuropsychological studies in monkeys sometimes require an automated food-pellet dispenser. Commercially available dispensers typically sequester the pellet until delivery and, once delivered, the pellet's availability cannot be controlled. The custom-designed dispenser described here overcomes those two limitations. The device is composed of two separate units: a feeder and an electronic controller. The feeder manipulates food pellets with actuators driven by air pressure and delivers them into a serving bowl. The controller's settings determine whether the monkey can retrieve a pellet from the bowl. If the experiment requires that the pellet be visible and within reach, but unavailable for retrieval, the controller enables a trap-door mechanism at the bottom of the bowl. Any motion near the serving bowl, such as that caused by the approach of a monkey's hand, will then trigger the opening of the trap door, which causes the pellet to fall into an enclosed pellet collector. This rapid pellet-removal mechanism can also be triggered by other computer-controlled contingencies. Two of these dispensers have been in operation in an applied laboratory setting for over 2 years.},

abstract={I examined the effects of a nonlethal predator, larvae of the odonate Anax junius, and food-resource level on behaviour and growth of larval southern leopard frogs (Rana sphenocephala) to test whether the strength of effects of a nonlethal predator was influenced by background resource level. I crossed two levels of food resources, growth-limiting and non-growth-limiting, with the presence or absence of A. junius. Tadpoles responded to predators by altering spatial distribution and activity. When predators were present, tadpoles on both food treatments had similar low levels of activity, but tadpoles on the nonlimiting food treatment showed a much larger reduction in activity than tadpoles on the growth-limiting treatment. Tadpoles on both food treatments delayed metamorphosis when exposed to predators. Growth and size at metamorphosis were affected significantly by food treatment but not by predator treatment. However, the direction of response to predators differed. Tadpoles on the growth-limiting treatment were larger at metamorphosis and grew faster when exposed to predators; the opposite was true for tadpoles on the non-growth-limited food treatment. This raises the interesting possibility that for some species experiencing low resource availability, predators may induce a behaviourally mediated positive effect on growth.},

abstract={When confronted by potential predators, many prey fishes engage in predator inspection behavior. Previous authors have argued that by selectively avoiding the predator's head during an inspection visit (attack cone avoidance), individual inspectors may reduce their local risk of predation. In field trials, we investigated the effects of predator diet cues on the presence of 'attack cone avoidance' during predator inspection visits. Wild, free-ranging finescale dace (Phoxinus neogaeus) were exposed to the combined cues of a model predator and a distilled water control or the odor of a yellow perch (Perca flavescens) fed dace (with alarm pheromone), swordtail (Xiphophorus helleri) (lacking Ostariophysan alarm pheromone), or perch that were food deprived for four days. Finescale dace modified their predator inspection behavior following exposure to the odor of a perch fed dace (fewer dace present, reduced frequency of inspections, and an increased per capita inspection rate) compared to those exposed to the odor of a perch fed swordtails, perch that were food deprived, or a distilled water control. In addition, dace inspected the tail region more often only when the model predator was paired with the odor of a perch fed dace. In all other treatments, dace inspected the head region of the model predator more often. These data suggest that attack cone avoidance of inspecting prey fishes may be more likely to occur in high-risk situations, such as in the presence of conspecific alarm pheromones in the diet of potential predators.},

abstract={Tropical birds usually lay smaller clutches and are less likely to initiate a second brood than their temperate-zone relatives. This reduction in annual fecundity is generally explained as an adaptation either to higher rates of nest predation or to a more limited food supply concurrent with higher adult survival in the tropics. However, the physiological parameters associated with lower annual fecundity in tropical birds have not been well investigated. We compared the annual fecundity, behaviour and a number of physiological parameters of stonechat parents feeding fledged juveniles in territories with and without fiscal shrikes, a predator on adult and fledged birds. Stonechat pairs in territories with shrikes were less likely to initiate a second brood and delayed successive broods compared to pairs in territories without shrikes. After fledging of their young, males showed a greater propensity than females to initiate distraction calls after a human intrusion into their territory and, therefore, invested more in the defence of their young. In territories with shrikes stonechat males had higher initial plasma corticosterone levels and lower body conditions than males in territories without shrikes, suggesting that they were chronically stressed. In contrast, the females from both types of territory had low initial plasma corticosterone levels. We conclude that shrike presence might account for the delay in initiation of a second brood and the reduction in the tendency to initiate a second brood. Whether these effects are mediated by the elevated levels of corticosterone remains to be demonstrated.},

abstract={Background: The Resource Dispersion Hypothesis (RDH) proposes a mechanism for the passive formation of social groups where resources are dispersed, even in the absence of any benefits of group living per se. Despite supportive modelling, it lacks empirical testing. The RDH predicts that, rather than Territory Size (TS) increasing monotonically with Group Size (GS) to account for increasing metabolic needs, TS is constrained by the dispersion of resource patches, whereas GS is independently limited by their richness. We conducted multiple-year tests of these predictions using data from the long-term study of badgers Meles meles in Wytham Woods, England. The study has long failed to identify direct benefits from group living and, consequently, alternative explanations for their large group sizes have been sought. Results: TS was not consistently related to resource dispersion, nor was GS consistently related to resource richness. Results differed according to data groupings and whether territories were mapped using minimum convex polygons or traditional methods. Habitats differed significantly in resource availability, but there was also evidence that food resources may be spatially aggregated within habitat types as well as between them. Conclusions: This is, we believe, the largest ever test of the RDH and builds on the long-term project that initiated part of the thinking behind the hypothesis. Support for predictions were mixed and depended on year and the method used to map territory borders. We suggest that within-habitat patchiness, as well as model assumptions, should be further investigated for improved tests of the RDH in the future. ¬© 2001 Johnson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Diet prescription is a fundamental first-line element in the management of patients with dyslipidemia. Weight loss should be a primary goal for all overweight patients. A 5 to 10% weight loss is often sufficient to obtain a significant improvement in lipid levels. Dietary fat should not provide more than 30% of total calorie intake. Saturated fatty acids should not exceed 7% and polyunsaturated fatty acids should also be limited to 7 to 10%. For monounsaturated fatty acids the dietary allowance can be a bit wider, up to 15% of total calorie intake. Carbohydrates, particularly complex carbohydrates, should replace the fat calories. Dietary fiber (more than 20g/d) as well as soy protein or phytosterols can be helpful in reducing LDL-cholesterol by about 10%. Consumption of fruits and vegetables should also be encouraged because they provide antioxidants that have effects on other cardiovascular risk factors. Long-term education is needed to encourage the patient to comply with this type of diet. Psycho-behavioral strategies can be useful here.},

abstract={Background: Anorexia nervosa is a severe disorder that often responds poorly to treatment. At this time, little is known about pretreatment predictors of response. Methods: A sample of 42 restrictor type anorectics was tested at the assessment phase and after 180 days retested using the Temperament and Character Inventory and Eating Disorder Inventory 2 along with other clinical evaluation instruments. After 180 days of treatment with multimodal 'network' therapy, the patients were divided into two groups. The first group included patients who showed relevant clinical improvement; the second group included patients considered 'not yet responding'. Data collected from the not-yet-responding group were compared by the t test with the other group's data to evaluate prognostic indexes. Results: Diagnosis of personality disorder, which afflicted about 50% of patients, seemed not to be a relevant prognostic factor. However, a lower novelty seeking was characteristic of the nonresponder group. Higher levels of asceticism and maturity fears also characterized the nonresponder group. Conclusion: Present data suggest some elements that could be useful to focus pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and family counseling on the current psychopathology of each patient. Copyright ¬© 2001 S.

abstract={Excessive dietary intake of sugars could alter various biotransformation processes and the pharmacological and toxicological properties of numerous xenobiotics. In the present study, the effects of glucose supplementation were examined on the neurotoxicity of the organophosphorus (OP) pesticide parathion (PS) and its active metabolite, paraoxon (PO), a potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Rats (n = 6-12/treatment group) were given free access to tap water or 15% glucose (w/v) in tap water beginning 7 d prior to OP toxicant exposure. Food, caloric intake, and body weight were measured daily. Animals were challenged with either PS (4.5, 9, or 18 mg/kg, sc) or PO (0.3, 0.5, or 0.7 mg/kg, sc) and clinical signs of neurotoxicity (i.e., autonomic dysfunction, involuntary movements) were recorded daily for the following 13 d. Glucose feeding was associated with a dramatic drop (‚àº50%) in feed intake and an increase (‚àº20%) in total caloric consumption over the 7 d prior to OP exposure. Functional toxicity associated with PS exposure was increased in glucose-fed (GF) rats, but the glucose diet had no apparent effect on clinical signs of toxicity following PO treatment. Glucose feeding increased the magnitude of AChE inhibition in the frontal cortex and plasma at lower dosages (i.e., 4.5 and 9 mg/kg) 3 d following PS treatment. Time-course studies (3, 7, and 11 d after PS exposure, 18 mg/kg, sc) indicated significantly greater brain and plasma AChE inhibition in glucose-fed animals at later time points. In contrast, glucose feeding had no effect on the degree of AChE inhibition following PO exposure. Neither liver microsomal oxidative desulfuration of PS, nor liver or plasma paraoxonase, nor liver or plasma carboxylesterase activities were measurably affected by glucose feeding. Downregulation of muscarinic receptors 7 d after PS exposure (18 mg/kg, sc) was more extensive in GF rats. It is postulated that excessive glucose consumption decreases the intake of other dietary components, in particular amino acids, limiting the de novo synthesis of AChE and consequent recovery of synaptic transmission. Due to the shorter duration of inhibition following PO exposure, spontaneous reactivation of AChE may be more important than de novo protein synthesis in recovery of function, and thus with the effects of glucose feeding on its toxicity. Individuals that derive a large proportion of their calories from sugars may be at higher risk of acute toxicity from organophosphorus pesticides such as PS.},

abstract={The trade-off between parental care and feeding was studied in the male two-spotted goby (Gobiusculus flavescens F.). Two temperatures, 8.5¬∞C and 13.0¬∞C, were used, with five replicates at each temperature, in order to determine whether temperature influenced parental behaviour. In each replicate, two males and four females were introduced to an aquarium, where the males chose between two nests and courted the females. In each replicate, one male spawned. After spawning, the males guarded the eggs until hatching. The guarding males' behaviour was recorded with a video camera twice a day (15 min each time), once before and once after they were fed. The male's condition (c-factor) was calculated at the start of the experiment and after egg hatching. The eggs were spawned in an artificial nest (half of a PVC tube), and attached to the nest in a single layer. The areas with eggs (representing brood size) were marked after spawning and the fry counted after hatching (which was used to calculate area hatched). Numbers of prey eaten (plankton) and number of aggressive encounters between the guarding male and the other fishes were recorded. Time spent in the nest and time used on fertilisation, fanning and cleaning were estimated and related to egg age, brood size, hatching success, temperature and food availability (no food or food). The results showed that feeding (expected to influence future reproduction) decreased and parental expenditure (current reproduction) increased, as the eggs developed (became closer to independence). Parental expenditure was significantly higher at 13.0¬∞C than at 8.5¬∞C, presumably due to higher oxygen demands by the eggs, and a greater risk of egg-infections. The c-factor of the males guarding eggs decreased over time, in contrast to the non-guarding males' c-factor. Guarding males' aggressiveness decreased as the eggs got older, but increased just before hatching. A possible explanation for this could be the decreasing intrusion by the non-guarding male and females caused by high aggressive behaviour by the guarding male early in the brood cycle. The exploitation of the nest (percentage of total nest area covered by eggs) seemed to determine the amount of parental expenditure and loss of condition, while brood size (area of eggs) had no effect. ¬© 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Experiments were carried out to study the behavioural responses of the Antarctic omnivorous starfish Odontaster validus to the chemical signals produced by undamaged conspecifics. Tested starved animals displayed the ability to distinguish between fed and starved conspecifics. Effluents of starved conspecifics were mostly ignored by O. validus, although they showed a strong and complex reaction to the smell of fed ones. This combination of responses may be expected both to decrease the risk of cannibalism in the feeding aggregations typical for O. validus, and to increase foraging efficiency by stimulating the searching behaviour in animals exposed to satiated conspecifics.},

abstract={Doses of amphetamine or cocaine that fail to induce psychomotor sensitization when given to a rat in its home cage can produce robust sensitization if given immediately following placement into a relatively novel, distinct environment. A drug-associated context can serve as a conditioned stimulus, and therefore may promote robust sensitization by facilitating associative learning processes. We examined this hypothesis by habituating rats to the test environment for 1 or 6-8 hr prior to each drug injection, which degrades the ability of environmental context to serve as an effective conditioned stimulus. When 0.5 mg/kg of amphetamine was administered intravenously immediately after placement into a distinct environment there was a large acute psychomotor response (rotational behavior) on the first test day, and robust sensitization developed with repeated daily injections. When the same treatment was administered in the home cage, there was a small acute response and no sensitization developed. The enhanced acute response seen in the distinct environment was significantly attenuated by 1 hr of habituation to the test environment, and completely abolished by 6-8 hr of habituation. Also, as little as 1 hr of habituation completely prevented the development of a conditioned rotational response. In contrast, neither 1 nor 6-8 hr of habituation had any effect on the ability of amphetamine to induce robust behavioral sensitization. It is concluded that the ability of a distinct environment to facilitate sensitization to amphetamine can be dissociated from its effect on acute drug responsiveness and from the ability of drug-associated environmental stimuli to elicit a conditioned response. Possible mechanisms by which a distinct environment facilitates sensitization are discussed. ¬© 2001 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between pulmonary function, nutritional status, body image, and eating attitudes in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) compared with healthy controls. METHOD: Seventy-six children with CF (39 girls) and 153 healthy control children (82 girls) were recruited. All children were between 7 and 12 years of age. After being weighed and measured, participants undertook a structured 1-to-1 interview. Four measures were used to assess body image: body size (perception and satisfaction) were ascertained using the Children's Body Image Scale (CBIS), which uses photographs of children of various body mass index (BMI) representative of the range of BMI percentiles for children 7 to 12 years of age. Body size satisfaction was measured by the response to the questions, "Do you think your body is 1) much too thin, 2) too thin, 3) just right, 4) too fat, and 5) much too fat?" Body weight satisfaction was measured by the question, "Would you like your body to be 1) much thinner, 2) a little bit thinner, 3) stay the same, 4) a little bit fatter, and 5) much fatter?" Global self-esteem was measured using the children's version of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and Body Esteem Scale using a 24-item scale. Dieting behavior was measured by asking directly about previous weight control behaviors, use of the Dutch Eating Behavior-Restraint Scale (DEBQ-R), and, in children who acknowledged previous dieting behavior, the Children's Eating Attitude Test (ChEAT) was additionally administered. Results. Both girls and boys with CF had significantly reduced BMI percentiles compared with control children. Boys with CF did not have a significantly different BMI compared with girls with CF. There were significant positive correlations between forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) (% of predicted) and BMI percentile in girls (r =.35) and boys (r =.50) with CF. Body image perceptions in boys and girls with CF were examined in relation to the healthy control group using 2 (CF and control groups) by 2 (male and female) analysis of variance. The interaction effect was examined to explore the prediction that girls compared with boys with CF would have greater acceptance of their body shape and less desire to become larger. There were no differences between groups or sex in body esteem. On the CBIS body dissatisfaction score, children with CF were significantly more likely to perceive their ideal body size as a little larger than their current size while control children desired a smaller body size than their current size. CF children had a significantly lower mean score for body size satisfaction (an item assessing perception being too thin) and a significantly higher mean score on body weight satisfaction. There was a significant main effect of gender for only 1 measure, difference between the CBIS body dissatisfaction score, with girls being more likely to nominate a smaller ideal than their current figure. There were no significant interaction effects. Of children with CF and a low BMI (</=10th percentile), 25% of girls and 38% of boys thought they were too thin. Fewer girls (19%) than boys (38%) would have liked to be fatter. The CF group had significantly lower mean scores on the DEBQ-R scale compared with controls. Of the children with CF completing the ChEAT (n = 13), none obtained a score of clinical significance compared with 6 (4%) for controls. To examine predictors of BMI a multiple regression analysis was conducted separately for boys and girls with CF and control boys and girls in which the dependent variable was BMI and the independent variables were FEV(1) (% of predicted) (in CF children only), body esteem, self-esteem, and body dissatisfaction score. In the case of boys with CF, the regression equation was significant (Adjusted R(2) = 0.30). In the case of girls with CF, the regression equation was significant (Adjusted R(2) = 0.25) with body dissatisfaction making a significant independent contribution. For control boys the regression equation was significant (Adjusted R(2) = 0.18). Variables making a significant contribution to the equation were body esteem and body dissatisfaction. Finally, for control girls the regression equation was significant (Adjusted R(2) = 0.13). The only variable to make a significant contribution to the equation was body dissatisfaction. DISCUSSION: Children with CF had very similar body esteem and general self-esteem as controls. A consideration of body image constructs does reveal group differences between perception and satisfaction with body size between groups. Children with CF were more likely to perceive their body size as larger than it actually was and have greater satisfaction with their current body size in contrast to control children. The girls and boys with CF with a higher BMI frequently selected a smaller body size as their ideal. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

abstract={Background. Inconsistencies in the literature linking Type A behaviour pattern (TAB) to coronary heart disease (CHD) may be due to differences in the effects of various components of TAB, namely aggressiveness, hostility, ambitiousness, competitive drive, and a chronic sense of time urgency. Methods. We investigated the association between sense of time urgency/impatience and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) in a study of 340 cases and an equal number of age-, sex-, and community-matched controls. Results. A dose-response relation was apparent among subjects who rated themselves higher on the four-item time urgency/impatience scale (P-value for trend <0.001), with a matched odds ratio (OR) for non-fatal MI of 4.45 (95% CI : 2.20-8.99) comparing those with the highest rating to those with the lowest. After further adjustment for family history of premature MI, physical activity, body mass index, occupation, cigarette smoking, total caloric intake, per cent calories from saturated fat, alcohol intake, lipid levels, treated hypertension and diabetes, the dose-response relation remained (P-value for trend = 0.015) and the adjusted OR for MI was 3.99 (95% CI : 1.32-12.0) comparing those with the highest rating to those with the lowest. Conclusion. In these data, a sense of time urgency/impatience was associated with a dose-response increase in risk of non-fatal MI, independent of other risk factors. Prospective cohort studies of time urgency/impatience and incident CHD events, are needed to confirm or refute these observations from a case-control study.},

abstract={In many parts of the world rates of suicidal behaviour are increasing among young people. Community surveys of suicidal ideation have demonstrated that up to 24% of adolescents have experienced suicidal thoughts at some point in their lives. Rates of attempted suicide are highest among young people, and increased occurrence is reported, particularly among young males. A similar picture emerges with regard to completed suicide, and in some countries rates of suicide among young males are higher than those for older age groups. Risk factors can be grouped according to their social/familial, individual, or environmental nature. Based on these findings an explanatory model of suicidal behaviour can be developed, in which three criteria can be discerned: i.e. trait-dependent factors, including those related to serotonin, personality and cognitive psychological dysfunctions; state-dependent characteristics, such as depression and hopelessness; and threshold factors, which may have a risk-enhancing or protective effect, such as social support, contagion effects, the availability of means, and the accessibility of mental health care. Preventive actions need to be developed, targeting the general population (through, for example, educational programmes) or populations at particular risk, such as adolescents attempting suicide. Potential treatment approaches include the treatment of individual psychopathological phenomena, whether or not in school-based clinics, but particular attention has to be given to inducting and keeping young people at risk in treatment. ¬© 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={We assessed the effects of peripheral leptin on anxiety and exploratory behaviour in the elevated plus-maze and in the four-hole box or Y-maze tests, in rats fed 80% of normal daily food intake and rats fed ad libitum. In the Y-maze test, i.p. injection of 0.4 or 1 mg/kg leptin into rationed rats significantly decreased the percentage of spontaneous alternation behaviour and increased the number of visits. In the elevated plus-maze test, rationed rats spent significantly more time in the open arms (aversive part of the maze) than did rats fed ad libitum. This difference in behaviour was abolished by injecting 0.4 mg/kg leptin. In the four-hole box test, i.p. administration of 1 mg/kg leptin significantly reduced the duration and number of hole visits in rationed and ad libitum fed rats. As with leptin inhibition of food intake, these behavioural changes caused by leptin were prevented by a CCK1 receptor antagonist (L364,718), at a dose that had no effect by itself. Finally, a 20-min stress that increased corticosterone and ACTH levels had no effect on circulating leptin levels and on the leptin content of epididymal fat tissue, stomach and brain. Thus, leptin induces hypoexploration and decreases spontaneous alternation in rats and these effects are partly dependent on nutritional status. These results also suggest that the CCK system may be involved in the induction of these behavioural changes in rats by leptin, via the CCK1 receptor. ¬© 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract={Natural patterns of cooperative sentinel behaviour in Arabian babblers, Turdoides squamiceps, have proven consistent with state-dependent models of individually selfish anti-predator strategies. Here we demonstrate experimentally that sentinel effort within groups is determined simply by individual state. The two highest-ranking males in eight groups were separately fed a supplement of mealworms, each for one day at a time. Control days before and after each treatment confirmed that no carry-over effects occurred, and that most normal sentinel activity was carried out by alpha males, then beta males and then by the rest of the group. When supplemented, both alpha and beta males exhibited similar marked increases in sentinel activity, relative to control days. Unsupplemented males and the rest of the group incompletely compensated for these increases with reductions in sentinel effort. Differences in individual body mass within groups reflected natural and experimental variation in sentinel effort. Alpha and beta males weighed more than other group members, and gained mass only when supplementally fed. There was no evidence either for competitive sentinel behaviour, nor for any increased interference between males during the supplementation treatments. These results therefore provide strong evidence in support of the state-dependent approach to cooperative sentinel behaviour.},

abstract={Caching or storing surplus prey may reduce the risk of starvation during periods of food deprivation. While this behaviour occurs in a variety of birds and mammals, it is infrequent among invertebrates. However, golden orb-web spiders, Nephila edulis, incorporate a prey cache in their relatively permanent web, which they feed on during periods of food shortage. Heavier spiders significantly reduced weight loss if they were able to access a cache, but lost weight if the cache was removed. The presence or absence of stored prey had no effect on the weight loss of lighter spiders. Furthermore, N. edulis always attacked new prey, irrespective of the number of unprocessed prey in the web. In contrast, females of Argiope keyserlingi, who build a new web every day and do not cache prey, attacked fewer new prey items if some had already been caught. Thus, a necessary pre-adaptation to the evolution of prey caching in orb-web spiders may be a durable or permanent web, such as that constructed by Nephila.},

abstract={ABSTRACT: Dispersal polymorphisms are known from many terrestrial organisms that inhabit fluctuating environments, but they are not well-recognized among marine invertebrates. An unusual form of variation was found in the settlement behavior of lecithotrophic larvae of the mollusc Alderia modesta (Lov√©n, 1844) that markedly altered the dispersal potential of sibling larvae. Most clutches contained, in variable proportions, larvae that spontaneously metamorphosed in the egg mass or within 2 d of hatching, and larvae that delayed metamorphosis until encountering the obligate adult food, the yellow-green alga Vaucheria longicaulis. The proportion of larvae undergoing spontaneous metamorphosis within a clutch was highly variable, ranging from 0 to 90 %, and was unrelated to adult size. The proportion of intracapsular metamorphosis was also variable, ranging from 0 to 32 %. The percentage of spontaneous metamorphosis per clutch was phenotypically plastic: when adults were starved, there was a significant tendency for each successive clutch to have a lower percentage of spontaneous metamorphosis, thus increasing the dispersal potential of the offspring. The decrease in spontaneous metamorphosis was significant after only 24 h of starvation. There was no significant increase in the cumulative level of spontaneous metamorphosis after the 2nd day post-hatching, but larval mortality increased as a linear function after the 5th day. Most larvae that did not spontaneously settle in the first 2 d delayed metamorphosis until they were exposed to the adult host alga, V. longicaulis. When 2 d old larvae were exposed to 17 species of macroalgae and sediment from the adult habitat, only V. longicaulis induced significant metamorphosis (93.3 ¬± 6.7 %); all other species of algae and field sediment induced no metamorphosis or low levels (0-9 %) that were not significantly higher than sea water controls. There was no difference in the settlement specificity of 2 and 9 d old larvae when tested against 2 different algae, nor in their ability to complete metamorphosis. The high initial percentage of spontaneous metamorphosis reduces the dispersal potential of some larvae in each clutch relative to their siblings that delay metamorphosis until stimulated by V. longicaulis; this settlement dimorphism represents a novel bet-hedging strategy among marine invertebrates.},

abstract={Genetically distinct anadromous (sockeye) and nonanadromous (kokanee) morphs of the Pacific salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, develop identical, brilliant red color at maturity during sympatric breeding in freshwater streams. The marine and lacustrine environments they occupy prior to maturity, however, appear to differ in the availability of dietary carotenoid pigments necessary to produce red coloration. We tested the hypothesis that kokanee, which occupy carotenoid-poor lakes, are more efficient at using the dietary pigments than are sockeye, which occupy the more productive North Pacific Ocean. In a 2-year controlled breeding study, flesh and skin color of mature and immature crosses fed a low-carotenoid diet were quantified with both a chromameter and by chemical extraction of carotenoid pigments. Results revealed striking countergradient variation in carotenoid use, with kokanee approximately three times more efficient at sequestering the pigments to the flesh musculature than similar age sockeye. This difference translated into virtually nonoverlapping differences between pure crosses in secondary sexual color at maturity, when the pigments are mobilized and transported to the skin. Kokanee crosses turned pinkish red over most of their body, whereas sockeye turned olive green. The olive green was similar to the breeding color of residuals in the wild, the progeny of anadromous sockeye that remain in fresh water and are believed to have given rise to kokanee on numerous independent occasions. Reciprocal hybrids were similar to each other and intermediate to the pure crosses, indicating additive genetic inheritance. Mate choice trials with sockeye males in the wild showed the ancestral morph strongly preferred red over green models. These results suggest a preference for red mates maintained in nonanadromous breeding populations drove the reevolution of the red phenotype in kokanee via more efficient use of dietary carotenoid pigments. This is a novel, yet hidden, mechanism by which sexual selection promotes the genetic differentiation of these sympatric populations.},

abstract={Recent studies have presented evidence that the prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role in every aspect of the cognitive processes necessary for behavioral planning: processing and integration of perceived or memorized information, associative learning, reward-based behavioral control, behavioral selection/decision-making and behavioral guidance. We propose that the creation of novel information is the means by which the prefrontal cortex operates to achieve executive control over behavioral planning. The prefrontal cortex is the site of operation of nodal points, where neural circuits integrate currently available or memorized information to generate the information that is necessary to perform an action. The prefrontal cortex also regulates the flow of information through multiple nodes to meet behavioral demands.},

abstract={The present review points out that visuomotor functions in anurans are modifiable and provides neurophysiological data which suggest modulatory forebrain functions. The retino-tecto/tegmento-bulbar/spinal serial processing streams are sufficient for stimulus-response mediation in prey-catching behaviour. Without its modulatory connections to forebrain structures, however, these processing streams cannot manage perceptual tasks, directed attention, learning performances, and motor skills. (1) Visual prey/non-prey discrimination is based on the interaction of this processing stream with the pretectal thalamus involving the neurotransmitter neuropeptide-Y. (2) Experiments applying the dopamine agonist apomorphine in combination with 2DG mapping and single neurone recording suggest that prey-catching strategies in terms of hunting prey and waiting for prey depend on dose dependent dopaminergic adjustments in the neural macronetwork in which retinal, pretecto-tectal, basal ganglionic, limbic, and mesolimbic structures participate. (3) Visual response properties of striatal efferent neurones support the concept that ventral striatum is involved in directed attention. (4) Various modulatory loops involving the ventral medial pallium modify prey-recognition in the course of visual or visual-olfactory learning (associative learning) or are responsible for stimulus-specific habituation (non-associative learning). (5) The circuits suggested to underlie modulatory forebrain functions are accentuated in standard schemes of the neural macronetwork. These provide concepts suitable for future decisive experiments. ¬© 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract={Three hypotheses to discern the strong positive association between juvenile fish and mangrove habitat were tested with field and laboratory experiments. Artificial mangrove structure in the field attracted slightly more juvenile fish than areas without structure. Artificial structure left to accumulate fouling algae attracted four-times the total number of juvenile fish than areas without structure or areas with clean structure. Community composition of fish attracted to structure with fouling algae was different when compared with areas with no structure or clean structure; five species were attracted by structure with fouling algae whilst two species were associated with structure regardless of fouling algae. Algae were linked to increased food availability and it is suggested that this is an important selection criteria for some species. Other species were apparently attracted to structure for different reasons, and provision of shelter appears to be important. Predation pressure influenced habitat choice in small juvenile fish in laboratory experiments. In the absence of predators, small juveniles of four out of five species avoided shelter but when predators were introduced all species actively sought shelter. Large fish were apparently less vulnerable to predators and did not seek shelter when predators were added to their tank. Feeding rate was increased in the mangrove habitat for small and medium-sized fish compared with seagrass beds and mudflats indicating increased food availability or foraging efficiency within this habitat. Larger fish fed more effectively on the mudflats with an increased feeding rate in this habitat compared with adjacent habitats. The most important aspect of the mangrove habitat for small juvenile fish is the complex structure that provides maximum food availability and minimises the incidence of predation. As fish grow a shift in habitat from mangroves to mudflat is a response to changes in diet, foraging efficiency and vulnerability to predators. ¬© 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={The effect of food concentration on the phenotypic response of life history traits to two predator kairomones was investigated in Daphnia. For the experiment, one clone of Daphnia galeata was used as the prey organism and solutions containing infochemicals (kairomones) of Chaoborus (phantom midge) and Perca (perch) simulated the presence of potential predators. The combined effect of food level and predator kairomone on phenotypic plasticity of Daphnia life history is complex. At low food levels, the responses in life history traits to kairomones are enhanced. For example, in the Perca treatment, this leads to a younger age at first reproduction. The presence of Chaoborus kairomone decreases survival so that death often occurs before reproduction is reached. This results in a strong decrease in the intrinsic rate of population increase and might contribute to the pronounced summer decline of some Daphnia populations during periods of food shortage.},

abstract={The fat reserves of small birds are built up daily as insurance against starvation. They are believed to reflect a trade-off between the risks of starvation and predation such that in situations of high predation risk birds are expected either to reduce their fat reserves in response to mass-dependent predation risk or to increase them in response to foraging interruptions. We assessed the effect on fat reserves of experimentally altering the perceived (but not the actual) risk of predation of wild great tits at a winter feeding site. The perceived predation risk was alternated between 'safe' and 'risky'. Increasing the perceived risk of predation involved 'swooping' a model sparrowhawk over the feeder at four unpredictable times each day, using a remote mechanism. We produce evidence that the experiment was successful in altering the perceived risk of predation. As predicted from the hypothesis of mass-dependent predation risk, great tits (Parus major) carried significantly reduced fat reserves during the 'risky' treatment. Furthermore, dominant individuals were able to reduce their reserves more than subordinates. As birds returned to feeders within seconds after a predator 'attack', the reduction in fat reserves cannot be attributed to an interruption in feeding.},

Risk factors of victims and caregivers were analysed in the context of the social history. In both cases, the victims had a dominant personality and the abusers (the sons) had been strictly controlled and formed by the parent. The victims showed typical risk factors such as living together with the abuser, isolation, dependence on care, income and money administration. Initially, the victims declined help from outside and self-neglect occurred. The unemployed perpetrators lived in social isolation and depended financially and mentally on the victims. In both cases no mental illness was present but there was a decrease of social competence. Legal medicine is predominantly involved in fatal cases in connection with external post-mortem examinations and autopsies. Also in the living, the medico-legal expert can assist in the identification of findings in elderly persons in cases of suspected abuse.},

abstract={This review of sow welfare addresses all aspects of housing for adult female pigs, including the issue of piglet welfare during lactation. It puts the issue of sow welfare in perspective by briefly outlining different approaches to the scientific assessment of welfare, the 'feelings, preference, nature, and the functional or home-ostasis' approaches. We believe the last approach currently offers science the best assessment of welfare and is the approach that is utilised in this review. It involves comparing housing or husbandry systems and risks to welfare on the basis of relative changes in biological (behavioural and physiological) responses and corresponding decreases in fitness (growth rate, reproductive performance, or health/injury/immunology). The review discusses the following areas: (i) housing of individually housed pregnant pigs, with subsections on tethers, stalls, reproductive performance, exercise, and new stall designs; conventional, alternative, and outdoor group housing with subsections on aggression, electronic feeding stations, ecoshelters, and other alternative group housing designs; and other issues, such as lameness, culling, straw and other substrates, diet and hunger, quality of stockpeople, and housing around mating including oestrus detection and mating; and (ii) farrowing and lactating pigs with subsections on farrowing crates and alternative farrowing systems, stress around farrowing and during lactation, maternal behaviour and piglet survival, and sow and piglet injury and lameness. Conclusions and recommendations arising from the review include the need for public education to provide an informed consumer base that will result in some consensus on welfare issues among diverse interest groups and the need for industry education that results in better animal welfare and a sustainable industry. Some specific research recommendations include space allowance and the duration of housing for individually housed pigs, welfare issues of breeding sows in ecoshelters, piglet mortality in alternative systems, aggression in conventional and large groups, bedding, and hunger.},

abstract={The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals states that both structural and social environments should be considered when addressing the husbandry needs of laboratory animals. The purpose of this study was to investigate environmental enrichment strategies that could potentially enhance the well-being of rabbits. Male and female 6-week old New Zealand White rabbits were divided into three groups: food-enriched (Bunny Stix, Bunny Blocks, or celery), non-food enriched (Jingle Ball, Kong toy, or Nylabone), and not enriched. Animals were given a particular enrichment for 1 h daily for 15 days. Home cages were fitted with specially designed plexiglass doors, which allowed the animals' interactions with the objects to be videotaped. The amount of time the animal interacted with each object and the total activity during the 1-h taped session were recorded for each rabbit. Rabbits were weighed weekly. Rabbits spent significantly more time interacting with the Bunny Stix than any other food item or non-food object. In addition, total activity time was significantly greater for all rabbits enriched with food versus any of the non-food items. Weight gains after 15 days did not differ significantly, but there was a trend towards increased weight gains in food-enriched rabbits. In this study, food was a stronger, more sustained enrichment device than were non-food objects.},

abstract={We describe a stochastic model of an animal exploring and foraging within an uncertain environment. Behaviour is determined not by an optimizing algorithm but by fuzzy systems using linguistic rules derived from the information primacy hypothesis which stresses the importance of continual information gathering under conditions of uncertainty. In the model, the animal's hunger increases steadily over time and is reduced by Visiting locations that may contain varying amounts of food. Uncertainty arises from three sources: (1) location novelty or ambiguity, that is, the animal is uncertain whether it has visited the same location before; (2) variation in the amounts of food in a given location; and (3) the recency of information concerning these two aspects of a given location. In complex and changing environments flesh information is likely to be more accurate than old information and consequently our model gives most weight to recently gathered information. All sources of uncertainty are reduced by visiting locations and gathering flesh information. The model is successful in simulating results from experiments investigating such phenomena as: spontaneous alternation; patrolling; the effects of hunger on the variability of learnt responses; latent learning; contrafreeloading; and behaviour following changes in food availability. ¬© 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Studies have shown that animals prenatally exposed to ethanol (E) exhibit deficits in conditioned taste aversion as well as displaying hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) hyperresponsiveness during exposure to stressors. In contrast, postnatal handling has been shown to attenuate both emotional and HPA reactivity under certain conditions. The present study tested the hypothesis that handling could attenuate adverse effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on consummatory behavior and HPA activity in a conditioned taste aversion task. We found that both prenatal ethanol exposure and handling independently increased saccharin consumption over 5 days of pretoxicosis exposure, suggesting that neophobia decreased at a faster rate in these animals. When conditioned aversion was assessed in handled animals under nondeprived conditions, E animals showed increased consumption compared to controls. Furthermore, across prenatal groups, lower corticosterone (CORT) levels were found in handled compared to nonhandled animals during reexposure under food-deprived conditions, emphasizing the importance of assessing both behavior and HPA function when examining an animal's response to a task and indicating that handling may not be effective at attenuating some deficits in E animals. ¬© 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract={Red-backed salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, show a variety of alarm responses to chemical cues from eastern garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis. We measured the foraging activity of red-backed salamanders exposed to water soiled by a garter snake (fed P. cinereus) or to unsoiled water. Salamanders exposed to snake-soiled water showed less foraging activity than salamanders exposed to unsoiled water; therefore, predators could have nonlethal effects on salamander populations. Our results also show additional factors influenced salamander foraging activity. Salamander foraging activity and responsiveness to chemical cues do not appear to have been affected by sex or food deprivation. Salamander foraging activity does appear to have been influenced by activity biorhythms. Foraging activity of animals in both treatments showed a bimodal periodicity that is consistent with natural activity patterns controlled by internal biorhythms. Exposure to snake-soiled water significantly reduced foraging activity during periods of peak foraging activity, but had a subtler effect on foraging activity during natural lulls in activity. We suggest that both activity biorhythms and exposure to chemical cues are important factors affecting salamander foraging behavior.},

abstract={Leporids have long been known to reingest soft faeces. However, it was recently found that they regularly reingest hard faeces, too. During the daytime, both soft and hard faeces are defecated and all of the faeces are reingested. Excreted at night are the hard faeces, which are normally discarded but reingested in starvation. The separation mechanism in the proximal colon, which diverts fine particles into the caecum and thus only passes large food particles, produces hard faeces. When the mechanism ceases acting, fermented caecal materials are excreted as soft faeces. The reingestion of soft faeces, rich in vitamins and microbial proteins, is physiologically imperative. Hard faeces are basically a refuse, but their thorough mastication at reingestion reduces poorly digestible large particles to fine ones good for fermentation. The regular reingestion of daytime hard faeces thus promotes food digestibility. The temporary use of night-time hard faeces allows leporids to do without food for some time. It thus gives leporids behavioural flexibility and thereby an ecological advantage. Reingestion is also known in other small- to medium-sized herbivores, which are all caecal fermenters. Morphological differentiation between faeces is reported only in larger species, but all ingested faeces are found to be richer in nutrients than discarded ones. Thus a separation mechanism is probably present in all reingesting species. Reingestion activity is deeply related to other behavioural and physiological traits of small mammalian herbivores, hence its study is important to understanding of their ecology and biology. Leporids are the largest of the reingesting species except for the semi-aquatic Coypu, and reingestion by leporids is certainly the most sophisticated. This development of a reingestion-involved digestive system has probably brought them to their present niche, as terrestrial medium-sized generalist mammalian herbivores, and consequently made their characteristic hide-and-run lifeforms by exposing them to a strong predation pressure.},

abstract={Using food supplementation, we tested whether food limits juvenile survival in a population of Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) in northeastern Utah. The influence of additional food on female nest attendance also was investigated because those strategies may influence predation mortality rates of juveniles. We provided supplemental food near 13 nests from close to hatching until close to independence during the 1996 and 1997 breeding seasons. Thirteen additional nests served as controls and received no supplemental food. We compared the following variables at treatment and control nests: (1) adult female mass, (2) nestling mass and size, (3) female nest attendance, and (4) juvenile survival. Following supplemental feeding, adult females from treatment nests were heavier than their control counterparts, and remained closer to the nest during the latter part of the nestling period and throughout the postfledging period. Nestlings from supplemented nests were significantly heavier than those from unsupplemented nests, but results for size measurements were equivocal. Survival rates for treatment nestlings were significantly higher than controls in 1997, but not in 1996. Those results support the hypothesis that food does not limit avian reproductive success on an annual basis. Most deaths in 1997 were the result of starvation or sibling competition. That observation, and the fact that fed nestlings were heavier, is consistent with the idea that treatment nestlings were in improved nutritional condition. Overall patterns of mass and nest-attendance for adult female goshawks supports the hypothesis that female condition and behavior are adjusted in response to food supplies. However, it is less clear what role the females' presence in the nest stand plays in mediating juvenile deaths, because we did not document predation as a primary mortality factor during the two years of this study. The apparent flexibility in female nest attendance behavior suggests that such plasticity may be an adaptation to lower the risk of predation.},

abstract={The provisioning parameters, breeding success, adult mass, and survival of yellow-nosed albatrosses were studied over 7 successive years at Amsterdam Island, southern Indian Ocean. We examined the ability of this long-lived seabird to adjust its breeding effort under different environmental conditions and the fitness consequences in terms of survival and quality of offspring produced. Provisioning rate and adult mass varied extensively between years, and the lowest and highest values were associated with sea surface temperature anomalies. When waters around the island were colder, adults were in good condition and brought large meals at short intervals, whereas warmer waters resulted in lower provisioning rates, lower adult mass, and lighter chicks at fledging. Adult survival and fledging success were not affected by sea surface temperature anomalies. Yellow-nosed albatrosses appear to be unable to adjust their breeding effort every season, and their differential breeding investment probably primarily reflects different levels of food availability. Yellow-nosed albatrosses are able to regulate their provisioning behavior according to the nutritional status of their chick only when conditions are favorable. Birds appear to invest primarily in their own future maintenance rather than in provisioning. They have a wide safety margin in body mass that limits mortality risks during good years as well as during poor years. However, during unfavorable seasons adults continue to provision chicks that have a poor prospect of survival to breeding, without additional survival costs for the parents. Favorable seasons therefore have a high value in terms of fitness because of the high quality of the chick produced. We suggest that understanding how long-lived animals optimize their provisioning behavior and lifetime reproduction can only be achieved through studies encompassing several contrasted seasons.},

abstract={The polygyny threshold model states that secondary females gain benefits from high territory quality that outweigh the costs of sharing a male. We aimed to test this prediction using the dusky warbler as a model species. We first showed that neither the shifted sex ratio hypothesis nor the no-cost models were likely to apply to our study. Secondary females settled in territories of higher quality (high food abundance, low predator density) and had a nonsignificantly higher reproductive success than simultaneously settling monogamous females. However, there were strong indications that these two groups of females differed intrinsically. Secondary females were older than late monogamous females, and while they replaced lost clutches more often, they also suffered from a nonsignificantly higher winter mortality. Consequently, it was impossible to tell whether differences in reproductive success were caused by differences in territory quality or in female qualities. Our study suggests that female choice may also depend on characteristics that are specific to the individual, and may therefore be more sophisticated than allowed for in traditional polygyny models. In other words, the polygyny threshold may be not the same for all individuals. We suggest that prior breeding experience may help older females to profit more from the benefits and to suffer less from the costs of polygyny than young females. ¬© 2001.

abstract={Reducing the risk of predation is an important feature of the feeding behaviour of most animals. In social insects, foraging workers are particularly vulnerable, and the ability to trade-off mortality risk against food value may provide a considerable competitive advantage for the colony. We investigated the response of Argentine ants, Linepithema humile, to different kinds of disturbance while workers foraged on food of differing quality. The behaviour of disturbed individuals was influenced by group size, by the behaviour of nearby nestmates and by how much food had already been consumed. When in large groups, workers were less likely to leave the foraging arena and resumed feeding more rapidly. This response was even more marked among workers whose gasters were only partially replete. However, individuals took more time to resume feeding and became more likely to run away from a food source when greater numbers of ants were disturbed. These influences may allow foraging groups to maximise food intake while minimising the mortality of workers.},

abstract={The effect of water level changes and wading birds' abundance on the foraging behaviour of the blacknecked stork (BNS) Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus was studied from January 1995 to June 1997 in Dudwa National Park, Uttar Pradesh. Our observations indicate that BNS territoriality increased as food levels became depleted, resulting in increased rates of aggression towards intruders. Chasing or aggression was more intense during the early period (February and March) than the late period (April, May and June). Most of (> 50%) the aggressive encounters were observed between 0600 and 1000 h of the day. Seventeen species (including BNS) were observed interacting with BNS, throughout the study period. Most interactions were with the spoonbill, Platalea leucorodia (67.4%), followed by the whitenecked stork, Ciconia episcopus (16.6%). The distance (while foraging) between BNS and other wading birds varied significantly (P < 0.001) between years indicating that BNS and other water birds foraged at different water depths and thereby explored the wetlands fully. Spoonbills were chased often; the number varied from 1 to 43 birds. BNS occasionally accepted the presence of other wading birds, including spoonbills and started foraging amidst them. This led to successful foraging of BNS (solitary feeder). Other fish-eating bird species and their numbers also limited the food consumption of foraging BNS as they had to spend time chasing away the intruders. Availability of the preferred prey fish species, Heteropnestus fossilis, forced BNS to stay throughout the year in their respective territories. High (> 60 cm) water levels were not suitable for BNS even though the patch had high prey abundance.},

abstract={Both the pattern of exploration and the manipulation efficiency of young keas attempting to open a complex food container proved to be influenced by the observation of an experienced group member. Five individuals were allowed to observe a trained conspecific that iteratively demonstrated several techniques to open a large steel box. The lid of the box could be opened only after several locking devices had been dismantled: a bolt had to be poked out, a split pin had to be pulled, and a screw had to be twisted out. The observers' initial manipulative actions were compared with those of five na√Øve control subjects (nonobservers). Although the observers failed to open the box completely and thus to get the reward in their first attempts, they explored more, approached the locking devices sooner and were more successful at opening them. Although their initial attempts did not match the response topography or the sequence of the model's actions (movement or sequence imitation), their improved efficiency at unlocking the devices seemed to reflect the acquisition of some functional understanding of the task through observation (emulation learning). ¬© 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={We studied the selection response of the freshwater grazing zooplankter, Daphnia galeata, to increased abundance of cyanobacteria in its environment. Cyanobacteria are a poor-quality and often toxic food. Distinct genotypes of D. galeata were hatched from diapausing eggs extracted from three time horizons in the sediments of Lake Constance, Europe, covering the period 1962 to 1997, a time of change in both the prevalence of planktonic cyanobacteria and levels of phosphorus pollution. We assessed whether the grazers evolved to become more resistant to dietary cyanobacteria by exposing genetically distinct clones to two diets, one composed only of the nutritious green alga, Scenedesmus obliquus (good food), and the other a mixture of S. obliquus and the toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa (poor food), Genotype performance was measured as the specific rate of weight gain from neonate to maturity (gj). We evaluated evolutionary change in the Daphnia population using an analysis of reaction norms based on relative (log-transformed) changes in gj. Log(gj) is a measure of the proportional effect of dietary cyanobacteria on other fitness components of the Daphnia phenotype. For comparison, we also analyze absolute (i.e., nontransformed) changes in gj and discuss the interpretations of the two approaches. Statistical results using a general linear model demonstrate a significant effect of genotype (showing differences in gj among genotypes), a significant genotype x food-type interaction (showing differences in phenotypic plasticity among genotypes), and, in the case of log-transformed data, a significant sediment-genotype-age x food-type interaction. The latter shows that phenotypic plasticity evolved over the period studied. Two constraints act on response to selection in the D. galeata - Lake Constance system. First, gj on a diet containing poor food is highly correlated with gj on a diet of good food, thus evolving resistance also meant evolving an increase in gj on both diets. Second, because genotypes with a high gj also grow to a large adult body size, which in turn increases Daphnia vulnerability to fish predation, we suggest that selection only acted to favor genotypes possessing a high potential gj after cyanobacteria became prevalent. The presence of cyanobacteria depressed realized gj and led to animals of small adult body size even if their genotypes had the potential for high gj and large size. With realized gj reduced, genotypes with an inherently high value could be selected even in the presence of predatory fish. The joint action of selection by dietary cyanobacteria and vulnerability to fish predation provides an explanation for the observed evolution of resistance to poor food through reduced phenotypic plasticity.},

abstract={Using an automatic identification and weighing system, we investigated changes in adult body mass in relation to reproductive behaviour during courtship and incubation in free-living king penguins. Despite stressful nutritional conditions and variability of fast length, the majority of pairs incubated successfully by accumulating large body reserves before fasting, which provided flexibility in fasting strategies. Our data indicate a low body mass during fasting below which males either delayed or stopped breeding: (1) at 12 kg, the male interruped courtship to replenish his body reserves at sea before re-engaging in courtship; and (2) when body mass dropped to 9 kg during incubation, the male deserted the egg. The behavioural decision to go to sea was not controlled by the time spent fasting, but by the amount of body reserves. In deserting males, the depletion of body reserves during incubation before relief by the females was due to a lower stored energy (- 2 kg) at the onset of courtship compared with successful males. Unsuccessful males weighed only 12 kg when they started to court, and consequently had no safety margin that allowed them to wait for a delayed female. The unusual depletion of body reserves of male breeders caused only 3% of incubation attempts to fail. Compared with successful pairs, their female partners gained less body mass at sea (- 40 g/day) and made a slightly longer foraging trip (+5 days). We suggest that the deserting males had risked breeding with the lowest fasting safety margin possible, rather than breeding later that year. However, the low body mass at desertion did not affect the penguins& survival or their feeding capacity, and therefore did not compromise another breeding attempt during the next season. ¬© 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={We analysed the effects of forest fragmentation on the flock structure of insectivorous forest passerines (Parus, Aegithalos, Certhia, Regulus, etc.), and on the anti-predator behaviour and energy management of blue tits in these flocks. We surveyed flocks in Central Spain during two winters. Flocks in fragments comprised fewer individuals and species than flocks in unfragmented forests. The most abundant species in forest flocks (blue tit, Parus caeruleus, and firecrest, Regulus ignicapillus) were also the most abundant in fragments, while the rarest species in the area never occurred in small woodlots. We investigated how fragmentation and related changes in flock structure affect anti-predator behaviour of blue tits, a widely distributed species in the area. In fragments but not in forests, blue tits increased scanning rates with decreasing flock size. Vigilance was relaxed when great tits, Parus major, were abundant as flock mates, suggesting that the absence of this dominant species in fragments could intensify anti-predator behaviour of blue tits. Blue tits enhanced anti-predator behaviour in the second winter parallel to an increase in the abundance of raptors. This behavioural change was stronger in fragments, where blue tits foraged deeper in the canopy and increased scanning and hopping rates. Under increased predation risk, birds are expected to reduce body mass to improve predator avoidance. On average, blue tits weighed similar in fragments and forests the second winter. However, they accumulated fat along the day in fragments only, and adjusted body mass to body size more closely in that habitat type. This suggests that blue tits perceived fragments as unpredictable habitats where fattening would help avoid starvation, but also as dangerous sites where overweight would further increase the risk of predation. In summary, our results support that fragmentation affects individual behaviour of blue tits, and show the potential of behavioural approaches to unravel how different species face the advancing fragmentation of their habitats.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE - To examine the association of stage of change with diet and exercise behaviors in response to a lifestyle intervention for Native Hawaiians (NHs). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A family ('ohana) support lifestyle intervention was compared with a standard intervention in NHs with or at risk for diabetes in two rural communities in Hawaii (n = 147). Stage of change, as a hypothesized mediator of behavior change, and dietary and exercise behaviors were measured at baseline and at 1 year postintervention. RESULTS - Stage of change was significantly associated with positive dietary and exercise behaviors. NHs receiving the 'ohana support (OS) intervention were more likely to advance from pre-action to action/maintenance for fat intake and physical activity than the group who received the standard intervention. Participants in the OS group who advanced from pre-action to action/ maintenance showed more improvement in fat intake and physical activity than those in the standard group. CONCLUSIONS - These initial findings suggest that stage of change is an important factor in mediating lifestyle behavior changes in persons with or at risk for diabetes and merits further study among minority populations at high risk for diabetes.},

abstract={This study has used time-lapse video recordings to analyze the burrow-related behaviour of N. norvegicus under a 12 h light: Dark regime in aquarium conditions, and compared this with the behaviour of lobsters infected by the parasitic dinoflagellate Hematodinium. Uninfected lobsters performed a higher number of burrow departures, of longer duration, during the hours of darkness than during the light. Infected lobsters performed a relatively constant number of departures of similar-duration in the light and the dark periods. However, the mean number of departures per day performed by infected lobsters (70 day-1) was more than double that of uninfected lobsters (30.1 day-1), while the mean duration of burrow departures performed by infected lobsters (258.5 s . departure-1) was more than six times greater than in uninfected lobsters (38.7 s . departure-1). This led to a more than ten-times increace (from 1.7 to 19.4%) in the percentage of the day spent out of the burrow by infected lobsters. This altered burrow related behaviour could be due to the nutritional demands of the parasites on infected lobsters, causing an increased requirement to forage, or alternatively to a 'functional hypoxia', due to the additional respiratory demands of the parasite, causing the host to emerge from the burrow onto the sediment surface to seek oxygen. Implications for the increased time spent out of the burrow are discussed in relation to availability of infected lobsters by trawlers and predators, and to the use of infection prevalence data from trawl-caught samples in stock assessment models for N. norvegicus.},

abstract={Passerines maintain low levels of fat in winter even though larger fat reserves would provide better insurance against starvation. This is believed to be a result of predation risk and/or metabolic expenditure increasing with the amount of fat carried. Recent empirical studies indicate that the effect of increased mass on predation risk is small, but the effect on metabolic expenditure is large. Using dynamic modelling, I investigated how mass-dependent costs affect the pattern of fat gain. I found that increases in metabolic expenditure were sufficient to explain strong regulation of the level of fat, but that increases in direct predation risk cannot be excluded. A plausible explanation for the increase in metabolic expenditure is if the extra weight is compensated for by a parallel gain in flight muscle. Such compensation means that an increase in instantaneous predation risk can be avoided, but that costs depending on an increase in energy intake may occur instead. For example more time spent foraging increases exposure to predators. Hence, one form of predation risk (impaired ability to escape from an attacking predator) may be traded for another (more time spent foraging). This will be beneficial if this extended foraging is not risky, whereas failure to compensate for the extra mass would mean the risk of being caught by a predator increasing considerably. Besides the widely recognized trade-off between starvation and predation, this means that there may also be a trade-off between different forms of predation in wintering birds. ¬© 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={How do different levels of sibling competition affect nestling growth strategies? We investigated this through the effect of different levels of per capita feeding rate on the average growth rate of nestlings and on individual growth strategies within broods. To manipulate sibling competition, we transferred marsh tit nestlings between nests creating broods with fewer (reduced) or more (enlarged) nestlings than originally, Mean mass decreased as brood size, and thus sibling competition, increased. This was due to a large difference in mass between the smallest young in each brood. The mass of the largest young did not differ significantly between the broods. In reduced broods, the largest and smallest nestlings had equal mass, whereas in enlarged broods the difference was large. In contrast, wing length close to fledging did not differ between the experimental broods. We conclude that the growth of the wing has priority over general increase in size. This depends on the risk of starving for nestlings unable to leave the nest when their most dominant sibling leaves. Thus, low intake rates induce a trade-off in the growth of different structures, leading subdominant nestlings to divert proportionally more resources to wing length growth at the expense of general size. Subdominant nestlings are thus facing both a food constraint, depending on parental feeding rate and number of dominant siblings, and a time constraint, depending on the growth rate of the largest sibling. Hence, to fledge successfully, subdominant nestlings will leave the nest at suboptimal masses with a likely increase in postfledging mortality. ¬© 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Isolated individuals of most species are thought to be at a higher risk of mortality from starvation and predation than those in groups. However, supporting evidence remains scant. As part of a broader study of grey-cheeked mangabey, Lophocebus albigena, dispersal in Kibale National Park, Uganda between October 1996 to February 1999, we investigated starvation and mortality risks within a sample of 27 radiotagged mangabey males. Each male was contacted on average three times a week to collect data on spatial relations, habitat use, activity patterns and fates. We assessed risks by comparing data from 'isolated' (‚â•200 m from the group) males with data from 'within-group' males. We assessed starvation risks by comparing proportions of time spent in feeding, foraging and moving, comparing rates of movement during focal samples, and comparing proportions of time that males spent in different habitat types and canopy levels. We assessed mortality risks by comparing scanning rates and mortality events of within-group and isolated males. Isolated males spent significantly more time scanning, but we could detect no other significant differences in time allocated to different activities by the two categories of males. Nor could we detect differences between within-group and isolated males in the use of habitat types and canopy levels. At least three of five established mortality events involved males known to be isolated from groups. Given that males were found isolated only 11% of the time, it is estimated that isolated males were at least 12 times as likely to die as within-group males. These results suggest that dispersing males may not face increased risk of starvation, but are at higher risk of mortality (primarily through predation by eagles) than nondispersing males. ¬© 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Background: Odour-taste associative learning in the terrestrial slug offers a useful model for long-term memory formation and retention. The genes which are expressed over 2 h after a learning event are thought to include those related to memory formation and/or consolidation. It is very important to examine what kinds of genes are expressed following associative learning. Results: We identified a novel slug gene, the expression of which was regulated by associative learning and mostly restricted to the procerebrum (PC), a place that olfactory information is believed to be processed in slug. This gene encodes a 121 amino acid, 18 kDa secretory protein which we term LAPS18. Expression of the LAPS18 gene was induced in somata and the protein spread to neurites in the PC of slugs subjected to paired conditioning. Recombinant LAPS18 promoted the aggregation and movement of PC neurones in culture and they were blocked by the anti-LAPS18 antibody. Beads coupled with LAPS18 protein attached to PC neurones and the beads aggregated through PC cells but not by themselves, suggesting that LAPS18 may require a counterpart molecule for PC neurone aggregation. Conclusions: An increased expression and translocation of LAPS18 protein after paired conditioning may be needed for long-term memory formation and retention in the slug. Since genes homologous to LAPS18 genes in the land slug Limax are found from vertebrates including human, analysing the expression and function of LAPS18 may be important in understanding the molecular mechanism of memory formation and retention.},

abstract={Several factors appear to affect vertical HIV-1 transmission, dependent mainly on characteristics of the mother (extent of immunodeficiency, co-infections, risk behaviour, nutritional status, immune response, genetical make-up), but also of the virus (phenotype, tropism) and, possibly, of the child (genetical make-up). This complex situation is compounded by the fact that the virus may have the whole gestation period, apart from variable periods between membrane rupture and birth and the breast-feeding period, to pass from the mother to the infant. It seems probable that an extensive interplay of all factors occurs, and that some factors may be more important during specific periods and other factors in other periods. Factors predominant in protection against in utero transmission may be less important for peri-natal transmission, and probably quite different from those that predominantly affect transmission by mothers milk. For instance, cytotoxic T lymphocytes will probably be unable to exert any effect during breast-feeding, while neutralizing antibodies will be unable to protect transmission by HIV transmitted through infected cells. Furthermore, some responses may be capable of controlling transmission of determined virus types, while being inadequate for controlling others. As occurence of mixed infections and recombination of HIV-1 types is a known fact, it does not appear possible to prevent vertical HIV-1 transmission by reinforcing just one of the factors, and probably a general strategy including all known factors must be used. Recent reports have brought information on vertical HIV-1 transmission in a variety of research fields, which will have to be considered in conjunction as background for specific studies.},

abstract={The ultimate goal of feeding puppies and kittens is to ensure a healthy adult. The specific objectives, however, are to optimize growth, minimize risk factors for disease, and achieve optimal health and longevity. Minimum nutrient requirements are easiest to determine in growing animals using growth rates as the nutritional marker. These levels ensure a minimum level of good health in most animals. Nevertheless, the optimal nutrient levels for growth may not represent the optimal levels for other physiologic functions (e.g., immune function, disease prevention, behavior). Nutritional requirements for growing animals are being redefined using physiologic parameters other than growth rate. The most common causes of malnutrition in the neonate seem to be protein-energy deficiency or overnutrition in the perinatal period. Single micronutrient abnormalities are relatively uncommon. Nevertheless, the nutritional status during neonatal development is known to affect genetic expression and to have a lifelong impact. It is thus important to tailor the nutritional plan to the individual at each life stage and to remember that pediatric nutrition should start before conception.},

abstract={The Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) is the dominant paradigm in predicting patch use and numerous tests support its qualitative predictions. Quantitative tests under complex foraging situations could be expected to be more variable in their support because the MVT assumes behavior maximizes only net energy-intake rate. However across a survey of 26 studies, foragers rather consistently "erred" in staying too long in patches. Such a consistent direction to the errors suggests that the simplifying assumptions of the MVT introduce a systematic bias rather than just imprecision. Therefore, I simulated patch use as a state-dependent response to physiological state, travel cost, predation risk, prey densities, and fitness currencies other than net-rate maximization (e.g., maximizing survival, reproductive investment, or mating opportunities). State-dependent behavior consistently results in longer patch residence times than predicted by the MVT or another foraging model, the minimize Œº/g rule, and these rules fail to closely approximate the best behavioral strategy over a wide range of conditions. Because patch residence times increase with state-dependent behavior, this also predicts mass regulation below maximum energy capacities without direct mass-specific costs. Finally, qualitative behavioral predictions from the MVT about giving-up densities in patches and the effects of travel costs are often inconsistent with state-dependent behavior. Thus in order to accurately predict patch exploitation patterns, the model highlights the need to: (1) consider predator behavior (sit-and-wait versus actively foraging); (2) identify activities that can occur simultaneously to foraging (i.e., mate search or parental care); and (3) specify the range of nutritional states likely in foraging animals. Future predictive models of patch use should explicitly consider these parameters.},

abstract={There are many explanations for the sex-specific difference in life expectancy. An important reason for this difference can be found in the genome difference of one sex chromosome. It is obvious that testosterone, as an effective hormonal product of this genome difference, influences not only morphology, physiology and risk profiles of diseases but also social behavior and lifestyle. Statistical simulations are, for physicians, an unusual way to demonstrate differences in human mortality, but they may help to show other, and more abstract, aspects of nature. The Penna model of biological aging is a well-established model for simulating the influence of genetic factors on sex-specific mortality. In this study, the Penna model is explained and modified to take into account the potentially detrimental effects of testosterone on male mortality. This is achieved by a modification of the Verhulst factor, starting with male puberty. We demonstrated that about one-third of the sex-specific difference in life expectancy may be caused by the influence of testosterone in this mathematical aging model. These results do not show that male vices (smoking, drinking, risk-taking behavior, etc.) can be attributed only to testosterone even though it may appear so from the statistics. There are some correlations but not causal relations. It seems, even from the view of a mathematical - statistical simulation, that males are discriminated against regarding mortality and life expectancy. This underlines the need for sex-specific research, social policy and preventive programs (e.g. sports, nutrition) for minimizing the negative impact of male-specific genetic and hormonal factors.},

abstract={Plant morphology is dramatically influenced by environmental signals. The growth and development of the root system is an excellent example of this developmental plasticity. Both the number and placement of lateral roots are highly responsive to nutritional cues. This indicates that there must be a signal transduction pathway that interprets complex environmental conditions and makes the "decision" to form a lateral root at a particular time and place. Lateral roots originate from differentiated cells in adult tissues. These cells must reenter the cell cycle, proliferate, and redifferentiate to produce all of the cell types that make up a new organ. Almost nothing is known about how lateral root initiation is regulated or coordinated with growth conditions. Here, we report a novel growth assay that allows this regulatory mechanism to be dissected in Arabidopsis. When Arabidopsis seedlings are grown on nutrient media with a high sucrose to nitrogen ratio, lateral root initiation is dramatically repressed. Auxin localization appears to be a key factor in this nutrient-mediated repression of lateral root initiation. We have isolated a mutant, lateral root initiation 1 (lin1), that overcomes the repressive conditions. This mutant produces a highly branched root system on media with high sucrose to nitrogen ratios. The lin1 phenotype is specific to these growth conditions, suggesting that the lin1 gene is involved in coordinating lateral root initiation with nutritional cues. Therefore, these studies provide novel insights into the mechanisms that regulate the earliest steps in lateral root initiation and that coordinate plant development with the environment.},

abstract={Most established risk factors for chronic disease incidence and mortality from cancer, such as cigarette smoke, alcohol drinking, occupational and environmental hazards and dietary factors, have been shown to vary in their importance in terms of relative risk. In studies which addressed the individual level of behaviour, but also coping and self-regulation, a strong modifying effect of long-lasting hopelessness and helplessness has been found to depend on personality. Autonomy and healthful self-regulation have been defined as the regulation of behaviour in those activities which are carried out in the physical and social environment and lead to stimulated feeling, pleasure, perception of inner and social security, and competence. Persons with such well-regulated behaviour are capable of coping with sources of listlessness, uncertainty and instability. Those individuals showing a well-regulated behaviour arrive at a psycho-neuro-physiological basis for better competence and defence against health hazards. The capability determined by the degree of self-regulation is measured with different instruments. The experience with a questionnaire for the assessment of self-regulation, its quantification and predictive value is presented here. The method of study is by prospective approach, which permits the demonstration of causal associations (promotion, co-causality) and facilitates the experimental approach through intervention. A causal association is likely if the effect of a modifier is not only found in a prospective (observational) follow-up but also if the (experimental) intervention shows an effect. The method of intervention by stimulation of self-regulation is the autonomy training developed by Grossarth-Maticek. Using several examples presenting the method, the modifying effect is shown by referring to four risk factors. If the risk factors are associated with an inhibited self-regulation, then the effect in terms of disease and pathological outcome is stronger. This was shown with the hazardous effects of smoking, alcohol drinking and dietary malnutrition as well as with automobile exhaust. It may be important, for example, whether a person feels self-determined when driving a car for hours but does not need to consume ethanol-containing drinks for feeling well. One's own capability to regulate well over time apparently modulates functions of the body and hence modifies the effects of physical factors. In epidemiological studies, which assess mostly only exogenous factors (so called established risk factors) this evidence has to be considered by including the pertinent data on the relevant questions in each field study.},

abstract={‚Ä¢ It is difficult to predict, on first contact with patients with AN, whether a compulsory admission to hospital may become necessary to protect their lives and health. There are only tentative pointers so far to an entrenched avoidance of treatment: (1) components of a disordered personality associated with a history of childhood physical or sexual abuse or previous episodes of self-harm and (2) the presence of a more severe illness, suggested by numerous previous admissions. ‚Ä¢ An involuntary admission is likely to be beneficial at least in the short term, as shown by a gratifying weight gain, although a longer period of inpatient stay may be necessary. ‚Ä¢ Patients who have required compulsory detention are at a considerable risk in the long-term as shown by their high mortality rates. It is, therefore, essential to organize long-term observation for all patients who required involuntary admission for AN. ‚Ä¢ A compulsory admission for AN does not require compulsory treatment, such as forced feeding by NGT or other intrusive methods. Clinicians who contemplate a compulsory admission for a seriously ill anorexic patient might therefore question the advantages provided by the detention. First, clinicians can be assured that it should be possible to induce a satisfactory weight gain through persistent nursing methods without running the risk of these patients discharging themselves. With inpatients, the goals are nearly always attained, although the admission may be longer than average. Not only do these patients' nutrition improve vastly, but also they are likely to show improvements in their mental state. Secondly, these patients are likely to learn that the professional staff, their families, and outside agencies take their illness very seriously, even if patients themselves do not seem to. This is particularly evident when patients appeal to a Mental Health Review Tribunal for release. They attend the proceedings and hear the evidence presented by their psychiatrists, the nursing staff, and their nearest relatives. The tribunal usually sustains the compulsory admission: The patient may be initially distressed, but in the long run the experience is generally therapeutic. Finally, compulsory admission permits more stringent forms of supervision. For example, patients who vomit may have legitimately restricted access to bathrooms. Patients addicted to exercise may be rationed to sensibly short periods of walking daily. Patients who are extremely anxious or overactive may be required to take appropriate tranquilizing or sedating drugs, such as one of the benzodiazepine drugs. ‚Ä¢ Clinicians sometimes are reluctant to resort to compulsory admission because of a fear of damaging the therapeutic relationship with their patients. Clinical observations, however, point to the converse being the case, as shown in several studies. Tiller et al maintain: "Compulsory treatment may be an act of compassion: It shows that professionals recognize the severity of the illness and that they are prepared to contain the anxieties provoked by weight gain. Often the patients and their families are immensely relieved to hand over the responsibility, temporarily, to the professional team.".},

abstract={Abundantly fed Euplotes versatilis n. sp. undergo unequal fissions yielding opisthes definitely larger than proters and larger than mothers. This process results in production of giant cells some of which become predatory or cannibalistic. Starvation induces the reversion to the small phenotype, by means of both unequal fissions yielding smaller opisths and physiological reorganizations. These size variations are associated with extensive variations of the dorsal argyrome pattern, the taxonomic value of which is therefore poor. The largest cells exhibit supernumerary ventral cirri and dorsal kineties. A somewhat similar phenotypic plasticity is known in E. balteatus and at a lesser degree in E. focardii. The latter shares with E. versatilis an uncommon asymmetrical mode of conjugation. The three species are assumed to be phylogenetically close and adapted to frequent and unpredictable variations of food availability. From a morphogenetical point of view, the occurrence of unequal cell fission in these species is assumed to be related to some genetically modified integration of cellular growth with the other components of the cell cycle, so that fission may be triggered even in cells with a posterior part much larger or much smaller than the anterior one.},

abstract={Much has been written about Vincent van Gogh's pathological condition. Most authors base their various diagnoses on the symptoms he exhibited in the last years of his life. However, Van Gogh during a much longer part of his life displayed symptoms best consistent with a borderline (personality) disorder: Impulsivity, variable moods, self-destructive behaviour fear of abandonment, an unbalanced self-image, authority conflicts and other complicated relationships. The precipitating element disturbing Vincent's psychic balance - delicate in any case due to a positive family history, malnutrition, intoxication and exhaustion and the borderline disorder - may have been his being deserted by his friend Gauguin. He (also) developed an organic psychosyndrome with psychotic and epileptic elements. The stress (due to social isolation, by his being a psychiatric patient, and by poor prospects), the intoxication going on outside the hospitals and especially also the problems relating to his brother Theo caused a downward spiral culminating in suicide.},

abstract={CART (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript) peptides are novel brain neuropeptides that have been shown to have a role in the control of feeding behavior in mammals. The effects of intracereboventricular (i.c.v.) administration of two CART fragments, CART (62-76) and CART (55-102) on feeding and behavioral activity of goldfish (Carassius auratus) were examined. Both CART peptide fragments inhibited food intake in goldfish. Co-injection of CART peptide and neuropeptide Y (NPY) reduced the increase in feeding caused by injection of NPY alone. CART (55-102) was more potent than CART (62-76). Co-treatment with CART (55-102) and orexin A inhibited the feeding response induced by orexin A alone. Feeding behavior was stimulated relative to saline controls following injection of CART (62-76) alone and co-injection of NPY and CART (62-76), but was not affected by treatment with CART (55-102) alone, NPY and CART (55-102) or orexin A and CART (55-102). Total behavioral activity was increased with NPY, orexin A, and both CART fragments alone as compared to saline controls, as well as in fish co-treated with NPY and CART (62-76) or NPY and CART (55-102) as compared to saline controls and NPY-treated fish. Tremors were seen in fish treated with CART (55-102) alone, and in fish co-treated with NPY and CART (55-102) and orexin A and CART (55-102). Co-treatment of the fish with NPY but not with orexin A significantly lowered the frequency of fish showing tremors as compared to fish treated with CART alone. These results indicate that CART peptides are involved in the regulatory pathways of feeding and behavioral activity in goldfish. ¬© 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={It is expected that through flexibility in behaviour, flock living birds respond to the asymmetries in resource access derived from dominance relationships. We analysed the microhabitat use of willow tits in winter flocks and assessed possible factors which shape habitat segregation between adults and juveniles in different temperature regimes. When foraging in mild conditions (ambient temperature > 0¬∞C), flocks split up into subgroups with adults foraging in inner parts of trees more often than juveniles. However, no differences were recorded in the vertical position occupied in trees. In harsh conditions (< -4¬∞C), flocks re-united and juveniles further moved to outer parts of trees, increasing horizontal segregation between age classes. In mild conditions, vigilance behaviour was not related to the position of birds in trees, but in harsh conditions, scanning frequency was higher in outer parts of trees only for adults. In mild weather, juvenile position in trees was associated with body size and mass. The foraging microhabitat segregation detected in harsh conditions fits the age-related hoarding distribution previously described in the same population. This supports the hypothesis that hoarded food is important in determining future foraging habitat use. Adult preference and intraspecific competition for safer or richer inner parts of trees as foraging sites during harsh conditions seems to determine the habitat segregation between adults and juveniles. Furthermore, we suggest that in mild weather, when foraging in the absence of adults, juveniles balance the costs of using a potentially dangerous microhabitat with the benefits of building energetically cheap and large food reserves through hoarding. The expected patterns of microhabitat segregation may differ in parids, depending on whether predation risk or other factors such as food availability are the main factors controlling habitat quality.},

abstract={Despite warning labels and increases in evidence of the adverse effects of tobacco use, women continue to use tobacco products during pregnancy. Cigarette smoking has been linked to increased prenatal mortality, increased incidence of SIDS, reductions in birth weight, and disruptions in CNS and behavioral development. Animal model systems have critically established the causal relationship between nicotine and adverse developmental outcome. The present study examines the behavioral effects of nicotine exposure in the rat during the third trimester equivalent of the human brain growth spurt, a period of rapid development of the cholinergic systems and a period during which the CNS is particularly vulnerable to a number of insults. Sprague-Dawley rat pups were exposed to nicotine (6.0 mg/kg/day) from postnatal days (PD) 4-9 via an artificial rearing procedure. This procedure ensures that observed effects are not due to nutritional deficits. Two control groups were employed, an artificially reared control group and a normally reared control group. Activity level was measured on PD 18-19. Nicotine-exposed subjects were significantly overactive compared to both control groups, which did not differ significantly from one another. This behavioral alteration was observed in the absence of nicotine-induced body weight deficits. These results suggest that women who use tobacco products during late gestation may place their fetuses at risk for hyperactivity later in life, particularly during early adolescence.

abstract={Depth of burrowing in bivalves presents the individual with a trade-off: burrowing more deeply increases safety against predators but shallow burrowing increases food intake. Large variation in burrowing depth exists both between and within species. This study investigated whether part of this variation in depth in the tellinid Macoma balthica can be attributed to phenotypic plasticity. A predatory crab and food availability were either offered or withheld in separate aquarta and the response in burrowing depth measured. Individuals burrowed more deeply in the presence of a crab but only to shallow depths in the presence of food. This suggests that individuals can assess their environment and subsequently make decisions on their burrowing depth. Phenotypic plasticity like this flexible anti-predation behaviour in M. balthica can have fararanging effects. In the presence of predators burrowing depth increases, reducing energy uptake and subsequent growth and reproduction, whereas increased burrowing depths reduces mortality by predation, further affecting prey and predator population dynamics.},

abstract={Gambusia hubbsi populations occur in a variety of fresh and brackish-water habitats on Andros, Bahamas. These include shallow water sites (tidal creeks, lakes, roadside ditches), and blueholes (vertical solution caves). In some blueholes G. hubbsi is the only species present, in others it co-occurs with other species, principal among these is a predator, Eleotris pisonis. By contrast to blueholes, shallow water sites have highly variable temperature and depth. In addition, they are frequented by avian piscivores and may be occasionally occupied by piscivores such as Eleotris. We sampled 10 shallow water sites, 14 blueholes where Eleotris is absent and 12 blueholes where Eleotris co-occurs with G. hubbsi. We measured and compared variation in female body size, fecundity, and reproductive investment among these three habitats. The observed patterns of life history variation are only partially in accord with expectations from theory regarding the effects of predation and seasonality on life history variation. Samples from populations that colonized a series of man-made trenches (Well Fields), a set of introductions into that habitat, and changes in life history traits of lab-raised females from three blueholes, suggest that the observed pattern of life history variation in other habitats also reflects differences in food availability among habitats, and imperfectly reflects the potential phenotypic variability of this species.},

abstract={The present study examined the effects of D1 and D2 antagonists on flavor-preference conditioning by the sweet taste of sucrose. All sessions were conducted under sham-feeding conditions to minimize post-ingestive influences. The rats were trained in alternating, one-bottle sessions to sham-feed a 16% sucrose solution containing one novel flavor (CS+) and a less-preferred 0.2% saccharin solution containing a different flavor (CS-). Three groups of food-restricted rats were treated with either vehicle (control group), the D1 antagonist, SCH23390 (200 nmol/kg), or the D2 antagonist, raclopride (200 nmol/kg) during one-bottle training. A fourth group (yoked group) was vehicle-treated and its training intakes were matched to that of the D1 and D2 drug groups. Preferences were assessed in two-bottle tests with the CS+ and CS- flavors presented in mixed 8% sucrose+0.1% saccharin solutions following systemic doses of 0, 200, or 800 nmol/kg of either the D1 or D2 antagonists. All groups significantly preferred the CS+ flavor in vehicle tests, although the preferences were weaker in the D1, D2, and yoked groups compared to the control group. All groups selectively reduced their CS+ intakes when treated with either D1 or D2 antagonists during two-bottle testing, and the CS+ preference was blocked at the higher doses. These data show that D1 and D2 receptor antagonists block the expression of a sucrose-conditioned preference, but produces substantially lesser effects upon the acquisition of this form of flavor conditioning. ¬© 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.},

Chemicals from sculpins and trout induced a short-term decrease in locomotory activity in G. pulex, whereas crayfish did not. There was no difference in activity between G. pulex exposed to water scented by trout or sculpin, and these responses were independent of predator diet (G. pulex, Asellus aquaticus and starved). In the second experiment we examined whether longer-term exposure (4 week) to chemical cues from sculpins affects rates of leaf processing by G. pulex. During the first week, G. pulex consumed significantly more leaves in the control (i.e., no fish cue) than in the fish cue treatment. After 4 weeks, however, there was no difference in total leaf processing rate between treatments indicating an adaptation to the cue.},

Method: In hierarchical multiple regression analyses, the relative predictive power for ice-cream consumption was assessed, that is, emotional versus external versus bulimic eating using scales of the DEBQ and the EDI-R. In nonplanned stepwise multiple regression analyses, the association was assessed between these three types of eating behaviors and non-eating-related EDI-R scales. Results: Emotional eating was the most important variable for ice-cream consumption. External eating was borderline significant and bulimic eating nonsignificant when emotional and external eating had been partialled out. Emotional eating was best predicted by the EDI-R scales Asceticism, Interoceptive Awareness, and Social Insecurity. Discussion: Results are consistent with psychosomatic theory, which focuses on emotional eating as the result of confusion and apprehension in recognizing and accurately responding to emotional and visceral states related to hunger and satiety.

abstract={Objective. The goal of the study was to obtain an estimate of the proportion of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in rheumatologic care who are unable to live independently. It investigates the association of age, disease duration, disease activity, joint involvement, and comorbidity with dependence on help and care. In addition, we attempt to derive an estimate of the level of physical disability at which dependence on external help is to be expected in more than 50% of the cases. Methods. A sample of 273 patients with RA and considerable physical disabilities (less than 67% of full functional capacity) was drawn from the Berlin rheumatologic database. Standardized questionnaires and interview data were used to ascertain dependence on help and care. Patients were classified as in need of help when they depended on external help to manage household chores and as in need of care if beyond this they depended on assistance to manage personal hygiene and nutrition. Results. More than 50% of the patients who had less than 58% of full functional capacity (Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ] >1.54) required help, and for patients with less than 30% (HAQ >2.3) the need for help was almost certain (more than 95%). Generalizing these results to all RA patients treated by rheumatologists in Berlin, 33% were expected to be dependent on external help and 7% to be dependent on care. Even in patients with disease duration ‚â§5 years, a rather high expected proportion of help-dependence was found (26%). When single joints were compared, the highest amount of disability resulted from impaired wrists. Our data suggest that the contribution of comorbidity to functional impairment was low, especially in patients in need of help, while patients independent of help reported more frequently that their comorbid condition had an impact on their physical function. Conclusion. The results support the importance of identifying high-risk patients and of the employment of a strategy of early therapeutic intervention, since a high degree of dependence on help was observed in patients with short disease duration. As help-dependence is highly influenced by the condition of the wrists, more attention should be paid to the treatment and stabilization of these joints.},

abstract={We used on-line microdialysis measurements of dopamine and noradrenaline extracellular concentrations in the medial prefrontal cortex of awake, freely moving rats during the dark and the light period of the day to study whether (i) basal efflux would be higher in the active, dark period than in the inactive, light period; (ii) the activation induced by environmental stimuli would be dependent on these conditions. When determined one day after cannula placement, noradrenaline and dopamine levels were higher during the dark. Maximal relative increases induced by novelty and handling were 150% and 175-200%, respectively, and were very similar in the light and the dark, but the net increases were higher in the dark. Separate groups were tested one week after cannula placement to ensure recovery of possibly disturbed circadian rhythms. While basal levels in the dark were now approximately twice those in the light, the maximal relative and net increases after both novelty and handling were very similar. Basal levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (one day after cannula placement) were not different in the light or dark, but were increased by novelty and handling to about 130% only in the light period, not in the dark.Thus, in the prefrontal cortex, dopamine strongly resembles noradrenaline, in that basal efflux was state dependent, whereas activation by stimuli was not. In the nucleus accumbens, basal dopamine efflux was not state dependent, but activation by stimuli was. These results suggest that there are differential effects of circadian phase on basal activity and responsiveness of the mesolimbic vs the mesocortical dopamine system. Copyright (C) 2000 IBRO.},

abstract={Amphipod abundance and biomass were determined in soft-bottom substrates (SBS), mono-specific Thalassia testudinum patches and T. testudinum with attached macroalgae (SAV) from Terminos Lagoon. Amphipods were absent in SBS, and their density and biomass were higher in SAV (3351 individuals m-2, 1718 mg AFDW m-2) than in T. testudinum (1220 ind m-2, 625 mg AFDW m-2). Although macroalgae and seagrasses are recognised as an alternative refuge against predation for amphipods, the high abundance of amphipods in SAV suggests that macroalgae represent a habitat that provides greater food availability. Pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus duorarum (Burkenroad, 1939) consumption rate (Mo) of epibenthic amphipods was experimentally evaluated. Mo intensifies as prey density increases and varied from 0.39 to 2.39 mg AFDW h-1. Predation efficiency of F. duorarum on epibenthic amphipods was also evaluated in four artificial habitats with different physical complexity: soft-bottom substrates (SBS), small woody debris (SWD), seagrasses with densities of 300 and 1200 shoots m-2 (S300 and S1200, respectively), macroalgae (MA), and at two prey densities (962 and 2406 ind m-2). Amphipod consumption rate by F. duorarum varied from 1.20 to 2.07 ind h-1 in S1200 and MA, respectively. Habitat complexity had a significant effect on consumption rate, but prey density did not. Habitat physical complexity and predation efficiency maintained an inverse and a non-linear relationship. Presumably, the decrease in predation efficiency in association with the habitat complexity is due to the differential refuge value of these habitats. However, predation efficiency may also be influenced by either the microhabitat use by amphipods, the shrimp's dependence on seagrasses, or by differences in habitat value caused by the diel behavioural distribution pattern of amphipods and shrimp. Both field and experimental results highlight the importance of evaluating the relative value of tropical estuarine habitats through the study of the relationship between habitat physical complexity and predator-prey interactions. They also emphasise that inherent biological and ethological factors of the predator and prey involved, coupled to spatial and temporal variations in the habitat, should also be considered.

abstract={1. Daphnia magna reproduced at a smaller size (body mass) when exposed to fish-kairomone than D. magna growing up without this cue. 2. The total egg mass for first reproduction was the same in both groups, but the proportion of clutch mass to total body mass was about 11% higher in daphniids exposed to fish-kairomone. This difference was about the same for low and high food concentrations (0¬∑5 or 1¬∑5 mgCl-1). 3. Although egg mass was the same, triglyceride (TAG) content of the egg material was significantly lower when daphniids were exposed to fish-kairomones for both food concentrations. 4. The TAG content of the clutch was lowered to the extent that the TAG proportion in the clutch in relation to the somatic mass of the animal was the same for animals treated with fish-kairomone and controls (5% of body mass at first reproduction). 5. The lower TAG content per clutch resulted in a lower quality of the individual egg in daphniids exposed to fish-kairomone. The resulting higher susceptibility to starvation under low food conditions is a substantial cost of the plastic response to fish-kairomones. 6. This cost may set a limit on the plastic response in resource allocation of Daphnia magna exposed to fish-kairomones. However, daphniids living in a system with fish predation are more likely to be eaten by fish than to starve to death.},

abstract={Free-living female laboratory mice, adapted to outdoor life in large pens providing a naturalistic environment, were tested for their ability to modify their foraging habits to controlled food supply. An automatic feeder box delivered a small portion of the daily quantity of seeds to each individual mouse. Eight such boxes were placed into an outdoor pen. Each day, mice had to visit all boxes to gather the daily amount of food and were rewarded only at the first visit to each box. Mice were individually recognised by an implanted microchip. Throughout a 16-day period, feeding activity concentrated in an interval time around the beginning of the daily session. During the same period, the number of different feeders visited every day by mice increased irrespective of variation in exploratory activity. The experimental set-up allowed detecting temporal and spatial adaptations to the food restriction, as well as behavioural differences due to territorial and social factors. These data permit the design of novel tests assessing behavioural changes, memory and learning in normal and genetically modified mice, both in the laboratory and in naturalistic settings.

abstract={Objective: This study was undertaken to estimate the prevalence of malnutrition in elderly patients hospitalized with an acute illness, as well as to assess the clinical usefulness of standardized nutritional assessment upon admission by means of the MNA scale. Design: A prospective study. Setting: A large size regional university hospital. Subjects: There were 175 patients (113 women and 62 men) with a mean age of 79.7 ¬± 8.5 years admitted for an acute problem. Death occurred in 11 patients (6.3%). Methods: Upon admission, demographic (age, gender, origin) and medical (disease, drugs) data were recorded for each patient; the MNA questionnaire (score: 0-30) was administered and Katz score (7-28) calculated. At hospital discharge, data included Katz score, outcome (death/survival), and destination. Results: The mean MNA score was 20.5 ¬± 5.1 and the prevalence of severe malnutrition (MNA <17) was 21.7%. Further, 48.6% of elderly were at risk of malnutrition (MNA between 17 and 24). There was no association between MNA and age or gender, but underweight was a sign of low MNA values (P <.001). MNA scores were inversely related to Katz scores at both admission and hospital discharge (P < .001). Patients originating from nursing homes had a poorer nutritional status than those living at home (MNA: 18.4 against 22.3, P <.001). The number of drugs taken per patient (5.2 ¬± 2.8) was found to be correlated with MNA (P = .049). MNA scores were on average significantly higher (P <.001) in survivors (20.9) than in nonsurvivors (14.1). Conclusions: The study clearly demonstrates the high prevalence of malnutrition and the clinical usefulness of the MNA scale in geriatric medicine. The MNA score upon admission reflects the patient's nutritional condition, degree of autonomy (Katz score), living conditions and current treatment. It is also predictive of patient's outcome (death or survival).},

abstract={The relations between behavior, olfactory input and bursts of gamma wave activity (roughly 30-90 Hz) in the pyriform cortex were studied in freely moving rats. Olfactory input was measured by recording the negative (depolarizing) potentials which occur in the olfactory mucosa during inspiration. Low levels of pyriform gamma activity were associated with spontaneous apnea and slightly higher levels were associated with vigorous sniffing. Intermediate levels of gamma activity occurred during rhythmical breathing during alert immobility, walking, eating, and grooming. High amplitude bursts of gamma activity occurred during very deep breathing during sighing and vocalization. Closing one nostril resulted in the ipsilateral disappearance of pyriform gamma wave bursts, even during vocalization, but contralateral gamma wave activity persisted. It is concluded that pyriform gamma wave activity is entirely dependent on olfactory input and that previously reported relations to conditioning, arousal, motivation, etc., are indirect effects of variations in the pattern of air flow in the upper airway.

abstract={1. In order to assess the future impact of a proposed development or evaluate the cost effectiveness of proposed mitigating measures, ecologists must be able to provide accurate predictions under new environmental conditions. The difficulty with predicting to new circumstances is that often there is no way of knowing whether the empirical relationships upon which models are based will hold under the new conditions, and so predictions are of uncertain accuracy. 2. We present a model, based on the optimality approach of behavioural ecology, that is designed to overcome this problem. The model's central assumption is that each individual within a population always behaves in order to maximize its fitness. The model follows the optimal decisions of each individual within a population and predicts population mortality rate from the survival consequences of these decisions. Such behaviour-based models should provide a reliable means of predicting to new circumstances because, even if conditions change greatly, the basis of predictions - fitness maximization - will not. 3. The model was parameterized and tested for a shorebird, the oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus. Development aimed to minimize the difference between predicted and observed overwinter starvation rates of juveniles, immatures and adults during the model calibration years of 1976-80. The model was tested by comparing its predicted starvation rates with the observed rates for another sample of years during 1980-91, when the oystercatcher population was larger than in the model calibration years. It predicted the observed density-dependent increase in mortality rate in these years, outside the conditions for which it was parameterized. 4. The predicted overwinter mortality rate was based on generally realistic behaviour of oystercatchers within the model population. The two submodels that predicted the interference-free intake rates and the numbers and densities of birds on the different mussel Mytilus edulis beds at low water did so with good precision. The model also predicted reasonably well (i) the stage of the winter at which the birds starved; (ii) the relative mass of birds using different feeding methods; (iii) the number of minutes birds spent feeding on mussels at low water during both the night and day; and (iv) the dates at which birds supplemented their low tide intake of mussels by also feeding on supplementary prey in fields while mussel beds were unavailable over the high water period. 5. A sensitivity analysis showed that the model's predictive ability depended on virtually all of its parameters. However, the importance of different parameters varied considerably. In particular, variation in gross energetic parameters had a greater influence on predictions than variations in behavioural parameters. In accord with this, much of the model's predictive power was retained when a detailed foraging submodel was replaced with a simple functional response relating intake rate to mussel biomass. The behavioural parameters were not irrelevant, however, as these were the basis of predictions. 6. Although we applied the model to oystercatchers, the general principle on which it is based applies widely. We list the key parameters that need to be measured in order to apply the model to other systems, estimate the time scales involved and describe the types of environmental changes that can be modelled. For example, in the case of estuaries, the model can be used to predict the impact of habitat loss, changes in the intensity or method of shellfishing, or changes in the frequency of human disturbance. 7. We conclude that behaviour-based models provide a good basis for predicting how demographic parameters, and thus population size, would be affected by novel environments. The key reason for this is that, by being based on optimal decision rules, animals in these models are likely to respond to environmental changes in the same way as real ones would.},

abstract={Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) catalyses the initial step of fatty acid import into the mitochondrial matrix, the site of Œ≤-oxidation, and its inhibition by malonyl-CoA is a primary control point for this process. The enzyme exists in at least two isoforms, denoted L-CPT I (liver type) and M-CPT I (skeletal-muscle type), which differ in their kinetic characteristics and tissue distributions. A property apparently unique to L-CPT is that its sensitivity to malonyl-CoA decreases in vivo with fasting or experimentally induced diabetes. The mechanism of this important regulatory effect is unknown and has aroused much interest. CPT I is an integral outer-membrane protein and displays little activity after removal from the membrane by detergents, precluding direct purification of active protein by conventional means. Here we describe the expression of a 6 x His-tagged rat L-CPT I in Pichia pastoris and purification of the detergent-solubilized enzyme in milligram quantities. Reconstitution of the purified product into a liposomal environment yielded a 200-400-fold increase in enzymic activity and restored malonyl-CoA sensitivity. This is the first time that a CPT I protein has been available for study in a form that is both pure and active. Comparison of the kinetic properties of the reconstituted material with those of L-CPT I as it exists in mitochondria prepared from yeast over-expressing the enzyme and in livers from fed or fasted rats permitted novel insight into several aspects of the enzyme's behaviour. The malonyl-CoA response of the liposomal enzyme was found to be greater when the reconstitution procedure was carried out at 22¬∞C compared with 4¬∞C (IC50 approximate 11 ŒºM versus 30 ŒºM, respectively). When the sensitivities of L-CPT I in each of the different environments were compared, they were found to decrease in the following order: fed liver &gt; fasted liver approximate liposomes prepared at 22¬∞C approximate P. pastoris mitochondria &gt; liposomes prepared at 4¬∞C. In addition, pre-treatment of L-CPT I liposomes with the membrane-fluidizing reagent benzyl alcohol caused densensitization to the inhibitor. In contrast with the variable response to malonyl-CoA, the liposomal L-CPT I displayed a pH profile and kinetics with regard to the carnitine and acyl-CoA substrates similar to those of the enzyme in fed or fasted liver mitochondria. However, despite a normal sensitivity to malonyl-CoA, L-CPT I in P. pastoris mitochondria displayed aberrant behaviour with regard to each of these other parameters. The kinetic data establish several novel points. First, even after stringent purification procedures in the presence of detergent, recombinant L-CPT I could be reconstituted in active, malonyl-CoA sensitive form. Second, the kinetics of the reconstituted, 6 x His-tagged L-CPT I with regard to substrate and pH responses were similar to what is observed with rat liver mitochondria (whereas in P. pastoris mitochondria the enzyme behaved anomalously), confirming that the purified preparation is a suitable model for studying the functional properties of the enzyme. Third, wide variation in the response to the inhibitor, malonyl-CoA, was observed depending only on the enzyme's membrane environment and independent of interaction with other proteins. In particular, the fluidity of the membrane had a direct influence on this parameter. These observations may help to explain the mechanism of the physiological changes in the properties of L-CPT I that occur in vivo and are consistent with the current topographical model of the enzyme.},

abstract={1. In order to understand the relative importance of prey quality and mobility in indirect interactions among alternative prey that are mediated by a shared natural enemy, the nutritional quality of two common prey for a generalist insect predator along with the predator's relative preference for these prey was determined. 2. Eggs of the corn earworm Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) were nutritionally superior to pea aphids Acyrthosiphum pisum (Homoptera: Aphididae) as prey for big-eyed bugs Geocoris punctipes (Heteroptera: Geocoridae). Big-eyed bugs survived four times as long when fed corn earworm eggs than when fed pea aphids. Furthermore, only big-eyed bugs fed corn earworm eggs completed development and reached adulthood. 3. In two separate choice experiments, however, big-eyed bugs consistently attacked the nutritionally inferior prey, pea aphids, more frequently than the nutritionally superior prey, corn earworm eggs. 4. Prey mobility, not prey nutritional quality, seems to be the most important criterion used by big-eyed bugs to select prey. Big-eyed bugs attacked mobile aphids preferentially when given a choice between mobile and immobilised aphids. 5. Prey behaviour also mediated indirect interactions between these two prey species. The presence of mobile pea aphids as alternative prey benefited corn earworms indirectly by reducing the consumption of corn earworm eggs by big-eyed bugs. The presence of immobilised pea aphids, however, did not benefit corn earworms indirectly because the consumption of corn earworm eggs by big-eyed bugs was not reduced when they were present. 6. These results suggest that the prey preferences of generalist insect predators mediate indirect interactions among prey species and ultimately affect the population dynamics of the predator and prey species. Understanding the prey preferences of generalist insect predators is essential to predict accurately the efficacy of these insects as biological control agents.},

abstract={The effect of a standard diet providing essential fatty acids enriched in fish oil or palm oil was studied in young, mature and old mice. Two groups of pregnant and lactating OF1 mice were fed on diets with or without high levels of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Offspring were maintained on these diets after weaning. The litter size did not differ. The weight increased more quickly in fish-oil-fed mice than palm-oil-fed mice. The fish-oil diet induced a significant increase in exploratory activity in young mice which was not found in mature and old mice. The level of locomotor activity was significantly higher in young, no different in nature, and lower in old fish-oil-fed mice than in controls. Habituation, the simpler form of learning, occurred to the same extent in the two diet groups. For the place learning protocol of the Morris water maze there was no difference between the two diet groups; however, in the probe trial, the mature fish-oil-fed mice remembered the situation well compared with the control mice. In the active avoidance test, on the first day of acquisition the young fish-oil-fed mice made more avoidances than control mice, whereas in contrast, mature and old-fish-fed mice made less avoidances than control mice. These results suggest a positive effect on arousal and learning ability of a diet enriched in long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in young mice and a detrimental effect in old mice.},

abstract={Serotonin type 2A (5-HT2A) receptor-mediated neurotransmitter is known to activate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, regulate sleep-awake cycle, induce anorexia and hyperthermia. Interaction between melatonin and 5-HT2A receptors in the regulation of the sleep-awake cycle and head-twitch response in rat have been reported. Previous studies have shown that melatonin has suppressant effect on HPA axis activation, decreases core body temperature and induces hyperphagia in animals. However, melatonin interaction with 5-HT2A receptors in mediation of these actions is not yet reported. We have studied the acute effect of melatonin and its antagonist, luzindole on centrally administered (¬±)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl) 2-amino propane (DOI; a 5-HT2A/2C agonist)-induced activation of HPA axis, hypophagia and hyperthermia in 24-h food-deprived rats. Like ritanserin [(1 mg/kg, i.p.) 5-HT2A/2C antagonist], peripherally administered melatonin (1.5 and 3 mg/kg, i.p.) did not affect the food intake, rectal temperature or basal adrenal ascorbic acid level. However, pretreatment of rats with it significantly reversed DOI (10 Œºg, intraventricular)-induced anorexia and activation of HPA axis. But the hyperthermia induced by DOI was not sensitive to reversal by melatonin. Mel1 receptor subtype antagonist luzindole (5 Œºg, intraventricular) did not modulate the DOI effect but antagonized the melatonin (3 mg/kg, i.p.) reversal of 5-HT2A agonist response. The present data suggest that melatonin reversal of DOI-induced hypophagia could be due to suppression of 5-HT2A mediated activation of HPA axis. ¬© 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Hunger/satiation state interacts with appetitive and noxious stimuli to determine feeding and avoidance responses. In the predatory marine snail Pleurobranchaea californica, food chemostimuli induced proboscis extension and biting at concentration thresholds that varied directly with satiation state. However, food stimuli also tended to elicit avoidance behavior (withdrawal and avoidance turns) at concentration thresholds that were relatively low and fixed. When the feeding threshold for active feeding (proboscis extension with biting) was exceeded, ongoing avoidance and locomotion were interrupted and suppressed. Noxious chemostimuli usually stimulated avoidance, but, in animals with lower feeding thresholds for food stimuli, they often elicited feeding behavior. Thus, sensory pathways mediating appetitive and noxious stimuli may have dual access to neural networks of feeding and avoidance behavior, but their final effects are regulated by satiation state. These observations suggest that a simple cost- benefit computation regulates behavioral switching in the animal's foraging behavior, where food stimuli above or below the incentive level for feeding tend to induce feeding or avoidance, respectively. This decision mechanism can weigh the animal's need for nutrients against the potential risk from other predators and the cost of relative energy outlay in an attack on prey. Stimulation of orienting and attack by low-level noxious stimuli in the hungriest animals may reflect risk-taking that can enhance prey capture success. A simple, hedonically structured neural network model captures this computation.},

abstract={1. We sought evidence for state-dependent behaviour and energy expenditure by manipulating the body-state of birds. We reviewed three hypotheses that could describe responses to a change in body-state: the Increased Effort; Reduced Effort; and Balanced Effort Hypotheses. 2. Territorial European robins Erithacus rubecula L. were captured at dusk during winter, and chilled or warmed overnight to manipulate body-state. 3. The robins were released onto their territories before dawn. Their subsequent behaviour was monitored by radio-tracking, and energy expenditure was measured using the doubly labelled water technique. 4. Robins with high overnight energy expenditures (= 'negative' body-state; chilled) were less likely to initiate vocal behaviour, and less likely to respond to the song or calls of conspecifics than those with low overnight expenditures (= 'positive' body-state; warmed). 5. Chilled birds moved around their territories at almost twice the rate of warmed birds, and had significantly higher daytime energy expenditures. 6. We concluded that behaviour, including vocalizations and activity levels, and energy expenditures of robins, were sensitive to manipulations of body-state. 7. These behaviours are interpreted as adaptive responses to restore condition, while minimizing the risk of mortality from predation and starvation. Our results were consistent with the Balanced Effort Hypothesis, entailing an increase in energy expenditure on foraging and a reduction in expenditure on non-maintenance activities. 8. We suggest that inter-individual differences in body-state may be a key cause of previously unexplained variation in daily energy expenditure.},

abstract={Objective: This cross-sectional study investigated the relationship among obesity, depressive symptoms, eating attitudes and behaviors, and dietary intake. It compared women at risk for recurrence of breast cancer and women who had not been diagnosed with breast cancer and were recruited from the same community and age group (middle-aged and older). Method: Body mass index (BMI), dietary intake, self-reported depressive symptoms, and eating disorder psychopathology (assessed with the Eating Disorder Examination - Questionnaire [EDE-Q]) were examined in women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer (n = 56) and the comparison group of women with no breast cancer history (n = 52). Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify factors independently associated with global and subscale EDE-Q scores and BMI. Results: BMI and depressive symptoms were significantly and independently associated with global and subscale EDE-Q scores in women at risk for breast cancer recurrence and women with no breast cancer history. Dietary restriction was also significantly associated with EDE-Q scores in the group with no breast cancer history. Conclusions: An association among obesity, depressive symptomatology, and abnormal eating attitudes and behavior may affect response to standard nutritional interventions in women at risk for breast cancer recurrence.

abstract={In many amphibian larvae a suite of morphological and behavioural characters varies together in an induced defence against predators, but it remains unclear which features are functionally related to defence. We independently manipulated behaviour and morphology in tadpoles of Hyla versicolor and assessed their consequences for swimming performance and predator escape. Data on burst swimming showed that tadpoles which accelerated rapidly were elongate, with shallow bodies and tails. Predator escape was measured by exposing tadpoles to predators (larval Anax dragonflies or larval Ambystoma salamanders) and recording time until death. Tadpoles were first reared for 30 days in ponds containing either caged Anax or no predators; individuals responded to predators by developing large brightly coloured tails and short bodies. We placed tadpoles of both morphological phenotypes into plastic tubs, and manipulated their behaviour using food and chemical cues from predators. Mortality risk experienced by the predator-induced phenotype was about half that of the no-predator phenotype, and risk increased with time spent swimming. An interaction between morphology and behaviour arose because increasing activity caused higher risk for tadpoles with deep tail fins but not shallow tail fins.},

Elsewhere, some abnormal attitudes are relevant of anorexia and bulimia nervosa, with their specific psychological traits and behaviours, perfectionism, overcompliance, self denial, excessive deferential, tendencies toward depression, weight preoccupation, obsessionality, rigidity in thinking and dieting, vomiting, excess training. Many of these traits are similar with the behaviour of top level athletes, but these are positive, egocentric, etc. But the differences are small between the overtraining athlete, the athlete at risk for developing an eating disorder and the symptomatic one. The treatments are very different, implicating a conscientious identification.},

Alexander Skutch proposed 50 years ago that higher nest predation in the south constrains the rate at which parent birds can deliver food to young and thereby constrains dutch size by limiting the number of young that parents can feed. This hypothesis for explaining differences in dutch size and parental behaviors between latitudes has remained untested. Here, a detailed study of bird species in Arizona and Argentina shows that Skutch's hypothesis explains dutch size variation within North and South America. However, neither Skutch's hypothesis nor two major alternatives explain differences between latitudes.},

(-)-OSU6162 per se displayed no effect on the animals' behavior. On the other hand, pretreatment with (-)-OSU6162 attenuated rotational behavior induced by apomorphine (apomorphini hydrochloridum), L-DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine), and the dopamine D2 receptor agonist, quinpirole (trans-(-)-4aR-4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9- octahydro-5-propyl-1H-pyrazolol[3,4-g]quinoline hydrochloride), without inducing motor impairment such as akinesia or dystonia. In addition, treatment with (-)-OSU6162 for 5 consecutive days almost completely abolished the rotational behavior provoked by apomorphine and produced a transient subsensitization of such apomorphine-induced effects after it was discontinued. Moreover, pretreatment with (-)-OSU6162 in two monkeys augmented the rotational behavior elicited by the dopamine D1 receptor agonists, SKF-81297 (R(+)-6-chloro-7,8,dihydroxy-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro- 1H-3-benzazepine hydrobromide) and A-77636 ((-)-(1R,3S)-3-adamantyl-1- (aminomethyl)-3,4-dihydro-5,6-dihydroxy-1H-2-benzopyran hydrochloride).

We displaced males and females from cover objects on the forest floor at Mountain Lake Biological Station, Virginia, and monitored homing by displaced individuals and invasion of vacated cover objects by novel individuals. Neither residents nor invaders differed significantly intersexually in snout-vent lengths, total lengths, or sizes of cover objects inhabited. Also, the number of male versus female residents that successfully returned to their cover objects did not differ significantly. However, significantly more females than males invaded vacated cover objects, and they did so significantly faster.

abstract={Age and size at metamorphosis are two important fitness components in species with complex life cycles. In anurans, metamorphic traits show remarkable phenotypic plasticity, especially in response to changes in growth conditions. It is also possible that the perception of risk directly determines changes in larval period and the size of metamorphs. This study examines how the perception of predation risk affects the timing of and size at metamorphosis in common frogs (Rana temporaria). I raised tadpoles at two risk levels (fish-conditioned water or unconditioned water) crossed with the availability or lack of food at night (all tadpoles had food available in the day). Tadpoles reacted to chemical cues from predatory fish by decreasing activity. A novel behavioural result was a predationxfood interaction effect on refuge use, which also accounted for most of the predator main effect: predation risk only caused increased refuge use in the night-starved treatment. Despite these behavioural modifications, the perception of predation risk did not affect growth rate and mass at metamorphosis in a simple way: the effects of food regime on growth and size at metamorphosis were dependent on the level of predation risk as revealed by significant predationxfood interaction effects. Tadpoles who had food withheld at night metamorphosed at the smallest size, suggesting a negative relationship between size at metamorphosis and refuge use. Tadpoles raised in fish-conditioned water had longer larval periods than those in unconditioned water, but these differences were significant only if food was available at night. These results conflict with the hypotheses that tadpoles should reduce their larval period or growth rates (and hence metamorphose at a smaller size) as the risk of predation increases. In contrast to predation risk, food availability strongly affected the length of the larval period: night-starved tadpoles metamorphosed relatively early with or without fish stimulus. Thus, early metamorphosis resulted from periods of low food availability, but not from a heightened 'perceived risk' of predation. This example counters the hypothesis of acceleration of the developmental rate (which shortens the time to metamorphosis) as a mechanism to escape a risky environment.},

abstract={The way in which novel learned behaviour patterns spread through animal populations remains poorly understood, despite extensive field research and the recognition that such processes play an important role in the behavioural development, social interactions and evolution of many animal species. We conducted a series of controlled diffusions of foraging information in replicate experimental populations of the guppy, Poecilia reticulata. We presented novel foraging tasks over 15 trials to mixed-sex groups, made up of food-deprived and nonfood-deprived adults (experiment 1) or small, young fish and old, large adults (experiment 2). In these diffusions, knowledge of a route to a feeder could spread through the group by subjects learning from others, discovering the route for themselves, or, most likely, by some combination of these social and asocial learning processes. We found a striking sex difference, with novel foraging information spreading at a significantly faster rate through subgroups of females than of males. Females both discovered the goal and learned the route more quickly than males. Food-deprived individuals were faster at completing the tasks over the 15 trials than nonfood-deprived guppies, and there was a significant interaction between sex and size, with a sex difference in adults but not young individuals. There was also an interaction between sex and hunger level, with food deprivation having a stronger effect on male than female performance. We suggest that information may diffuse in a similar nonrandom or 'directed' manner through many natural populations of animals. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The distribution and extent of chemical alarm signaling systems among some families of fishes, including the Cottidae, remains unclear. In laboratory experiments, we tested whether reticulate sculpins, Cottus perplexus, respond to chemical alarm signals released by injured conspecifics. Sculpins decreased movement following exposure to skin extracts from conspecifics, but did not respond to cues of syntopic speckled dace, Rhinichthyes osculus, or allotopic swordtails, Xiphophorous helleri. Additional tests demonstrated that the responses of sculpins to alarm cues were dependent on the hunger level of the fish. Sculpins deprived of food for 2 days failed to respond to conspecific alarm cues, however, the same individuals fed to satiation did respond to alarm cues.},

abstract={Animals commonly approach (i.e. 'inspect') potential predators. Glowlight tetras, Hemigrammus erythrozonus, have previously been shown to inspect the combined chemical and visual cues originating from novel predators and to modify their inspection (approach) behaviour depending upon the predator's diet. We conducted two experiments to determine whether tetras would inspect the chemical cues of injured prey or the dietary cues of a novel predator in the absence of any visual cues. Shoals of glowlight tetras were exposed to either distilled water (control) or the skin extract of swordtail (lacking ostariophysan alarm pheromones) or the skin extract of tetra (with alarm pheromones). There was no significant difference in the frequency of predator inspection behaviour towards swordtail or tetra skin extract compared to the distilled water controls. In the second experiment, we exposed shoals of tetras to either distilled water or the odour of Jack Dempsey cichlids, Cichlasoma octofasciatum, which had been food deprived, or fed a diet of swordtails or tetras. There was no significant difference in the frequency of predator inspection behaviour towards the odour of the starved cichlids and the odour of the fed cichlids in either of the two diet treatments. However, when tetras were exposed to the odour of cichlids fed tetras, they took significantly longer to initiate an inspection visit, remained further from the source of the chemical cues and inspected in smaller groups, compared with the odour of a starved cichlid or a cichlid fed swordtails. These data strongly suggest that tetras will inspect chemical cues alone, but only if the cue contains information about the predator. (C) The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Subordinates often have to wait for dominants to obtain food. As a result, their foraging success should be less predictable and they should therefore maintain a higher level of energy reserves compared with dominants. A corollary of this prediction is that subordinates should gain mass earlier in the day and maintain higher mass than dominants. We tested these predictions with captive Carolina chickadees. In two different experiments (one where birds were given ad libitum access to food and the other with food access limited to 60 min/day), we formed social flocks of two previously unfamiliar birds and compared their energy management (body fat and food caches) while they were in the flock with energy management when housed alone. Results from both experiments failed to support the predictions. Of all the parameters of body mass and food caching we measured only the following results were significant: (1) On the ad libitum food schedule, both subordinates and dominants accumulated more mass over the day when in a flock compared with when they were solitary, and there were no differences in mass gain between dominants and subordinates. (2) When analysed separately, dominants showed a higher evening mass in the flock compared with the solitary condition, a trend that runs opposite to the prediction. Our results suggest that when in favourable foraging conditions, social interactions might cause dominant and subordinate birds to accumulate more energy reserves as a result of competition. On the other hand, if food supply is limited, both dominants and subordinates may be forced to maintain similar fat reserves as an insurance against increased risk of starvation.

abstract={During a 30 month study in the Comoe National Park, Ivory Coast, it was revealed that median size of kob antelope groups which contained a majority of adult females varied between as well as within seasons. Group size was smallest at the height of the rainy season and greatest at the beginning of the rainy season. Whereas increase in group size in the beginning rainy season might have been related to the improving feeding conditions and to reproductive behaviour, reduction of number of animals per group at the height of the rainy season was probably influenced by grass height. In addition to grass height, other factors influencing visibility such as vegetation density, time of the day (day/night) and moon light intensity at night effected group size. While long term trends in group size changes are effected by food availability and reproduction, we assume visibility to be the proximate factor influencing short term (1-24 hours) group size changes in kobs in the study area. We presume avoidance of predator attacks to be the ultimate cause for these changes.},

abstract={Stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) is a computational technique that has been used to model daily routines of foraging in small birds. A diurnal bird must build up its fat reserves towards dusk in order to avoid starvation during the night, when it cannot feed. However, as well as the benefits of avoiding starvation, storing fat imposes costs such as an increased predation risk and higher flight and metabolic costs. There is therefore an optimal level of fat reserves for a bird to reach at dusk in order to survive overnight without being left with excessive fat reserves at dawn. I tested a prediction common to all SDP models of daily foraging routines, that a bird will attempt to reach this level at dusk, regardless of its fat reserves the previous dawn. I provided supplementary food to manipulate the fat reserves at dawn of free-living European robins, Erithacus rubecula. Diurnal changes in body mass (a reliable estimate of fat reserves) were then monitored remotely. Robins provided with an ad libitum food supply reached almost exactly the same body mass at dusk, regardless of their body mass at dawn, supporting the prediction that birds attempt to reach a target level of reserves at dusk.

abstract={The influence of temporal and spatial heterogeneity in seed availability on the foraging behaviour of the harvester ant Messor arenarius was studied in an arid shrubland in the Negev Desert, Israel. The study investigated the implications of behavioural responses to heterogeneity in seed availability for the seed predation process and the potential for feedback effects on vegetation. Vegetation and seed rain were monitored across two landscape patch types (shrub patches and inter-shrub patches) in 1997. Shrub patches were shown to have higher plant and seed-rain density than inter-shrub patches. Patch use and seed selection by M. arenarius foragers were monitored through the spring, summer and autumn of 1997. After a pulse of seed production in the spring, the ants exhibited very narrow diet breadth, specialising on a single annual grass species, Stipa capensis. At this time, ants were foraging and collecting seeds mainly from inter-shrub patches. In the summer, diet breadth broadened and use of shrub patches increased, although the rate of seed collection per unit area was approximately equal in the two patch types. The increase in the use of shrub patches was due to colony-level selection of foraging areas with relatively high shrub cover and an increase in the use of shrub patches by individual foragers. In the autumn, a pulse of seed production by the shrub species Atractylis serratuloides and Noaea mucronata led to a reduction in diet breadth as foragers specialised on these species. During this period, foragers exhibited a large increase in the proportion of time spent in shrub patches and in the proportion of food items collected from shrub patches. The seasonal patterns in foraging behaviour showed linked changes in seed selection and patch use resulting in important differences in the seed predation process between the two landscape patch types. For much of the study period, there was higher seed predation pressure on the inter-shrub patches, which were of relatively low productivity compared with the shrub patches. This suggests that the seed predation process may help maintain the spatial heterogeneity in the density of ephemeral plants in the landscape.},

Method: Sixty-two third through sixth-grade boys and girls completed audiotaped interviews and questionnaires regarding eating behavior, attitudes toward dieting, and body dissatisfaction. Results: Fifty percent of all children wanted to weigh less and 16% reported attempting weight loss. Children were well informed about dieting and were most likely to believe that dieting meant changing food choices and exercising as opposed to restricting intake. Their primary source of information was the family. Seventy-seven percent of children mentioned hearing about dieting from a family member, usually a parent. Discussion: Young children are knowledgeable about dieting and the concept of dieting does not necessarily mean caloric restriction to them. These data suggest that the family can play a powerful role in countering the development of eating concerns and body dissatisfaction in children.},

abstract={Zygiella x-notata is an orb-weaving spider that often renews its trap daily. Web building has associated costs and benefits, and building successive webs may have consequences for lifetime reproductive success. In the laboratory, we tested the ability of Z. x-notata to modify its building behaviour in response to various stages in predation (prey detection, capture and ingestion) experienced with a previous web. We determined which stages provided information for the spiders. Spiders that detected, captured and ingested prey and then rebuilt their web used less silk and made a smaller capture area than in the previous web. There was no effect of prey detection alone on the next web. Capture without feeding gave the same results as capture followed by feeding. The spiders that ate prey without detection and capture (feeding by hand) had the same energetic gains as spiders that caught prey but delayed building a new web. The spiders thus showed plasticity in web-building behaviour and in the amount of silk used (energetic investment) in the short term (from one web to the next). Changes in body condition may therefore influence web construction. Moreover, information gained during prey capture appeared to influence the size and structure of the next web. This ability should enable spiders to adapt their web building to maximize their fitness. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Sex-specific predation on adult individuals is often predicted by different behaviour in males and females resulting from different reproductive strategies and social systems. High predation pressure and the need for biparental care are considered a possible ecological basis for the evolution of monogamy, the most puzzling social system in mammals. In species where adults and offspring are vulnerable to the same predators, males and females may protect their offspring to different extents because of conflicting demands of investment in current and future offspring. I present the first empirical data on age- and sex-specific predation pressure by top predators on a monogamous rodent and the sex-specific behavioural responses of the prey species to different rates of predation. During an annual predation peak, only offspring and adult males were killed but no females. Whereas males and females travelled similar distances at night before the period of high predation on offspring, males moved further during this period. At the same time, males and females increased their distance from their offspring but males stayed closer to them than females. As a consequence, the distance between the members of the pair increased during the predation peak. The males' behaviour could lead to their encountering predators more frequently which would reduce survival prospects. The different behaviour of males and females provides empirical evidence that males invest in the welfare of current offspring at the cost of higher predation risk whereas females protect their residual reproductive value.

abstract={The swimming behaviour of adult Daphnia largely governs their depth, which has a direct effect on both individual foraging success and predation avoidance. We treated individual swimming behaviour as a threshold character and used directional changes in average clonal depth within experimental tubes as a test for character plasticity. We compared the swimming behaviours of two cohabiting, phenotypically similar Daphnia (Daphnia galeata and Daphnia galeata-Daphnia rosea hybrid) to determine (1) whether there is inherited variation (H2) for different traits (responses to hunger and predator cues); (2) whether changes in genetic parameters (norm of reaction and character state) across four environments could be simulated by combinations of the presence or absence of a predator cue and high or low hunger levels; and (3) whether these Daphnia would respond to directional selection, particularly in a trade-off environment (high hunger and predator cue treatments). Responses of both D. galeata and the D. galeata-rosea hybrid to hunger and a predator cue and the trade-off environment were plastic. Daphnia galeata expressed significant genetic variation within (H2) and between environments (heritability of plasticity). Both the character state and norm of reaction estimates of heritable variation in the hybrid were close to zero. Genetic correlations were positive and stable across six environmental pairs in Daphnia galeata. Most hybrid genetic correlations were not significant. The phenotypic distributions of both D. galeata and the hybrid were bimodal in the trade-off environment. The D. galeata distribution was partly due to between-clone variation and the hybrid distribution was almost entirely due to within-clone variation. Genetic variation expressed by D. galeata in the trade-off environment appears to depend on both clone by environment interactions and stable inherited differences. These results indicate that while plastic phenotypic responses cause a similar opportunity for selection in D. galeata and the hybrid, their responses to selection would be different in the trade-off and in related environments.

abstract={Morphological adaptations of amphisbaenians to fossorial life may affect their anti-predator behaviour and escape decisions. Amphisbaenians exposed on the soil surface by a predator may decide to escape either by burrowing immediately or by using alternative defensive behaviours. This decision may depend on the internal state (body temperature and associated burrowing performance) but, because anti-predator behaviours may be costly, an optimal response should also be sensitive to risk and vary according to the threat of predator attack. In a laboratory experiment we simulated predatory attack on individual amphisbaenians of the species Blanus cinereus, and specifically examined the effects of temperature (warm vs. cold) and predation threat (low vs. high) on escape decisions. Amphisbaenians showed significantly longer episodes of an alternative anti-predator behaviour on the soil surface (coiling) when the predation threat was high and when the temperature was low. The time to burrow until half of the body was buried was significantly longer when the temperature was low and was significantly shorter when the threat was high. The variations observed in anti-predator behaviours may reflect the choice of the optimal response under each circumstance, taking into account the estimated predation risk, which is dependent on the characteristics of the initial attack, and potential burrowing performance, which is dependent on body temperature.},

abstract={To begin identifying what behavioral details might be needed to characterize community dynamics and stability, we examined the effect of prey behavioral responses to predation risk on community dynamics and stability. We considered the case of prey altering their foraging effort to trade off energy gain and predation risk. We used state-dependent dynamic optimization to calculate the optimal trade-off for four models of prey behaviorally responding to predation risk. We consider a fixed behavior model in which prey use constant levels of foraging effort and three flexible behavior models in which prey change their foraging effort according to their physiological state and their perceived level of predation risk. Flexible behavior was destabilizing at the community level as evidenced by higher predator-prey oscillations and lower community persistence times. The mechanisms by which prey estimated predation risk also affected community stability. We found that community dynamics resulting from prey with flexible behavior and fixed perception of risk approximated community dynamics resulting from prey with flexible behavior and perfect information about predation risk, however neither approximated the community dynamics resulting from prey with flexible behavior and flexible perception of risk. Thus, whether it might be possible to abstract complex behavior with simpler rules when modeling community dynamics depends on the prey's behavioral mechanisms, which are empirically poorly known.},

abstract={Ultraviolet (UV) sensitivity in birds has been shown to be intrinsically involved in the selection of mates; UV may, therefore, also play a role in the establishment and maintenance of social hierarchies in intensively housed turkeys. Cereal seeds and straw are known to reflect UV, and turkeys may use these cues for foraging and exploratory behaviors. A series of trials was conducted to see if supplementation of the photoperiod (12 h at various white light intensities) with UV radiation (0.06 to 0.16 W/m2 at floor level) and regular supplies of straw to the litter allow a better recognition of individuals within a flock, enrich the environment by the provision of new pecking material and of radiation across the whole range of avian sensitivity, and, as a consequence, reduce the incidence of injurious pecking in male turkeys that have not been beak-trimmed, detoed, or desnooded. Body weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion efficiency, and leg integrity were generally not significantly affected by UV supplementation and environmental enrichment. In contrast, the provision of UV radiation, simultaneous with a 12-h photoperiod of white light at intensities of &lt;70 lx to 5 wk and of 10 lx to 20 wk, and the regular addition of straw to the litter, significantly reduced the incidence of culling because of injurious pecking. However, complex interactions among UV supplementation, white light intensity, and material environmental enrichment precluded a simple recommendation to solve the problem of injurious pecking.},

abstract={Damage by herbivorous spider mites induces plants to produce volatiles that attract predatory mites that consume the spider mites. A clear attraction to volatiles from Lima bean plants infested with the spider mite Tetranychus urticae has been consistently reported during more than 15 years for the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis. We have monitored the response to volatiles from spider-mite infested Lima bean plants for a laboratory population of the predatory mite from 1991 to 1995 on a regular basis. A reduction in the level of attraction in the laboratory population of P. persimilis was recorded in mid-1992. The attraction of the laboratory population was weaker than that of a commercial population in the latter part of 1992, but the responses of these two populations were similarly weak in 1994 and 1995. Therefore, a behavioral change has also occurred in this commercial population. Experiments were carried out to address the potential causes of this change in attraction. The attraction of predators from a commercial population with a strong response decreased after being reared in our laboratory. Within a predator population with a low degree of attraction, strongly responding predators were present and they could be isolated on the basis of their behavior: predators that stayed on spider-mite infested plants in the rearing set-up had a strong attraction, while predators that had dispersed from the rearing set-up were not attracted to prey-infested bean plants. From our laboratory population with a low degree of attraction, isofemale lines were initiated and maintained for more than 20 generations. All isofemale lines exhibited a consistently strong attraction to spider mite-induced plant volatiles, similar to the attraction recorded for several populations in the past 15 years. Neither in a population with a strong attraction nor in two with a weak attraction was the response of the predators affected by a starvation period of 1-3 hr. Based on these results, possible causes for the observed reduction in predator attraction to spider mite-induced bean volatiles are discussed. The predatory mite P. persimilis is a cornerstone of biological control in many crops worldwide. Therefore, the change in foraging behavior recorded in this predator may have serious consequences for biological control of spider mites.},

abstract={We examined the effects of predation and hunger levels on foraging behavior of adult neotenic graybelly salamanders, Eurycea multiplicata griseogaster. Hungry and satiated salamanders were exposed to chemical stimuli from a predatory fish (sculpin, Cottus carolinae) and from two nonpredatory species, golden redhorse fish (Moxostoma erythrurum) and tadpoles of leopard frogs (Rana sphenocephala). Latency to attack prey was lengthened in the presence of chemical stimuli from predators regardless of hunger levels, but hungry salamanders had shorter latency times than satiated salamanders. There was no interaction between hunger and threat levels. In addition, salamanders distinguished between chemical stimuli from predatory (sculpin) and nonpredatory (redhorse) fishes; responses to redhorse and tadpole stimuli were not different. Handling times were not affected by either predator treatment or hunger level. In summary, graybelly salamanders can (1) recognize sculpin predators based solely on chemical cues, (2) distinguish between chemical stimuli from predatory and nonpredatory fish, and (3) adjust their foraging behavior according to both hunger and predation risk.},

A simultaneous discrimination task required learning a baseline odor pair (A+B-) and then, under the influence of scopolamine, a novel odor pair (A-C+) with an overlapping component (A) versus a novel odor pair (D+E-) with no overlapping component. As predicted by the model, rats that received scopolamine (0.50 and 0.25 mg/kg) were more impaired at acquiring overlapping than nonoverlapping odor pairs relative to their performance under normal saline or methylscopolamine. These results support the prediction that the physiological effects of acetylcholine can reduce interference between stored odor memories during associative learning.},

abstract={The defining characteristic of mammals is that females nurse and care for their young; without this, the neonate has no chance to survive. Studies on wild and domestic species show that the neonatal period is the most critical step in the lifetime of a mammal. This review compares three well-studied species (the rabbit, pig and sheep) that differ in their parental strategies and in the problems that neonates have to overcome. As a general trend, mother-young interactions vary according to the maturity of the newborn, and the size of the litter. Neonatal survival relies to a great extent on an environment that is ecologically appropriate for the developmental stage of the neonate, and on optimum interactions with the mother. Adaptive maternal care supposes that the mother provides the basic needs of the neonate: warmth (in pigs and rabbits) or shelter, food, water and immunological protection (via colostrum) and, in some instances, protection from predators and other conspecifics. A major risk facing all neonates, other than the birth process itself, is inadequate colostrum intake owing to delayed suckling or competition with siblings, which leads to starvation, hypothermia or even crushing, as has been observed in pigs.},

The unusual nutritional behaviour of S. nana reported in the present note is in contradiction with well-established prior knowledge. The species presented all the characteristics of the family, particularly the ventral arch sclerite present on the larva cephalopharyngeal skeleton.

abstract={Wild-caught specimens of the lacertid lizard Gallotia galloti eisentrauti from the Canary Island of Tenerife were checked for ectoparasites. The parasitic gamasid mite Ophionyssus galloticolus Fain and Bannert (2000) was very abundant on these lizards. Additionally, parasitism by larvae of two species of Trombiculidae (Prostigmata: Parasitengona) was observed. O. galloticolus was reared in the laboratory on its natural host in order to investigate its life cycle, reproductive biology, and development. The life history of O. galloticolus is documented in detail and compared to literature data of other Ophionyssus species. O. galloticolus was found to be similar to other species of the same genus with respect to the duration of development, the precopulatory association of protonymphs, and the arrhenotokous development of eggs. However, it seems to be more tolerant towards low relative humidity and longer starvation periods than other Ophionyssus species. Evolutionary transformations of the life-history pattern of this genus and other parasitic mites in comparison to its predatory precursors involve a reduction or partial suppression of ontogenetic instars in order to decrease mortality during host-seeking phases, and a compensating increase in growth capacity of the remaining feeding instars facilitated by replacement of sclerites through elastic cuticle or by growth of new cuticle unrelated to a moult (neosomy).},

abstract={Life-history theory predicts that differences in reproductive effort and residual reproductive value among species should result in differences in the level of risk that parents are willing to tolerate to themselves versus their offspring. Specifically, highly fecund and shorter-lived species are expected to place greater value in current offspring than themselves, whereas less fecund and longer-lived species are expected to place greater value in their own survival and future breeding opportunities. Here, we test the prediction that parental investment decisions are correlated with life histories by comparing risk-taking behaviour in two species of nuthatch that differ in reproductive effort: the white-breasted nuthatch, Sitta carolinensis (more fecund, lower survival) and the red-breasted nuthatch, S. canadensis (less fecund, higher survival). We experimentally manipulated stage-specific predation risk by presenting models of an adult predator (hawk) and an egg predator (wren) and measured the willingness of males to feed incubating females on the nest. We found that both species of nuthatch responded to predators by increasing the length of time between visits and aborting more visits to the nest. However, as predicted by their life histories, S. carolinensis displayed a significantly stronger response to the egg predator, whereas S. canadensis responded more strongly to the adult predator. Thus, species can differ in their willingness to tolerate risk to themselves and their young, and such differences appear to be related to differences in investment in current reproduction and the probability of future survival.

No sex or strain differences were found for neophobia or preference for saccharin, but less tolerance of bitter (quinine) was shown by hooded rats and less tolerance of sour (HCl) by males. In learning tasks in restricted environments, comparable acquisition across groups was found for instrumental conditioning, appetitive classical conditioning, and taste aversion learning. However, hooded rats showed greater latent inhibition with auditory stimuli and more sensitivity to contextual cues, both in nausea-based conditioning and in the radial maze. Overall the results suggest that careful choice of rat strain is required in behavioral experiments where environmental factors are critical.},

abstract={The field slug, Deroceras reticulatum, a common pest of agricultural and horticultural crops, is a generalist herbivore with distinct preferences for particular food items. However, these preferences are not fixed, but are influenced by the recent dietary history of the slugs. In particular, slugs tend to select novel food items ('neophilia'). We investigated the basis of such influences, using artificial diets in which protein and carbohydrate composition could be controlled and non-nutritional ('secondary') chemicals added as flavours. The slugs showed no general inclination for neophilia based on taste alone. There was a possible learned association between protein content and taste, but this was weakly expressed. However, the slugs selected food items, when given a choice, containing nutrients that were deficient in earlier diets, even though all the food items contained the same familiar secondary taste chemicals. Injections of missing nutrients into the haemocoel of slugs inhibited such changes in food preference, indicating that slugs' feeding preferences are influenced directly by their internal nutritional status. We suggest that neophilia in D. Reticulatum is a physiological response to a nutritional imbalance arising from a suboptimal diet. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The rate at which parents deliver energy to their brood is an important factor in avian reproduction because poor condition caused by malnutrition may reduce the offspring's survival to breeding. Models of central place foraging predict that nesting parents should optimize their prey delivery rate by minimizing travelling distances and by selecting patches where the gain per unit cost is high. I investigated the allocation of searching time amongst food patches in the home ranges of breeding great tits, Parus major, and blue tits P. caeruleus, by radiotracking. The density of locations in individual trees was positively correlated with prey biomass within trees and negatively with the distance of the trees from the nest. These two factors explained 52% of the variance in the allocation of the birds' search time. In rich patches, food was reduced considerably within 20 m of the nests, and the birds' travelling distances increased significantly during the nestling period. In parallel to foraging selectively in rich resources near the nest, the birds continually sampled the trees in their territory. The average surplus search time due to resource exploration was 1.52 times (range 1.25-1.99) the expected search time if the birds had exclusively used the most profitable patch. Despite considerable effort in patch sampling, the overall search time per unit prey was 30% better than expected by an equal use of trees. The results suggest that foraging tit parents come close to the maximum rate of prey delivery possible in a given patch distribution. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Juvenile thirteen-lined ground squirrels, Spermophilus tridecemlineatus, are less vigilant (i.e. they spend less time visually scanning the environment) than adults. To determine whether nutritional need was a potential cause of this difference, we supplemented two groups of free-ranging juveniles during the predispersal stage, while juveniles were still near and around the natal burrows. The high-energy food group (HEF: 11 squirrels) received peanut butter and oats while the low-energy food group (LEF: seven squirrels) received lettuce. Adults (14 squirrels) were also supplemented, but due to their greater home range sizes, it was not feasible to classify them as either HEF or LEF. To evaluate the effect of supplementation on antipredator vigilance, the behavioural act of visually scanning for predators, we videotaped individuals while they were foraging above ground during 5-min observation periods. Each squirrel was observed and weighed during three time periods over 23 days. From the videotape, we extracted measures of time spent vigilant, locomoting and foraging. All three categories of squirrels gained mass over the study period, but the HEF juveniles rapidly exceeded that of the LEF juveniles. Early in the study, LEF and HEF juveniles did not significantly differ in either body mass or time budgets, and, initially, both juvenile groups were similar to adults in the amount of time devoted to vigilance. Later in the study, the behaviour of HEF juveniles closely resembled that of adults (increased time devoted to vigilance and decreased time devoted to foraging), while LEF juveniles decreased vigilance and increased their foraging time. This study indicates that for thirteen-lined ground squirrels the lower vigilance of juveniles is due, at least in part, to the greater nutritional needs of young animals with consequent increases in foraging, which is largely incompatible with vigilance.

abstract={Females of the shield bug Parastrachia japonensis Scott progressively provision nymph-containing nests with drupes of the host tree, Schoepfia jasminodora (Olicaceae: Rosidae: Santales). The majority of nests are 5-15 m from the host tree, a distance thought to have been a major impetus for the occurrence of provisioning in this species. However, the function of provisioning is not well understood. We carried out two field experiments to determine whether provisioning is nutritionally important and whether it affords protection against predation. Development of nymphs was significantly delayed and their survival was low in the absence of provisioning, even when nests were within the area of ground on to which the drupes fell, apparently because of the poor quality of the majority of the drupes. Selective provisioning of good-quality drupes by female P. japonensis, a semelparous species, was thus necessary for young nymphs to obtain enough food for their development. Furthermore, even without a female in attendance, having drupes in the nest significantly reduced early mortality in the presence of a predator. ¬© 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Objective: This study compared 55 women with active bulimic symptoms, 18 in remission from a bulimic eating disorder, and 31 who showed no evidence of a past or present eating disorder, on selected personality and psychiatric features. Method: Discriminant function analyses were used to isolate dimensions that differentiated active patients from patients in remission, and controls (i.e., that would logically constitute 'state'- related disturbances), and then dimensions that differentiated clinical cases (whether active or in remission) from non-eating- disordered controls (i.e., that might reflect stable trait pathology associated with bulimic syndromes, whether active or not). Results: Measures of depression, suicidality, and anxiety loaded significantly on the first function (differentiating active bingers from all other cases), whereas narcissism differentiated both clinical groups from non-eating-disordered controls. Discussion: In light of theoretical and empirical evidence stressing the etiological role of narcissistic disturbances in bulimic syndromes, we interpret our findings as suggesting that narcissism may be a common trait characteristic (persisting even after remission of bulimic symptoms) in those who develop bulimic eating syndromes. Alternatively, depression, suicidality, and anxiety appear to be state-dependent features that resolve in many cases, along with remission of bulimic symptoms. We discuss various clinical and theoretical implications of our findings.},

abstract={Ian Brady, who has been in prison for over 30 years for murdering three children, last week lost his fight to stop doctors force feeding him through a nasogastric tube, when a High Court judge ruled that their decision to do so was ‚Äúlawful, rational, and fair.‚Äù Brady, who is detained in Ashworth special hospital near Liverpool, was probably ‚Äúplaying the system‚Äù in undertaking his hunger strike, said Mr Justice Kay at the High Court in Liverpool. The judge accepted the view of James Collins, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the hospital, that Brady's refusal to eat was ‚Äúa florid example of hispsychopathology in action.‚Äù Dr Collins described Brady as psychopathic and prone to narcissism, egocentricity, histrionics, obsessionality, need for control, paranoia, litigiousness, lack of remorse, and lack of empathy. In the past he had referred to receiving a ‚Äúmassive psychological boost‚Äù from earlier hunger strikes, which he saw as ‚Äúa battle of wills.‚Äù Brady started his hunger strike last October after he was moved without warning from one ward in Ashworth to another, by a six man control and restraint team in balaclava helmets and full riot gear. His right arm was fractured in the move. Under English law, a patient who is competent to take decisions may not be treated‚Äîincluding by artificial feeding‚Äîagainst his or her will. The exception is patients covered by the Mental Health Act 1983, who may be treated against their will even if they are competent‚Äîbut only if the treatment is for their mental disorder. The judge held that the force feeding was treatment for Brady's mental disorder. But even if the act had not applied, he was satisfied that Brady was incompetent, and therefore doctors could lawfully feed him in his best interests. As a result of his severe personality disorder, said the judge, Brady had eschewed the weighing up of information and the balancing of risks and needs. So doctors were legally empowered to supply medical treatment in his best interests. Brady, aged 62, who attended the hearing but did not give evidence, was making his first court appearance since 1966, when he was convicted of the murder of three children, two of them with his accomplice, Myra Hindley. The judge said that he was not satisfied that Brady had at any time expressed a clear wish to die. He made no ruling on a hospital authority's duty or power to prevent suicide. The judge refused Brady leave to appeal. ¬© 2000 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.},

abstract={Exploring the biology of neurotransmitters and polymorphic genes that influence behavior most certainly will increase understanding of the complexity of personality disorders and the people who suffer with them. Continuing biologic exploration of the personality disorders will also provide new and valuable information that will inform and direct ever more sophisticated and specific psychiatric treatments. Further, it will supply knowledge that might begin to erode the strong biases and negative labels that have for too long been applied to these patients. These labels may have been applied not because these patients are bad people, but because of ignorance in understanding their complexity and limited ability to improve their condition. Nonetheless, clinicians must refrain from concluding that the answers to all problems in psychiatric treatment can be answered by the molecular geneticist or biologic researcher. As Reiss et al have written when speaking about nonshared environmental effects and its role in the development of psychopathology: 'Psychiatry has been forced into the chronically uncomfortable position of straddling biomedicine and the social sciences and seems always to hunger for relief. . . . [Yet] the data simply do not permit a conception of the future centered on a straightforward biomedical answer to the fundamental question of the pathogenesis of major disorders. Indeed, a balanced image of the future contains a growing and equal partnership of the social sciences and molecular biology'.},

abstract={Background. The combined influence of age-associated factors such as general health, degree of dependency, diminished odor perception, and poor oral health on the risk for malnutrition was explored. Methods. A total of 81 persons living in retirement homes took part in the study (mean age 83.4 years, SD = 6.6, range 61-98). The Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) was used to evaluate the risk of malnutrition. Odor perception was measured by the detection threshold for isoamylacetate. The number of drugs taken by each person was counted. General health status was determined by the Medical Outcome Study (MOS) scores. Oral examinations were carried out to count the number of natural teeth and type of dentures. Results. On average, women had slightly, but significantly, lower MNA scores than men (respectively, 23.4, SD = 2.8; and 24.6, SD = 2.6; p = .048). The correlations between age and MNA score and between odor perception and MNA score were not significant. Significant correlations were found between age and number of natural teeth (r = -.26, p = .001) and between MNA score and number of natural teeth (r = .27, p = .001). The mean MNA score of complete denture wearers (22.8, SD = 2.9) was significantly lower than that of partial denture wearers (25.8, SD = 2.9; p = .0005). The total MOS and MNA scores were not correlated, but a significant correlation was found with the subscales mental functioning (r = .29, p = .003), social functioning (r = .19, p = .045), and perceived health (r = .19, p = .047). No relation was found between the activities of daily living (ADL) and MNA scores. A significant negative correlation was observed between number of drugs taken and the MNA score (r = -.34, p = .001). When participants without risk of malnutrition (MNA ‚â• 24) were compared with those at risk (MNA = 17-23.5), again, the number of drugs taken was significantly different (on average, respectively, 4.5, SD = 2.9; and 7.0, SD = 2.6; p &lt; .0005). Using multiple regression to test the separate effects of the different independent variables, the number of drugs taken showed a significant negative regression coefficient (Œ≤ = -.31, p = .008), as did the mental health score (Œ≤ = .27, p = .02), giving a total R2 = .32. The other parameters did not contribute significantly. Conclusion. Among the elderly in retirement homes, the health state (as measured by the MOS subscale mental health and by the medication use) appears to be the most clinically relevant parameter to explain the risk for malnutrition. Loss of natural teeth and perceived health are less independently contributing, whereas no contribution derives from decline of odor perception, degree of dependency, and age itself.},

abstract={Genetic, epidemiologic, and molecular studies concur that liability to schizophrenia is transmitted through the inheritance of a number of genes of relatively small effect, some of which are shared with other psychoses. Each of these susceptibility genes causes minor deviations that are relatively innocent in themselves, for example, increased lateral ventricular volume, schizotypal personality, or subtle cognitive difficulties. However, when an individual is unlucky enough to inherit several of these traits, their cumulative effect, often compounded by environmental hazards, propels that person over a threshold for the expression of frank psychosis. Early environmental risk factors for schizophrenia include urban and winter birth, fetal malnutrition and hypoxia, and possibly prenatal viral infections; these early hazards have only a modest risk-increasing effect, and operate in the context of genetic risk. Preschizophrenic children are more likely to have minor psychomotor and cognitive problems; low IQ has a linear relationship with risk for schizophrenia. However, schizophrenia is not simply a neurodevelopmental disorder, because risk factors have been identified that have their effects proximal to the onset of psychosis: drug abuse, immigrant status, and social adversity and isolation. Both genetic and environmental risk factors appear to operate across diagnostic categories and therefore support a dimensional model of psychosis.},

abstract={Background: The personality of healthy individuals has not been well studied in relation to health consciousness, dietary habits and actual food intake, simultaneously. Objective: Our objective was to study the association between personality and dietary habits. Design: Information on dietary habits, including taste preferences and the frequency of food consumption, was collected through a questionnaire from 76 male and 394 female students. The personality of students was determined by a modified NEO-FFI test. Health status, height, body weight, body fat percentage and blood pressure were measured by physical examination. Main outcome measures were personality scores as indicators of a healthy dietary pattern. Results: Food intake was influenced by neuroticism (N), extraversion (E), openness (O) and agreeableness (A) of personality. Taste preferences and receptivity to dietary advice were also influenced by personality: the odds ratios (ORs) between the high and low tertiary points of the NEO-FFI scores for salty and sweet taste preferences were significantly higher in the group that scored high for neuroticism (N) (salty taste preference: OR=2.25, NS in males and OR=2.39, 95%CI=1.16-4.93 in females; sweet taste preference: OR=21.00, 95%CI=2.40-183.99 in males and OR=3.33, 95%CI=1.61-6.91 in females). On the other hand, the groups with high scorer for O and A did not like salty tastes. The groups with high scores for A and C were receptive to dietary advice. High scores of each N, E, O, A, and C factor were characterized by distinguishable, dietary habits and lifestyle. For nutritional or health education, group classes are sufficient for high A and O. High C scorer displayed discrepancies between health consciousness and dietary habits, so intervention or a close follow-up by medical professionals would be necessary to improve the health of individuals in this group. High E scorer possessed a confident attitude towards their health, but they were not interested in developing healthy habits. High N scorer was adverse to receiving health information and learning healthy dietary habits. Conclusion: Personality determined by NEO-FFI test was related to dietary habits and health attitude. Effective health education methods must take the personality of the targeted individuals into consideration. personality, NEO-FFI, health education, dietary habits, nutrition, taste preferences, food frequency intake.},

abstract={Through an exploration of Egon Schiele's life and enigmatic ?mannerisms?, which recall those of autistic children and schizophrenic patients, the author explores the impact his outstanding and disturbing paintings can have. The approach is biographical, revealing Schiele the artist as an already gifted though disturbed child. Some material refers to Schiele's way of expressing painful yet creative fantasies, in which different parts of his body (in particular his hands), projected into his paintings, form part of an intimate, creative, disturbed language. From childhood to his early death, Schiele used a coherent figurative language which was both realistic and oneiric; the author develops some ideas on art and psychoanalysis, particularly as to the creative process within a complex and disturbed personality. Working as he did between the psychotic and non-psychotic elements of his personality (Bion), Schiele is an appropriate artist for our time. His drama, his feelings of disintegration and ?dismemberment? are nourished by the creative, sane parts of his personality. The true psychotic artist is not entirely psychotic, for creation requires aesthetic taste and harmony. ¬© 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Objective: Several studies have shown that hostility, as measured by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-derived Cook-Medley Hostility Scale (Ho), is positively associated with several cardiovascular risk factors, possibly accounting for the relationship between Ho scores and cardiovascular mortality. This study was undertaken to examine associations between hostility and cardiovascular risk factors representing the metabolic syndrome in 1081 older men who participated in the Normative Aging Study. Methods: Subjects included men who completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory in 1986 and who participated in a subsequent laboratory examination within 1 to 4 years. Total and subscale Ho scores were computed, and associations with anthropometric data, cigarette smoking, dietary information, serum lipids, blood pressure, and fasting glucose and insulin levels were examined. Results: The total Ho score was positively associated with waist/hip ratio, body mass index, total caloric intake, fasting insulin level, and serum triglycerides. The Ho score was inversely related to education and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. Path analysis also suggested that the effects of hostility on insulin, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were mediated by its effects on body mass index and waist/hip ratio, which, in turn, exerted their effects on lipids and blood pressure through insulin. Conclusions: The results are consistent with those of prior research and also suggest that, in older men, hostility may be associated with a pattern of obesity, central adiposity, and insulin resistance, which can exert effects on blood pressure and serum lipids. Furthermore, effects of hostility on the metabolic syndrome appear to be mediated by body mass index and waist/hip ratio.},

abstract={The process of domestication involves adaptation, usually to a captive environment. Domestication is attained by some combination of genetic changes occurring over generations and developmental mechanisms (e.g., physical maturation, learning) triggered by recurring environmental events or management practices in captivity that influence specific biological traits. The transition from free-living to captive status is often accompanied by changes in availability and/or accessibility of shelter, space, food and water, and by changes in predation and the social environment. These changes set the stage for the development of the domestic phenotype. Behavioral development in animals undergoing domestication is characterized by changes in the quantitative rather than qualitative nature of responses. The hypothesized loss of certain behavior patterns under domestication can usually be explained by the heightening of response thresholds. Increases in response frequency accompanying domestication can often be explained by atypical rates of exposure to certain forms of perceptual and locomotor stimulation. Genetic changes influencing the development of the domestic phenotype result from inbreeding, genetic drift, artificial selection, natural selection in captivity, and relaxed selection. Experiential contributions to the domestic phenotype include the presence or absence of key stimuli, changes in intraspecific aggressive interactions and interactions with humans. Man's role as a buffer between the animal and its environment is also believed to have an important effect on the development of the domestic phenotype. The domestication process has frequently reduced the sensitivity of animals to changes in their environment, perhaps the single-most important change accompanying domestication. It has also resulted in modified rates of behavioral and physical development. Interest in breeding animals in captivity for release in nature has flourished in recent decades. The capacity of domestic animals to survive and reproduce in nature may depend on the extent to which the gene pool of the population has been altered during the domestication process and flexibility in behavioral development. 'Natural' gene pools should be protected when breeding wild animals in captivity for the purpose of reestablishing free-living natural populations. In some cases, captive-reared animals must be conditioned to live in nature prior to their release.},

abstract={Background: The high-risk strategy is one of the most powerful approaches for identifying premorbid risk factors and reducing etiologic and phenotypic heterogeneity characteristic of the major psychiatric disorders. Methods: This paper reviews the methods of high-risk research and findings from previous high-risk studies of anxiety. The preliminary results of the 6-8 year follow-up of a high-risk study of 192 offspring of probands with anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and unaffected controls are presented. The key study measures include comprehensive diagnostic interviews, symptom ratings, indirect measures of brain functioning (neuropsychologic, neurologic and psychophysiologic function), developmental measures, and family functioning measures. Results: The major findings reveal that there is specificity of familial aggregation of anxiety disorders among parents and children; children at high risk for anxiety have increased startle reflex, autonomic reactivity, and stress reactivity, higher verbal IQ, and deficits in paired associative learning as compared to other children.Conclusions: The finding that family environment and parenting do not differ between children at risk for anxiety disorders and other children, when taken together with the strong degree of specificity of transmission of anxiety disorders, suggests that there may be temperamental vulnerability factors for anxiety disorders in general that may already manifest in children prior to puberty.

abstract={Early intervention teams must be prepared to conduct a thorough evaluation of infants and toddlers with nonorganic failure to thrive. Early identification and intervention is necessary to minimize the long-term developmental effects of malnutrition. The evaluation process must examine feeding, maternal-child interactions, child temperament, and environmental risks and behaviors to identify factors contributing to this condition. Accurate assessment information is needed to plan appropriate interventions. This article describes basic assessment considerations for children exhibiting this condition.},

abstract={Food-restricted rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss maintained a lower basal heart rate than satiated fish, probably as a result of reduced metabolic rate. Food-restricted fish were also more active during feeding and were more willing to take risks than satiated fish. Both satiated and food-restricted fish were positioned lower in the tank after the predator attack. Heart rate increased more during feeding in the food-restricted fish compared to the satiated, but energy status had no general effect on the relation between heart rate and behaviour. Hence, the increase in heart rate was mainly a response to the more active foraging behaviour in the food-restricted fish. Moreover, behavioural activity in the food-restricted fish was associated with a higher heart rate after the predator attack than when the fish was undisturbed, which may reflect physiological preparation for flight. These findings suggest that behavioural and cardiac responses are coadapted to meet variation in food availability and predation risk in the wild.},

abstract={In order to obtain reliable evidence for differences in habitat preferences between two closely related savanna-dwelling primate species, namely, patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas) and tantalus monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops tantalus), I collected data on vegetation and patterns of range use concurrently at a single study site, Kala Maloue, Cameroon, in a similar manner for a group of each species. Kala Maloue consisted of 64% grassland mostly dominated by Gramineae spp. and the rest was woodland. Tantalus monkeys showed preference for woodland, especially gallery forest, much more than did the patas irrespective of the season. Moreover, patas preferentially established their home range in grassland in the wet season. Interspecific and seasonal differences in habitat preferences could be interpreted on the basis of interspecific and seasonal differences in preferences for main food. In dry season, tantalus utilized water-containing areas at a frequency closely in proportion to the availability of such areas while the patas utilized water-containing areas more frequently than expected. This is because tantalus established a smaller home range along the river where water was never completely depleted throughout the dry season. Both the patas and the tantalus preferred woodland to grassland as sleeping sites possibly owing to predation avoidance. Both the daily travel distance per group weight and the home range size per group weight were greater for patas than for tantalus partly because of higher preference for grassland with low habitat quality in the case of patas. It is suggested, however, that high locomotive ability enabled patas to effectively utilize small and widely dispersed items of food such as grasshoppers and to explore areas with high availability of food and water and with preferable sleeping sites.},

Galls of Disholcaspis edura on Quercus turbinella produce a secretion that is harvested by three species of ants (Formica neorufibarbis, Liometopium apiculatum, and Monomorium cyaneum) in the chaparral vegetation of Arizona, U.S.A. The study reported here provides evidence of a mutualistic relationship between these species of ants and the gall-forming wasp Disholcaspis edura. 3. An ant exclusion experiment showed that when ants tended galls, the rate of parasitism by Platygaster sp. on Disholcaspis edura was nearly halved in comparison to a treatment in which ants were excluded. 4. In the presence of ants, galls with the largest diameter suffered a lower mortality rate due to parasitoid attack than when ants were excluded. Thus, ant presence reduced the selective pressure imposed by Platygaster sp. on the galls with larger diameter.},

abstract={Undernutrition and the consumption of poor diets are prevalent among elderly people in developing countries. Recognising the importance of the early identification of individuals at high nutritional risk, this study aimed to develop a simple tool for screening. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 11 randomly selected villages among the 62 in Mersing District, Malaysia. Undernutrition was assessed using body mass index, plasma albumin and haemoglobin on 285 subjects. Dietary inadequacy (a count of nutrients falling below two-thirds of the Recommended Dietary Allowances) was examined for 337 subjects. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify significant predictors of undernutrition and dietary inadequacy from social and health factors, and to derive appropriate indices based on these predictions. The multivariate predictors of undernutrition were 'no joint disease', 'smoker', 'no hypertension', 'depended on others for economic resource', 'respiratory disease', 'perceived weight loss' and 'chewing difficulty', with a joint sensitivity of 56% and specificity of 84%. The equivalent predictors of dietary inadequacy were 'unable to take public transport', 'loss of appetite', 'chewing difficulty', 'no regular fruit intake' and 'regularly taking less than three meals per day', with a joint sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 47%. These predictions, with minor modification to simplify operational use, led to the production of a simple screening tool. The tool can be used by public health professionals or community workers or leaders as a simple and rapid instrument to screen individuals at high risk of undernutrition and/or dietary inadequacy.},

abstract={In Experiment 1, adult prenatally protein malnourished and well- nourished male and female rats were tested in an open field after having been subjected to a 15-day regimen of varied uncontrollable and inescapable mild stress (experimental group). Their responses were compared with rats that had not been subjected to the stress regimen (control group). In the control group, females with a history of prenatal malnutrition made significantly fewer entries into the center of the arena than did well-nourished females, suggesting that baseline differences in anxiety exist between the two nutritional groups of females. In addition to open field, the experimental group of animals was also tested in a forced swim test conducted at the beginning (Day 5) and at the end of the stress regimen (Day 15). Significant differences were observed between nutritional groups on Day 15 only: prenatally malnourished males exhibited a lower latency to immobility than well-nourished males, whereas the opposite effect was found in malnourished females. In Experiment 2, separate groups of males were exposed to forced swim on two different occasions without the stress regimen between exposures. A somewhat different pattern of findings was generated. There was no significant difference in the latency to immobility between malnourished and well-nourished rats on the second forced swim. However, malnourished animals showed greater total immobility than the well-nourished controls in the second exposure to forced swim, providing further support for the interpretation that the malnourished males were less affected than well- nourished ones, or adapted more readily to the stress regimen in Experiment 1. Overall these results suggest that the relationship between prenatal malnutrition and stress depends on the level of stress (acute vs. chronic), the type of behavioral measure used to assess its effects, as well as gender.},

abstract={Rationale: Demonstrations of associative tolerance to the analgesic effects of morphine, not confounded by practice or novelty effects, have been restricted to the tail-flick and flinch-jump tests. Objectives: Experiment 1 investigated whether associative tolerance would be found on two other nociceptive assessment methods: the paw-pressure withdrawal and tail-shock vocalization thresholds. Experiment 2 tested the hypothesis that conditioned compensatory behavioral responses are the substrate of associative morphine tolerance in the paw-pressure, tail-shock, and tail-flick tests. Methods: Rats were given eight morphine injections (20 mg/kg, i.p.) explicitly paired or unpaired with a distinctive context. Control animals were given saline injections over the course of conditioning. Animals were then tested after morphine (experiment 1) or placebo injections (experiment 2) in the context. Results: There was evidence of context-specific tolerance across both testing methods, with a rightward shift of dose-response curves of paired relative to unpaired animals. No evidence of conditioned compensatory responding was found on any of the three testing methods. Conclusions: The data indicated that, although Pavlovian processes can play a major role in tolerance acquisition, there was little support for the thesis that the conditioned tolerance response is a behavioral effect that is opposite in direction to the direct effects of the drug.},

abstract={Predator-prey relationships involving rabbits and hares are widely studied at a long-term population level, while the short-term ethological interactions between one predator and one prey are less well documented. We use a physiologically-based model of hare behavior, developed in the framework of artificial intelligence studies, to analyse its sophisticated anti-predatory behavior. The hares use to stand to the fox in order to inform it that its potential prey is alerted. The behavior of the hare is characterized by specific standing and flushing distances. We show that both hare survival probability and body condition depend on habitat cover, as well as on the ability of the predator to approach - undetected - a prey. We study two anti-predatory strategies, one based on the maximization of the survival probability and the other on the maximization of the body conditions of the hare. Despite the fact that the two strategies are not independent, they are characterized by quite different behavioral patterns. Field estimates of flushing and standing distances are consistent with survival maximization. There exists an optimal anti-predatory strategy, characterized by a flushing distance of 20 m and a standing distance of 30 m, which is optimal in a large set of environmental conditions with a sharp fitness advantage with respect to suboptimal strategies. These results improve our understanding of the anti-predatory behavior of the hare and lend credibility to the optimality approach in the behavioral analysis, showing that even for complex organisms, characterized by a large network of internal constraints and feedback, it is possible to identify simple optimal strategies with a large potential for selection.},

abstract={Ghost crabs (Ocypode quadrata) have been implicated in mortality of eggs and chicks of the beach-nesting Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) whose Atlantic Coast populations are listed as threatened. Through observation and experimentation, we investigated the interactions between ghost crabs and plovers on Wild Beach, a Piping Plover nesting area on Assateague Island, Virginia. This site has a high abundance of ghost crabs and historically low fledging success compared to adjacent areas with fewer crabs. We observed encounters of crabs with plover eggs, chicks, and adults in the field, but never predation. In staged encounters of crabs with eggs and chicks (using hatchery reared quail as plover surrogates), we were unable to elicit predatory behavior either on the beach or in the lab. We conclude that although instances of ghost crab predation on Piping Plover eggs and chicks occur, they are rare and cannot account for the high mortality frequently reported on beaches where ghost crabs are abundant. Adult plovers behave toward crabs as if they were dangerous to eggs and chicks, and their young broods in the study area did not forage along the foreshore. Hence, ghost crabs may increase mortality indirectly. Frequent responding to crabs by parents may attract more deadly brood predators. Brood nutrition may suffer as adult plovers direct chicks away from areas where forage is reportedly richer but crabs are abundant, such as the foreshore. Nutrient intake may be further reduced on more southerly breeding grounds where high temperatures on backshores force chicks to stop foraging and take shelter during mid-day. Although high mortality cannot be attributed directly to predation by crabs, it may be due to factors that covary with crab abundance, such as high temperature, behavioral responses of adult birds, and poor forage.},

abstract={The quest to achieve the ideal weight comes with notable costs. Dieting carries the financial costs of professional consulting, low-calorie foods, books and materials, and diet programming. Club memberships, clothing, equipment, and time all contribute to the cost of exercise. Cosmetic surgery to achieve the desired physique carries a significant financial, and sometimes psychological, burden. Women often pursue thinner bodies despite already being at a healthy weight. This pursuit is motivated primarily to enhance appearance. The ideal body portrayed in the media has stabilized in thinness, but it is becoming increasingly tubular, i.e., taller with slimmer hips and thicker waist. This ideal is presented to adult and adolescent women in their popular magazines, and to little girls with their dolls. Exercise is promoted as an optimal means to achieve the ideal physique. Young American women tend to idealize an athletic body shape, especially with upper-body muscularity. This shape can be attained only through sustained exercise and upper-body strength training. High-level exercise may be a precursor to eating disorders. Women who exercise to excess, who are highly preoccupied with weight, and who are characterized by perfectionism and an obsessive compulsive personality are at risk for eating disorders. When body weight and shape are kept in perspective and realistic goals are set, the physical, psychological, and financial costs of achieving or maintaining a healthy weight may be minimized.},

abstract={Context: Several observational epidemiological studies report an association of pregnancy and obstetric complications with development of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) in offspring. However, the precise nature and timing of the hypothesized biological insults are not known. Objective: To test whether severe maternal nutritional deficiency early in gestation is associated with risk for ASPD in offspring. Design and Setting: Retrospective cohort study. From October 1944 to May 1945, the German army blockaded food supplies to the Netherlands, subjecting the western Netherlands first to moderate (official food rations, 4200-6300 kJ/d) then to severe (<4200 k J/J) nutritional deficiency. The north and south were subjected to moderate nutritional deficiency only. Participants: Dutch men born in large urban areas in 1944-1946 who were given psychiatric examinations for military induction at age 18 years (N = 100 543) were classified by the degree and timing of their prenatal exposure to nutritional deficiency based on their birthdate and birthplace. Main Outcome Measure: Diagnosis of ASPD by psychiatric interview at time of medical examination for military induction, using the International classification of Diseases, Sixth Revision (ICD-6). Results: Men exposed prenatally to severe maternal nutritional deficiency during the first and/or second trimesters of pregnancy exhibited increased risk for ASPD (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 205; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-4.2). Third-trimester exposure to severe nutritional deficiency and prenatal exposure to moderate nutritional deficiency were not associated with risk for ASPD. Conclusions: Our data suggest that severe nutritional insults to the developing brain in utero may be capable of increasing the risk for antisocial behaviors in offspring. The possible implications of these findings for both developed countries and developing countries, where severe nutritional deficiency is widespread and often exacerbated by war, natural disaster, and forced migration, warrant study.},

abstract={Access to novel objects, similar to drugs of abuse, can enhance a place preference in rats. In the present experiments, the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH-23390 blocked an increase in place preference conditioned by access to novel objects at doses that did not interfere with object interaction (0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg) or produce a place aversion in controls. However, eticlopride, a D2/D3 dopamine receptor antagonist, only blocked the conditioned increase in place preference at a dose (0.3 mg/kg) that impaired object interaction. In contrast, neither SCH-23390 nor eticlopride blocked preference for the novel object in an object recognition task at doses that did not interfere with object interaction. These experiments provide further evidence that the neural processes controlling learned associations between novel stimuli and the environment overlap with drugs of abuse.},

abstract={The generality of mechanisms affecting habitat choice and grazing in seagrass meadows was evaluated in a latitudinal comparison of seagrass grazers from the temperate (60¬∞N) Baltic Sea and the subtropical (30¬∞N) Gulf of Mexico. Using similar habitat choice experiment set-ups in Finland and the USA, the role of food type, habitat complexity and predation hazard on habitat choice of the isopods Idotea baltica (Pallas) and Erichsonella attenuata Harger were tested. When shelter was provided by both living and artificial seagrass, epiphytic food resources on artificial vegetation were clearly preferred by both species, although Idotea was attracted to epiphyte-free seagrass when no alternative food was present. When choosing between food and shelter, both species preferred epiphytic food over shelter. However, under predation hazard of fish, Erichsonella clearly switched to the habitat offering shelter, while the presence of a predatory fish produced no preference for shelter by Idotea. Food type may be considered as an universal mechanism that partly determines the presence of grazers in seagrass habitats and is, in the absence of a predator, more important than shelter. Predation risk affected the behaviour of the grazers, but the response varied between species possibly due to varying importance of fish predation in the areas studied.},

The stunted children showed significantly more apathy, and less enthusiasm and variety in exploring, were less happy and more fussy. Caretakers' vocalisations to them were less warm or instructive. Stunted children's activity level, exploratory and happy behaviours were predictive of change in developmental levels measured on the Griffiths Scales, from enrolment to 12 and 24 months later.

As dementia progresses, involvement of multi- disciplinary health care professionals is needed to manage the disease. Alzheimer research is progressing rapidly. While 5% of all Alzheimer's disease may be genetically determined, the majority is not. Susceptibility genes can reveal the risk of contracting Alzheimer's disease. Early life risk factors such as education, nutrition, and vascular disease may increase the likelihood of dementia in later life. In the United States, two acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have been approved as cognitive enhancers. Possible prevention and symptomatic treatment interventions have focused on estrogen replacement therapy, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory medications.

abstract={In our study of the development of diving in Galapagos fur seals, we analysed changes in diving activity and body mass trends over the lunar cycle. Based on previously observed lunar cycles in colony attendance patterns, we hypothesized a greater impact of prey migrations of deep scattering layer organisms on younger fur seals. Using electronic dive recorders, we determined that seals dived less and deeper on moonlit nights than at new moon, and incurred body mass losses. These changes in foraging over the lunar cycle correlate with the suppression of the vertical migration of prey by lunar light. All effects were more pronounced in juveniles than adult females, with greater relative mass loss during full moon, which must (i) negatively affect long-term juvenile growth rates, (ii) lengthen periods of maternal dependence, and (iii) contribute to the lowest reproductive rate reported for seals. This underlines the importance of studying ontogeny in order to understand life histories, and for determining the susceptibility of animal populations to fluctuations in food availability.},

abstract={Like humans engaged in risky activities, group members of some animal societies take turns acting as sentinels. Explanations of the evolution of sentinel behavior have frequently relied on kin selection or reciprocal altruism, but recent models suggest that guarding may be an individual's optimal activity once its stomach is full if no other animal is on guard. This paper provides support for this last explanation by showing that, in groups of meerkats (Suricata suricatta), animals guard from safe sites, and solitary individuals as well as group members spend part of their time on guard. Though individuals seldom take successive guarding bouts, there is no regular rota, and the provision of food increases contributions to guarding and reduces the latency between bouts by the same individual.},

abstract={Eggs, hatchlings, and tadpoles of bufonids are unpalatable or toxic to some aquatic predators but are readily consumed by other species without ill effect. We investigated the effects of toxic Bufo marinus on potential predators (tadpoles) which are phylogenetically related but which differ in their history of evolutionary exposure to B. marinus. Our aim was to determine whether the behavioral and/or physiological responses of tadpoles to toxic B. marinus varied depending on their history of evolutionary exposure to these toxins. Dead tadpoles of B. marinus and other species were offered as food to anuran larvae in controlled laboratory experiments in native (Brazil) and exotic (Australia) habitats of B. marinus. Tadpoles in Brazil consumed dead tadpoles of B. marinus without any apparent ill effect but avoided them when alternate food was available. In contrast, the majority of Australian tadpoles died after consuming dead tadpoles of B. marinus. The tendency of Australian tadpoles to avoid consuming larval B. marinus when alternate food was available varied widely. Some species largely avoided larval B. marinus and experienced high survival rates. Other species, however, did not avoid consuming tadpoles of B. marinus and experienced low survival rates. Differences in the responses of tadpoles in Brazil and Australia to toxic B. marinus may result from differences in their evolutionary histories of exposure to these toxins.},

abstract={An object recognition task was used to determine if chronic restraint stress (6 h/day for 21 days) impairs non-spatial memory, since chronic restraint is known to impair spatial memory. In addition, food deprivation was tested as a possible modulating factor of any stress effect in this non- reward-dependent task. Following 3 weeks of daily restraint, subjects were tested for open field activity and object recognition (over different delay intervals) during one week in two separate experiments. Experiment 1 involved testing under low demand conditions (small arena) while experiment 2 involved testing under higher-demand conditions (large arena). Basal monoamine and amino acid levels (home cage) were assessed in experiment one and monoamine arousal levels (following a sample trial) were assessed in experiment two. We observed that chronic stress impaired object recognition when the delay was extended beyond 1 h, and that food deprivation could attenuate the degree of impairment. In addition, chronic stress was associated with increased norepinephrine levels in both the amygdala and hippocampus, and dopamine (HVA/DA, DOPAC/DA) in prefrontal cortex. These changes were not observed in stress subjects that were subsequently food deprived. Food deprived subjects had higher basal serotonin activity in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus as well as higher serum CORT levels. Results suggest that food deprivation may act as a novel stress, thereby increasing subjects' arousal and attention toward the objects, which aids stressed subjects, especially in low-demand conditions. Both restraint and food deprivation affected select limbic areas associated with memory functioning.},

abstract={Prey of different quality can be distinguished by their effects on fitness parameters (e.g., survival, growth, development) of the predator. This paper describes a series of experiments with wolf spiders, Schizocosa sp., designed to analyze the behavioral and physiological mechanisms by which these effects are brought about. Schizocosa responded to prey of inferior quality by developing an aversion. The number of prey encounters needed for the aversion to develop depended on the prey type and the quality of alternative prey available. As expected, fewer low-quality prey were accepted if prey of higher quality were available; however, acceptance was also reduced if alternative prey were of even lower quality. An aversion disappeared within a few hours to about 1 day. Consumption by Schizocosa of even small amounts of some 'toxic' prey species reduced growth by inhibiting feeding rate and impairing utilization of food derived from prey of higher quality. These results have implications for understanding the interactions of generalist predators in community food webs.},

abstract={We document and interpret microgeographic variation in life history traits of water pythons (Liasis fuscus) on the Adelaide River floodplain in tropical Australia. Subpopulations of pythons separated by <2 km differ in reproductive timing, in survival rates at three different life history stages (adults, embryos, and hatchlings), in costs of reproduction, and in reproductive frequencies. Remarkably, these differences all seem to result from a minor divergence in nest-site characteristics. Female water pythons use two main types of nest sites: those with relatively low, variable temperatures (especially hollows within paperbark root systems on the edge of the floodplain) and those with higher, constant temperatures (burrows dug by large varanid lizards in the higher, drier ridges ~2 km away). 'Cool' nests delayed reproduction and reduced survival rates of hatchlings in at least one year. Females ovipositing in 'cool' nests remained with the clutch throughout the 2-mo incubation period, whereas they deserted the clutch within a few days of laying in warmer nests. Most egg-attending females did not feed. Hence, 'cool'-nesting females were emaciated by the end of incubation, and many died from starvation or predation; surviving females required two years to replenish their energy reserves before producing another clutch. In contrast, 'hot'-nesting females had higher rates of survival, and most could reproduce again the following year. Most females showed strong nest-site fidelity in successive clutches, but some moved between 'hot' and 'cool' nest sites. We have previously shown that the incubation thermal regime also affects developmental rates and hatchling phenotypes (shape and behavior). Thus, nest-site selection is a phenotypically plastic character, which although superficially trivial, engenders significant microgeographic variation in a wide range of life history traits.},

abstract={This article examines the effect of risk of mortality on the optimal diet of an animal foraging for two food types. The foods are characterized by different nutritional or energetic values per unit volume, and the forager has constraints on both the amount of time it has available for foraging and on the volume of food that can be processed per unit time. Such a situation characterizes the diet choice problem faced by many herbivores. The two food types may occur in the same habitat, or they may occur in different habitat patches; in the latter case, they cannot be encountered simultaneously. Unlike earlier analyses of these diet problems, here we consider the risk of mortality when foraging and allow risk to differ between habitats. Optimal time allocation strategies and the resultant functional responses are calculated for both one- and two-habitat situations. Mortality risk can substantially change the forager's time allocations and consequently, its functional responses. Increasing mortality risk in both habitats proportionally can increase use of the habitat that has the greater risk. Time allocation often responds in a non-monotonic fashion to changes in the density of a particular food. As a result, functional responses may decrease with increasing food abundance over one or more ranges of abundance. Experimental findings on the response of grasshopper foraging to the risk of spider predation are compared with the theory. Finally, the possible indirect interactions between the food species in this simple food web are discussed.},

abstract={Studies on foraging rats suggest that they can use visual, olfactory, and self-movement cues for spatial guidance, but their relative reliance on these different cues is not well understood. In the present study, rats left a hidden refuge to search for a large food pellet located somewhere on a circular table, and the accuracy with which they returned to the refuge with the food pellet was measured. Cue use was manipulated by administering probe trials from novel locations, blindfolding, moving the home cage relative to the table, rotating the table and using combinations of these manipulations. When visual cues were available and a consistent starting location used, a visual strategy dominated performance. When blindfolded, the rats used olfactory cues from the surface of the table and from the starting hole. When olfactory stimuli were made uninformative, by changing the starting hole and rotating the table, the rats still homed accurately, suggesting they used self-movement cues. In a number of cue combinations, in which cues gave conflicting information, performance degraded. The results suggest that rats display a hierarchical preference in using visual, olfactory and self- movement cues while at the same time being able to reaffirm or switch between various cue combinations. The results are discussed in relation to ideas concerning the neural basis of spatial navigation.},

abstract={The behavioral effects of AR-R 15849, a novel cholecystokinin agonist with high affinity and selectivity for the CCK-A receptor subtype, were examined. Initially, using an operant feeding paradigm to test for anorectic activity and specificity, acute administration of AR-R 15849 was found to alter the intake and pattern of feeding in a manner similar to prefeeding. Further, AR-R 15849 did not induce compensatory feeding as did CCK-8, and did not affect performance on running rates of responding, or motor activity on a running wheel, as did fenfluramine. In tests for subchronic anorectic activity, daily intraperitoneal injections of AR-R 15849 significantly reduced food intake in fasted rats over a 9-day test period with greater efficacy compared to its nonselective predecessor AR-R 14294 (formerly FPL 14294). The sustained decrease in food intake with AR-R 15849 treatment resulted in a significant reduction in body weight gain over 9 days. Finally, an experiment designed to determine the effect of caloric deprivation and subchronic drug exposure on the overall efficacy of AR-R 15849 indicated that pharmacological tolerance does not develop following subchronic treatment.

Drinking and mounting occurred almost immediately. Fighting developed after an exploratory period, and could last up to 60 minutes. There were large differences in the behaviour of pigs from the three farms. Pigs from farm A fought frequently but showed little mounting activity, whereas pigs from farm C were involved in mounting but little fighting. The period of food deprivation had no effect on average skin damage or rigor score, but the frequency of carcases with the highest scores was different The pigs deprived of food for up to an hour had the lowest incidence of severe skin damage and high rigor scores. Boars had a higher incidence of severe skin damage but a lower incidence of carcases with a high rigor score than gilts. Liver glycogen was almost completely depleted in the pigs deprived of food for 12 and 18 hours and was lower in the pigs deprived for up to an hour than in animals fed immediately before slaughter. The period of food deprivation had no effect on the levels of cortisol, creatine phosphokinase or lactate in the blood.},

abstract={We report on the responses of wild European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) to a reduction in predation risk from red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in a predator removal experiment in montane Australia. Specifically we tested whether rabbits in two sites with reduced fox numbers moved further from refuge than rabbits in two sites with abundant foxes. We then compared diet quality by analysing stomach contents, gut morphology and age-specific body mass to determine if release from predation risk enables rabbits to access higher quality food and hence attain higher body mass and condition. During spotlighting on three quarterly surveys in 1994-1995, rabbits in fox removal sites were observed, on average, three times further from refuge compared to rabbits at sites with foxes. However, this freedom to forage far from cover did not translate into a higher quality diet. Analysis of the nitrogen and neutral-detergent fibre content of stomach samples taken from a shot sample of rabbits at their peak densities after fox removal showed no differences in short-term diet quality of male or female rabbits due to fox removal. In contrast, analyses of gut morphologies, which reflect long-term fibre intake, suggested that rabbits in removal sites fed on a diet higher in fibre and hence of lower quality. This was possibly due to the large increases in rabbit density associated with fox removal. Despite this, male rabbits in fox removal sites were heavier for their age, had longer intestines, and heavier stomach and gut contents. We suggest that rabbits in fox removal sites compensated for the lower quality diet by increasing intake which enabled them to maintain higher age-specific body mass but only because predation risk was reduced. This result highlights the untenable link between resource limitation and predation risk.},

abstract={Refuge use provides a good model for the study of trade-offs between the benefits of predator avoidance and the costs of lost feeding opportunities. We manipulated the latter costs by subjecting similar-sized three-spine sticklebacks to 2 days of food deprivation followed by a 2-day re-feeding period and recorded associated changes in body weight and refuge use. Food deprivation resulted in a decrease and re-feeding in an increase in the duration of refuge use by fish. Emergence times of fish from the refuge were extremely variable (with a ratio of 1:127 between the shortest and the longest ones) but individual ranks were highly consistent between different days of testing, suggesting that emergence times were individually characteristic. Percentage weight change of fish in response to the experimental treatments also showed a high level of inter-individual variation ranging from 0-17%. A significant positive correlation was found between the percentage weight lost and the percentage decrease in emergence time from a refuge after food deprivation and similarly between the percentage weight gained and the percentage increase in refuge use after re-feeding. The relationship between energy turnover and behavioural strategies is discussed. ¬© Springer-Verlag and ISPA 1999.},

abstract={Animals change their movements in response to food supply and predation risk. Such behavioural shifts can affect reproduction and survival, especially if animals are forced to trade off between food and safety. I studied snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus Erxleben) during a low phase of the ten-year cycle in the southern Yukon. I used a factorial manipulation of food addition and predator reduction to determine how predators, food supply, and hare density affect hare movements. Control hares were more active than hare protected from predators or hares given supplemental food. Female hares showed no change in home range size or winter travel rates with these treatments, but females protected from predators had lower summer travel rates than did control females. Male hares protected from predators had lower travel rates in both seasons and smaller home ranges than did males exposed to mammalian predators. Male hares generally had higher movements than did females, but neither sex responded to a ~5-fold change in density. The results indicate that different movement indices have distinct functions that may differ with sex. Not all movement types are necessarily affected by predation risk, food availability, or density. The increase in movements with higher risk is unusual, because most small mammals reduce movements when predation risk is high. For snowshoe hares, safety may increase by moving away from predators and using larger areas.},

abstract={This study, conducted in deep pools in three rivers, is the first to show a clear three-dimensional habitat segregation in size groups (equivalent to age groups) of juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, and brown trout, S. trutta. Young-of-the-year (YOY) held position near the river bed and the river bank; height above bottom and distance from river bank increased significantly with fish size. Brown trout held position significantly further from the substratum, and were on average closer to the river bank, than salmon. The vertical segregation of young salmonids was most evident among young trout, with YOY being closest to the bottom. This size-dependent segregation is probably a result of different outcomes of the trade-off between the conflicting interests of higher food availability and greater predation risk in the upper part of the water column. We suggest that intercohort predation and competitive interactions were the main reasons why YOY of both species and salmon yearlings held positions close to the river bed. We found no evidence of salmon and trout parr preferring particular water depths, as studies in shallow parts of rivers have suggested, as the correspondence of use and availability of microhabitats at different water depths was high in the pools.},

abstract={When novel behaviour patterns spread through animal populations, typically one animal will initiate the diffusion. It is not known whether such 'innovators' are particularly creative individuals, individuals exposed to the appropriate environmental contingencies, or individuals in a particular motivational state. We describe three experiments that investigated the factors influencing foraging innovation in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata. We exposed small laboratory populations of fish to novel foraging tasks, which involved exploration and problem solving to locate a novel food source. Experiments 1 and 2 found that (1) females were more likely to innovate than males, (2) food-deprived fish were more likely to innovate than nonfood-deprived subjects, and (3) smaller fish were more likely to innovate than larger fish. We suggest that the sex difference may reflect parental investment asymmetries in males and females. Experiment 3 found that past innovators were more likely to innovate than past noninnovators. Collectively, the results suggest that differences in foraging innovation in guppies are best accounted for by differences in motivational state but, in addition, guppies may vary in their predisposition to innovate.},

abstract={Mixed animal grazing is traditionally the most commonly practised method used in commercial meat production to exploit grazing land in both temperate and semi-arid areas. The increased number of variables involved compared with mono-type animal grazing offers greater opportunities to optimize the use of grazing land. Complementary grazing behaviour patterns among different animal types improve individual animal performance and output per unit of area, in a more sustainable grazing ecosystem. They can also be exploited to reduce labour requirements, improve the spread of income and reduce the risk of environmental damage. Methodology developed for temperate conditions is also suitable for semi-arid areas. The need for further research to improve our understanding of dietary intake, dietary selection and use of space under mixed grazing, limits the exploitation of the benefits outlined, particularly in making choices of animal mixes to suit differences in vegetation botanical composition, nutrient density and their geographical distribution. The need for inclusion of the socioeconomic component in extension programmes is emphasized.},

abstract={Background: One of South Africa's principal tourist attractions is the opportunity to encounter Africa's large mammals in the wild. Attacks by these mammals can be exceptionally newsworthy with potentially deleterious effects on tourism. Little is known about the risk of injury and death caused by wild mammals to visitors to South Africa's nature reserves. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of fatal and nonfatal attacks on tourists by wild mammals in South Africa and to ascertain avoidable factors, if any. Methods: Commercial press records covering all South African Newspapers archived at the Independent Newspapers' central library were systematically reviewed for a 10-year period, January 1988 to December 1997 inclusive, to identify all deaths and injuries to domestic and international tourists resulting from encounters with wild mammals in South Africa. All of these incidents were analyzed to ascertain avoidable factors. Results: During the review period seven tourists, including two students from Thailand and a German traveler, were killed by wild mammals in South Africa. Three of the four deaths ascribed to lions resulted from tourists carelessly approaching prides on foot in lion reserves. A judicial inquiry found that the management of a KwaZulu-Natal Reserve was culpable for the remaining death. Tourist ignorance of animal behavior and flagrant disregard of rules contributed to the two fatalities involving hippopotami. The unusual behavior manifested by the bull elephant responsible for the final death, resulted from discomfort caused by a dental problem to this pachyderm. During the same period there were 14 nonfatal attacks on tourists, including five by hippo, three by buffalo, two by rhino, and one each by a lion, leopard, zebra and musth elephant. Only the latter occurred while the visitor was in a motor vehicle. Tourist ethological naivete and failure to determine the experience of trail guides prior to travel, resulted in inadvertent agonistic behavior, unnecessary risk-taking and avoidable injury. Conclusions: This retrospective study has shown that attacks on tourists by wild mammals in South Africa are an uncommon cause of injury and death. Sensible precautions to minimize this risk include remaining in a secure motor vehicle or adequately fenced precincts while in the vicinity of large mammals, rigidly observing nature reserve instructions, never approaching animals that appear ill, malnourished, displaying aggressive behavior traits or female wild mammals with young, and demanding adequately trained and experienced game rangers when embarking on walking trails. Any behavior that might be construed as antagonistic and which could provoke an attack by large mammals should be avoided (e.g., driving directly at a lion). Visitors need to be informed of classic signs of aggression, in particular in elephants, which will allow timely avoidance measures to be taken. The risk-enhancing effect of excessive alcohol intake is undesirable in the game reserve setting, as is driving at high speed after dusk in areas where hippos graze. Local advice on personal safety in wildlife reserves and the credentials of trail guides should be obtained from lodge or reserve management, tourism authorities or the travel industry prior to travel to game reserves.},

DHEA, administered by intraperitoneal injection, causes a dose-dependent decrease in the spontaneous activity of lean and obese Zucker rats when exposed to a novel environment. The midpoint of DHEA's effect is around 50 mg/kg, a dose similar to that which reduces caloric intake of the rat by nearly 50%. d-Fenfluramine, a known anorectic agent, decreases spontaneous activity under the same conditions. Administration of either DHEA or d-fenfluramine leads to changes in serotonin or its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, in select regions of the brain.

abstract={Host behavioral changes due to parasitism are often assumed to be adaptations of the parasite. However, behavioral effects of parasites may be a generalized response to parasitism and only coincidentally beneficial for parasite transmission. For this reason, alternatives to the manipulation hypothesis should be tested. Previous work demonstrated that the trematode parasite Microphallus sp. influences the behavior of the snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum in a way that may increase the probability of transmission. Here I report work conducted to test alternatives to the manipulation hypothesis. In a field study, the effect of Microphallus on behavior was compared to that of two other castrating parasite groups to determine if the behavioral change is simply a byproduct of parasitism. Also, the foraging behaviors of infected and uninfected snails were examined in the presence and absence of food resources to determine if the hunger level of Microphallus-infected snails could account for the parasite-induced behavioral change. First, Microphallus-infected snails were found on top of rocks during the day less often than the two other parasite groups. This evidence suggests that the behavioral change caused by Microphallus is specific to Microphallus-infected snails. Second, Microphallusinfected snails responded to the lack of food differently from uninfected snails. Uninfected snails retreated to safer positions under rocks when the food source was removed from the top of the rocks, while Microphallus-infected snails remained on top of the rocks where the risk of consumption by the final host is greater. Taken together with previous studies, these results suggest that infection by Microphallus results in behavior that enhances parasite transmission.},

abstract={It is now widely accepted that obesity develops by way of genetic mechanisms conferring specific dispositions which interact with strong environmental pressures. It is also accepted that certain dispositions constitute metabolic risk factors for weight gain. It is less well accepted that certain patterns of behaviour (arising from biological demands or environmental influences) put individuals at risk of developing a positive energy balance and weight gain (behavioural risk factors). Relevant patterns of behaviour include long-lasting habits for selecting and eating particular types of foods. Such habits define two distinct groups characterized as high- fat (HF) and low-fat (LF) phenotypes. These habits are important because of the attention given to dietary macronutrients in body-weight gain and the worldwide epidemic of obesity. Considerable evidence indicates that the total amount of dietary fat consumed remains the most potent food-related risk factor for weight gain. However, although habitual intake of a high-fat diet is a behavioural risk factor for obesity, it does not constitute a biological inevitability. A habitual low-fat diet does seem to protect against the development of obesity, but a high-fat diet does not guarantee that an individual will be obese. Although obesity is much more prevalent among HF than LF, some HF are lean with BMI well within the normal range. The concept of 'different routes to obesity' through a variety of nutritional scenarios can be envisaged, with predisposed individuals varying in their susceptibility to different dietary inputs. In a particular subgroup of individuals (young adult males) HF and LF displayed quite different profiles of appetite control, response to nutrient challenges and physiological measures, including BMR, RQ, heart rate, plasma leptin levels and thermogenic responses to fat and carbohydrate meals. These striking differences suggest that HF and LF can be used as a conceptual tool to investigate the relationship between biology and the environment (diet) in the control of body weight.},

abstract={The effect of the composition of a base oil matrix on additive response is an indication of its behaviour in a dynamic system. In this paper, a novel method involving quantitative 1H and 23C NMR to explain the molecular chemistry of base oil is used. Oxidative degradation of base oils (pure as well as additivated) has been studied using DSC. The results are explained in terms of molecular composition of the different base stocks to get a clear understanding of additive response in a matrix of different hydrocarbon oils.},

abstract={The rapid response of animals to changes in predation risk has allowed behavioral ecologists to learn much about antipredator decision making. A largely unappreciated aspect of such decision making, however, is that it may be fundamentally driven by the very thing that allows it to be so readily studied: temporal variation in risk. We show theoretically that temporal variability in risk leaves animals with the problem of allocating feeding and antipredator efforts across different risk situations. Our analysis suggests that an animal should exhibit its greatest antipredator behavior in high-risk situations that are brief and infrequent. An animal should also allocate more antipredator effort to high-risk situations and more feeding to low-risk situations, with an increase in the relative degree of risk in high-risk situations. However, the need to feed leaves an animal with little choice but to decrease its allocation of antipredator effort to high-risk situations as they become more frequent or lengthy; here, antipredator effort in low-risk situations may drop to low levels as an animal allocates as much feeding as possible to brief periods of low risk. These conclusions hold under various scenarios of interrupted feeding, state-dependent behavior, and stochastic variation in risk situations. Our analysis also suggests that a common experimental protocol, in which prey animals are maintained under low risk and then exposed to a brief 'pulse' of high risk, is likely to overestimate the intensity of antipredator behavior expected under field situations or chronic exposure to high risk.},

abstract={In this article, we analyze German youth's health-compromising behaviors from the perspective of risk-taking behaviors. As with American youth, peer influence is found to be important not only on smoking and drinking behavior, but also on the perception of these behaviors as socially appealing (an opposite measure of risks) among German youth. Moreover, association with friends who smoke leads to less concern about one's own health and an over-assessment of one's own control over health behaviors, both of which contribute to other health-compromising behaviors - alcohol consumption, unhealthy nutrition, and lack of physical exercise. Concern about one's own health, though directly preventing unhealthy nutrition and low level of physical activity, does not have significant effects on smoking and drinking behavior. It reflects the fact that smoking and drinking are not considered by German youth as health-threatening behaviors; rather, these behaviors are seen as socially appealing and desirable. Implications for health education are discussed in the conclusion.},

In this study, we investigated how the relative importance of these costs and benefits changes with increasing body length. This is of particular interest in animals such as fish, which show continuous growth throughout their lives. Our results suggest that larger fish are subject to lower predation risks and are less affected by food deprivation than small fish, with fish decreasing their responses to food-deprivation treatments more strongly with increasing body length than to predation treatments. This may explain our observation that large fish emerged later from a refuge than small ones and spent shorter times outside the refuge. The key role of differential responses to food deprivation was further illustrated by the finding that the relative weight loss of individual fish was strongly correlated with a reduction in hiding time even in the absence of body length differences. The importance of inter-individual differences in metabolic rates for the decision-making behaviour of animals is discussed.},

abstract={n-Butyl acetate, a common industrial solvent, was selected by the US EPA as a chemical of concern for neurotoxicity as part of the Multisubstance Rule for the Testing of Neurotoxicity. The neurotoxic potential of n-butyl acetate was investigated in Sprague-Dawley rats using a functional observational battery, motor activity, neurohistopathology, and schedule-controlled operant behavior (SCOB) as indicators of neurotoxicity. Animals were exposed to concentrations of 0, 500, 1500, or 3000 ppm of n-butyl acetate for 6 hours per day for 65 exposures over 14 weeks. Functional observational battery and motor activity values for ad libitum-fed male and female rats were measured during Weeks -1, 4, 8, and 13. SCOB testing of food-restricted animals, using a multiple fixed ratio/fixed interval schedule, was conducted daily prior to each exposure to maintain the operant behavior; the data from Weeks -1, 4, 8, and 13 were evaluated for evidence of neurotoxicity. Transient signs of sedation and hypoactivity were observed only during exposure to the 1500 and 3000 ppm concentrations. The only signs of systemic toxicity were reduced body weights for the 3000 ppm ad libitum-fed groups and occasionally for the female 1500 ppm ad libitum-fed group. No evidence of neurotoxicity was seen during the functional observational battery examinations. Motor activity for the 3000 ppm male group was significantly (p ‚â§ 0.05) higher than for the control group only during Week 4. No significant differences were observed among groups for Weeks 8 and 13. No significant differences in motor activity values were observed for female rats. No significant differences were seen in operant behavior at any test vapor concentration. Microscopic evaluations of sections from the brain, spinal cord (cervical and lumbar regions), dorsal and ventral spinal roots, dorsal root ganglia, sciatic nerve, and tibial nerve of animals in the control and 3000 ppm groups did not indicate any treatment-related effects. In conclusion, there was no evidence of cumulative neurotoxicity based on the functional observational battery, motor activity, neurohistopathology, and schedule-controlled operant behavior endpoints. The data presented here are relevant to the neurotoxicity risk assessment of n- butanol due to the rapid hydrolysis of n-butyl acetate in vivo.},

abstract={The trophic role of ciliates in microbial food webs has often been considered to be either bacterivore, herbivore or predatory. In general, single species have been assigned to only one trophic level, although early publications have already pointed to omnivorous feeding in many different groups of ciliates. However, the knowledge on the quantitative aspects of ciliate food preferences is scarce up to now. The aim of this study was to quantify food selectivity with the help of different fluorescently labeled potential prey organisms offered to the omnivorous filter-feeding ciliate Stylonychia mytilus as a model organism. Different fluorescently labeled bacteria (FLB) and algae (FLA), and inert fluorescent particles (FP) were offered in feeding experiments and evaluated with the help of epifluorescence microscopy. In addition, different live-stained fluorescent ciliates (FLCi) were offered as living prey. A vital staining method for obtaining FLCi is described. The results of this study showed a selective ingestion of different ciliates as well as a clear selection between different algae. Bacteria and FP were ingested, but negatively selected. There was a variability in the food preference regarding different-sized cells by Stylonychia mytilus indicating ontogenetic differences in feeding habits. Young daughter cells were not able to ingest the largest prey items. Feeding rates of Stylonychia were highest during the first twenty minutes of the experiments and reached a plateau after 60 min. Capture efficiency for ciliate prey was 70% at the beginning and declined to a value of about 30% after 30 min. Such behavioural patterns may significantly overestimate feeding rates of ciliates determined by short-term experiments. Food concentration was shown to have strong effects on ciliate ingestion rates leading to a clearly detectable functional response. Various factors influencing the feeding behaviour of filter-feeding ciliates and their significance in grazing experiments are discussed.},

abstract={In humans there is evidence that the restriction of total caloric intake appears to be more important than the restriction of any particular macronutrient. Today the mechanism of the effect of caloric restriction is unknown. With advancing age and the occurrence of concomitant illness there is an increased risk of developing nutritional deficiencies. Altered nutritional status is associated with the pathogenesis of a number of common diseases of the elderly, thus it would appear that nutritional modulation and manipulation represents one possible approach to successful aging and a healthy longevity. The conceptual framework of the paper suggests the need of a newer light of the aging processes namely by a holistic human-gero-ecological model and a personality oriented geriatry. There are accentuated the role of the nutrients and vitamins, the food intake and drug-nutrients interactions and the meanings of the differences between the normal and pathological aging.},

The results showed that HS014 (5 Œºg/rat) completely blocked Œ±-MSH (3 and 5 Œºg/rat)-induced grooming, yawning and stretching. Penile erections induced by Œ±-MSH were, however, only partially blocked by HS014. Injections of Œ±-MSH decreased food intake in food-deprived rats, whereas HS014 increased food intake. When the peptides were given together, the food intake was similar to that of saline treated controls. Locomotion/exploration and resting were not influenced by either peptide. Our data show that exogenous Œ±-MSH decreases food intake, and that an endogenous central melanocortinergic inhibitory tone on feeding prevails which can be blocked with HS014, leading to an increase in food intake. Our data also provide evidence that grooming, stretching and yawning in rats may be mediated by the melanocortin MC4 receptor, whereas penile erections might perhaps be mediated by some other melanocortin receptor.

abstract={To test the importance of predators and food availability in determining patterns of aggregation and movement in the urchin Tetrapygus niger, we studied the behavioral responses of animals with different body sizes under laboratory conditions. Experiments were carried out on a square platform in tanks with circulating water. Twelve sea urchins of three size ranges were placed following a uniform spatial distribution on the platform and maintained in the presence or absence of: (a) one predator (the fish Pinguipes chilensis or the asteroid Meyenaster gelatinosus), or (b) food (fronds of the brown kelp Lessonia nigrescens). The experiments were followed with a video camera. The movement patterns of the sea urchins, the number and size of aggregations, and the dispersion patterns were quantified. To determine the importance of aggregation as a defensive mechanism, artificial aggregations of large sea urchins were created on the platform in the presence or absence of predators. Behavioral responses were followed and analyzed as described above. Individuals of T. niger recognize the presence of predators, and respond with increased mobility (e.g., number of sea urchins moving or average speed of movement; i.e., escape responses) but do not increase the number or size of aggregations. Moreover, the increased mobility of sea urchins would account for the random spatial distribution of individuals at the end of the experiments with predators. The escape responses were specially marked in the presence of the starfish M. gelatinosus. In this case, the aggregations were unstable, suggesting that the aggregations of T. niger would not have a protective function against this starfish. By contrast, sea urchins aggregated in the presence of food. It is concluded that the generation of aggregations in this species would be more related to feeding patterns (or to other factors related to spatial heterogeneity; e.g., substrate topography) than to responses to predators. The escape behavior of sea urchins to starfish is also described.},

abstract={Why is high-fat food so attractive? Fat generally enhances the pleasure resulting from the consumption of food. The orosensory properties of fats seem to prevail in the attractiveness of lipids. Thus, lipids and liposoluble molecules modulate the perception of texture as well as odour and taste qualities. Consequently, the hedonic value of food is strongly correlated with its lipid contents. Strong relationships between fats and some other nutrients, such as sucrose should also be stressed. Thus, since the taste perception of sugar often prevails, most consumers are not aware of the high- lipid contents of their favourite foods. The present review states that a successful (long-term) weight-loss based on a low-fat diet should also take into account the palatability of food. Further investigations are required in order to understand the exact influence of lipids upon the sensory properties of food, their precise role in hedonic responses which sustain food intake, the central processing of both endogenous and external signals in relation with the consumption of high fat meals, and how the resulting behavioural responses are affected.},

abstract={In hedonic theories of motivation, 'motivational affective states '(MASs) are typically seen as adaptations which motivate certain types of behaviour, especially in situations where a flexible or learned response is more adaptive than a rigid or reflexive one. MASs can be negative (eg unpleasant feelings of hunger or pain) or positive (eg pleasant feelings associated with eating and playing). Hedonic theories often portray negative and positive MASs as opposite ends of a one-dimensional scale. We suggest that natural selection has favoured negative and positive affect as separate processes to solve two different types of motivational problems. We propose that negative MASs (eg thirst, fear) evolved in response to 'need situations' where the fitness benefit of an action has increased, often because the action is needed to cope with a threat to survival or reproductive success. We propose that these negative MASs develop in response to a change in the body (eg dehydration) or the environment (eg the approach of a predator) which creates the need for action, and that negative MASs can become intense and prolonged if the threat to fitness is high and persistent. We propose that positive MASs evolved in 'opportunity situations' where an action (eg playing, exploring) has become advantageous because the fitness cost of performing it has declined. We propose that these positive MASs occur during, or as a result of, the performance of types of behaviour which are beneficial for fitness at a variety of times, not only when they are required to meet immediate needs; and that the pleasure inherent in the behaviour motivates the animal to perform it when the cost of so doing is sufficiently low. Some behaviour (eg eating) can be motivated by both positive and negative affect. Other behaviour, such as playing or fleeing from a predator, may be motivated largely by positive or negative affect alone. Our hypothesis needs to be tested, but we suggest that it corresponds well to common human experience. The hypothesis provides a basis for predicting whether an aspect of animal management is likely to cause strong and prolonged negative affect ('suffering'), or to prevent animals from experiencing certain types of pleasure. This distinction is important for bringing animal welfare assessment into line with ethical concerns.},

They were removed from the dam for 6 hours daily on postnatal day 6, 7, 8 and for 12 hours daily on postnatal day 12, 13, 15,16 and placed to another cage lined with cotton wool at controlled temperature 37 ¬∞C. Body weight was estimated repeatedly from postnatal day 9 to 97. At 14 weeks of life the behavioral activity was measured in an open field on 2 occasions, 2 days apart. One week later the rats were exposed to 15 min novelty stress or to 3 min handling and decapitated 15 min after the initiation of both. Trunk blood was collected and plasma prolactin (PRL) was measured by radioimmunoassay. Results. On postnatal day 15 the eye opening was found in 75 % of control pups and 73 % of pups with RMD. In the rats after RMD the body weight gain was significantly decreased from day 21 until the day 97. Vertical behavioral activity (rearing) was enhanced in RMD rats when measured on the first occasion. Horizontal behavioral activity did not significantly differ from the control group. Stress of novel environment elicited the activation of PRL secretion in untreated animals (19.3 1¬±4.6 ng/ml vs. 7.17¬±1.03 ng/ml, P<0.05), while no change was found in the rats after RMD (8.15¬±2.0 ng/ml vs. 4.35¬±0.48 ng/ml). Conclusions. In the rats exposed to neonatal mother deprivation the lower emotionality was found. Significantly decreased body weight gain in these animals was probably due to the nutritional deprivation during the postnatal separation from the mother. The nonresponsiveness of lactotrophs to mild stressor in adult rats after RMD may have a negative impact on defense mechanisms to immune challenges.},

abstract={Obstetrician-gynecologists have traditionally provided reproductive health care to women, focusing on the medical and surgical conditions affecting the reproductive organs. Such care has included the provision of a vast array of medical services: prenatal care, management of complications of pregnancy, management of labor and delivery, postpartum care, contraceptive services, infertility care, diagnosis and management of such gynecologic conditions as abnormal bleeding or pelvic masses, screening and detection of gynecologic malignancies, diagnosis and management of such urinary problems as incontinence, and evaluation and management of such hormonal conditions as androgen excess or menopause. Many women, particularly those of reproductive age, either do not have another physician or view their obstetrician- gynecologist as their primary physician. Obstetrician-gynecologists fulfill the traditional requirements of primary care physicians, including a role as the entry point to the health care system. They provide continuity in the relationship between the physician and patient, use of appropriate skills and judgment with respect to consultation and referral when required, and 24- hour availability. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recognized this when they defined the types of services provided by obstetrician-gynecologists: obstetric and gynecologic services, primary and preventive care, and extended primary care. A number of recent national efforts have focused on prevention of illness, rather than treatment of established disease. This focus on wellness and screening measures with evidence-based effectiveness is included in the US Preventive Services Task Force Guide to Clinical Preventive Services. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists adopted and adapted these guidelines. In addition, a set of guidelines called 'Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services' was developed by a multidisciplinary group convened by the American Medical Association. Appropriate well care for women changes throughout the life cycle. Health care for young women and adolescents carries its own challenges, including a developmental perspective encompassing aspects of physical, psychosocial, psychosexual, cognitive, peer relationship, and family relationship growth and development. Confidentiality and risk-taking behaviors are among other areas in which health care provided to adolescents differs from that provided to older women. The provision of health and well care services to women in midlife includes issues relating to the transition of menopause. Decisions about hormone replacement therapy become important at this time. Health care for older women includes a greater emphasis on prevention of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, the number 1 killer of women. Other areas of concern for well woman care include diet, nutrition, and weight. Nutritional needs vary through the life cycle, and dietary intake, particularly of such minerals as iron and calcium, is important. Exercise is important throughout a woman's lifetime; exercise can help prevent cardiovascular disease and is critical in the maintenance of bone density and weight. Alcohol and other substance use and abuse can be a hidden problem for women at any age. Sexual function and sexual health are critical in wellness. Attention to screening for such mental health problems as depression, which is at least twice as common among women as among men, is a key element of primary health care. Routine screening for physical and sexual abuse is another key element of health care that can be lifesaving.},

abstract={The drug effect gives especially young people with a borderline personality structure and/or narcissistic personality disorder an emotional 'high' and a cognitive illumination which moves them profoundly and fascinates them. After this short effect the concerned people feel all the more an emptiness in themselves. Therefore they must take drugs soon again. An inquiry with 4802 recruits (20 years old men) in 1972/73 and a third following-up examination of 914 men of those former recruits in 1991 showed that people who had grown up without love and security had a higher risk to fall into drug consumption until their mature adult years. The search for narcissistic reinforcement and 'tranquilizing' their 'hunger' represents a main motive for seeking help with drugs. The supposition that drug addiction develops on the basis of a (latent) homosexuality as Rado [20] supposed is an unproved hypothesis.},

abstract={Objective: Given that dietary restraint and associated dietary behavior may predispose individuals to frank eating disorders, and that differences in personality profiles have been observed across subtypes of eating disorders, we sought to address whether aspects of restrained eating (cognitive restraint, disinhibition, and susceptibility to hunger) could be distinguished using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). Method: One hundred and one women aged 18-45 selected at random from the community completed the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS), the TCI, and the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ). Results: Novelty seeking (NS) was significantly positively correlated with disinhibition. Self-directedness (SD) was negatively correlated with the total TFEQ score, disinhibition, and susceptibility to hunger. Self-transcendence (ST) correlated positively with total TFEQ score and cognitive restraint. Discussion: These findings suggest that individuals with character traits denoting low SD and high ST may be particularly reactive and susceptible to societal messages pertaining to the ideology of slenderness.},

abstract={Cholecystokinin (CCK) is one of the first discovered gastrointestinal hormones and one of the most abundant neuropeptides in the brain. Two types of CCK receptors have been identified: (1) CCK-A receptors are mainly located in the periphery, but are also found in some areas of the CNS; and (2) CCK-B receptors are widely distributed in the brain. Major biological actions of CCK are the reduction of food intake and the induction of anxiety-related behavior. Inhibition of feeding is mainly mediated by the A-type receptors, whereas anxiety-like behavior is induced by stimulating B-type receptors. This paper presents new findings on the effects of the biologically active CCK agonists, CCK-8S, CCK-4, and A71378. The results reviewed suggest that the hypophagic effects of CCK are strongly dependent on the experimental design, sex, and age of the rats. For example, food intake measured during the night or after food deprivation is reduced by CCK-8S in young adult and aged rats, whereas, under fixed feeding conditions, CCK-8S does not inhibit food intake in young adult rats. The sensitivity to the hypophagic CCK effect increases with age in male and female rats; however, female rats are less sensitive to the CCK action. Further, using a nongenetic and non-stressful model of obesity due to unspecific postnatal overfeeding, the satiating effect of moderate CCK-8S doses is weaker in obese than in normal rats. Again, the hypophagic effect is more pronounced in male than in female obese and normal rats. Considering that aversive reactions in rats are markedly influenced by strain and breeding-line variations, research results in this area are critically reviewed. It is shown that anxiety-like symptoms can only be induced by a selectively acting CCK-B agonist, whereas mixed CCK-A and -B agonists and selective CCK-A agonists fail to change behavior in anxiety tests. CCK-4 induces stable and reproducible anxiogenic-like behavior only in certain rat strains. Moreover, CCK-4 effects can be demonstrated in the conflict test, in the ultrasonic vocalization test in rat pups, on the elevated plus maze, and in the black and white box, but not in the social interaction test. CCK has also been reported to modulate memory processes. On the one hand, CCK-8S and CCK-4 enhanced habituation to the novelty of a hole board. On the other hand, repeated administration of CCK-8S did not improve maze performance in aged rats. The literature on the behavioral pharmacology of CCK is rife with inconsistency and contradiction. The major biological actions of CCK depend on the receptor selectivity of the CCK fragments used and on organismic and procedural variables. All these variables potentially influence behavioral responses in rats. Therefore, in CCK research more attention should be paid to the importance of these methodological factors.},

abstract={On intertidal flats in north-west Europe, the bivalve Macoma balthica buries deep in the sediment in early winter, but ascends to the surface in late winter. Close to surface Macoma runs the risk of being eaten by epibenthic predators. We hypothesise that living shallow leads to more rapid growth in spring by allowing for higher food-intake rates. In three experiments, of which two took place in the field, we placed Macoma at fixed burying depths. We measured body mass and survival after 10-16 weeks. At the end of all three experiments, body mass of shallow-buried animals was significantly higher than that of the surviving deep-buried animals. Survival was lowest in the animals buried deepest; deceased animals may have died of starvation and/or perhaps suffocation. In the mesocosm experiment there was a negative relationship between burying depth and feeding (grazing) radius. Our experimental results are consistent with the idea that Macoma comes to the surface to feed efficiently in order to grow fast.},

abstract={The feeding behaviour of asteroids is usually analyzed with optimal foraging models, which assume that asteroids maximize the ratio of energy uptake relative to energy used in the feeding process. The behaviour of Asterias rubens feeding at subtidal beds of Mytilus edulis was studied in order to evaluate effects of mussel bed structure on predation rate and size selection of prey. Field observations showed that Asterias feeds on mussels whose size were the same or larger than the mean size for the population. The solid structure of interconnected mussels forming the bed restricts Asterias predation to only those mussels situated at the bed surface. A field experiment demonstrated that Asterias consumption rate of mussels was higher at beds with an intact structure of mussels compared to beds where the bands interconnecting the mussels were broken and mussel orientations changed. A laboratory experiment revealed that attachment of mussels did not affect starfish predation rates and indicated that change in orientation of mussels may reduce predation rates. In field and laboratory experiments, increased attachment of mussels was observed when exposed to Asterias. The study demonstrated that the feeding behaviour of Asterias is restricted by the complex structure of interconnected mussels in beds, which has to be integrated in optimal foraging models.},

abstract={The effect of a 5-hydroxytryptamine7 (5-HT7) receptor-directed antisense oligonucleotide on rat behaviour and neuroendocrine function was investigated. Six days of intracerebroventricular 5-HT7 antisense oligonucleotide treatment significantly reduced [3H]5-HT binding to hypothalamic 5-HT7 receptors, whereas cortical 5-HT(2C) density remained unchanged. In rats on a food-restricted diet, both antisense and mismatch oligonucleotides reduced food intake and body weight compared with that in vehicle-treated controls by day 4 of administration. 5-HT7 antisense oligonucleotide administration did not affect exploratory or locomotor activity in photocell activity monitors on day 4 or elevated plus-maze behaviour on day 6 of intracerebroventricular treatment. 5-HT7 antisense oligonucleotide did not affect plasma corticosterone or prolactin levels or 5-HT turnover in either 5-HT cell body or terminal areas. These data demonstrate that intracerebroventricular 5-HT7 antisense oligonucleotide administration selectively reduced rat hypothalamic 5-HT7 receptor density without affecting any of the biochemical or behavioural measures. The results suggest that this antisense protocol could be a valuable tool to investigate central 5-HT7 receptor functions, and that this receptor is not critical for the control of neuroendocrine function or food intake.},

abstract={A better understanding of the animal x plant interaction is needed to develop management practices which will maintain a sufficiently rich and abundant vegetation in the pastures. Such practices would permit the animals to meet their nutritional requirements, and to ensure a sufficient production, while contributing to the maintenance of the environment. This review, drawn on a large number of experimental studies, takes stock of the factors influencing the selection and use of feeding sites and stations by herbivores. First, we present the theorical framework in which the experimental observations are discussed. The general context of Optimal Foraging Theory (OFT) and its predictions are described and discussed. Second, we analyse how forage (quantity and quality, plant species, distribution), environment (topography, distance to water, predator risk) and some animal factors (cognitive abilities, social organization) affect the choice and use of feeding sites and stations. The OFT successfully explains the foraging behaviour of herbivores. However, animals' choices are rarely as absolute as predicted. Under natural conditions, animals not only respond to food resource, but they are also constrained by some non alimentary environmental factors and by the limits of their cognitive abilities (memory, discrimination). Other complementary approaches, such as ¬´ hedonism ¬ª and ¬´ nutritional wisdom ¬ª, can partly influence animals' choices and are also briefly discussed.},

abstract={Researchers have normally considered weaning to be a non-reversible event. To determine the validity of this assumption, we interviewed 36 mothers of toddlers who were living in a poor shanty town of Lima, Peru. Data from 32 women were complete and used in this analysis. Mothers described their beliefs, practices, and decisions about breastfeeding, weaning, and relactation (the reintroduction of breastfeeding after weaning). We recorded attempted weaning events if the mother reported (1) purposefully not breastfeeding with the intention to wean, or (2) carrying out an action that was believed to cause the child to stop breastfeeding. Using a constant comparative approach, references to childfeeding decisions were coded, categorized, and analyzed. All mothers breastfed for at least 12 months; the median duration of breastfeeding was 25 months. There were several different patterns of child-feeding. Thirteen women never attempted to wean their children or had weaned on the first attempt. The majority (n = 19) of women, however, attempted to wean their children - some as early as 3 months of age - but relactated between less than 1 day and 3 months later. Factors that influenced feeding decisions were primarily related to maternal and child health, and maternal time commitments. Children were weaned when there was a perceived problem of maternal health or time commitments and child health was not at risk of deterioration. Mothers postponed weaning because of poor child health. The primary reason for relactation was a child's negative reaction to weaning (e.g., incessant crying or refusal to eat). Personalities of the mother and child were important determinants of feeding decisions. These results demonstrate that maternal and child factors jointly influence child-feeding decisions and that these decisions are easily reversed. As relactation is culturally acceptable, health practitioners should consider recommending relactation when children have been prematurely weaned and human milk would improve their nutritional and health status.},

abstract={Visalberghi and Fragaszy [Animal Behaviour 49:1089-1095, 1995] have shown that social influences affect acceptance of novel foods. However, little is known about the temporal course on which such influences act (e.g., for how long they persist and for how many encounters they are effective). To explore this issue, 11 adult tufted capuchins were observed during ten successive encounters with eight unfamiliar foods (phase 1, in which subjects were tested in social or individual condition) and ten more encounters 6 months later (phase 2, in which all subjects were tested in social condition). A total of 680 observational sessions were carried out. Results show that during the first five encounters in phase 1, capuchins ate more when they encountered these foods in the presence of their groupmates than if they encountered them alone. Thereafter, during the second five encounters of phase 1, foods were consumed equivalently whether presented to monkeys socially or individually. In phase 2, the foods were consumed equivalently regardless of the previous circumstance of their presentation (social or alone). In phase 2, consumption was similar to that scored in a previous study for familiar foods [Visalberghi and Fragaszy, Animal Behaviour 49:1089-1095, 1995]. We conclude that 1) foods remain unfamiliar to capuchins only for the first few encounters, 2) social facilitation of consumption of unfamiliar foods is of limited duration, and 3) individuals consumed equivalent amounts of an unfamiliar food when they repeatedly encountered it alone or in the presence of groupmates. These results caution those who interpret similar feeding habits in primate groups as evidence of social influences.},

abstract={Objectives: to compare the adequacy of nutritional support in surgical, medical and geriatric wards, and to assess correlates and prognostic implications of inadequate caloric intake. Design: prospective observational study. Setting: an acute-care university hospital. Patients: 370 patients over 70 years of age consecutively admitted to general surgery (n = 86), general medicine (n = 149) and geriatric (n = 135) wards. Method: a multidimensional assessment was performed on admission, and the average daily caloric intake was computed. The logistic regression analysis was used to characterize patients at risk of starvation, defined as a caloric intake below 40% of the estimated requirement, and of death. Results: the average daily caloric intake, expressed as mean ¬± SD, was 63 ¬± 40%, 63 ¬± 31% and 69 ¬± 34% of that required in surgical, medical and geriatric wards, respectively. Patients at risk of starvation were identified by body mass index &lt; 22 kg/cm2 on admission [odds ratio (OR) = 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.33 - 2.24] and pre-admission dependency in activities of daily living (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.03 - 1.73). Mortality was independently predicted by an actual/required caloric intake ratio below 40% in the first 3 days of stay (OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.21 - 2.85), pre-admission dependency in at least one activity of daily living (OR=1.91, 95% CI = 1.24 - 2.94), lymphocytes &lt; 1000/mm3 (OR = 1.71, CI = 1.11 - 2.64), albumin &lt; 3.5 g/dl (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.08 - 2.66). Conclusions: nutritional support to geriatric patients is frequently inadequate in both surgical and medical and geriatric wards of the acute-care hospital. Malnourished and dependent patients are at high risk of in-hospital starvation. Inadequate caloric intake is a co-contributor to the risk of hospital mortality.},

Surprisingly, variations in food availability failed to produce significant effects on any of these behavior patterns. Risk x food interactions were also not statistically significant for any gerrid behavior. The significant responses to predators all changed in directions that should decrease the risk of predation for G. marginatus.},

abstract={A better understanding of the animal x plant interaction is needed to develop management practices which will maintain a sufficiently rich and abundant vegetation in the pastures. Such practices would permit the animals to meet their nutritional requirements, and to ensure a sufficient production, while contributing to the maintenance of the environment. This review, drawn on a large number of experimental studies, takes stock of the factors influencing the selection and use of feeding sites and stations by herbivores. First, we present the theoretical framework in which the experimental observations are discussed. The general context of optimal foraging theory (OFT) and its predictions are described. Its 'applicability', usefulness and validity to study the foraging behaviour of herbivores are then discussed. Second, we analyse how forage (quantity and quality, plant species, distribution), environment (topography, distance to water, predator risk) and some animal factors (cognitive abilities, social organisation) affect the choice and use of feeding sites and stations. In spite of some problems of definitions ('patch', 'prey' for an herbivore?) and of the herbivores' specific characteristics, the OFT has been successfully used to explain the foraging behaviour of herbivores. However, animals' choices are rarely as absolute as predicted. Under natural conditions, animals not only respond to food resource, but are also constrained by some non-alimentary environmental factors and by the limits of their cognitive abilities (memory, discrimination). Other complementary approaches, such as 'hedonism' and 'nutritional wisdom', can partly influence animals' choices and are also briefly discussed. (¬© Elsevier/Inra).},

abstract={In the Dutch Hunger Winter at the end of World War II a combination of circumstances created the conditions of a natural experiment. Unlike other famines, the Dutch famine struck at a precisely circumscribed time and place, and in a society able to document the timing and severity of the nutritional deprivation as well as the effects on fertility and health. Because the Dutch maintained comprehensive military and health records, it was possible to compare the incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders in adulthood for birth cohorts exposed versus those unexposed to prenatal famine. We have conducted several studies guided by the hypothesis that prenatal micronutrient deficiencies can cause neurodevelopmental schizophrenia or related personality disorders. In this paper we shall summarize our previous work and combine the outcome data of the different studies. Early prenatal famine was found to be specifically and robustly associated with each of three conditions: (1) congenital anomalies of the central nervous system, (2) schizophrenia, and (3) schizophrenia spectrum personality disorders. We found that the greatest increase in the risk of schizophrenia spectrum disorder - schizophrenia plus spectrum personality disorder - occurred among males born in the famine cities in December 1945 (relative risk = 2.7; 95% confidence interval = 1.5-5.1). Persons born in December 1945 were generally conceived at the absolute peak of the famine (March-April 1945). In the hope that the associations we have found may offer clues to the aetiology of schizophrenia, we are currently tracing and examining the cases of schizophrenia after prenatal exposure to famine.},

abstract={Groups of black and white colobus monkeys, or guerezas (Colobus guereza), observed in the Kakamega Forest, Kenya, had weak fidelity for sleeping sites. Groups often slept in trees near commonly used food sources, which might reduce the time and energetic costs of travel. Although the home range of each group overlapped with four to seven others, groups seemed to avoid sleeping near other groups, which would give them immediate and exclusive access to nearby food sources in the morning. The number of times a species of tree was slept in was positively correlated with its density. This may have occurred because so many suitable sites were available that proximity to feeding trees could be obtained whether or not groups slept in the feeding trees. Groups slept in tall trees, which provide stable sleeping sites and which may provide protection from both aerial and ground predators. Groups were more tightly clustered on nights with greater visibility, which might reduce the risk of predation.},

abstract={A number of theories have been proposed to explain the substantial comorbidity between the eating disorders and the substance-related disorders. Among them is the claim that self-starvation-exacerbated by excessive exercising-is itself an addiction to the body's endogenous opioids. While efforts have also been made to identify an 'addictive personality,' attempts to establish whether eating-disordered patients share these characteristics have met with mixed success. The present study was designed to determine the degree to which anorexic and bulimic patients display addictive personality characteristics, and whether these traits are useful in predicting the severity of the patients' weight preoccupation and their degree of excessive exercising. Results confirmed that both anorexic and bulimic patients had high scores on the Addiction Scale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, and that addictiveness and obsessive-compulsiveness were related simultaneously to weight preoccupation and excessive exercising in both patient groups. Findings are discussed within the framework of the auto- addiction opioid theory, and they highlight the similarities and differences in the personality structure of the eating-disorder subtypes.},

abstract={The pattern of locomotion activity was studied in Triatoma infestans, in relation to the use of an artificial refuge offered to the bugs in an experimental arena. In assays performed with insects that had a post-ecdysis starvation period of 1 week, the activity was low and mainly related to refuge leaving or entering. Insects that had gone through a longer period of starvation (6 weeks) exhibited a high locomotory activity throughout the night. Specific temporal windows were detected for refuge leaving and entering after dusk and before dawn, which were not modified by different levels of starvation of the insects. T. infestans exhibits a higher motivation for feeding during the first night hours, in comparison to that observed at the end of the scotophase. The activity peaks previously reported for T. infestans are therefore related to host and refuge search. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={The effects of MK-801 upon motor activity and memory were assessed in a novel use of open-field behavior testing. In this study, rats were treated with different doses of MK-801 (0.025, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg) and given a brief 10-min exposure to an open-field in which locomotor activity and within-session habituation were measured. Doses of MK-801 ‚â§0.1 mg/kg had no effect upon locomotor activity or within-session habituation. MK-801 0.2 mg/kg produced a marked hyperlocomotion and completely prevented within- session habituation. One day later, the animals were tested for their retention of habituation to evaluate the effects of MK-801 on memory processes. In that animals treated with 0.2 mg/kg MK-801 failed to habituate to the novel environment under the influence of 0.2 mg/kg MK-801, it was not surprising that these animals were impaired on the retention test for the novel environment. Importantly, however, the 0.1 mg/kg MK-801 treatment, which did not affect locomotor activity or within-session habitation to the novel environment, severely interfered with retention of the novel environment. Additional experiments indicated that this result could not be accounted for by drug conditioning or drug state-dependent effects. Thus, the results indicated that MK-801 can produce profound effects upon motor activity and memory and that these two effects can be disassociated.},

abstract={Food deprivation increases the rewarding effects of self-administered drugs such as psychomotor stimulants and benzodiazepines. These drugs also possess aversire properties and can produce conditioned tast aversions (CTA). Because drug-seeking behavior is most likely affected by both the rewarding and aversire properties of drugs, we hypothesize that food deprivation might also attenuate a drug's aversire consequences. The CTAs induced by three different drugs (amphetamine, chlordiazepoxide, and LiCl) were assessed separately. Male Long-Evans rats were assigned to one of two feeding conditions: restricted (maintained at 80% of free-feeding body weight), or nonrestricted (with ad lib food). Both groups received CTA training, consisting of an intraoral infusion of a novel saccharin solution (10 min) followed immediately by one of two IP injections: paired rats received drug, and unpaired rats received a similar volume of saline. After 10 days of ad lib food access, saccharin was presented to all rats again, and the latency to reject the tastant was used as an index of CTA learning. The rats that had been food restricted at the time of conditioning exhibited attenuated CTAs relative to those that had not been deprived. These differences were seen only when a rewarding drug (amphetamine or chlordiazepoxide) and not when a nonrewarding drug (LiCl) was used as the unconditioned stimulus. In a separate experiment, we established that this effect is apparent only when the deprivation period precedes conditioning rather than precedes testing. The present results indicate that food deprivation. modulates the acquisition of a CTA induced by amphetamine or chlordiazepoxide, but not LiCl.},

abstract={Octopamine is a neuromodulator that mediates diverse physiological processes in invertebrates. In some insects, such as honeybees and fruit flies, octopamine has been shown to be a major stimulator of adenylyl cyclase and to function in associative learning. To identify an octopamine receptor mediating this function in Drosophila, putative biogenic amine receptors were cloned by a novel procedure using PCR and single-strand conformation polymorphism. One new receptor, octopamine receptor in mushroom bodies (OAMB), was identified as an octopamine receptor because human and Drosophila cell lines expressing OAMB showed increased cAMP and intracellular Ca2+ levels after octopamine application. Immunohistochemical analysis using an antibody made to the receptor revealed highly enriched expression in the mushroom body neuropil and the ellipsoid body of central complex, brain areas known to be crucial for olfactory learning and motor control, respectively. The preferential expression of OAMB in mushroom bodies and its capacity to produce cAMP accumulation suggest an important role in synaptic modulation underlying behavioral plasticity.},

abstract={It has been observed that susceptibility to many degenerative diseases increases concurrently with industrialization and rising living standards. Although epidemiologic studies suggest that specific environmental and dietary factors may be important, caloric intake alone (as reflected in body size) may account for much of the differential risk observed among diverse human populations. It has been suggested from animal studies that caloric intake may be the primary effector for many hormonal, metabolic, physiologic, and behavioral responses that coordinate reproductive strategy to apparent availability of food. When caloric intake is excessive, particularly at critical developmental stages, physiologic priorities are set for body growth and fecundity rather than for endurance and longevity. The converse occurs during periods of famine, thus increasing the probability that sufficient individuals survive to restore the population when conditions improve. Calorically restricted rodents have significantly longer reproductive and total life spans than their ad libitum-fed controls and exhibit a spectrum of biochemical and physiologic alterations that characterize their adaptation to reduced caloric intake. These include reduced stature, hypercorticism in the absence of elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, increased metabolic efficiency, decreased mitogenic response coupled with increased rates of apoptosis, reduced inflammatory response, induction of stress proteins and DNA repair enzymes, altered drug-metabolizing enzyme expression, and modified cell-mediated immune function. The overall profile of these changes is one of improved defense against environmental stress. This has been suggested as the mechanistic basis for the protective effects of low body weight on radiation and chemically induced cancers in experimental animals. It may also explain the significantly higher thresholds of acute toxicity observed when calorically restricted rodents are exposed to certain test compounds.},

Participants received eight sessions of CBT and were then randomized to either exposure to pre-binge cues (B-ERP), exposure to pre-purge cues (P-ERP), or a relaxation control condition (RELAX). Results. CBT produced significant clinical change. At the end of the behavioural treatments, there were no significant differences across the three groups on abstinence (66% in B-ERP, 45% in P-ERP and 47% in RELAX), or frequency of bingeing and purging. B-ERP, but not P-ERP, significantly reduced anxiety on the cue reactivity assessment, food restriction, body dissatisfaction and depression. These differences were not maintained at 6-month follow-up. At 12-months, B-ERP was independently associated with lower food restriction and better global functioning. Conclusions. CBT is a highly effective treatment for bulimia nervosa. B-ERP was modestly superior to P-ERP at post-treatment; however, the advantage did not remain throughout the follow-up interval. ERP for bulimia nervosa is an expensive and logistically complicated treatment that does not appear to offer any significant additive benefits that are proportional to the amount of effort required to implement the treatment.},

abstract={The neuroactive steroid 3Œ±-hydroxy-5Œ≤-pregnan-20-one (pregnanolone) and benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) agonists share sedative, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant properties. Recent evidence suggests that like BZR agonists, pregnanolone may also modulate feeding responses. The present experiments examined the behavioral mechanisms responsible for any hyperphagic effect of pregnanolone. The effect of pregnanolone (1-10 mg/kg IP) on the intake and microstructure of licking for two sucrose solutions (1 and 3%) in well familiarized nondeprived male rats under either light or dark conditions was examined. Pregnanolone had no effect on either intake or the duration or number of bouts of licking in these experiments, although in all cases the intrabout lick rate was significantly reduced at the highest dose. Pregnanolone (1-10 mg/kg) also failed to increase intake of a sweet wet mash in familiarized nondeprived male rats. However, in a food choice test where both novel and familiar food items were available, pregnanolone (1-3 mg/kg) significantly increased the time spent eating the novel food. These results suggest that unlike BZR agonists, which enhance feeding responses directly, pregnanolone may facilitate feeding secondarily via an attenuation of anxiety. Science Inc.},

abstract={Experiments were conducted to identify the roles of the individual sense organs in the feeding behaviour of Chinese perch Siniperca chuatsi by determining the consumption of natural food after selective removal or blocking of eyes, lateral lines and olfactory organs, and also by observing the behavioural response to visual, mechanical and chemical stimulation by artificial prey. Chinese perch were able to feed properly on live prey fish when either eyes or lateral lines were intact or functional, but could scarcely feed without these two senses. Chinese perch recognized its prey by vision through the perception of motion and shape, and showed a greater dependence on vision in predation when both visual and mechanical cues were available. Chemical stimulation by natural food could not elicit any feeding response in Chinese perch, and gustation was only important to the fish for the last stage of food discrimination in the oropharyngeal cavity. The sensory basis of Chinese perch in feeding is well adapted to its nocturnal stalking hunting strategy, and also explains its peculiar food habit of accepting live prey fish only and refusing dead prey fish or artificial diets.},

abstract={In female mammals, fertility declines abruptly at an advanced age. The human menopause is one example, but reproductive cessation has also been documented in non-human primates, rodents, whales, dogs, rabbits, elephants and domestic livestock. The human menopause has been considered an evolutionary adaptation, assuming that elderly women avoid the increasing complications of continued childbirth to better nurture their current children and grandchildren. But an abrupt reproductive decline might be only a non-adaptive by-product of life-history patterns. Because so many individuals die from starvation, disease and predation, detrimental genetic traits can persist (or even be favoured) as long as their deleterious effects are delayed until an advanced age is reached, and, for a given pattern of mortality, there should be an age by which selection would be too weak to prevent the onset of reproductive senescence. We provide a systematic test of these alternatives using field data from two species in which grandmothers frequently engage in kin-directed behaviour. Both species show abrupt age- specific changes in reproductive performance that are characteristic of menopause. But elderly females do not suffer increased mortality costs of reproduction, nor do post-reproductive females enhance the fitness of grandchildren or older children. Instead, reproductive cessation appears to result from senescence.},

abstract={This study consisted of two experiments, one in rats and one in human volunteers, that used the identical progressive ratio (PR) operant procedure. In both experiments, responding was reinforced under a progressively increasing work requirement, and different groups of subjects received reinforcers that varied in sweetness. In experiment 1, rats were subjected to chronic mild stress, a well-validated animal model of depression. Performance under the PR schedule increased in subjects reinforced with conventional precision pellets (which contain 10% sucrose) or very sweet pellets, but not in subjects reinforced with sugar-free pellets. In experiment 2, volunteers were subjected to a depressive musical mood induction. Performance under the PR schedule increased in subjects reinforced with chocolate buttons, but not in subjects reinforced with with buttons made from the relatively unpalatable chocolate substitute carob. In experiment 2, depressive mood induction also increased chocolate craving, as measured by a novel questionnaire, and there were significant correlations between chocolate craving and chocolate-reinforced PR performance. These results suggest that performance under the PR schedule provides a measure of craving rather than reward, and that craving for sweet rewards is increased by depressive mood induction in both animal and human models. Implications for the interpretation of pharmacological studies using the PR procedure are also discussed.},

abstract={Predators can have significant nonlethal effects on prey by modifying prey behaviour through chemically mediated interactions. We examined behavioural responses of wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and American toad (Bufo americanus) tadpoles to both direct and indirect chemical signals associated with a predatory odonate (Anax junius). In laboratory trials, tadpoles of both species responded strongly to water conditioned with Anax nymphs by decreasing foraging rates, becoming immobile, and moving away from the stimulus. The responses to water conditioned with starved Anax versus Anax that fed on conspecific tadpoles did not differ significantly; these results suggest that tadpoles rely primarily on direct signals to detect odonates. Rana did not respond to water conditioned with conspecific tissue extracts, while Bufo responded with behaviours that were indistinguishable from those of tadpoles exposed to Anax chemicals. In a field experiment, the responses of R. sylvatica tadpoles to Anax chemicals were similar to those of tadpoles observed in the laboratory. Collectively, our data indicate that tadpoles of both species use chemical cues to assess predation risk from other community members. Tadpoles can selectively distinguish members who pose a threat, and only evacuate food patches or reduce foraging rates when in danger. These behaviours appear to be adaptive and are consistent with the predictions of optimality theory.},

abstract={The vertical distribution of early juvenile sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria (Pallas), and their behavioral responses to changing food and temperature conditions were examined in laboratory experiments. Although field collections have suggested that juveniles are obligate residents of the neuston, laboratory experiments on diel movements indicated the potential for downward movement during the day, when activity levels were high and active foraging would be likely. The relationship of downward movement to fish size (small vs. large juveniles), prior feeding success (high vs. low rations) and thermal structure of the water column (isothermal vs. varying intensities of thermal stratification) were tested. Thermal stratification inhibited downward movement, with sablefish displaying clear avoidance of cold water even when the thermal gradient was moderate (12 ¬∞C top layer and 8 ¬∞C bottom layer). However, sablefish could be induced to swim downward into cold water if food was introduced beneath the thermocline. Across all temperature treatments, occurrence in cold water significantly increased when food was present. Increasing the sharpness of the thermal gradient (top layer = 12 ¬∞C, bottom layer = 8, 6, 4 or 2 ¬∞C) did not affect the percentage of time spent in cold water, but did shorten the maximum time an individual would spend beneath the thermocline. Movement into cold water constituted a potentially lethal risk for juvenile sablefish; dives beneath the thermocline that exceeded 60 s resulted in loss of equilibrium and immediate death for small fish moving from 12 to 2 ¬∞C water. Thus, sablefish displayed behavioral trade-offs between food acquisition and the physiological risk of cold temperatures, similar to previous studies documenting balancing of foraging behavior and predation risk. Behavioral responses to thermal stratification were modified by fish size and hunger level, with larger juveniles and those held on low rations spending more time in cold water. These behavioral responses correspond with the high feeding requirements necessary to maintain the naturally rapid growth rates of this species and the transitions in habitat associated with different life history stages.},

abstract={The C57BL/6 mouse (C57) is used as a model for the human consumption of ethanol. Previous studies on the taste preferences of the C57 mouse indicate that ethanol drinking by this animal is for calories and not for a pharmacological effect. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to further determine the role of calories and taste in the selection of ethanol by the C57 mouse. C57 and outbred Hsd:ICR (ICR or CD-1) mice were housed two per cage with three drinking tubes. A standard 10-day preference test of 3-30% ethanol (v/v) vs. water was performed: the mean maximally preferred concentrations of ethanol were 17.9% for C57 and 6.8% for ICR mice. Once drinking of the preferred concentration for each cage had stabilized at 13.2 and 0.9 g/kg/day, respectively, the third tube was filled with water, 0.5% aspartame, isocaloric dextrose, or diluted chocolate Ultra Slim-Fast plus dextrose. Five days of dextrose or chocolate drink reduced the amount of ethanol consumed by 41% and 44% by C57 mice, but aspartame did not affect their drinking. Additional groups of C57 and ICR mice were habituated to a 2- h limited access to water. When offered a 0.5 mM quinine solution as the only fluid, both strains consumed the same volumes as water. Presentation of a saccharin solution was followed by an IP injection of either 0.5 M LiCl or NaCl. When given the saccharin solution 48 h later, the LiCl-treated mice of both strains drank less saccharin. The C57 mouse did not exhibit a LiCl- induced taste aversion when ethanol was the novel solution. As a test of response to novelty, a cork stopper was placed in each cage. The ICR mice gnawed much more of the cork than did the C57 mice. Thus, both C37 and ICR mice learned a taste aversion, but the C57 mouse altered its large consumption of ethanol based on more palatable sources of calories. These data support the earlier concept that the consumption of ethanol represents a preferred source of calories for the C57 mouse. Extrapolation of genetic or biochemical differences between these mice to differences between the human alcoholic and the nonalcoholic should thus be made with caution.},

abstract={Objective: To compare the health problems, needs and behavior of pupils absent from school with participants in the Swiss Multicenter Adolescent Survey on Health. Methods: The present pupils' group (N = 3324; adolescents between 15 and 20 years old, randomly selected from high schools and professional centers of French-speaking Switzerland) answered a self- administered anonymous questionnaire. The absent pupils group (N = 96) was questioned on the phone by means of a shorter but similar version of the questionnaire. Results: The proportion of respondents reporting skin problems, weight concerns, sleep difficulties, headaches, stomach aches, as well as vision or dental problems was higher in the present pupils sample (p < 0.01). The percentages of teenagers reporting the need for help were higher in the present pupils sample than in the absent group: nutrition (21.8 vs. 9.4, p < 0.01) stress (44.2 vs. 31.3, p < 0.05), depression (28.4 vs. 18.9, p < 0.05), sleep problems (21.3 vs. 12.1, p < 0.05), sports (9.2 vs. 4.2, p < 0.05), and love life (31.5 vs. 14.5, p < 0.01). The rates of hospitalizations and injuries were lower among absent pupils (28.2 vs. 40.1, p < 0.01). A higher proportion of absent students were sexually active (p < 0.05). They had a tendency to use tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis more frequently than did present pupils (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Within the Swiss context, nonparticipation owing to school absenteeism is probably related less to physical or chronic health problems than to lifestyles which predispose these students to truancy.
3324 in-school students aged 15-20 years randomly selected from high schools and professional centers in francophone Switzerland answered a self-administered questionnaire about their health problems, needs, and behavior. Their responses were compared with those of 96 absent students sampled via telephone on a shorter, but similar questionnaire. Relative to the absent students, a significantly higher percentage of in-school students reported skin problems, weight concerns, sleep problems, headaches, stomach aches, and vision or dental problems. The percentages of students reporting a need for help were also higher among present students than among those who were absent: nutrition, 21.8 vs. 9.4; stress, 44.2 vs. 31.3; depression, 28.4 vs. 18.9; sleep problems, 21.3 vs. 12.1; sports, 9.2 vs. 4.2; and love life, 31.5 vs. 14.5. The rates of hospitalization and injuries were lower among absent students, 28.2 vs. 40.1. A higher proportion of absent students were sexually active and they also had a tendency to use tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis more often than did present students. Absent students also more frequently partook of leisure and group activities. Study findings suggest that within the Swiss context, school absenteeism is probably related less to physical or chronic health problems than to hedonistic lifestyles which predispose some students skip part of the school hours.},

abstract={Egg-laying organisms should lay, in a reproductive bout, the number of eggs that maximizes fitness. Lack argued 50 years ago that clutch size for most birds is limited by the amount of food parents can provide for their offspring. Clutch sizes, however, are often smaller than this 'Lack clutch size', and this fact is the subject of much debate. Here I propose and test a new explanation for this pattern that is based on evidence that conspecific brood parasitism is widespread in birds, specifically when females parasitized by other females. At the population level, parasitic eggs decrease the average value of the parental eggs laid by parasites, in turn favouring even greater allocation to parasitism (trade-off in fig. 1); optimal clutch size depends on the frequency of parasitism, and vice versa. The dynamic nature of the problem is further enhanced in species where the success of parasitic eggs is also frequency-dependent. These various game aspects do not alter the qualitative assumptions or predictions of the graphical model. It will be important, however, to incorporate these assumptions and predictions into a more quantitative, theoretical study and into some empirical tests. For example, in populations in which parasites are also hosts, the fitness estimates for a parasite's own clutch must reflect her risks and costs of being parasitized. I have accounted for these fitness estimates; egg survival estimates (Fig. 2) included parasitic females who were themselves parasitized (6 of the 23 parasitic females). Some of these females raised parasitic chicks and, consequently, sacrificed some of their own chicks in the process.},

abstract={Novel assays were used to assess inter alia whether the hippocampus is involved in detecting novelty per se or in an associative mismatch process. During training, rats received two audiovisual sequences (tone-left constant light and clickleft flashing light). In both sham-operated control rats and those with excitotoxic hippocampal lesions, novel visual targets provoked an orienting response that habituated during training. Moreover, like sham- operated rats, rats with hippocampal lesions acquired associations between the elements of two audiovisual sequences. However, subsequent test trials in which the auditory stimuli preceding the visual targets were switched (click- left constant light and tone-left flashing light) provoked renewed orienting to the visual targets in sham-operated rats but not in hippocampal rats. These results support the view that hippocampal damage results in a failure to detect (or act on) mismatches that are generated when an auditory stimulus associatively evokes the memory of one visual stimulus and a different (familiar) visual stimulus is present in the environment.},

abstract={In a recent study it has been shown that benzodiazepine receptor agonists attenuate novelty-induced suppression of feeding and increase the percentage of animals feeding in the open field. Food-deprived rats were placed in one corner of the open field containing food in the center. The number of rats beginning to eat in the first 5 min was recorded. In the present study this test was validated pharmacologically using known 'anxiolytic' or 'nonanxiolytic' drugs. The following substances (effective doses, given IP) increased the number of rats feeding within 5 min in the center of the open field: meprobamate (30.0-300 mg/kg), 8-OH-DPAT (10 and 30 Œºg/kg), ipsapirone (1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg), ritanserin (0.125-0.5 mg/kg), tropisetron (0.1-10.0 Œºg/kg), ondansetron (0.3-3.0 Œºg/kg), lisuride (0.28- 0.55 mg/kg), morphine (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg), propranolol (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg), clozapine (1.0 mg/kg). Drugs without 'anxiolytic' effects in other animal models or in humans, including amphetamine, apomorphine, haloperidol, sulpiride, and mCPP did not increase the incidence of food intake in this test. Ethanol and hexobarbital, in nonsedative doses, had no effect in this paradigm. Drugs and doses effective in the modified open-field test caused no increase in food intake in an independent food consumption test using food- deprived rats staying in the familiar cages. The results suggest that the modified open-field test can detect 'anxiolytic' drug properties and is valid for the assessment of 'anxiolytic' effects from different classes of drugs.},

abstract={Like human prehensile behavior, the pigeon's ingestive pecking response is elicited by visual stimuli conveying information about the location and size of the target. This information is used to generate localized ingestive pecks whose gapes are amplitude-scaled to seed size, prior to contact. We employed high-resolution, 'real-time' monitoring of head acceleration, jaw movements and terminal peck location to examine the kinematics, coordination and stimulus control of conditioned pecking. Conditioning procedures were used to bring pecking under the control of visual targets whose stimulus properties (size, location) were independently varied, while simultaneously monitoring pecking response parameters. Stimulus control of the transport component (peck localization) is extremely precise, even in the absence of a specific localization-dependent reinforcement contingency. Subjects also showed amplitude-scaling of gape size to the size of a visual target, but over a more restricted range than shown to food pellets of comparable sizes. Comparison of the kinematic profiles of conditioned and ingestive pecks suggests that conditioned pecking is functionally analogous to human 'pointing' rather than 'grasping' behavior.},

abstract={The efforts in optimizing feeding conditions of food producing animals in the past were focussed primarily on promoting performance and/or the products' quality (MEYER 1997). In spite of great success in this direction various risks occure due to the conflict between the increased requirements on the one hand and the species typical demands on the other (for example: need of roughage as well as of concentrates with high energy and nutrient density in ruminants). Especially in feeding high yielding dairy cows the conflict is obvious: Even in the case, that high amounts of concentrates are fed it becomes more and more difficult to meet the energy requirement when the milk yield exceeds 40 kg milk per day (FLACHOWSKY a. LEBZIEN 1997). A negative energy balance is accompanied by a forced predisposition for ketosis and infertility (KRUIP 1996). Insufficient proportions of roughage in those rations predispose the animals for rumen acidosis and associated problems (health of claws etc.) as well as for displacement of abomasum. Thereby in feeding high yielding dairy cows there is only the choice between different risks due to the fact that the feed intake capacity did not increase to the same extent as the milk production did. In fattening calves the use of roughage (in Germany required by law) is on debate in this direction (necessary to avoid disturbances in the behaviour). Further problems in feeding animals according to their species typical demands are related to the established conditions of housing, feeding and water supply (risks of mechanization and automatization due to potential disfunction). The generally increased feeding intensity results - for example in poultry - in a higher frequency of skeleton diseases; the more and more specialized pig production (separate units for piglet production, rearing units, fattening units) is accompanied by increased changes in diets and techniques of feed and water supply, to that the animals have to be accustomed, too. The science of animal nutrition gets more and more involved in questions on the species depending requirements that guarantee a physiological development of the animal, health and normal behaviour. There is an increased need to create and evaluate parameters that can be used for characterization animals' well-being related to different feeding strategies. Without any doubts it is a special task to veterinary nutritionists to point out risks, problems, conflicting aimes when the feeding intensity is forced continuously. The slogan "back to nature" is too simple and does not correspond to the complexity of efforts which are suitable and necessary to meet animals' energy and nutrient requirements as well as demands of animals' welfare. Eventually it is helpful to remember sometimes the limits set up by the biology and physiology when feeding intensity or techniques are on debate.},

abstract={Dissociative identity disorder (DID; called multiple personality disorder in DSMIII-R) is a psychiatric condition in which two or more identity states recurrently take control of the person's behavior. A characteristic feature of DID is the occurrence of apparently severe amnestic symptoms. This paper is concerned with experimental research of memory function in DID and focuses on between-identity transfer of newly learned neutral material. Previous studies on this subject are reviewed and a pilot study with four subjects is described. This study is specifically concerned with the question whether self-reported asymmetries in between-identity transfer can be replicated on experimental memory tests. A secondary aim was to examine whether, in the absence of explicit transfer, implicit transfer of information would occur. The results showed that the apparent amnestic asymmetry for explicit information was substantiated in the laboratory, although at least some leakage was present between the apparently amnestic identities. No evidence was found for better performance on implicit than on explicit memory tests in the apparently amnestic identities. In the discussion, parallels between apparent amnesia in DID and state-dependent memory are drawn, and the question of simulated amnesia is addressed. ¬© 1998 Academic Press.},

abstract={Evidence for primates' understanding of causality is presented and discussed. Understanding causality requires the organism to understand not just that two events are associated with one another in space and time, but also that there is some 'mediating force' that binds the two events to one another which may be used to predict or control those events (e.g. a physical force such as gravity or a psychological force such as an intention). In the physical domain, studies of tool use indicate that capuchin monkeys do not have a causal understanding of the functioning of tools in terms of the physical forces involved, but rather they learn to associate aspects of their own behavior with the results it produces. Apes show some possible signs of understanding the causal relations involved in tool use in the sense that they may employ various forms of foresight in approaching novel tasks, perhaps involving an understanding of physical forces-although not to the extent of human children. In the psychological domain, nonhuman primates understand conspecifics as animate beings that generate their own behavior and, thus, they appreciate that to manipulate conspecifics communicative signals, and not physical activities, are required. However, there is very little evidence that nonhuman primates of any species understand others as psychological beings with intentions and other psychological states that mediate their behavioral interactions with the world-as human children begin to do sometime during their second year of life. More research, using a wider range of problem-solving situations, is needed if we are to become more precise in our understanding of how primates understand the causal structure of the world around them.},

abstract={We present spatially explicit models to predict the optimal distribution of numerous food provisioners that share a nesting aggregation. We compare predictions for solitary and social provisioners, and for three foraging currencies. When distinct food patches with identical food parameters are considered, fewer provisioners use the farther patches. The rate of decline in number of provisioners depends on the currency used. With net rate of energy intake (net energy gain over time), the rate of decline is relatively small under a wide range of realistic parameter values and distances; with efficiency (net energy gain over energy cost) and empirically derived energetic costs, the rate of decline is much higher. With lifetime fitness (lifetime food delivery under predation risk), outcomes depend on the ratio of mortality risk during flight and during food collection at the patch. With all currencies, there is a difference between the optimal spatial distribution of solitary and social provisioners, with a larger proportion of social provisioners being farther from the central place. The optimal distribution of solitary provisioners in a two dimensional field of uniformly distributed food such as a flowering meadow is such that the density of solitary provisioners (number per unit area) declines monotonically with distance, and provisioner number peaks at half the maximum area used.},

abstract={The effects of food restriction on predation risk-taking behavior were studied in juvenile coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, during the period before seawater migration in the spring. A radiographic technique enabled the study of individual food intake in a safe and risky food patch before and after exposure to a piscivorous predator. The study revealed a significant increase in food intake and specific growth rate in the weeks following deprivation, resulting in compensatory growth and a recovery of the weight loss caused by dietary restriction. The increase in food intake resulted from a change in risk-taking behavior. Following a period of diet restriction, the fish habituated faster after predator exposure, and the proportion of fish in the risky patch was significantly higher than before deprivation. Deprived fish took greater shares of the group meal compared with control fish, and the pattern of the individual share of the group meal after food restriction indicated a change in the social hierarchy. This study indicates that risk-taking behavior is state dependent and changes temporarily to compensate for a period of food restriction. The results are discussed in terms of trade-offs between food and risk in a period leading up to an ontogenetic habitat shift.},

abstract={Life history characteristics of sea urchins can be used to evaluate the potential of species for aquaculture. The important life history characteristics for this evaluation can be separated into those affecting production of biomass and maintenance. These result from three primary life history strategies. First, species in environments that are unstable or with high predation and with high food availability should have high production and low maintenance. Second, high production and moderate maintenance and a potential for phenotypic plasticity should occur in species in environments that are stable with low predation and high food availability. Third, those in environments that are stable or with low predation and with low food availability should have low production and high maintenance. Tripneustes, Strongylocentrotus, and Arbacia are probable representative genera, respectively, of these life history strategies. Species in the first category would be most appropriate for aquaculture using production as the criterion. The consumption by humans of certain species of sea urchins in the past can be related to their accessibility and palatability, and does not necessarily indicate their suitability for aquaculture. Knowledge of life history characters can aide in evaluating sea-urchin species for aquaculture.},

abstract={The present experiments compared the effects of 2 appetitive motivational states on the acquisition of Pavlovian fear conditioning in rats (Rattus norvegicus). In Experiment 1, rats were deprived of either water or food prior to contextual fear conditioning, which consisted of the delivery of a single footshock in a novel observation chamber. Conditional fear to the contextual cues of the conditioning chamber was measured by observing freezing behavior. The results revealed that water, but not food, deprivation enhanced conditional freezing to contextual stimuli paired with footshock. Experiment 2 indicated that the different impact of food or water deprivation on the acquisition of conditional freezing was not due to differential generalization decrements during extinction testing. Together, these experiments suggest that the modulation of fear conditioning by deprivation state is specific to certain motivational systems.

abstract={Predators that aggregate in 'hot spots' of high prey density have been hypothesized to synchronize population cycles of small mammals. During a peak and decline in a snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) cycle, we created artificial hot spots of increased hare abundance by adding food and excluding mammalian predators on three 1-km2 blocks and then recorded the response of radio-marked Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus) to these food additions. Territorial owls showed a decrease in home range size and patchiness of spatial use as hare densities peaked and declined, although this was better explained by smaller territory sizes due to a growing owl population rather than a direct behavioral response to changing food density. Experimental owls on food-enriched territories did not show a difference in conventional measurements of home-range size and patchiness of spatial use compared with controls, but the distances of owl locations to treatment blocks revealed concentrations of spatial use on experimental hot spots. At a larger scale, neither territorial owls nor nonterritorial floaters showed a tendency to leave poorer patches and move toward hot spots, and the territorial system of Great Horned Owls was largely resistant to extreme variations in prey density. The effect of social interference between predators has been assumed for several models of predator-prey interactions, but empirical evidence has rarely been demonstrated. Our results suggest that territorial behavior, in addition to limiting the growth of a predator population, also prevents large aggregations of predators at an intermediate spatial scale.},

abstract={Juvenile green iguanas were placed in a situation of conflict between two motivations: a thermoregulatory drive and the attraction of a palatable bait. To be able to reach the bait (lettuce), they had to leave a warm refuge, provided with standard food, and venture into a cold environment. In experiment 1 the time interval between sessions with bait, ranging from 1 to 8 days, had no effect on the duration of stay on the bait. This result shows that the lettuce was not a necessary food, deprivation of which would have had to be compensated for. In experiment 2 as the ambient temperature at the bait decreased the lizards spent less time feeding on lettuce, and they visited the bait less frequently. This result shows that the lizards traded off the palatability of the bait with the disadvantage of the cold. These findings support the hypothesis that a common currency makes it possible for lizards to compare two sensory modalities.},

We examined physiological and behavioral effects of food deprivation for larval (8‚Äì24 mm) and juvenile (small, 45‚Äì70 mm; medium, 80‚Äì120 mm; and large, 140‚Äì230 mm) walleyes Stizostedion vitreum encompassing critical periods in their early life history. Juvenile walleye size ranges encompass important ontogenetic diet shifts (small and medium) and the overwinter period (large). The direct effects of starvation on total body energy (J/g wet weight) and mortality rates of larval and juvenile fish were assessed in both laboratory tanks (420 L) and pond (0.4 ha) experiments. Temperature (15‚Äì25¬∞C) affected mortality rates and the depletion of energy reserves. During the overwinter period (4¬∞C), initial energy losses were observed that did not affect mortality through 150 d. A ‚Äúpoint of no return‚Äù was observed for larval fish after 6‚Äì8 d of starvation. Larval and juvenile fish (all sizes) survived longer at low energy densities when temperatures were reduced. We also assessed the indirect effects of starvation on foraging efficiency and vulnerability to predation in laboratory experiments. Capture efficiency and handling time was affected for larval fish after 5 d and for juveniles after 21 d of starvation, but no effects were observed for overwintering fish. Starved fry were more vulnerable to predation than fed fish were after 6 d, and juveniles were more vulnerable after 21 d of starvation. Direct effects of starvation were more important to survival than indirect behavioral effects, but for both direct and indirect effects, the length of the period to critical starvation levels increased with fish size. ¬© 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Phenotypic plasticity has primarily been studied in the context of adaptation to environmental fluctuations and its underlying genetic mechanisms. However, its impact on competition and coexistence has rarely been addressed. In this paper we analyzed the ecological and evolutionary implications of phenotypic plasticity in diel vertical migration of competing, physiologically distinguishable, Daphnia populations. We developed a model that evaluates the competitive strength of daphnids which are food limited and which face predation. Competitive strength is assessed by a population's ability to invade and defend a previously established site. Phenotypically plastic individuals were assumed to choose an evolutionarily stable migration strategy at any time during the invasion process. We found plasticity to increase a population's competitive ability and in special cases to support coexistence of similar populations. Including community structure in analyzing the adaptive value of phenotypic plasticity reveals aspects that are not directly inferable from isolated population models. Hence, selection for plasticity may be more widespread than generally expected.},

abstract={A herbivore faces challenges while foraging - ongoing changes in its physiological condition along with variation in the nutrient and toxin concentrations of foods, spatially and temporally - that make selecting a nutritious diet a vital affair. Foraging behaviours arise from simple rules that operate across levels of resolution from cells and organs to individuals and their interactions with social and physical environments. At all these levels, behaviour is a function of its consequences: a behaviour operating on the environment to induce changes is itself changed by those events. Thus, behaviour emerges from its own functioning - behaviour selforganizes-not from that of its surroundings. This ostensible autonomy notwithstanding, no self-organizing system (cell, organ, or individual) is independent of its environs because existence consists of an ongoing exchange of energy and matter. According to this view, the notion of cause and effect is replaced with functional relationships between behaviours and environmental consequences. Changes in physical environments alter the distribution, abundance, nutritional, and toxicological characteristics of plants, which affect food preference. Social interactions early in life influence behaviour in various ways: animals prefer familiar foods and environments, and they prefer to be with companions. Animals in unfamiliar environments often walk farther, ingest less food, and suffer more from malnutrition and toxicity than animals in familiar environments. An individual's food preferences - and its ability to discriminate familiar from novel foods - arise from the functional integration of sensory (smell, taste, texture) and postingestive (effects of nutrients and toxins on chemo-, osmo-, and mechano-receptors) effects. The ability to discriminate among foods is critical for survival: all problems with poisonous plants are due to an inability to discriminate or a lack of alternatives. Animals eat a variety of foods as a result of nearing or exceeding tolerance limits for sensory and postingestive effects unique to each food. After eating any food too frequently or excessively, the likelihood increases that animals will eat alternative foods owing to exceeding sensory-, nutrient-, and toxin-specific tolerance limits. Cyclic patterns of intake of a variety of foods reflect seemingly chaotic interactions among flavours, nutrients, and toxins interacting along continua.},

abstract={We examined predictors of outcome 1 year after completion of a randomized clinical trial assessing the additive efficacy of two forms of exposure with response prevention to a core of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for bulimia nervosa (BN). One hundred one women who met DSM-III-R criteria for BN, and who completed the clinical trial, were available for follow-up at 1 year. Predictor variables were assessed prospectively and partitioned temporally to reflect lifetime history (including personality), pretreatment clinical status, and posttreatment clinical status. Outcome was based on the frequency of hinging and purging in the 3 months before assessment based on carefully constructed lifechart interviews. A series of stepwise logistic regressions were performed to determine independent predictors of 1-year outcome while controlling for treatment received. Demographic variables were unrelated to treatment outcome. A history of obesity was predictive of poor outcome, whereas a history of alcohol dependence decreased the odds of poor outcome. High self-directedness on the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) predicted favorable outcome at 1 year, whereas personality disorder symptoms were not predictive. Pretreatment global functioning, bulimia scores on the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI), and the presence of major depression predicted poor outcome. Posttreatment binging, food restriction, and urges to binge on a cue reactivity assessment predicted poor outcome at 1 year. The character trait of self-directedness is a strong predictor of good outcome for CBT, and methods to enhance this trait may be worthy of investigation. Low global functioning and the presence of major depression at presentation may require additional treatment than focused CBT for BN. Our results argue for treatment goals that include abstinence from binging and restricting and decreases in urges to binge in response to high-risk cues.},

abstract={The survival and quality of progeny can be strongly influenced by nongenetic effects derived from the physiological condition of the mother during gametogenesis. The influence of maternal condition on the size and quality of larvae at dispersal was examined for the tropical damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, through a series of field studies during 1994. In this species, males guard a demersal nest of eggs contributed to by nearby females. The largest and most dominant female stays near the nest and contributes most to the egg clutches, limiting egg contributions from subordinate females. Maternal effects dramatically influenced the size of larval progeny at hatching, four days after laying. Much of the variability in progeny size was explained by levels of the stress-associated steroid hormone, cortisol, in the female. A field experiment manipulating maternal levels of cortisol found that cortisol levels strongly influenced the morphology and yolk size of larval progeny at hatching. Variation in the density of egg predators and competitors together explained 38% of the observed variance in maternal cortisol levels. These competitors and predatory fish appear to elevate maternal cortisol levels and consequently influence larval morphology through a stress-related response. This study suggests that the behavioral interaction regime of a fish population can determine larval quality and potentially govern a female's contribution to the next generation.},

abstract={Arginine-vasopressin (AVP), a mammalian neuropeptide, has been postulated to function as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator. There is clinical evidence that, apart from its role in affective illness, AVP may be involved in anxiety syndromes as well. The present study investigated the putative anxiogenic effect of intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) AVP administered in rats, using well validated animal models of anxiety, including the open-field, elevated plus-maze, social interaction and feeding latency in a novel environment tests. Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 20 mg/kg, i.p.) was used as the standard anxiogenic agent for comparison. In addition, the effect of AVP was assessed on rat brain tribulin activity in terms of endogenous monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B inhibition. Tribulin has been shown to be an endocoid marker of anxiety and stress. AVP (100, 200 and 500 ng/rat, i.c.v.) produced a dose-related decrease in ambulation and rears, and an increase in immobility and defaecation, in the open-field test. These doses of AVP produced a dose-related decrease in the number of entries and time spent on the open arms of the elevated plus-maze, reduced social interaction in paired rats and increased the latency to feed in an unfamiliar environment in food-deprived rats. A qualitatively similar behavioural response was induced by PTZ in all the test parameters. AVP and PTZ increased rat brain tribulin activity, the increase in the MAO A inhibitor component being more marked than that on the MAO B inhibitor component, consonant with earlier studies with several anxiogenic agents and anxiety during addictive drug withdrawal in rats. The findings indicate that AVP exhibits an anxiogenic effect, unlike the earlier reported anxiolytic effect of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), its physiological antagonist, in rats. The anxiogenic effects of AVP (200 and 500 ng/rat, i.c.v.) and PTZ were inhibited by the benzodiazepine anxiolytic, lorazepam (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.). However, the selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, pimozide (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), inhibited only the anxiogenic effect of AVP. The results of the present study indicate that AVP induces significant anxiogenic response in rats which may be dopamine-mediated, like its antidiuretic effect in this species. AVP and ANP have contrary effects on water homeostasis and may be involved in the syndrome of acute water intoxication seen in psychiatric patients. The present investigations suggest that this postulate may hold relevance in view of the opposite effects of AVP and ANP on behaviour.},

abstract={Phytoseiid mites use herbivore-induced plant volatiles in long-range prey-habitat location and are arrested by these volatiles in a prey patch. The responses of predatory mites to these volatiles are considered to be an important factor in the local extermination of prey populations by phytoseiids such as Phytoseiulus persimilis. Prey-induced plant volatiles are highly detectable and can be reliable indicators of prey presence and prey identity. The composition of herbivore-induced plant volatiles depends on plant species and plant cultivar. Moreover, the composition may also vary with the herbivore species that infests a plant. The responses of phytoseiids to prey-induced plant volatiles from a specific plant-herbivore combination are highly variable. Causal factors include starvation, specific hunger, experience, pathogen infestation and the presence of competitors. Investigating variation in the phytoseiid's behavioural response in relation to these factors is important for understanding how and why behavioural strategies maximize phytoseiid fitness.},

abstract={Exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) induces persistent structural and functional alterations in the developing reproductive tract of males. It is possible that xenoestrogens other than DES alter sexual differentiation in males and account for the increasing incidence of developmental disorders of the reproductive tract in men and wild animals. Phytoestrogens (coumestans, isoflavonoids, flavonoids, and lignans) present in numerous edible plants are quantitatively the most important environmental estrogens when their hormonal potency is assessed in vitro. They exert their estrogenic activity by interacting with estrogen receptors (ERs) in vitro. They may also act as antiestrogens by competing for the binding sites of estrogen receptors or the active site of the estrogen biosynthesizing and metabolizing enzymes, such as aromatase and estrogen-specific 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase (type 1). In theory, phytoestrogens and structurally related compounds could harm the reproductive health of males also by acting as antiestrogens. There are very little data on effects of phytoestrogens in males. Estrogenic effects in wildlife have been described but the evidence for the role of phytoestrogens is indirect and seen under conditions of excessive exposure. In doses comparable to the daily intake from soy- based feed, isoflavonoids such as genistein were estrogen agonists in the prostate of adult laboratory rodents. When given neonatally, no persistent effects were observed. In contrast, the central nervous system (CNS)-gonadal axis and the male sexual behavior of the rat appear to be sensitive to phytoestrogens during development. The changes were similar but not identical to those seen after neonatal treatment with DES, but higher doses of phytoestrogens were needed.There are no data on effects of phytoestrogens given as pure compounds to humans, and all evidence currently available is indirect and based on experiments with phytoestrogen- rich diets. The hormonal effects have so far been marginal. It is known that the intake of phytoestrogens is higher in countries where the incidence rates of clinical conditions linked to estrogen exposure, such as hypospadia or testicular and prostatic cancers, are low. This makes it unlikely that phytoestrogens, or structurally related compounds in amounts present in Asian diets, would have DES-like actions. This does not exclude possibilities that they influence concentrations of endogenous sex hormones and interact with the ER, and that through these mechanisms they alter male sex differentiation, and consequently increase the risks of male genital tract tumors or developmental disorders, particularly in doses exceeding the daily intake of phytoestrogens in Asian diets. ¬© 1998, Sage Publications.

The arrangement of paths influenced the rats' rate of energy intake in the beginning of the experiment, whereas the arrangement of beacons did not. With experience, the rats employed different orientation strategies in the presence of different arrangements of paths or beacons, and, by the final 4 days, all groups achieved statistically indistinguishable net rates of return. The rates of energy intake were similar because the rats in different treatments traveled similar distances per session, despite differing arrangements of paths and landmarks.},

abstract={The development and occurrence of anorexia, the voluntary reduction in food intake during parasitic infections in animals, is somewhat paradoxical and contrary to conventional wisdom and expectation. We take the view that its occurrence is an evolved, costly behavioural adaptation which serves a function. Five such functional and general hypotheses to account for it are developed: (1) anorexia is induced by the parasite for its own benefit; (2) food intake decreases to starve parasites; (3) the negative effect on the host's energetic efficiency during parasitic diseases has a direct effect on food consumption; (4) food intake decreases for the purpose of promoting an effective immune response in the host; and (5) anorexia allows the host to become more selective in its diet, and thus select foods that either minimize the risk of infection or are high in antiparasitic compounds. Only hypotheses (4) and (5)survive the comparison for consistency with the physiological, metabolic and behavioural alterations that occur during the development of parasitic infections, and with the rule of generality (i.e. account for its occurrence in both protozoan and helminth infections). Both surviving hypotheses will need further experimental testing for their support or rejection, and such experiments are proposed. Also, the advantages and consequences of viewing anorexia during parasitic infections within a functional framework are discussed. These arise from the recognition that anorexia is a disease-coping strategy, part of the mechanism of recognition of parasite invasion by the immune system, which leads to a modification of the host's feeding behaviour.},

The total brain neurochemical parameters from rats born to mothers sired by an alcohol treated father were also investigated. Enzymatic markers of nerve cell development (enolase isoenzymes and glutamine synthetase) and the defense system (superoxide dismutase) against free radicals formed during alcohol degradation were measured in order to evaluate nerve cell damage. Behavioral locomotor tests (open-field, novelty-seeking, light/dark) were carried out to show long- lasting effects of paternal alcoholization on the offspring. Behavioral and developmental alterations were found until 1 year of age in the offspring and a significant growth retardation was observed in the males. Our results suggest that paternal alcohol exposure produces developmental and behavioral effects in the offspring. The consequence of either alcohol withdrawal during stage one spermatogenesis, or maternal diet supplementation with manganese during pregnancy were investigated. It was observed that some of the effects of paternal alcohol exposure on the offspring may be reversed by these treatments.},

abstract={Any general model of stress will have difficulty explaining the modulation of behavior by glucocorticoids. If a stressor is defined as a perceived threat to an organism's fitness (survival and reproductive output), rather than a threat to homeostasis, behavior becomes an integral component of the stress response. But this will not resolve arguments over what stress is or whether mating is stressful to B. marinus. It may be more productive to develop an integrated model of glucocorticoid action in which corticosteroids, released in a diurnal rhythm or in response to a stressor, coordinate responses to events that disrupt equilibrium conditions. In both cases, corticosterone acts as a transitional hormone between major physiological or behavioral states, as from sleeping to activity or from courtship to escape. Corticosterone is often defined as a 'permissive' hormone, and it may act as one under basal conditions, but I make the following distinctions. A 'transitional' hormone differs from a permissive hormone, such as thyroxine, because the circulating levels of transitional hormone fluctuate greatly in response to internal or external cues, whereas permissive hormones do not. In addition, a transitional hormone exerts more transient effects than a permissive hormone. However, there are similarities between transitional and permissive hormone action: corticosteroid and thyroid hormone receptors are both ubiquitous, so most cells in the body are capable of responding to them, and the effects of both permissive and transitional hormones vary with neuroendocrine context. Neuroendocrine context is an ambiguous term, but it is quantifiable. Even concepts like individual experience or ecological constraints may be measurable, in future studies, in terms of kinetics of glucocorticoid action, variations in cellular sensitivity to corticosteroids, activity of CRH, vasopressin or monoamine systems, or the levels of fos or jun in specific brain regions. These types of neuroendocrine factors underlie the plasticity in glucocorticoid action and are likely to shape many neural and behavioral responses to corticosteroids. Glucocorticoids appear to facilitate behavioral transitions following diurnal and stress-induced release by rapidly modifying the processing of sensory information. The studies mentioned above, in which corticosterone alters the behavioral responses of male mice to the odor of an estrous female (Kavaliers et al., 1997) or the responsiveness of Taricha hindbrain neurons to tactile stimuli associated with mating (Rose et al., 1993), support this idea. In both cases, corticosteroids may produce a shift in the dominant sensory modality, redirecting the animal toward threatening external stimuli. Studies done in rats (Saphier and Feldman, 1987) also find that corticosteroids elicit rapid changes in neurophysiological responses to sensory stimulation, so this may be a common mechanism by which glucocorticoids alter brain function during exposure to a stressor. Rapid behavioral transitions induced by glucocorticoids should be regarded as key components in the stress response. In the wild, prolonged exposure to most stressors - predators, blood loss or starvation, for example - would be lethal. Given this, the rapid behavioral or metabolic actions of glucocorticoids may have obvious fitness consequences for most animals, whereas the potentially maladaptive effects of prolonged glucocorticoid exposure may be relevant primarily in stress-related disorders in humans (McEwen, 1998a). We do not yet understand how a valuable, adaptive response becomes maladaptive nor do we understand the molecular mechanisms of rapid and delayed glucocorticoid action, but greater integration of biomedical and environmental/evolutionary approaches to glucocorticoid action will help us to reach the next level of understanding.},

abstract={Background: Approximately 39% of children aged <5 y in developing countries are growth retarded (stunted) and many have poor mental development and behavioral abnormalities. Animal research suggests that an altered stress response may contribute to the negative outcomes following undernutrition. Objective: We tested the hypothesis that stunted children have higher salivary cortisol concentrations and heart rates and altered behavior when compared with nonstunted children when social background was controlled for. Design: We compared 30 stunted with 24 nonstunted children, all of whom were 8-10 y old and lived in the same poor areas of Kingston, Jamaica. All subjects were participants in a prospective, longitudinal, case-control study of children who were stunted in early childhood. We administered a test session (including psychologic and physical stressors), measured baseline and response levels of salivary cortisol and heart rate, and observed behavior. Results: Compared with nonstunted children, stunted children had higher salivary cortisol concentrations (P = 0.007), had higher heart rates during the psychologic test session (P = 0.03), exhibited enhanced cardiovascular responsivity to a physical stressor (P = 0.04), vocalized less, were more inhibited, and were less attentive. After birth weight or social background and maternal and child intelligence quotients were controlled for, the differences in cortisol concentration and cardiovascular reactivity remained significant. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that consistent growth retardation since early childhood affects physiologic arousal, which, we speculate, may contribute to the poor cognitive functioning and immune responses of stunted children and the relation between adult short stature and increased cardiovascular risk.},

abstract={Here we summarize recent progress in the biology of leptin, concentrating on its central nervous system (CNS) actions. The product of the ob gene, leptin is a circulating hormone produced by white adipose tissue that has potent effects on feeding behavior, thermogenesis and neuroendocrine responses. Leptin regulates energy homeostasis, as its absence in rodents and humans causes severe obesity. We consider the physiological mechanisms underlying leptin action, along with several novel hypothalamic neuropeptides that affect food intake and body weight. The molecular causes of several other obesity syndromes are discussed to illuminate how the CNS regulates body weight. We describe neural circuits that are downstream of leptin receptors and propose a model linking populations of leptin-responsive neurons with effector neurons underlying leptin's endocrine, autonomic and behavioral effects.},

abstract={We present a model of the survival-maximizing foraging behavior of an animal searching in patches for hidden prey with a clumped distribution. We assume the forager to be Bayesian: it updates its statistical estimate of prey number in the current patch while foraging. When it arrives at the patch, it has an expectation of the patch's quality, which equals the average patch quality in the environment. While foraging, the forager uses its information about the time spent searching in the patch and how many prey has been caught during this time. It can estimate both the instantaneous intake rate and the potential intake rate during the rest of the patch visit. When prey distribution is clumped, potential intake rate may increase with time spent in the patch if prey is caught in the near future. Being optimal, a Bayesian forager should therefore base its patch-leaving decision on the estimated potential patch value, not on the instantaneous patch value. When patch value is measured in survival rate and mortality may occur either as starvation or predation, the patch should be abandoned when the forager estimates that its potential survival rate during the rest of the patch visit equals the long term survival rate in the environment. This means that the instantaneous intake rate, when the patch is left, is not constant but is an increasing function of searching time in the patch. Therefore, the giving-up densities of prey in the patches will also be higher the longer the search times. The giving-up densities are therefore expected to be an increasing, but humped, function of initial prey densities. These are properties of Bayesian foraging behavior not included in previous empirical studies and model tests.},

abstract={Infanticide, the killing of conspecific young, has been documented in numerous species of mammals and is considered an adaptive behavioral strategy to enhance the reproductive success of the perpetrator. The potential benefits of committing infanticide for males are obtaining nutritional gain and mating partners, and for females are acquiring access to resources such as food and nest sites. Some costs are associated with committing infanticide such as additional energy expenditure, risk of injury, and exposure to predation. However, the major costs associated with infanticide are borne by the victim female and the sire male in loss of fitness. In response to this selection, males and females use a variety of Counter-strategies to protect their young from infanticide. We summarize the published accounts and theory associated with infanticide and the occurrence of counter-strategies in a variety of mammalian groups in order to explain how infanticide may influence individual behavior as well as the social systems of mammals. We focus on the behavioral strategies used, primarily by females, to deter major losses in reproductive success. These strategies include aggression, female choice of dominant males, and promiscuity to confuse paternity as defense against males, and territoriality, association with kin; reproductive suppression, and reproductive synchrony as defenses against females. Male counter-strategies are less well known, but intrasexual territoriality may in part function as defense against infanticide. The costs associated with the different male and female counter-strategies are likely to vary, but may include increased energy expenditure, exposure to predators and injury for both sexes, as well as increased competition for resources, limited mate choice, and postponed reproduction for females. We propose that the occurrence of infanticide does not only have the potential to affect the behavior of individuals (e.g. aggression, spacing and mate choice), but may also have consequences for the shaping of mammalian mating systems.},

abstract={An increased number of visits and time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze by malnourished rats has been used as indicative of lower anxiety or higher impulsiveness. In order to study how this behavior profile responds to an anxiogenic procedure (short-term social isolation), control (16% protein) and malnourished (6% protein) rats were socially isolated prior to the test in the maze. Litters (dam plus 6 male and 2 female pups) were fed the diets from birth to 49 days of age. From 50 days on, all rats were fed a lab chow diet. Social isolation consists in removing the rats from the group and placing them in individual cages for 2 h before the test. During the test each rat was individually placed on the center of the maze and allowed to explore for 5 min. The results showed higher open arms exploration and lower attempts to enter open arms by the malnourished rats than by the controls. Social isolation decreased open arm exploration and increased time spent on the central platform in control animals, but had no effect on the malnourished rats. The results reinforce the lower anxiety or higher impulsiveness of malnourished rats, as well as the anxiogenic effect of social isolation in control rats. However, the malnourished rats were unresponsive to the anxiogenic effects of social isolation, indicating that protein deficiency early in life not only induces lower anxiety or higher impulsiveness in the maze, but also changes the behavior of these animals in response to another environmentally-induced procedure of anxiety (social isolation).},

A fitness measure which explicitly includes risk of advective loss is presented. The authors show that as horizontal current speeds and vertical shear increase, the behavioral strategies that maximize fitness of zooplankton possessing different life history strategies are affected. For a Calanus finmarchicus-type life history, fitness is maximized by did vertical migrations when advection risk in surface waters is low and by spending less time in the surface layers as flow rate increases. For a Paracalanus parvus-type life history, vertical migration is postulated to occur as advective loss increases. The geographic length scale of the habitat of residence also affects the optimal mode of habitat selection. In the Calanus case an abrupt change in the optimal vertical migration pattern is postulated as a function of length scale of habitat and rate of advection.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: Results from a recent series of surveys from 9 states and the District of Columbia by the Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project (CCHIP) provide an estimate that 4 million American children experience prolonged periodic food insufficiency and hunger each year, 8% of the children under the age of 12 in this country. The same studies show that an additional 10 million children are at risk for hunger. The current study examined the relationship between hunger as defined by the CCHIP measure (food insufficiency attributable to constrained resources) and variables reflecting the psychosocial functioning of low-income, school-aged children. METHODS: The study group included 328 parents and children from a CCHIP study of families with at least 1 child under the age of 12 years living in the city of Pittsburgh and the surrounding Allegheny County. A two-stage area probability sampling design with standard cluster techniques was used. All parents whose child was between the ages of 6 and 12 years at the time of interview were asked to complete a Pediatric Symptom Checklist, a brief parent-report questionnaire that assesses children's emotional and behavioral symptoms. Hunger status was defined by parent responses to the standard 8 food-insufficiency questions from the CCHIP survey that are used to classify households and children as "hungry," "at-risk for hunger," or "not hungry." RESULTS: In an area probability sample of low-income families, those defined as hungry on the CCHIP measure were significantly more likely to have clinical levels of psychosocial dysfunction on the Pediatric Symptom Checklist than children defined as at-risk for hunger or not hungry. Analysis of individual items and factor scores on the Pediatric Symptom Checklist showed that virtually all behavioral, emotional, and academic problems were more prevalent in hungry children, but that aggression and anxiety had the strongest degree of association with experiences of hunger. CONCLUSION: Children from families that report multiple experiences of food insufficiency and hunger are more likely to show behavioral, emotional, and academic problems on a standardized measure of psychosocial dysfunction than children from the same low-income communities whose families do not report experiences of hunger. Although causality cannot be determined from a cross-sectional design, the strength of these findings suggests the importance of greater awareness on the part of health care providers and public health officials of the role of food insufficiency and hunger in the lives of poor children.},

abstract={Avian long-distance migration involves the storage and expenditure of very large fuel loads. Birds may double in weight before take-off on flights of many 1000 kin, and they may lose half their body mass over the subsequent few days that such trips take. Recent studies indicate that in addition to the storage and depletion of fat, the muscles and belly organs also undergo considerable changes in size in the course of such migrations. Such intraindividual and repeatedly reversed changes in stores and organ sizes represent a class of phenotypic plasticity called 'phenotypic flexibility'. Using preliminary comparative data for different populations of Bar-tailed Godwits Limosa lapponica, and several other shorebird species adding variation to the migration strategies sampled (Golden Plover Pluvialis apricaria, Ruff Philomachus pugnax, Red Knot Calidris canutus and Bristle-thighed Curlew Numenius tahitiensis), the thesis is developed that the size of the organs carried during take-off represent evolutionary compromises between their functions during the storage, flight and post-arrival phases of migration. In all cases fat-free tissue along with fat is deposited during fuel storage, but the proportions vary a great deal between similarly sized species. Just before departure on long-distance flights, exercise organs (pectoral muscle and heart) tend to show hypertrophy and nutritional organs (stomach, intestine and liver) tend to show atrophy. Reductions in nutritional organs appear most pronounced in (sub-) species that are about to overtly barren oceans with few or no opportunities for emergency landings. Migrant birds seem to show a great deal of adaptive flexibility, and the study of this flexibility may shed light on (presently unknown) physiological mechanisms as well as on correlated ecological constraints on bird migration.},

abstract={Objective. Amid growing consumer demand and professional society recommendations for more information on early childhood development, current practices of pediatricians in regard to children's development remain largely unknown. We investigate whether there are differences in provider practices and satisfaction with regard to children's development (based on length of time in practice). Design. A self-reported survey was conducted of physicians at 30 pediatric practices participating in the Healthy Steps for Young Children Program. Healthy Steps is a national program to enhance the developmental potential of young children. Comparisons were made among physicians categorized as in training (n = 88), recently in practice (completing residency from 1984 to 1996, n = 69), or more experienced (completing residency prior to 1984, n = 52). Principal Findings. Relative to those recently in practice and in training, more experienced pediatricians spend less time in well-baby visits in the first 2 months of life. One-third of physicians conduct family risk assessments, half complete routine developmental screening, and over half do safety risk assessments in the first 2 months of life. There were few differences by provider experience in the topics covered under anticipatory guidance for new parents. Nearly all discussed infant car seats, sleep position, feeding practices, and temperament, but less than half routinely discussed domestic violence, and between half and three-quarters discussed infant bathing, maternal depression, and appropriate discipline practices. While all three groups of physicians were satisfied with the amount of time to discuss growth and development and parenting issues, more experienced physicians were more satisfied with their own and their staff's abilities to meet new parents' needs on these issues. Factors that over one-third of physicians reported affected their ability to deliver the best-quality care were shortage of support staff, limited referral sources, managed-care restrictions on referrals for special services, excessive paperwork, and lack of time for follow up, teaching parents, and answering questions. Physicians in recent practice were more likely than more experienced physicians to cite reimbursement concerns and limited staff to address the needs of parents regarding development. Conclusions. Most pediatricians do not conduct routine developmental screening in the first 2 months of life, and most discuss safety, as opposed to developmental and mental health, concerns with parents of newborns. Pediatricians with more experience believe they are better meeting new parents' needs and are less likely to cite systems and organizational factors as limiting their ability to deliver high-quality care.},

abstract={A novel electrosensory function is presented for the large, plankton-feeding, freshwater paddlefish, Polyodon spathula, along with a hypothesis which accounts for the distinctive, elongated rostrum of this unusual fish. Behavioural experiments conducted in the 'dark' (under infrared illumination), to eliminate vision, show that paddlefish efficiently capture planktonic prey to distances up to 80-90 mm. They make feeding strikes at dipole electrodes in response to weak low-frequency electrical currents. Fish also avoid metal obstacles placed in the water, again in the dark. Electrophysiological experiments confirm that the Lorenzinian ampullae of paddlefish are sensitive to weak, low-frequency electrical signals, and demonstrate unequivocally that they respond to the very small electrical signals generated by their natural zooplankton prey (Daphnia sp.). We propose that the rostrum constitutes the biological equivalent of an electrical antenna, enabling the fish to accurately detect and capture its planktonic food in turbid river environments where vision is severely limited. The electrical sensitivity of paddlefish to metallic substrates may interfere with their migrations through locks and dams.},

abstract={Variation in the intensity of schooling behavior in fishes suggests that the benefits of aggregation are balanced by certain costs. We examined the proximity of group members to each other in juvenile walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma, under different environmental conditions. Food availability, simulated by a gradient of six ration treatments, had a major influence on group cohesion, with increasing dispersion as food level decreased. Group cohesion also decreased at night relative to daytime levels. Small juveniles (xÃÑ = 53 mm TL) maintained on high rations were highly responsive to the potential threat of a predator, with groups becoming more cohesive and remaining so for up to an hour after the initial threat. A chronic threat (continual presence of predators) resulted in tighter group cohesion than an acute threat (single simulated attack). Small juveniles maintained on low rations were less responsive to predation threats and recovered quickly, supporting the hypothesis that hunger induces risk-taking behavior. Large juveniles (xÃÑ = 149 mm TL) did not change their degree of aggregation in response to either type of predation threat. An overall plasticity in the degree of cohesiveness among group members indicates that walleye pollock are capable of gradually modifying their schooling behavior according to the environmental context.},

abstract={Nutrition has significant effects on human health and the therapeutic role of dietetic regulation has long been recognized. Nutritional habits are affected by a spectrum of cultural, social and economic parameters. Dietary habits which are already set in childhood may predispose to chronic disease. Diet is a risk factor not only for cardiovascular diseases but also for some types of cancer. It is recommended that for prevention of these diseases, the caloric intake should include 12-15% from protein and 30-35% from fats of which no more than 7-8% should be from saturated fats. Changing of nutritional habits is not easy, and nutritional research focuses also on cultural and behavioral aspects of food consumption, including personality traits, especially the role of type A personality in the etiology and prevention of nutritional disease. The traditional mediterranean diet incorporates many elements which promote good health, including unsaturated fats, fibre, vitamins and minerals. Although the exact influence of the preventive role of the mediterranean diet is not fully understood, the antioxidant action of vegetable food appears to be important. Nutritional education can contribute to the decrease of conditions such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some forms of cancer. Such education is directed at the improvement of nutritional choices.},

abstract={Introducing of artificial nutrition in to the daily practice of clinical medicine significantly improved the results of treatment of many diseases in which malnutrition is one of the most important signs worsening the course of disease and results of treatment. During the 7th Congress of the Polish Society of Gastroenterology which was held in Poznan in September 1996 the Round Table Conference was organized, during which Polish experts in clinical nutrition presented their experience in the nutritional treatment of: inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic pancreatitis, severe acute pancreatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, cancer patients, including patients on chemo- and rtg therapy. Undernutrition is common in patients with IBD. When adequate oral nutrition cannot be taken, enteral chemically defined diets or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) allow repletion, however the duration of remission is unpredictable. According to own experience the response in the individual patient is variable. However, use of nutritional therapy represents major advance in the management of IBD. Patients with chronic pancreatitis are chronically malnourished, many have a history of alcoholism, drug addiction and associated personality disorders. To reduce the postoperative complications often seen in those patients we prepare the patient by means of parenteral, or enteral nutrition with the tip of the feeding tube below ligament of Treitz, for up to 12 days before the operation. After operation TPN is continued or started until there is a clinical evidence of normal GI function. Most patients with acute pancreatitis do not require nutritional support. Symptoms will usually subside over a period of 5 to 8 days, allowing resumption of oral intake of nutrients. If not, TPN should be introduced to improve depleted nutritional status and keep the GI tract and the exocrine pancreas in the state of rest. Although there is general agreement that TPN should be instituted in patients with severe acute pancreatitis, the administration of lipids in these patients is still controversial. Our experience indicates that provision of lipid - associated TPN to patients with severe acute pancreatitis can be done safely, is well tolerated, improves nutritional status and significantly reduces morbidity and mortality. It has long been known that patients with liver disease usually have varying degrees of malnutrition which, in turn, favors the progress of the disease. In advanced liver disease nutritional management via the parenteral or enteral route becomes essential because an adequate oral intake is not possible. Due to disturbed amino-acid metabolism solutions enriched with branched-chain amino-acids were introduced by Fischer and associates in 1976. In advanced liver disease hepatic encephalopathy often develops with extremely poor prognosis. Specific chemically defined enteral diets or parenteral solutions with hypertonic glucose are given providing 80 g/day of protein and improving mental and nutritional status. Cachexia is particularly common in patients with cancers of the esophagus and stomach. About 50% of these patients will have lost 10-15% of body weight due to a combination of anorexia and the increased metabolic demand of the growing tumor. The magnitude of the nutritional deficit makes it obvious that a few days of nutritional replenishment cannot return the patient to an anabolic state. On the other hand, TPN in the majority of responding patients brought improvement in nutritional status after 14 days of intensive therapy. Delay of surgery for two weeks (during the preparation for surgery) will not significantly increase the risk of tumor spread but will reduce the frequency of complications.},

abstract={Data are accumulating that insulin acting in the central nervous system is a physiological regulator of food intake and body weight, presumably via its effect in the hypothalamus. The present study investigated whether infusion of a small dose of insulin into two major hypothalamic insulin- binding areas also has an effect on diet selection and behavior. At the beginning of the dark period, rats received local bilateral infusions of 4 ŒºU of insulin or vehicle during 34 min into the arcuate (ARC) or paraventricular (PVN) nucleus of the hypothalamus. Consumption of carbohydrate (C)-, protein (P)-, and fat (F)-enriched food and time spent on certain behaviors (drinking, resting, grooming, rearing, exploring/sniffing) were assessed during the first nocturnal hour. In addition, 21-h diet selection was assessed. The percentage contribution of macronutrients (C/P/F) to total energy content of the C-, P-, and F-enriched diets was 71.9/17.2/10.9, 45.8/43.4/10.8, and 47.1/17.5/35.4, respectively. During the first hour, infusion of insulin into the PVN increased grooming behavior compared to infusion of the vehicle. Although infusion of insulin had no effect on diet selection during the first hour, insulin infused in the ARC caused a reduction in F-enriched food consumption and total intake of F (as a macronutrient) over the 21-h period without altering total food intake. Infusion of a higher dose of insulin (10 ŒºU) into the third ventricle had no effect on any of the assessed parameters. The data are explained to indicate that insulin (being an indicator of a positive energy balance) adjusts body weight homeostasis by modulating the preference for fat, at least at the level of the ARC, but not at the PVN.},

abstract={More than 250 studies, covering 29 Northern and five Southern Hemisphere countries, have been published on the birth seasonality of individuals who develop schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder. Despite methodological problems, the studies are remarkably consistent in showing a 5-8% winter- spring excess of births for both schizophrenia and mania/bipolar disorder. This seasonal birth excess is also found in schizoaffective disorder (December-March), major depression (March-May) and autism (March) but not in other psychiatric conditions with the possible exceptions of eating disorders and antisocial personality disorder. The seasonal birth pattern also may shift over time. Attempts to correlate the seasonal birth excess with specific features of schizophrenia suggest that winter-spring births are probably related to urban births and to a negative family history. Possible correlations include lesser seventy of illness and neurophysiological measures. There appears to be no correlation with gender, social class, race, measurable pregnancy and birth complications, clinical subtypes, or neurological, neuropsychological or neuroimaging measures. Virtually no correlation studies have been done for bipolar disorder. Regarding the cause of the birth seasonality, statistical artifact and parental procreational habits are unlikely explanations. Seasonal effects of genes, subtle pregnancy and birth complications, light and internal chemistry, toxins, nutrition, temperature weather, and infectious agents or a combination of these are all viable possibilities.},

abstract={Objective: The objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of food cravings in women with a history of anorexia nervosa. Method: One hundred one control women selected at random and 64 women with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa 10 to 14 years earlier (cases) completed the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies, a food craving questionnaire, the Temperament and Character Inventory and the Three- Factor Eating Questionnaire. Results: A similar proportion of cases and controls reported food cravings. A greater proportion of cases reported strong cravings with two or more features of intensity (p = .02). Cravings in the cases were more likely to be characterized by difficulty resisting the craved food (p = .0008), anxiety when the craved food was unavailable (p = .002), and a high frequency of occurrence (p = .001). The cases who craved were significantly more likely to have had lifetime BN (p = .02). Conclusion: A similar prevalence of food craving in cases as in controls suggests that successful control of food intake and/or denial of hunger overrides dietary restriction as a precondition for craving in anorexia nervosa. A dysfunction in the serotonergic system, the provision of intermittent reinforcement by binge episodes, and/or frustration due to unsuccessful attempts at dietary restraint may mediate the association of cravings with the presence of lifetime bulimia.},

abstract={Undernutrition, anorexia and functional trophic deficiency generate a vicious circle that must be fully understood for the elderly subject to be encouraged to resume appropriate eating. It is frequently impossible to distinguish between deep impairment of the gastrointestinal mucosa and/or a simple defect in the humoral control of digestion without tissue impairment. No precise tools are available to distinguish between anorexia related to hypothalamic deregulation of the hunger/satiety control centers and that related to behavioral response, a state of anxiety-depression, masked to a greater or lesser extent. It is also difficult to predict the response to controlled refeeding: weight gain and laboratory criteria (albumin, even prealbumin, etc.) often show a delayed response. With a view to resolving the above preoccupations, the authors set up a nutritional evaluation unit in the day hospital. The originality of the approach resides in a test meal. This little invasive investigation enables evaluation of. 1) digestive capacity by the change in the pancreolauryl test (PLT) and 2) the plasma kinetics of CCK by bioassay (investigation of anorexia). After comparison with the standard nutritional and dietetic evaluation, the function tests based on the test- meal enable proposal of more appropriate nutritional management. It is thus possible to conduct a strategy on the basis of objective decision-making criteria. The qualitative nature of supplementation may be better oriented. The data obtained by dynamic exploration would also seem to reduce the time to the institution of tube-feeding or gastrostomy. The method is little invasive, easy to implement, and well accepted and understood by the elderly subject.},

abstract={It is well recognised that although nutritionally breast milk is the optimal food for babies, there are a number of caveats to this, based on the consequences of the modern lifestyle. Here we have considered ways in which the young breast fed child may be exposed to various environmental and medical contaminants which might cause adverse reactions and to which he/she may not otherwise be exposed. These substances are divided into four different areas: (i) medication taken by the mother; (ii) exposure to possibly addictive drugs taken by the mother; (iii) exposure to pollutants mainly from the maternal diet or as the result of her occupation; (iv) viruses. The infant who consumes breast milk may be exposed to a variety of chemicals which may have untoward effects on his/her immediate health and temperament and future development. Potentially hazardous substances ingested by the breast fed infant include medicaments (or their metabolites) that may have been ingested by the mother, potentially addictive common neurotoxicants such as nicotine, caffeine and alcohol, illicit drugs such as heroin and cocaine, and pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). There is a paucity of good information on which to base reliable estimates of the harm that this may cause the child. Although breast feeding is known to protect against bacterial infection, a number of viruses are excreted in the breast milk which may infect the child asymptomatically (e.g. cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus) and which are not known to be harmful, as well as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) excretion which, in contrast, does appear to increase the risk of the child becoming infected. Balancing the risk of infection to the child born to an HIV infected mother, results in the proposition that known HIV positive women in developing countries (where the risk of gastrointestinal infection is high) should continue to breast feed but those in the developed world (where the risk of gastrointestinal infection is lower) are better advised to bottle feed.},

abstract={The nucleus accumbens, a site within the ventral striatum, is best known for its prominent role in mediating the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse such as cocaine, alcohol, and nicotine. Indeed, it is generally believed that this structure subserves motivated behaviors, such as feeding, drinking, sexual behavior, and exploratory locomotion, which are elicited by natural rewards or incentive stimuli. A basic rule of positive reinforcement is that motor responses will increase in magnitude and vigor if followed by a rewarding event. It is likely, therefore, that the nucleus accumbens may serve as a substrate for reinforcement learning. However, there is surprisingly little information concerning the neural mechanisms by which appetitive responses are learned. In the present study, we report that treatment of the nucleus accumbens core with the selective competitive N- methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP- 5; 5 nmol/0.5 Œºl bilaterally) impairs response-reinforcement learning in the acquisition of a simple leverpress task to obtain food. Once the rats learned the task, AP-5 had no effect, demonstrating the requirement of NMDA receptor- dependent plasticity in the early stages of learning. Infusion of AP-5 into the accumbens shell produced a much smaller impairment of learning. Additional experiments showed that AP-5 core-treated rats had normal feeding and locomotor responses and were capable of acquiring stimulus-reward associations. We hypothesize that stimulation of NMDA receptors within the accumbens core is a key process through which motor responses become established in response to reinforcing stimuli. Further, this mechanism, may also play a critical role in the motivational and addictive properties of drugs of abuse.},

abstract={This is the burning issue of the hour. In attempting to resolve it within the context of advanced age, it is important to clarify the meaning of the words involved: - Independence and autonomy are far from being synonyms. Independence refers to the ability to perform physical activities of daily living (bathing, eating, preparing meals, shopping, money management), whereas the second word, autonomy, refers more to the ability to make decisions, to reason, to express an appropriate opinion in a given situation. - Hazard and inevitability are totally at variance. Hazard implies the likelihood of occurrence of an event harmful to health, or to the length or quality of life. Hazard is more or less predictable, whereas inevitability is the expression of a supernatural power controlling all events. To find our whether 'dependency is a hazard or an inevitability', it is necessary to conduct a historical review of the extension in human longevity and in particular of the current 'weight' of aging both on individuals and on society at large. In Geneva, the proportion of the over 65-year-olds grew from 5.1 percent in 1880 to 13.4 percent in 1990. During that time, the gain in life expectancy was 52.4 percent for Geneva males of 80 years of age and 93 percent for Geneva females of the same age. This drastic change in age groups was coupled with a noteworthy change in household sizes. In 1860, the number of persons per household was 4.5. In 1990, it was down to 2.2. Conversely, the number of inmates in Geneva's medico-social institutions went up from 649 to 1168 between 1982 and 1992. In this socio-economic and cultural perspective, the concept of 'globality of the individual' throughout his lifetime explains: - age-related physiological changes; - the long-term repercussion of physical, professional or leisure activities; - the consequences of the accumulation of such varied risk factors as overweight or its opposite, malnutrition, tobacco or stress. - Such frailty caused by aging is an ideal breeding ground for disease. - For now, what matters most is the functional consequence of disease. Is the disease acute or chronic? Two out of three deaths result from a chronic disease, which caused loss of function by organs (impairment), loss of function by the subject himself (disability) or loss of function by the individual in society (social handicap or disadvantage). Raising the question 'Dependency: a hazard or an inevitability?' boils down to asking oneself about the place of disease in our society and its determinants, and about all aspects of medicine and especially of prevention. When detected, a susceptibility brings into play primary prevention, aimed at averting the onset of the disease. After a disease has set in, measures to prevent recurrence, or secondary prevention, are required. Lastly, prevention of dependency and of loss of autonomy is part of tertiary prevention. Except for violent traumatic accidents, the formulation of the above concepts proves that dependency is essentially 'a hazard'. Therefore, let us anticipate!.},

abstract={A series of experiments examined behavioural and autonomic aspects of stress and anxiety in rats subjected to either: (1) electrolytic lesions of the infralimbic cortex subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex; (2) electrolytic lesions of the prelimbic cortex subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex; (3) sham lesions of infralimbic or prelimbic cortex (sham control); or (4) no lesions (control). In exploration-based models of anxiety, infralimbic- or prelimbic-lesioned rats spent less time in the centre of an open field and less time on the exposed arms of an elevated plus maze, indicating increased anxiety. Locomotor activity was normal in the lesioned rats when tested in a non-stressful enclosed environment. In a step- down passive avoidance task, infralimbic-lesioned rats stepped down more quickly than controls onto a grid floor where they had been shocked 24 h previously. Prelimbic-lesioned rats were no different to controls on this test, although they showed greater latencies to step down onto the grid floor during conditioning. In a final experiment, indirect calorimetry was used to show that both infralimbic- and prelimbic-lesioned rats have essentially normal alterations in oxygen consumption and energy substrate utilisation when exposed to brief footshock. Thus, the impaired passive avoidance in infralimbic-lesioned rats cannot be attributed to decreased nociception. It is concluded that both the prelimbic and infralimbic regions play a role in anxiety, and that this role may be subtly differentiated. In particular, the infralimbic cortex may have a specific role in mediating the inhibition of behaviours associated with aversive outcomes.},

abstract={Conditioned blocking (CB) measures the transient suppression of learning that a new stimulus, added during learning, has the same consequences as the conditioned stimulus already present. Normal CB increases between the age of 8 and 20 years (Oades, R.D., Roepcke, B. and Schepker, R., A test of conditioned blocking and its development in childhood and adolescence: relationship to personality and monoamine metabolism, Dev. Neuropsychol., 12 (1996) 207-230). In the present study CB development is compared between healthy children (CN), children with attention deficit (ADHD) and those with complex tics or Tourette's syndrome (TS) with mean ages of 10-11 years. All children needed fewer learning trials with increasing age: the ADHD group showed a slight impairment. Only controls improved CB with increasing age. A trend for worse CB in the TS than the other groups was significant for those over 11 years. While ADHD children over 11 years showed less CB than controls, younger ADHD children showed more. A correlational analysis of the status of monoamine metabolism in 24 h urine samples showed a positive relationship for CB with dopamine metabolism in controls and TS children, but a negative relationship in ADHD children. In contrast, increases of serotonin metabolism were negatively related to CB in TS but positively in ADHD patients. In conclusion, when selective information processing abilities reflected by CB start to develop at puberty-onset, there is a relative worsening in ADHD patients. But TS patients show an impairment independent of age. Changes in the balance between dopamine and serotonin systems may contribute to normal and abnormal cognitive development.},

abstract={Two opposing hypotheses concerning determinants of mangabey (Cercocebus albigena) ranging patterns have been advocated. One hypothesis suggests that ranging patterns of mangabeys are largely a response to fruit availability, while the other hypothesis advocates that concerns of fruit availability are supplemented or overridden by concerns of fecal contamination and that the risk of parasite infection, especially during dry weather, determines their pattern of range use. In this 9 month study of mangabeys in the Kanyawara study area of Kibale National Park, mangabeys moved longer distances during the wet season than during the dry season. There were no seasonal differences in group spread, number of 50 by 50 m quadrats used, or in quadrat overlap between sequential sample periods. Intensity of quadrat use was closely related to the number of fruiting trees/lianas in the quadrats, irrespective of season. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that fruit availability is a main factor influencing mangabey ranging patterns. The results are not consistent with the hypothesis that mangabey ranging patterns largely reflect differential seasonal risk of parasite infection.},

abstract={This study examined two groups of people who were pursuing treatment for obesity: either medical intervention (a hospital group; N = 20) or support for dietary restriction (a community group; N = 18). This study addressed four questions: (1) Were there differences between the two groups in terms of their psychological distress (as measured by the Symptom Checklist)? (2) Does binge eating moderate psychological distress? (3) Do feelings of ineffectiveness moderate psychological distress? and (4) Which variables best accounted for group membership (i.e., type of treatment sought)? Results suggested that the hospital group was significantly more distressed than the community group. However, there were no differences between the two groups with respect to binge eating or feelings of ineffectiveness. These findings suggest that it is the effects of morbid obesity that are most likely to moderate psychological distress.},

abstract={The anxiogenic action of caffeine (10, 25 and 50 mg/kg, i.p.) was investigated in rats and compared with that of yohimbine (2 mg/kg, i.p.). The experimental methods used were the open-field, elevated plus-maze, social interaction and novelty-suppressed feeding latency tests. Caffeine produced a dose-related profile of behavioural changes, which were qualitatively similar to those induced by yohimbine and which indicate an anxiogenic activity in rodents. Thus, both the drugs reduced ambulation and rears, and increased immobility and defaecation in the open-field test. They decreased the number of entries and time spent on the open arms of the elevated-plus maze, reduced social interaction in paired rats and increased the feeding latency in an unfamiliar environment in 48-h food-deprived rats. Lorazepam, a well known benzodiazepine anxiolytic agent, attenuated the anxiogenic effects of caffeine and yohimbine. Subchronic administration of caffeine (50 mg/kg, i.p.) for 21 days, in different groups of animals, induced a significant degree of tolerance in the elevated plus-maze test, which was statistically significant after 14 and 21 days' treatment. Yohimbine, however, did not induce similar tolerance. When caffeine (50 mg/kg, i.p.) was withdrawn after 21 days' administration, to a separate group of rats, significant withdrawal anxiety was observed 48 h later as noted in the elevated plus-maze test. The investigations support clinical evidence of caffeine-induced anxiety, tolerance to anxiety on continued use, and withdrawal anxiety in chronic caffeine-containing beverage users.},

abstract={Objective: We examined the onset of binge eating and dieting in 108 women with bulimia nervosa to determine whether (1) dieting always preceded binge eating; (2) dieting always preceded the onset of bulimia nervosa; and (3) individuals who manifested early initial binge eating differed from those whose earliest manifestation of disordered eating behavior was dieting in terms of lifetime psychopathology and temperament. Method: One hundred eight women were assessed at entry to a randomized clinical trial of cognitive- behavioral therapy for bulimia nervosa using structured diagnostic methodology. Retrospective recall of the onset of disordered eating behavior was used to categorize individuals as initial binge eaters or initial dieters. We then compared lifetime psychopathology and temperament across the two groups. Results: Seventeen percent of women reported early binge eating prior to any dieting behavior. The mean age of onset of binging in this group was approximately 10 years. Neither the clinical picture of bulimia nervosa nor lifetime psychopathology differed between initial binge eaters and initial dieters. Individuals with early binge eating endorsed higher novelty seeking and lower harm avoidance. Conclusion: In a minority of women with bulimia nervosa, binge eating precedes dieting. These women display markedly higher novelty seeking and lower harm avoidance. Possible links between the dopamine system, novelty seeking, and appetitive behavior are discussed.},

abstract={In order to study the effects of the protein-calorie malnutrition on the behavior of rats submitted to the elevated plus-maze, an ethopharmacological analysis was used. Litters (dam plus 6 male pups) were fed ad lib (control) or were fed 50% of the amount of diet consumed by the control group (malnourished) from birth to 49 days of age. From Day 50 on, all rats were fed ad lib. At 70 days of age, the animals were pharmacologically treated (vehicle or diazepam, 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg) and were placed, 30 min later, in the center of the elevated plus-maze for a 5-min session. During this session, 11 behaviors believed to indicate anxiety or exploration were measured. The results showed that protein-calorie malnutrition results in increased exploration of the open arms of the maze, higher latency of first ann entry, and lower closed-arm returns, indicating lower anxiety or higher impulsiveness. In addition, the protein-calorie-malnourished rats were hyporeactive to the anxiolytic effects of diazepam, indicating possible alterations in the GABA-benzodiazepine system as result of the malnutrition procedure.},

abstract={Individual foraging specializations are an important source of intraspecific variability in feeding strategies, but little is known about what ecological factors affect their intensity or development. We evaluated stomach contents in marked individual largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and tested the hypothesis that diet specialization is most pronounced during periods with high conspecific densities. We collected diet data over 10 years from an unexploited population of largemouth bass that displayed a greater than threefold variation in density. Although diet composition of the aggregate bass population did not change during the study, bass body condition was inversely correlated with population size. Individual marked bass exhibited high diet consistency (diet overlap between successive captures) during years with high population densities. Diet overlap between randomly assigned pairs of bass was not correlated with population size. We did not detect the expected positive relationship between diet breadth and population size. Our analyses demonstrate that population responses to density changes may represent the sum of many unique individual foraging responses and would be obscured by pooled sampling programs. Behavioral flexibility of individuals may contribute to the ability of largemouth bass to functions as a keystone predator in many aquatic communities.},

abstract={Crucian carp Carassius carassius show great phenotypic plasticity in individual morphology and physiology, and strong variation in population density in different fish communities. Small fish with shallow bodies and large heads are typical in overcrowded monospecific fish communities in small ponds, whereas deep-bodied, large fish are found in larger, multispecies lakes. Crucian carp are especially vulnerable to predation by piscivorous fish and their greater relative body depth in multispecies fish communities has been proposed to be an induced defence against size-limited predation, and hence to be an adaptive feature. Data are presented here on the two divergent body forms in field populations in eastern Finland, together with results of laboratory experiments on predator effects on morphology and physiology (growth, respiration, heart rate). The deep body can be achieved in a few months by introducing a low population density of shallow-bodied fish into a food-rich environment with not piscivores. In the laboratory, both the presence of piscivores (chemical cues) and enhanced food availability increased the relative depth of crucian carp, but only to a modest extent when compared to natural variation. In is concluded that the deep-body form of crucian carp in the low density populations of multispecies fish communities is the normal condition. Reproduction in monospecific ponds results in high intraspecific competition, low growth rate and a stunted morphology. According to pilot tests, the mechanism behind the predator effect in the laboratory might be a behavioural reaction to chemical cues (alarm substances/predator odour) causing changes in energy allocation: predator-exposed crucian carp adopt a 'hiding' mode with decreased activity (less swimming, lower respiration and heart rate) and with higher overall growth. Whether, and to what extent, this predator-induced mechanism works in nature is unclear.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to examine the effects of several aspects of transportation (movement to a novel environment, reduced space allowance and deprivation of food and water) of the behavioural and physiological responses of red deer. In two experiments conducted in winter and summer, two groups of five adult male castrated red deer (housed at a space allowance of 2.7 m2 per deer) were subjected to either 3- or 6-h treatment periods (without food and water) at a reduced space allowance (0.9 m2 per deer). The effect of ambient temperature (9¬∞C, 13¬∞C and 20¬∞C) was also examined in the winter experiment. In both experiments, each of the two groups was subjected to one treatment combination per week, in a random order. The deer lost live weight during treatment periods, although the rate of loss decreased with time. In Experiment 1, there was a significantly larger increase in sodium concentration at the end of 6-h treatments than after 3-h treatments (1.73 versus 0.30 mmol l-1, P &lt; 0.05), although other measures of dehydration were not affected by either the length of treatment period or the ambient temperature. Neither plasma NEFA concentration nor plasma cortisol concentration were significantly affected by treatment periods. Proportionately more time was spend standing and moving during treatment periods, while less time was spent lying and grooming (all P &lt; 0.05). Behavioural changes during treatment periods were short-lived, as all activities had returned to (or approached) baseline levels by 3 h after the treatment periods. In Experiment 1, a greater proportion of time was spent moving at the two higher temperatures, and there was more pen-directed activity during longer treatment periods (P &lt; 0.05). There were only minor between-experiment differences, suggesting that seasonality was not a major influence on the animals' responses. It is concluded that any behavioural and physiological changes were short-lived, and that the welfare of deer was not significantly compromised by the aspects of transport investigated in the present study.},

abstract={The long-term consequences of a neonatal exposure to diazepam (DZP) on behavioral abilities and local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (LCMRglc) in selected brain regions involved in the control of memory and anxiety were studied in adult rats. Rat pups received a daily subcutaneous injection of 10 mg/kg DZP or of the dissolution vehicle from postnatal day (P) 2 to 21. Learning and memory were tested in P60-P70 rats on 5 consecutive days in a T maze and an eight arm maze while anxiety and reaction to novelty were tested in a 2 compartment box with a 2 step staircase on one side. Social behavior was evaluated in a condition of restricted access to food. LCMRglcs were measured at P60 by the quantitative autoradiographic [14C]deoxyglucose method. In the T maze, when performed without delay between the 2 trials, the rate of alternation was significantly lower in DZP than in vehicle-exposed rats on the first 2 days of testing and similar in both groups on days 3-5. In the procedure with a 30 s intertrial delay, the rate of alternation was similar in DZP and vehicle-treated rats on all days of testing. In the eight arm maze, DZP-treated rats were more active, i.e. entering more arms per min than control animals. The number of arms entered before the first error was lower on day 1 and higher on day 3 in DZP compared to vehicle-exposed rats. In the 2 compartment box, DZP-treated rats crossed more often the lower step of the staircase and spent more time than controls on the 2 steps of the staircase while control rats made more rearings than DZP-exposed rats in the well protected corner of the box. LCMRglcs were decreased by early DZP exposure in several cortical regions, mammillary body, septum and dorsomedian caudate nucleus. In conclusion, an early chronic DZP treatment induces an increase in activity, only a delay but no impairment in learning and leads to a decrease in the level of anxiety and emotionality leading to an active response to novelty. These quite subtle behavioral changes are accompanied by discrete metabolic changes and probably reflect the state of hyperactivity/hyperarousal of these animals which could result from a change in the distribution, the sensitivity and/or function of GABA-BZD receptors.},

Gray treefrog (Hyla chrysoscelis) tadpoles reared with predatory dragonfly (Aeshna umbrosa) larvae differ in shape and color from tadpoles reared in the absence of dragonflies. By exposing tadpoles to tail damage and the non-lethal presence of starved and fed dragonflies, we determined that these phenotypic differences are induced by non-contact cues present when dragonflies prey on Hyla. The induced changes in shape are in the direction that tends to increase swimming speed: thus, the induced morphology may help tadpoles evade predators. Altering morphology in response to predators is likely to influence interactions with other species in the community as well.},

Exploratory factor analysis indicated that nutritional health-seeking behavior items formed two factors: avoid (i.e., avoiding unhealthy nutritional behavior) and seek (i.e., attempting or seeking healthy nutritional behavior). Multiple regression analysis revealed that risk factors for poor nutritional health- seeking behaviors in older adults include advanced age, low economic resources, and male gender.

abstract={We tested the hypothesis that food supplementation for the generalist arthropod predator Tenodera sinensis would alleviate starvation and reduce intraguild predation. Two field experiments showed that mantids had higher growth rates and lower dispersal in the presence of supplemental prey. However, estimated mortality was greater in food-addition plots, so that numbers of mantid nymphs remaining at the end of the experiments were not significantly different from those in control plots. When groups of mantids were raised in the laboratory, mortality declined with increased food, owing to decreased starvation. Cannibalism in these cohorts did not differ between food levels. Therefore, greater mortality at higher food levels probably was not caused by intraspecific interactions. Emigration of cursorial spiders large enough to prey on mantids decreased in the food-addition plots and may have increased intraguild predation on mantids. In any case, elevating prey level apparently does not predictably benefit food-limited generalist predators.},

abstract={The polychaete worm Serpula vermicularis (Serpulidae) filter feeds at the mouth of its calcareous tube, but retreats into the tube when startled by mechanical stimuli likely to be associated with predators. While in its tube, a worm is sate but cannot feed. Thus, hiding has a lost-opportunity cost. We show that this cost can be substantial, given that food in the natural habitat appears in pulses, and good feeding conditions may not last long or recur frequently. We expect that a worm's hiding time will be sensitive to the lost-opportunity cost, and we present data from a series of experiments that support this prediction. The worms seem able to track relatively short-term changes in food availability, and some evidence suggests that they assess food availability on a relative basis, comparing current feeding conditions to those recently experienced. Hiding and other types of cryptic behavior are common antipredator tactics, and animals may commonly adjust the durations of such behaviors to current benefits and costs (including lost opportunity), as they perceive them.},

abstract={Begging passerine chicks display brightly coloured mouths as they solicit food from their parents. Despite a range of hypotheses, the function of vivid nestling mouth colour remains unknown. Here I report that mouth colour functions as a signal of need in canary nestlings, in the days immediately following hatching. Changes in mouth colour accurately reflect a nestling's state of need: the more food deprived the chick, the more intensely coloured its mouth. In controlled experiments with two nestlings, parents were offered the opportunity to choose which nestling to feed. When the mouth colour of one offspring was artificially reddened using food colouring, parents gave it more food. These results demonstrate a novel function for nestling mouth colour and are consistent with recent models of the resolution of parent-offspring conflict.},

abstract={1. Trophic breadth may be correlated with behavioural and functional versatility or flexibility (Liem 1984), such that species with limited diets would be predicted to be less versatile or flexible in their feeding capabilities than would trophic generalists. The relationship was examined between the trophic breadth of a species and the degree to which muscle activity is influenced by prey type in two species of pufferfishes: Chilomycterus schoepfi, a specialist on hard-shelled prey, and Sphoeroides nephalus, a generalist predator. It was predicted that the specialist would show a decreased ability to alter its motor pattern in response to prey type and an increased amount of motor pattern variability when feeding on different prey. 2. Electromyographic recordings of five feeding muscles were made from five individuals per species feeding on four prey types that differed in their hardness and escape abilities. Muscle-activity duration, relative onset and integrated rectified area were analysed for prey capture and manipulation behaviours for each prey type. 3. Prey-type effects on mean motor-pattern variables for capture were limited to one of 14 variables in each species. Prey effects on buccal manipulation were not significant for any of the 14 variables for C. schoepfi, but S. nephalus exhibited prey effects for seven out of 14 variables. No differences in motor-pattern variation were found for the strike, but species differed significantly in overall motor-pattern variability during buccal manipulation; C. schoepfi, the dietary specialist, exhibited greater motor variability than S. nephalus, the dietary generalist. 4. The results therefore support a direct relationship between the trophic breadth of a species and its functional versatility for buccal manipulation. In contrast, prey capture was a relatively stereotyped behaviour for both species, as few prey-type effects were found.},

In Experiment 1, environmental neophobia was enhanced but food neophobia was diminished in isolation-reared rats compared to socially reared rats. However, in Experiment 2, when subjects were not handled extensively prior to testing, no differences in behavioural responses to environmental or food novelty in an open-field were observed between rearing groups. The difference between these experiments was hypothesized to be the result of ceiling effects produced by increased anxiety or arousal in experiment 2 in which the animals had not been extensively handled. In summary, in these experiments anticipatory responses to novelty were alterred by isolation-rearing but the behavioural expression of this increased sensitivity was determined by intrinsic aversive/rewarding or arousing qualities of novel environments and novel foods.},

abstract={Objective: This study further investigates the hypothesis that dieting is the precursor to the development of binge eating. Method: The temporal relationship of onset of binge eating and dieting is examined from retrospective self-reports collected at baseline from women participating in two bulimia nervosa (BN) treatment studies (N = 221). Twenty women were identified who reported binge eating prior to the onset of dieting ('binged first,' BF). For comparison, 20 similar age individuals reporting dieting onset preceding that of binge eating ('dieted first,' DF) were selected. Results: A subset of women (8.8%) seeking treatment for BN endorsed the development of binge eating prior to dieting onset. The BF pattern of BN development was associated with earlier age of onset of binge eating, later onset of purging, increased desired weight, and increased actual weight. Binge eating prior to dieting onset was also associated with improved response to group cognitive-behavioral treatment at 6-month follow-up. Conclusions: This study provides support for the hypothesis that dieting is a risk factor, but not necessarily a precursor, to the development of binge eating in BN. Implications for treatment and future research are discussed.},

abstract={In reflecting upon insecticides and their use, it is easy to dwell on their well-documented problems as environmental pollutants and nontarget toxicants. Yet very few chemical industries have been as responsive or as innovative as the agrochemical companies in providing society with new and novel compounds that have allowed us to produce and protect the high quality food and fiber necessary to feed and clothe an ever increasing human population. Given the effectiveness and wide-spread use of insecticides, it was naive not to have envisioned the environmental impacts that these chemicals have caused. Nevertheless, the impacts of insecticide use have resulted in a much more complete and rigorous understanding of the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of environmental contaminants, their environmental fate and degradative processes, and an increased insight on mechanisms leading to acquired drug tolerance and resistance. Such understanding would certainly not have been possible without the explicit structure-activity relationships provided by insecticidal chemicals. The availability of homologous series of insecticidal analogues, toxic and nontoxic insecticidal enantiomers, and radiolabeled insecticides have provided us with invaluable tools in the elucidation of how insecticides bind receptors and ultimately produce their toxic response. Pesticide science owes a debt of gratitude to the agrochemical industry for making these compounds readily available to environmental researchers and academic scientists alike. In this review, I examine the mode of action studies of three structurally dissimilar insecticides on the nervous system. These insecticides are DDT, a chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon that acts as a nerve toxin by modifying the kinetics of voltage-dependent ion channels associated with the neurolemma; deltamethrin, a synthetic pyrethrin analog that acts in a similar fashion as DDT; and azinphosmethyl, a phosphorodithioate organophosphate that acts as nerve toxin by competitively inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (Fig. 1). The activity of these insecticides are assessed using three functional assays: (i) the enhanced release of neurotransmitters from isolated presynaptic nerve terminals; (ii) the behavioral and mortality responses of the ciliate organism, Paramecium; and (iii) the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase associated with azinphosmethyl resistance in Colorado potato beetle. In each case, I summarize our findings in terms of the future benefit that they may provide.},

abstract={During the last decades, an increase is apparent in the use of analgesics for laboratory animals in situations where this was previously considered unnecessary. Mice with advanced tumours often show clear signs of discomfort which may be a result of chronic pain or a result of general ill-being. The syngeneic murine tumour model most frequently used in our experiments was used to investigate whether this discomfort can be reduced with an analgesic. Twenty DBA/2 mice bearing SL2 lymphoma were given 0.5 mg/kg buprenorphine (Temgesic¬Æ) in food gel twice daily, 20 tumour-bearing mice were given control food gel at the same times. Indicators of well-being were monitored daily. These included behavioural parameters such as exploration, grooming, and posture; food and water consumption and fur quality. All mice showed a clear increase of discomfort with time: explorative behaviours and grooming decreased, while sitting in hunched posture increased. Food and water consumption and fur quality also decreased. Major significant differences between the buprenorphine treated group and the control group were not apparent. In conclusion, we could not document a positive effect or buprenorphine on discomfort in mice as evaluated by our scoring system. It remains possible that pain itself was not the primary cause of the discomfort in mice bearing these tumours, or that the analgesic effect of buprenorphine was insufficient under these circumstances.},

abstract={Theoretical models for the evolution of inducible anti-predator defenses predict that there should be fitness costs associated with the defense, otherwise it should be permanent. Thus, in the absence of predators and with limited resources, defended individuals are expected to be outcompeted by individuals lacking the costly defense. Crucian carp, Carassius carassius, increase in body depth in response to chemical stimuli from piscivorous fish, and the deeper body constitutes a morphological defense against gape-limited piscivores. Here, we have performed a field experiment investigating effects of population density on the relative competitive performance of shallow-bodied and deep-bodied crucian carp. We assigned groups of six individually marked fish (the 'focal' individuals) of either morph into enclosures with either low or high crucian carp density, and monitored changes in body mass, length, and body depth of these fish for 4 mo. In addition, we determined sex, and final liver and gonadal mass, of all focal fish. At high population density, there was a reduction in food resources (zooplankters), which resulted in reduced gonad mass, reduced gonadosomatic indices, and reduced growth in fish of both morphs. Unexpectedly, the relative allocation to livers was higher at high density. There was no difference in body mass gain between morphs at the low density, whereas at the high density shallow-bodied fish gained twice as much body mass as deep-bodied fish. Hence, when predators were absent and food resources were limited, deep-bodied individuals suffered a substantial cost when competing with shallow-bodied conspecifics. This study verifies the theoretical prediction that an inducible defense results in fitness costs in the absence of predators. Further, as we found no measurable disadvantage of the deep-bodied morphology at high food availability but a strong disadvantage under intense competition for food, our results also demonstrate the importance of relating defense costs to levels of intraspecific competition.},

abstract={Trophic cascades are regarded as important signals for top-down control of food web dynamics. Although there is clear evidence supporting the existence of trophic cascades, the mechanisms driving this important dynamic are less clear. Trophic cascades could arise through direct population-level effects, in which predators prey on herbivores, thereby decreasing the abundance of herbivores that impact plant trophic levels. Trophic cascades could also arise through indirect behavioral-level effects, in which herbivore prey shift their foraging behavior in response to predation risk. Such behavioral shifts can result in reduced feeding time and increased starvation risk, again lowering the impact of herbivores on plants. We evaluated the relative importance of these two mechanisms, using field experiments in an old-field system composed of herbaceous plants, grasshopper herbivores, and spider predators. We created two treatments, Risk spiders that had their chelicerae glued, and Predation spiders that remained unmanipulated. We then systematically evaluated the impacts of these predator manipulations at behavioral, population, and food web scales in experimental mesocosms. At the behavioral level, grasshoppers did not distinguish between Risk spiders and Predation spiders. Grasshoppers exhibited significant shifts in feeding-time budget in the presence of spiders vs. when alone. At the grasshopper population level, Risk spider and Predation spider treatments caused the same level of grasshopper mortality, which was significantly higher than mortality in a control without spiders, indicating that the predation effects were compensatory to risk effects. At the food web level, Risk spider and Predation spider treatments decreased the impact grasshoppers had on grass biomass, supporting the existence of a trophic cascade. Moreover, Risk spider and Predation spider treatments produced statistically similar effects, again indicating that predation effects on trophic dynamics were compensatory to risk effects. We conclude that indirect effects resulting from antipredator behavior can produce trophic-level effects that are similar in form and strength to those generated by direct predation events.},

abstract={Caenorhabditis elegans uses a variety of attractive olfactory cues to detect food. We show here that the responses to olfactory cues are regulated in a dynamic way by behavioral context and the animal's previous experience. Prolonged exposure to an odorant leads to a decreased response to that odorant, a form of behavioral plasticity called olfactory adaptation. We show that starvation can increase the extent of olfactory adaptation to the odorant benzaldehyde; this effect of starvation persists for several hours after the animals have been returned to food. The effect of starvation is antagonized by exogenous serotonin, which induces many of the same behavioral responses in C. elegans as are induced by food. Starvation also inhibits recovery from adaptation to a different odorant, 2-methylpyrazine, thus enhancing olfactory memory. In addition to its effects on adaptation, starvation modulates olfactory discrimination in C. elegans; starved animals discriminate more classes of odorants than fed animals. Increased olfactory discrimination is also seen in the adaptation-defective mutant adp-1(ky20). These various forms of behavioral plasticity enhance the ability of starved animal to respond to novel, potentially informative odorants.},

abstract={A widely held idea regarding information processing in the brain is the cell-assembly hypothesis suggested by Hebb in 1949. According to this hypothesis, the basic unit of information processing in the brain is an assembly of cells, which can act briefly as a closed system, in response to a specific stimulus. This work presents a novel method of characterizing this supposed activity using a hidden Markov model. This model is able to reveal some of the underlying cortical network activity of behavioural processes. In our study the process in hand was the simultaneous activity of several cells recorded from the frontal cortex of behaving monkeys. Using such a model we were able to identify the behavioural mode of the animal and directly identify the corresponding collective network activity. Furthermore, the segmentation of the data into the discrete states also provides direct evidence for the state dependence of the short-time correlation functions between the same pair of cells. Thus, this cross-correlation depends on the network state of activity and not on local connectivity alone. ¬© 1997 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The relative effects of foraging benefits (food intake) and costs (disturbance = pit destruction) on growth rate and foraging behavior of larvae of the ant-lion Myrmeleon mobilis were investigated. In a laboratory experiment second-instar larvae were subjected to combinations of three rates of feeding and three rates of disturbance. Pit relocations were generally rare but occurred more often in starved larvae. Disturbance rate had no significant effect on pit relocation rate. Feeding rate was a major determinant of the energy allocated in pit construction and maintenance (positive relationship). In a second experiment third-instar larvae encountered changing rates of disturbance. Pit size was reduced as a response to increased rates of disturbance. Disturbance had no detectable effect on growth. In general, M. mobilis larvae were cost-conservative foragers.},

abstract={Magurran, Irving and Henderson have reported that a population of European minnows, Phoxinus phoxinus, did not show an obvious behavioural fright reaction when they were presented with conspecific skin extract in a wild situation. Fish from the same population show a strong response when tested in aquaria. From these data the authors conclude that the fright reaction may be contingent on such factors as assessed risk and hunger. From this reasonable hypothesis they progress to the assertion that the Schreckstoff of ostariophysan fishes should not be considered an alarm pheromone. Much of their paper is devoted to arguments supporting their hypothesis that Schreckstoff cannot operate as an alarm pheromone. I argue that it is appropriate and adaptive to respond to alarm signals in a contingent manner, and attempt to answer the various arguments regarding the validity of terming Schreckstoff an alarm pheromone.},

abstract={The efficacy of cardiovascular risk-reduction programs has been established. However, the extent to which risk-reduction interventions are effective may depend on adherence. Non-compliance, or non-adherence, may occur with any of the recommended or prescribed regimens and may vary across the treatment course. Compliance problems, whether occurring early or late in the treatment course, are clinically significant, as adherence is one mediator of the clinical outcome. This article, which is based on a review of the empirical literature of the past 20 years, addresses compliance across four regimens of cardiovascular risk reduction: pharmacological therapy, exercise, nutrition, and smoking cessation. The criteria for inclusion of a study in this review were: (a) focus on cardiovascular disease risk reduction; (b) report of a quantitative measure of compliance behavior; and (c) use of a randomized controlled design. Forty-six studies meeting these criteria were identified. A variety of self-report, objective, and electronic measurement methods were used across these studies. The interventions employed diverse combinations of cognitive, educational, and behavioral strategies to improve compliance in an array of settings. The strategies demonstrated to be successful in improving compliance included behavioral skill training, self-monitoring, telephone/mail contact, self-efficacy enhancement, and external cognitive aids. A series of tables summarize the intervention strategies, compliance measures, and findings, as well as the interventions demonstrated to be successful. This review reflects the progress made over the two decades in compliance measurement and research and, further, advances made in the application of behavioral strategies to the promotion of cardiovascular risk reduction.},

abstract={Previous work has established a number of sex-related deficits in immune function, behavior, and endocrine responses to stress in the offspring of darns exposed to ethanol. To examine the potential role of maternal glucocorticoids as a mediator of these sexually dimorphic effects in the fetus, we examined the influence of prenatal alcohol exposure in the presence or absence of maternal glucocorticoids on fetal plasma corticosterone (CORT) production. An additional question to be addressed by these studies was whether maternal adrenalectomy could eliminate the known inhibition by ethanol of the prenatal surge of plasma testosterone in male fetuses. Pregnant dams were adrenalectomized (ADX) or sham-adrenalectomized on gestational day (G) 7 and placed on a liquid diet containing 35% ethanol- derived calories or pair-fed an isocaloric control diet throughout the experiment. On G18, G19, and G21, plasma levels of CORT, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were measured in male and female fetuses and their mothers. Ethanol administration consistently increased maternal plasma CORT levels but did not significantly alter CORT levels in the fetus. Maternal ADX resulted in compensatory increases in fetal CORT levels that were lower in fetuses of ADX dams on alcohol, suggesting a direct effect of ethanol on fetal pituitary-adrenal activity. There were no significant sex differences in fetal plasma CORT levels in response to any of these manipulations. A novel surge of maternal plasma DHEA was found on G19 that was absent in plasma from ADX dams. In spite of the absence of a surge on G19, plasma DHEA levels of ADX dams rose from very low levels at G18 to levels on G21 that were significantly higher than in Sham dams. A normal testosterone surge was observed in male fetuses on G18 and G19 from sham- adrenalectomized dams administered the pair-fed diet. However, this surge was greatly attenuated in males administered ethanol and also in male fetuses from ADX dams. These results reveal a direct inhibitory influence of ethanol on fetal CORT secretion as well as on the prenatal testosterone surge in males. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate the presence of a surge of DHEA in the pregnant rat. Overall, these data suggest that there is a critical adrenal factor in the rat that regulates the maternal surge of DHEA on G19 and the prenatal testosterone surge of male fetuses on G18-19.},

abstract={Purpose: The study objectives are: (1) to examine and compare patterns of covariation of a wide range of health behaviors among adolescent boys and girls; (2) to determine whether eating behaviors are part of a larger construct of health-related behaviors and to identify the behaviors with which they share underlying similarities; and (3) to determine whether youth engaging in other health-compromising behaviors are at risk for unhealthy eating. Methods: Data were analyzed from the Minnesota Adolescent Health Survey, a classroom-administered questionnaire, completed by 36,284 adolescents, in grades 7-12 from 1986-87. Results: Among boys, factor analysis revealed five factors: (1) risk-taking behaviors, (2) school- related behaviors, (3) 'quietly' disturbed behaviors (e.g., frequent dieting, self-induced vomiting, suicide attempts), (4) health-promoting behaviors; and (5) exercise. Eating behaviors loaded on the construct of health-promoting behaviors with brushing teeth and seat belt use. Among girls, four similar factors emerged; however, exercise loaded on the construct of health- promoting behaviors. Therefore, eating behaviors loaded with brushing teeth, seat belt use, and exercise among girls. Logistic regression analyses, controlling for sociodemographic and personal variables, revealed that boys and girls engaging in health-promoting behaviors were less likely to have unhealthy eating behaviors, while those engaging in quietly disturbed behaviors, risk-taking behaviors, and problematic school behaviors were more likely to have unhealthy eating behaviors. Conclusions: Eating behaviors appear to be part of a health-promoting behavioral construct and should not be viewed in isolation from other behaviors. Although eating behaviors do not appear to be part of the 'problem behavior syndrome,' youth engaging in a wide range of health-compromising behaviors are at risk for unhealthy eating; emphasizing the need to target high-risk youth with health promotion programs.},

abstract={Objective: To determine whether college athletes are at greater risk for maladaptive lifestyle and health-risk behaviors than their nonathletic peers and to identify high risk taking groups by gender, sport, and other identifiers. Design: Multicenter, cross-sectional study. Setting: Seven major geographically represented collegiate institutions in the United States. Participants: A total of 2298 college athletes and 683 randomized nonathlete controls completed a confidential survey questionnaire between the summer of 1993 and winter of 1994, assessing lifestyle and health-risk behaviors over the previous 12 months. Main outcome measures: Self-reports of lifestyle behaviors and health risks in the following areas: motor-vehicle safely, substance abuse, sexually transmitted diseases and contraception, mental health, cancer prevention, nutrition, exercise and general preventive health issues. Results: Athletes demonstrated significantly higher risk-taking behaviors (p < 0.05) than their nonathlete peers in the following areas: less likely always to use seatbelts; less likely always to use helmets with motorcycles, mopeds, and bicycles; more often drive as a passenger with a driver under the influence of alcohol or drugs; greater quantity and frequency of alcoholic beverages; greater frequency of smokeless tobacco and anabolic steroid use; less-safe sex; greater number of sexual partners, less contraceptive use; and more involvement in physical fights. Female athletes reported a higher prevalence of irregular menses, amenorrhea, and stress fractures compared with female nonathletes. Male athletes had more risk-taking behaviors than did female athletes (p < 0.05), and athletes in contact sports demonstrated more risk-taking behaviors than did athletes in noncontact sports (p < 0.05). Athletes with one risk-taking behavior were likely to have multiple risk-taking behaviors (p < 0.05). Conclusions: College athletes appear to be at higher risk than their nonathletic peers for certain maladaptive lifestyle behaviors. Athlete subgroups at highest risk include male athletes and athletes participating in contact sports. Athletes at risk for one high-risk behavior demonstrated an increased risk for multiple risk-taking behaviors. Preventive health interventions deserve further study to determine strategies for risk reduction in high-risk groups.},

However, conclusions regarding the stability of personality and the relation between personality and depression have been drawn (a) without differentiating relative stability among individual differences from absolute stability of change scores and (b) without explicitly modeling change in personality as a function of change in depression. The relation between neuroticism and depression was examined in a sample of depressed outpatients (N = 71) receiving a 5-week trial of pharmacotherapy. Measures of neuroticism and extraversion demonstrated both relative stability and absolute change, and changes in neuroticism and extraversion scores were modestly or not at all accounted for by changes in depression scores. Claims that personality scores are not stable and are state dependent must be reconsidered. Copyright 1997 by the American Psychological Association, Inc.},

abstract={Lipid concentrations of Bythotrephes cederstroemi were compared among three Great Lakes, Erie, Huron, and Michigan, in an effort to investigate the phenotypic plasticity in size displayed among the lakes. Four developmental stages were measured in Lakes Erie and Huron and two stages were studied in Lake Michigan. With a gravimetric extraction method, the total lipid concentration range (Œºg lipid Œºg dry weigh-1, expressed as percent) for Bythotrephes was estimated to he 10-19%. Statistically significant differences were found in lipid concentrations of Bythotrephes among lakes and developmental stages. Lake Erie had significantly higher lipid concentration values than Lake Huron for stages 2 through 4, and had similar values to Lake Michigan for the analyzed stages 1 and 4. The first instar had indistinguishable lipid concentrations among Lakes Erie, Huron, and Michigan. Even though animals from Lake Erie were significantly smaller, the data suggest that they were not less well nourished. We hypothesize that selective mortality imposed by visual predators on larger Bythotrephes and the lack of deep water refuges in Lake Erie has encouraged the smaller size of Bythotrephes found there in comparison to those found in Lakes Huron and Michigan.},

abstract={Table salt can now be fortified with iodine and iron without interaction and without loss of potency. According to Levente Diosady, professor of Food Engineering at the University of Toronto, the amounts of the two micronutrients available to the human body have been significantly reduced when the two interacted. In the new technology, the iodine is covered with a dextrin (a water soluble starch) capsule that serves as a physical barrier to the iron. Micronutrient Initiative (an international secretariat based at IDRC that works to eliminate health problems resulting from iron, iodine, and vitamin A deficiencies) and IDRC supported the development of the technology. The efficiency of absorption of the two micronutrients in the new double fortified salt in the human body is being tested at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. Later testing will be conducted by University of Ghana scientists in IDRC-funded trials that will focus on women and their families in areas of Ghana where these deficiencies are endemic. Iodine is part of thyroid hormone, which contributes to brain development in the fetus and regulates human metabolism; iodine deficiency is the most frequent cause of preventable mental retardation. Related disorders include lethargy, physical disabilities, goiter, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Iron deficiency, the most common nutritional problem in the world (particularly among women, infants, and children), is associated with anemia, fatigue, learning problems, pregnancy complications, premature births, and maternal mortality. The two deficiencies together affect more than one-third of the world's population. Approximately 1.6 billion people, in more than 100 countries, live in areas where iodine is not available in sufficient amounts; those most at risk include about one-third of China's population. It is also a severe problem in the Himalayas, the Andes, India, and West Africa.},

abstract={Actual fluid intake in the institutionalized elderly was compared with three established standards to determine adequacy of fluid intake. Consecutive 3-day food and fluid intake was observed directly and analyzed by computer for water content. Number and frequency of medications and Minimum Data Set (MDS) information about cognitive skills, physical locomotion, and ability to understand were obtained from medical records. Recommended fluid intake was determined using three established standards for two age groups: 65 through 85 years and 86 through 100 years. The standards were 30 mL/kg body weight (standard 1); 1 mL/kcal energy consumed (standard 2); and 100 mL/kg for f√Ørst 10 kg, 50 mL/kg for next 10 kg, and 15 mL for remaining kg (standard 3.) Data were collected in one nursing home. Subjects were 40 residents who were free from acute illness and infection and/or were not receiving enteral feedings. Fluid intake and MDS data were collected. Data about medications were obtained after preliminary data collection observations. A two-tailed t test was used to compare actual fluid intake with recommended fluid intake. Interaction effect of age on fluid intake was analyzed using multiple analysis of variance. Correlations were used to evaluate relationships among fluid intake, number and frequency of medications, age, weight, and MDS data. This population received adequate or more than adequate fluid according to the standards of 30 mL/kg body weight or 1 mL/kcal energy consumed, but inadequate fluid according to standard 3, which adjusted for extremes of underweight or overweight. Age was not a factor in adequacy of fluid intake. Positive correlations existed between fluid obtained from nonmeal feedings and number and frequency of medications. When the standard of 30 mL/kg body weight is used, underweight residents have unrealistically low fluid recommendations. Standard 3, which adjusts for extremes in body weight, is more reasonable for patients whether they are of normal weight, underweight, or overweight. This standard more closely supports other recommendations of 1,500 to 2,000 mL fluid intake per day. Number and frequency of medications influences the amount of fluid residents obtain during nonmeal feedings.},

abstract={Laboratory rats, like many other animal species, transport food. Their behavior is influenced by factors such as food size, the time required to eat, travel distance, travel difficulty, and the availability of cover, etc. Recent versions of optimal foraging theory suggest that species that display such behavioral patterns do so in order to minimize risk to predation while at the same time maximizing food gain. Nevertheless, it is not clear that this explanation applies to rats, nor is it easy to investigate this problem in a laboratory. The results of the present study on urban feral rats show that their food handling behavior is similar to that of domestic rats. The results also suggest that food carrying can serve defensive as well as communicative functions. Aggression around food sources was high. Smaller rats always carried food and some large rats infrequently carried food, suggesting that the food carrying by smaller, subordinate rats may help them avoid conspecific aggression. Tie rats also vigorously attempted to steal food that was carried home by conspecifics. This result suggests that food carrying can redistribute food resources and inform conspecifies about food availability. The results demonstrate the utility of multilevel behavioral analysis and also demonstrate that for rats, food transport has functions other than predator avoidance, including avoidance of conspecific aggression and communication about food availability. ¬© 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Seabird prey, such as small pelagic fish, cephalopods or zooplankton, generally exhibit short lifespans, early and highly variable recruitment. Seabird population sizes do not track short-term (annual) changes in prey population size, so seabirds can be expected to have behavioural buffering mechanisms to cope with natural fluctuations in food supply. These may include prey switching, selecting high-density patches of prey, seasonal migration, flexible tide budgets, brood reduction, flexible chick growth rates and periodic non-breeding. Fisheries may alter food supply to seabirds by reducing stock biomass, increasing variability of recruitment, by altering food-web structure and by making available to scavenging seabirds foods that they could not otherwise reach. Seabird numbers may be limited by food-related winter mortality and by food-related reproductive success. There is evidence for buffering against effects of food shortage, but buffering ability and behavioural responses of seabirds to food shortage vary among species. Although sensitive indicators of food shortage can be identified, it is extremely difficult to distinguish between fishery-induced and natural changes in terms of their effects on seabirds.},

The observed results suggest that the behaviour of individual fish depends on the integration of a continually changing hierarchy of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, with the relative importance of a specific factor varying with ontogeny and over time and space. The broad range of responses displayed by early life stages suggests that behaviour plays an important role in determining the consequences of environmental variability on walleye pollock populations. In general, results from our laboratory experiments are consistent with patterns observed in field studies, supporting the efficacy of using experimental behavioural research to define some of the underlying mechanisms controlling distribution and survival in the field, and eventual recruitment to adult populations.},

abstract={Mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in insects from 19 lakes in Quebec (Canada) and Sweden ranged from &lt;25 to &gt;550 ng Hg¬∑g-1 dry weight (dw). The mean proportion of MeHg to total Hg concentrations depended on the feeding behaviour of the animals, increasing from 35-50% in detritivores-grazers (dipterans, ephemeropterans, trichopterans) to 70-95% in predators (heteropterans, coleopterans, odonates). These differences were attributed to the biomagnification of MeHg in the food web since the MeHg/total Hg ratio in the organisms was not related to their body size. A large part of the overall variability of total Hg (r2=0.57, p=0.0001) and MeHg (r2=0.79, p=0.0001) concentrations in insects was explained by taxonomic differences, probably related to feeding behaviour, and the differences between lakes. MeHg concentrations in chironomids and in odonates were significantly correlated with sediment MeHg contents (r=0.78, p=0.005; r=0.62, p=0.001, respectively). However, our results suggest that animal feeding behaviour and the quality of ingested food are more important in determining MeHg accumulation in insects than either MeHg contents of sediment or atmospheric Hg deposition rates. Our data indicate that the bioavailability of Hg to the lower trophic levels of the food web is determined by abiotic factors and controls contamination of predators at the top of the food chain. Total Hg concentrations in insects increased from spring to fall, from 60-80 ng Hg¬∑g-1 dw to 125-175 ng Hg¬∑g-1 dw in the detritivore-grazer taxa, and from 88-120 ng Hg g-1 dw to 180-200 ng Hg¬∑g-1 dw in the predator taxa. MeHg/total Hg ratios showed little variability from spring to fall and the increase of Hg and MeHg concentrations in insects seemed to be related to enhanced methylation resulting from the rise of water temperature and to the variations in the nature of the food ingested.},

Amphetamine produced robust behavioral sensitization in all environments, but when an amphetamine challenge was given in a test environment that was novel for some groups but not others, the expression of sensitization was completely context specific. An injection of saline in the amphetamine-paired environment produced a conditional response (CR), but this was quite small compared to the magnitude of the sensitized response, and sensitization remained completely context specific following extinction of the CR. Results are discussed in relation to 3 models of how context may modulate the expression of sensitization: an excitatory conditioning model, an inhibitory conditioning model, and an occasion-setting model.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which eating disorders in women are related to a general tendency toward addiction, addiction to running, and level of running intensity. A stratified sample of 265 women runners/nonrunners (ages 20-35) included 66 nonrunners, 69 low-level runners, 67 medium-level runners, and 63 high-intensity runners. The women were weighed, measured, and had body fat and 4-day nutritional intake assessed. A questionnaire included scales to assess psychological and behavior traits common in women with anorexia (AN) and/or bulimia, general addiction, and running addiction. ANCOVA with age and income as covariates and multiple regression analyses were used. There were significant differences among the groups on the eating disorder scores and percent body fat with higher level runners scoring higher on eating disorder measures and running addiction and lower on body fat. A major finding for those providing health care for women was that 25% of the women who ran >30 miles/week had Eating Attitude Test scores indicating a high risk for anorexia. ¬© 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

abstract={Many insects feed on plants, yet the capacity to induce galls exists only in certain groups. Even within related insect orders, only species of specific families and tribes induce galls. For instance, the Cecidomyiidae, one of the largest families in Diptera, includes nearly three thousand species; about sixty per cent of these species are gall inducers but the rest are either free living or display mycophagous or zoophagous habits. Similar patterns are evident among other gall-inducing insects such as thrips, aphids, psylloids, coccoids, whiteflies, and cynipoids as well. This suggests that the evolution of gall-inducing trait has occurred independently in several lineages. Most of the gall insects show high levels of specificity for particular plant species. The nature of selection is so specific that the morphology of the gall could be considered a dependable criterion for field determinations of plants. Insect identity gives a clue for plant identity and vice versa. Although considerable information is currently available to explain how gall insects select their host plants, the question as to why they should select plants so accurately remains to be answered. One of the explanations offered is that host specificity of gall insects is due to the abundance of specific nutritional materials such as proteins, sugars, and lipids, besides some helpful allelochemicals, and/or their precursors in host plants. By inducing a gall, the insect is able to obtain a favourable metabolic response from the plant which not only provides necessary nutrients for the insect's development, but an enclosed environment protecting the gall inducer from predators as well. However, this explanation needs to be verified, because exceptions do exist. Recent investigations indicate that some gall insects show capability of invading novel host-plant species and induce galls on them. Though in a broad sense, gall insects can be used as plant taxonomists because of their high level of fidelity to specific host plants, it appears that this is no longer dependable. As sensitive organisms, gall inducers could easily get depleted should there be a catastrophic loss of their normal host plants, and are, therefore, probably responding rapidly to changing environmental pressures by developing new sympatric host races. These host races, supposedly of the same species because of no sexual incompatibility, however, show distinct variation in the molecular configuration of their hemolymph as well as behavioural traits. Consequently, the question arises is: Are they displaying early phases of biodiversification?},

abstract={Central Venous Catheter (CVC) allows the administration of drugs, parenteral nutrition and blood sample taking for laboratory tests, avoiding continuous damage to the peripheral veins. Most of the psychological traumas caused by crude treatments also decrease and therefore CVC may initially be experienced as the end of continuous physical injuries. Nevertheless, it often happens that other sorts of psychological trauma, due to fantasies and fears elicited by the CVC, arise in children and their families. The CVC is often felt as a dangerous and invasive 'foreign body'. Moreover after it has been used for a long time it may create a psychological state of dependency and it frequently becomes the only means of salvation. This makes removal particularly difficult and it is felt as a 'cutting' of the CVC at the end of the therapy. Young patients elaborate complex fantasies about the starting point, the route and the end point of the catheter. Their parents are often unknowing accomplices of these fears, partially because they project their own experience and also because they are conditioned by the way they have elaborated the information provided by the assistance staff. Since the handling of CVC is under the parent's responsibility when the child is not in Hospital, we should be able to help the patients and their families to cope with this experience in the most suitable way. This makes it possible to avoid both excessive worries and the tendency to underestimate the risk of infection. This is why we consider that submitting children and their family members to interviews, surveys and spontaneous drawing is wise in order to evaluate the existence, nature and extent of the fantasies. This helps to modify possible distortions both of perception and behavior.},

abstract={The risk for cardiovascular events can be reduced by modifications in life-style. However, only a small percentage of subjects are able to adopt such changes. We determined whether psychologic profiles measured on entry into a life-style intervention program correlated with objective measurements of success after 1 year of enrollment. When compared with patients who had dropped out, patients still enrolled in the program after 1 year differed statistically on scales 1 and 6 of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, showing a lower level of paranoia and more concern about health issues. Among patients remaining in the program, psychologic profiles differed between those who met an objective measure of success (responders) and those who did not. In addition, profiles differed among responders as a function of the aspect of life-style that they successfully changed. These findings suggest that psychologic profiles can be used to identify which life-style changes an individual can easily adopt.},

abstract={Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1-(7-36) amide and its pancreatic receptors are important for control of blood glucose levels. However, rat GLP-1 receptors are also localized in the brain, in hypothalamus, and in areas without a blood-brain barrier. When rats were kept on a food restriction schedule, intracerebroventricular injection of GLP-1 just before food was offered inhibited food intake. However, peripheral GLP-1 administration by intraperitoneal injection had little effect. GLP-1 effects on water intake and output were also investigated. Intracerebroventricular GLP-1 profoundly inhibited angiotensin II-induced drinking behavior in rats, and water intake was suppressed by exogenous GLP-1 in rats habituated to a water restriction schedule. These effects were reproduced by intraperitoneal administration of GLP-1. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular GLP-1 stimulated urinary excretion of water and sodium. The centrally elicited effects were blocked by the GLP-1 antagonist exendin-(9-39) amide, whereas the N-terminally extended and inactive GLP-1-(1-36) amide had no effect on feeding and drinking. GLP-1 had no effect in behavioral assays measuring exploratory locomotor activity and conditioned taste aversion. In conclusion, GLP-1 may play a physiological role in regulation of both ingestion and the water and salt homeostasis.},

abstract={This study examines the behavioral responses of larvae of the American toad, Bufo americanus, to the presence of an invertebrate predator, larvae of the dragonfly Anax junius. In particular, we examine whether responses to predators are categorical ones to some threshold level of predation risk or alternatively whether the responses are adjustable depending on the level of predation risk. If the responses are graded, does the response vary according to what cues about predation risk are available to prey? Because avoiding predation can incur costs in terms of resource acquisition, does food availability affect the responses of toad larvae to their predators? Finally, because predation risk is a function of body size, we also examined whether the response to predator presence was affected by size of toad larvae. We addressed these questions by measuring the activity levels and habitat use of toad larvae in the presence and absence of predators while manipulating predator density, whether the predators had fed, food availability, and larval toad size. In an additional experiment, we also measured activity and movement speed of toad larvae when we manipulated food availability and predator density. We found that toad larvae were less active as predator density increased and as food availability increased. Small toad larvae were more sensitive to the presence of predators than were large larvae. Although toad larvae did reduce activity by 35% in the presence of fed predators as opposed to unfed predators, the result was not statistically significant. Toad larvae did avoid predators, but the level of avoidance could not be shown to vary with predator density, food availability, or body size. However, there was a borderline effect of predator feeding status. Movement speed was not significantly related to either food availability or predator density.},

abstract={Experimental thiamine deficiency (TD) is a classical model of a nutritional deficit associated with a generalized impairment of oxidative metabolism and selective cell loss in the brain. In rats, TD-induced cell degeneration is accompanied by an accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP)/amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) immunoreactivity in abnormal neurites and perikarya along the periphery of, or scattered within, the lesion. Prompted by these data and our previous findings of a genetic variation in the development of TD symptoms, we extended our studies to mice. C57BL/6, ApoE knockout, and APP YAC transgenic mice received thiamine- deficient diet and pyrithiamine injections. Unlike rats, APP/APLP2- immunoreactive neurites in all strains of mice were sparsely scattered within damaged areas and did not delimit the thalamic lesion. In addition, abnormal clusters of intensely immunoreactive neurites occurred only in areas of damage including the thalamus, mammillary body, and inferior colliculus. The clusters appeared as either irregular clumps or round or oval rosettes that strikingly resembled the neuritic component of Alzheimer amyloid plaques. However, immunostaining using various antisera to synthetic amyloid Œ≤- protein (AŒ≤1-40) and thioflavine S histochemistry failed to show evidence of a component of AŒ≤. Neither APP/APLP2-immunoreactive clusters nor amyloid plaques were observed in the brain from patients with Wernicke- Korsakoff syndrome, the clinical manifestation of TD in man. Our results demonstrate species (ie, genetic) differences in the response to TD-induced damage and support a role for APP and APLP2 in the response to brain injury. This is the first report that chronic oxidative deficits can lead to this novel pathology.},

abstract={Psychosocial aspects in phenylketonuric (PKU) patients are reported. In two separate studies patients with PKU differing in age (children versus adolescents), were assessed. The main message of the first prospective study on 58 10 year-old patients is that normally intelligent PKU patients who were treated early and strictly did not show a higher risk for severe emotional and behavioural maladjustment compared with healthy controls at the age of 10 years. The data were obtained in the course of the German PKU Collaborative Study by the 'Personality Questionnaire for Children (PFK 9-14)'. All patients received nutritional, medical, and psychological counselling every 6 months. In the second retrospective study, 34 early treated, normally intelligent adolescents with PKU (age: mean = 14.6, SD = 2.0, range = 11-18 years) and their mothers were assessed with several psychometric personality inventories and self-developed questionnaires concerning their psychosocial situation and their disease- and diet-specific knowledge. Using the Mannheimer Biographic Inventory (MBI), the Personality Questionnaire for Children (PFK 9-14), and the Freiburger Personality Inventory (FPI) the adolescent patients described their social life and their emotional development as being distinctly restricted. Their knowledge concerning disease and diet was alarmingly poor and the majority had great difficulties in satisfactory dietetic management without parental help. In addition to the burdensome diet, developmental crises like puberty may cause more frequently emotional and behavioural problems in PKU patients.},

abstract={Individual differences in behavioural responses are of increasing interest in the behavioural sciences. There could be enormous benefits for animal husbandry if a test could be developed that would identify categories or types of individuals unlikely to cope with subsequent challenges. The present study compared the behavioural responses of two series of 16 groups (n - 6 or 7 gilts) under four different circumstances: Situation 1, an open field with a novel stimulus (bucket or human); Situation 2, individual access to food for 15 min after a 20-h period of food deprivation; Situation 3, competition for food after food deprivation; Situation 4, general activity and feeding behaviour in a group over a 24-h period. Situations 1 and 2 were assessed four and three times over a 2- and 1-week period, respectively. Both showed high levels of consistency in the behavioural responses of the gilts. Principal component analyses were used to reduce the number of variables per test situation and facilitate measurement of consistency across test situations. The amount of variation explained by the first component was generally more than twice that explained by any subsequent components. The only significant correlation between factor scores calculated from the first components was found between Situations 1 and 2 in the first series. None of the calculated factor scores showed bi- or multimodal distributions. We conclude that, whilst over a short period of time gilts respond consistently to a specific challenge, they do not display the same consistency when challenged in a different context. This lack of inter-situation correlations, plus the absence of multimodal distributions, fails to support the view that behavioural 'types' of gilts exist.},

abstract={In 1993, in Peru, the Institute of Nutritional Research conducted two studies in Huaraz in the Andean region to evaluate the educational and nutritional impact of the government's School Breakfast Program. The school breakfast included a small cake and a glass of Amilac (similar in taste and color to milk), which provided 30% of each child's energy requirements, 60% of recommended dietary allowances for minerals and vitamins, and 100% of dietary iron needs. A case control study examined the effects of breakfast on cognition among 54 elementary schoolchildren 9-11 years old. It found that the school breakfast did not have a significant effect on the children's performance in the Number Discrimination, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Raven Progressive Matrices, or Reaction Time tests. Children nutritionally at risk who received the placebo had significantly slower short-term memory scanning than their counterparts who received the breakfast. The no-risk placebo group exhibited more rapid discrimination between visual stimuli than the no-risk breakfast group. A field evaluation of the program in 10 rural schools, which were randomly assigned to a treatment or control condition, was conducted. In terms of energy, protein, and iron intake, the children in the case and control conditions were not significantly different. The children tended to be either very stunted or overweight. School attendance increased 0.58 points in the experimental group, while it decreased by 2.92 points in the control group (p 0.05). When both groups received the breakfast, attendance rates increased significantly in both groups (p 0.05). Vocabulary was sensitive to the effects of the breakfast. Specifically, the greater the child's weight, the higher his/her vocabulary test scores (p 0.05). These findings suggest that the brain is sensitive to decreases in the short-term availability of nutrients, and that an overnight and morning fast produces a physiological state accompanied by changes in brain function, especially working memory, particularly among nutritionally at-risk children.},

abstract={Infants with very low birth weight (VLBW) are at increased risk for feeding disorders that can affect growth and development. One hundred and forty one mother-infant pairs were compared [55 with infants with high medical risk due to infant VLBW and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), 34 VLBW without BPD, and 52 term infants] on operationally defined measures of feeding behaviors and maternal self-report of depression and anxiety. Mothers of VLBW infants with and without BPD spent more time prompting their infants to feed when their infants engaged in nonfeeding behavior. Despite increased maternal efforts, infants with BPD took in less formula, spent less time sucking, and spent a greater proportion of time nonfeeding. VLBW infants without BPD were equivalent to term infants in percentage of time sucking and in volume of formula ingested and were more likely to take in higher calories than infants with BPD. Mothers of VLBW infants with and without BPD were also more likely to report clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety than mothers of term infants. Because mothers of VLBW infants who were more depressed or anxious were less likely to verbally prompt their infants to eat, maternal psychological symptoms should be considered in assessing interactions of VLBW mother-infant dyads.

abstract={The effects of reduced food availability on the behavior of juvenile walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma were examined in laboratory experiments designed to test for potential energy-conserving responses. Groups of juvenile fish were held on 1 of 6 ration treatments ranging from ad libitum to near starvation, and then vertical distribution and activity levels were quantified in a 2.5 m deep water column under isothermal and thermally stratified conditions. Stratification resulted in a general shift to the upper, warmer layer in the 2 experiments employing a sharp thermocline at mid-depth, but the occurrence of fish in the colder bottom layer varied with different ration treatments. Movement into cold water increased in intermediate ration groups compared to high ration groups. Since reduced temperatures should reduce metabolic costs, this behavior is consistent with our hypothesis that food deprivation should invoke energy-saving behaviors. However, activity levels increased for fish held on intermediate rations, suggesting that the greater movement into cold water was a corollary result of increased searching for food Fish in the lowest ration treatments had decreased activity levels, but also decreased their movement into cold water when a sharp thermocline was present, negating potential bioenergetic benefits. In the third experiment, there was a gradual thermal gradient from surface to bottom rather than a sharp thermocline. Temperatures associated with vertical positions of the fish were determined. In this experiment, clear energy-conserving responses to temperature were displayed by food- deprived fish; the average temperatures occupied by fish on starvation rations were 3 to 4¬∞C colder than those of the higher ration groups. Based on the high Q10 for metabolic rates of juvenile pollock, these reduced temperatures potentially conferred energy savings of up to 34%, relative to the metabolic expenditures of fish on high rations. The contrast in behavior for the lowest ration groups between sharply stratified and gradually stratified conditions suggested that the severity of the temperature gradient influenced the fishes' ability to take advantage of cold water as an energetic refuge. The behavior of fish in the laboratory was consistent with prior observations in the Bering Sea, where juvenile walleye pollock remained in surface waters if food availability was high, but initiated vertical migration into deeper, colder water with reduced prey densities. Results of this study demonstrated a broad flexibility in the behavioral mechanisms used by walleye pollock to deal with declining food levels. The initial response to food limitation was increased activity, indicative of greater searching behavior. With extended food deprivation, a switch to energy- conserving behavior was evident. The temperature responses of fish experiencing severe food limitation provided support for a bioenergetic hypothesis of diel vertical migration.},

abstract={Previous studies have shown that green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus, have strong effects on the activity, habitat use, social interactions and mating dynamics of a stream-dwelling water strider, Aquarius remigis (family Gerridae, hence, gerrids). In nature, however, stream pools often contain not just sunfish and water striders, but also smaller fish such as minnows. Here, we used factorial experiments in seminatural streams to document the direct and indirect effects of sunfish and fat-head minnows, Pimephales promelas, on water strider survival and behavior. Sunfish, minnows and gerrids all consume surface prey (here, crickets); thus these three species are potential food competitors. Sunfish eat minnows. Accordingly, the presence of sunfish caused minnows to increase their schooling behavior and shift their activity from the surface toward the bottom substrate. The presence of sunfish was also associated with an increase in the number of missing gerrids, whereas minnows caused relatively little gerrid disappearance. Most interestingly, the presence of minnows decreased the effect of sunfish on gerrid disappearance rates; that is, minnows apparently had an indirect positive effect on water strider survival. We suggest that this indirect positive effect reflects the fact that minnows are alternative prey for sunfish. The effects of sunfish and minnows on gerrid mortality explained the influence of these fish on gerrid behavior. Sunfish caused decreases in male gerrid activity, female availability, mating activity, mating frequency and mating duration. Larger males had a mating advantage over smaller males only in pools with sunfish and no minnows. Sunfish also caused a borderline significant decrease in the large female mating advantage. These results were all observed in previous studies and can be viewed as adaptive responses to predation risk These patterns were not consistent with the expected effects of sunfish as food competitors with water striders. In contrast, minnows had relatively little influence on water strider behavior and the few significant effects were the opposite of those of sunfish. Minnows caused increases in female activity and in mating duration, a decrease in the large male mating advantage and an increase in the large female mating advantage. These patterns fit the view that minnows caused an increase in gerrid hunger, i.e., that minnows acted as food competitors with gerrids. Finally, planned contrasts against controls showed that, in the presence of both sunfish and minnows, water striders showed no significant behavioral responses to fish (i.e., gerrid behavior in pools with sunrish and minnows did not significantly differ from behavior in fishless pools). The most likely mechanism explaining this pattern is a dilution of sunfish predation risk due to the presence of minnows serving as alternative prey tor sunfish.},

abstract={Behavioural responses of mountain gazelles to four feeding schedules (restricted dietary water) over two (1991-92) summer seasons are described. Time spent feeding in the sun declined across treatments compared with control animals. Feeding behaviour became progressively more disrupted with treatment. Adult males were more active than females and spent less time feeding. Animals often used shelters for rumination and resting during the hottest part of the day. Resting time was divided into standing and lying time. Standing was considered to be an initial response to thermal stress. Females were more conservative in their evacuation behaviour than were males and spent less time urinating. Animals became more aggressive with treatment. A 'refuge' from direct sunlight is probably essential for the survival of mountain gazelles in the wild, although it is not known how animals partition their limited time between food patches and refuges. Changes in appetite may help to reduce metabolic heat. Both sexes scraped in the sand, but in different areas. Captive animals may require an extensive period of acclimatization to reduced dietary water before release into the wild. ¬© 1996 Academic Press Limited.},

In the elevated x-maze diazepam (0.6-2.5 mg/kg) and abecarnil (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) induced anxiolytic-like effects. The second paradigm is based upon the suppression of feeding by exposure to a novel environment, adapted from Bodnoff et al. (1989). Food-deprived rats were placed in a corner of the open field containing food in the centre. The number of rats beginning to eat in the first 5 min was recorded. Diazepam (2.5-5.0 mg/kg) and abecarnil (0.01-0.3 mg/kg) increased the number of rats eating. Flumazenil, the benzodiazepine antagonist, was without effect, but antagonised the effects of diazepam and abecarnil. In a seperate series of experiments the effects of diazepam and abecarnil on feeding and locomotor activity were excluded as having influenced the the anxiolytic effects of these compounds in the animal models of anxiety.},

Experiments 2-4 found a similar difference when training with a second outcome replaced extinction, despite the failure of that replacement to itself undermine performance. Similar results did not occur when the second outcome was identical to that used in initial training. These results suggest that training with a novel outcome generates a decremental process that is not directly observable but that dissipates with time.},

abstract={Responses of organisms to urbanization may involve adjustments in behavior. To qualify such behavioral plasticity we measured the degree to which gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) exploited sunflower seeds in pans distributed over an urban-rural gradient of 78 sites in Virginia. Our objective was to use squirrel GUDs as a functional, relativistic measure of the effects of urbanization. Results showed that a higher proportion of pans were foraged from and that the GUDs were lower (more seeds were removed) in relatively high-density urban and suburban areas than in more rural agricultural areas, or in relatively human-free forest controls. For sites near or within human settlements, GUDs were lower nearer to human-occupied structures than at a greater distance from them, where more squirrels were observed, and where the density of trees was higher; GUDs were higher where there was substantial ground cover and where domestic pets (i.e., cats/dogs) were present nearby. Squirrels living in close proximity to humans appear to be either more limited by food or less sensitive to predatory risk than those living in more natural areas. We argue that the GUD represents a valuable metric with utility for measuring the separate and combined impact of anthropogenic actions at the individual and population levels.},

Evidence is presented for a direct avoidance response in the water flea Daphnia pulex to a substance released by the predatory midge C. flavicans. This response occurs in the absence of visual cues and is independent of food availability.

abstract={I studied animal prey foraging by three outdoor groups of Geoffroy's marmosets, Callithrix geoffroyi, over the course of two summers (June-August 1994; August-September, 1995). Marmosets are highly motivated to forage for animal prey, as demonstrated by the amount of time spent foraging for insects and small vertebrates even in the presence of provisioned, high-quality food. Like their wild congeners, the marmosets engaged in prolonged visual searches of selected areas while slowly locomoting. They seldom used their hands to manipulate substrates. The marmosets were startled proportionately more often while foraging for animal prey than would be predicted by their overall time budgets, and they regularly, if briefly, interrupted their search/locomote pattern with sweeping scans by the surroundings that may contribute to a vigilance function. While carrying infants, they almost never foraged. These results are consistent with the notion that marmosets may be particularly vulnerable to predation while searching for animal prey. Most of the data on marmoset and tamarin feeding ecology have focused on fruits and gums. My data underscore the need to understand better the role of animal prey in the behavioral ecology of callitrichids.},

abstract={We compare the (relative) abundance of life phases [juveniles (JU), initial phase (IP) and terminal phase (TP) fish], social categories (territorial and group adults), and fish following alternative mating styles, in three local populations of the protogynous reef herbivore, Sparisoma viride, on the fringing reef of Bonaire (Netherlands Antilles). In order to determine the adaptive significance of variations in social organization, they are related to the density of conspecifics and other herbivores and to the availability of food, shelter and mating sites. The most striking difference is the high abundance of JU and group fish at one location (Playa Frans) and the total absence of group fish at another (Red Slave). These differences are coherent with a gradient in population density, total herbivore density, scarid grazing pressure, and reproductive output, all of which are highest at Playa Frans and lowest at Red Slave. Exposure to waves and currents shows an inverse trend. The differences in the relative abundance of territorial fish can be explained by the concept of economic defendability, which is reduced at higher population density. In a life history context, small TP group males represent 'bachelors' that sacrifice current reproduction for butter future prospects. As predicted by life history theory, early sex change is promoted at sites where the future rewards are higher (higher spawning rates of large TP males) and where the costs incurred during the bachelor phase are reduced (more spawning opportunities for group TP males). At Red Slave an alternative male mating style ('streaking') appears to be promoted by the lack of a refuge for group TP males and by a dense gorgonian canopy, allowing IP males to reside inside territories. We conclude that most observed differences in population structure can be considered adaptive in an ecological and in a life history context. Population density is a major factor in both contexts. Analysis of the variability in adult density in relation to JU density and the availability of fond trod shelter indicates that the S. viride populations at Bonaire are not totally controlled by stochastic processes. Considering the small spatial scale and the high dispersal of the planktonic embryos and larvae, the observed variability in behavioural and life history traits of S. viride points to a high degree of phenotypic plasticity.},

abstract={To characterize the organisation of behaviour, the responses to chemica inputs of individuals of the diogenid hermit crab Clibanarius vittatus were tested in the laboratory. Stimuli were introduced both singly and in combinations on three days (one, four, and seven days after the crabs were last fed). First, responses to single inputs were characterized: (a) odour of a predator elicited an increase in locomotion; (b) odour of food also elicited an increase in locomotion; (c) odour resulting from snail predation (a signal of availability of an empty shell) elicited brief grasps of the shells of other crabs and (d) the odour of conspecific blood elicited long grasps of shells. Individual crabs differed significantly in their tendencies to respond to chemical signals. Those responding strongly to one cue responded strongly to other cues. Those responding to one shell-related cue (snail odour) responded to the other such cue (conspecific blood) and individuals showing a stronger response to food odours the first day did so on subsequent days. Combinations of cues yielded examples of both summation of inputs (rate of locomotion when snail and predator odours were combined) and inhibition of the responses to one input by the detection of the second odour (brief grasps typical of the response to snail odour were eliminated by addition of predator odour). Responses to conspecific blood were unaffected by predator odour detection. Increasing levels of hunger resulted in increases in locomotion in response to some chemical signals (control, snail odour, and conspecific blood) and a decrease in the number of brief grasps elicited by snail odour.},

abstract={1. The hypotheses tested were that foraging behavioural responses (number of meals consumed, the number of encounters with prey and feeding time) and activity (swimming time) of the freshwater predatory leech Nephelopsis obscura were higher in the dark than in the light, increased with the size of the predator and increased with the length of the starvation period prior to feeding. 2. While swimming activity was longer in the dark, not all the foraging behaviour variables followed this pattern. There was an inverse relationship between swimming time and the number of meals consumed and the poor correspondence between swimming time and number of prey encounters indicates that swimming is not always directly associated with increased foraging and might be related to movements between micro-habitats. 3. The effect of body size on feeding is complicated by its interaction with hunger levels and the ability of the predator to handle prey.},

abstract={1. The effects of resource availability during ontogeny on subsequent feeding performance were investigated in larvae of the small-mouthed salamander (Ambystoma texanum)2. Salamander larvae were reared individually in either high or low prey density treatments for 7 weeks prior to intermediate prey density foraging trials. Larvae from the low prey density treatment were on average 35% smaller in body size than individuals from the high prey density treatment. 3. Resource availability during development influenced larval feeding rates and altered the relationship between body size and three feeding performance measures (attack rates, capture success and feeding rates). Feeding rates in predation trials were also positively correlated with growth rate early in the larval period (until the end of week 5). 4. These results suggest that the environment to which developing organisms are exposed can have significant effects on subsequent behaviour, and that small-mouthed salamander larvae may show state-dependent changes in feeding behaviour in response to differences in long-term feeding history. Additionally, differences in feeding performance may influence the probability of survival to the adult stage for organisms that utilize ephemeral habitats.},

abstract={Optimum reproductive efficiency of farmed deer is often constrained by apparent maladaptation of wild cervids to a given farm environment or components of that environment. Seasonal breeding amongst forest-fringe species of northern temperate origin (e.g. red deer, fallow deer) benefits the species within its natural range, but often creates misalignment in southern temperate zones between the high nutritional demands of lactation in summer and the earlier peak of pasture production and quality occurring in spring. This can lead to increased calf mortality, decreased calf growth rates and depressed dam liveweights. Much emphasis has been placed on manipulating either pasture production patterns or the timing of birth to create better synchrony between the two. The latter largely involves artificial manipulation of the timing of conceptions (e.g. melatonin treatment), but there may also be options for genetic selection of deer for earlier calving patterns. Tropical cervid species farmed in temperate environments can exhibit either aseasonal reproduction (e.g. chital deer) or autumn-wintering calving patterns (e.g. rusa deer), leading to high mortality of neonates (hypothermia, predation) under uncontrolled breeding management. However, there are simple management options to synchronise and shift calving patterns to better align tropical species in temperate environments. The effects of chronic and acute stress on reproductive efficiency of farmed deer are often discussed but seldom demonstrated. Many farmed deer populations exhibit high pregnancy rates (i.e. > 90% females pregnant), indicating robust reproductive physiology and general habituation to the farmed habitat. Low reproductive rates of pubertal red deer hinds in some herds may be partly indicative of the effects of chronic stress, although other factors such as social facilitation and nutrition cannot be discounted. While species of cervids that are used for farming generally display a high degree of behavioural plasticity, the farm environment and associated management practices may impinge on important components of the social environment. Thus, practices such as controlled breeding (e.g. single-sire mating) and confinement during calving may have effects on reducing overall reproductive potential by disrupting social processes (e.g. dam-calf bonds). This highlights the paucity of knowledge on the complexities of cervid behaviour and their implications in both wild and farmed deer.},

abstract={The present study investigates the effects of sensorimotor stimulation on the basal dendrogenesis of superficial cerebrocortical neurons and the accomplishment in the associated exploratory behavior in rats simultaneously exposed to nutritional deprivation. Sprague-Dawley albino rats were submitted to nutritional-environmental influences from birth to the 21 st postnatal day. Exploratory behavior was assessed by the evaluation of locomotor activity in the open-field apparatus. In order to evaluate changes in neuronal morphology induced by nutritional-environmental variables, brains were stained according to the Golgi-Cox-Sholl procedure. Dendritic development was assessed under camera lucida by measuring basal dendritic branching of layer II and III pyramidal neurons, located in the dorsomedial region of the visual cortex of the rat. Morphometrical analysis revealed that both basal dendritic length and branching were significantly reduced by undernutrition. In contrast, environmental stimulation during the suckling period compensated for the neuronal impairment produced by protein-calorie deprivation. An improvement was also observed in exploratory behavior although to a lesser degree, as shown by the open field test data. In conclusion, the present results indicate that sensorimotor stimulation applied during the period of fastest rate of cortical cytodifferentiation compensates for neuronal and behavioral impairment produced by undernutrition. ¬© 1996 S.

abstract={Laboratory studies were conducted to determine the effects of suboptimal prey density and length of prey-deprivation period on swimming, feeding, and social behavior in larval American shad, Alosa sapidissima. Replicated prey-density treatments of 1,000,500, and O Artemia nauplii/liter and deprivation periods of 0, 2, and 4 days were established for an 8-day period. The duration or frequency of 11 behavior patterns was quantified with an event recorder during the experiment. Exposure to suboptimal prey densities affected three categories of larval behavior: swimming activities (pivot and dart), interaction with other larvae (escape or avoid), and stereotypical feeding responses (sigmoid and lunge). Location of a food patch, simulated by the sudden introduction of prey to aquaria, affected the frequency of feeding responses more than other categories of behavior. The patch model was supported as a foraging strategy in larvae. The ontogeny of prey deprivation was evidenced primarily by changes in swimming activity (reduced pivot and dart frequencies), though feeding responses (particularly fixate) were also diminished. Deprivation-induced loss of pivot and fixate was an irreversible, pathological effect of starvation. Deprivation also resulted in greater vertical orientation (head up, 42¬∞) of larvae than non-deprived larvae (21-29¬∞). These changes in behavior may result in less effective escape from predators, location of food patches, or pursuit and capture of prey items in riverine habitats. ¬© Munksgaard, 1996.},

abstract={Two fundamental questions in the study of cooperatively breeding birds are (1) do auxiliaries increase the reproductive success of a flock, and (2) if so, how? This paper addresses these questions in the white-throated magpie-jay, Calocitta formosa. This social corvid was studied for three consecutive breeding seasons in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. Detailed information was gathered on 16 breeding flocks attending a total of 56 active nests. Auxiliaries were divided into three classes depending on their residency patterns and relative contributions to the breeding effort. The influence of auxiliaries was examined on eight measures of nesting success, and on five factors that influence reproductive outcome in this population: (1) onset of first laying, (2) predation, (3) hatching failure, (4) clutch desertion and (5) starvation. The results support three major conclusions. First, helpers directly enhanced nesting success at every stage in the nesting cycle. Second, all helpers did not help equally. Flock size alone bore no relationship to nesting success, but both the number of full-time helpers and helper score (a weighted measure of auxiliary contributions) were significantly related to reproductive outcome. Third, helpers increased breeding success by hastening the onset of first laying, reducing predation on eggs and chicks, and decreasing hatching failure; helpers did not affect the incidence of clutch desertion or chick starvation. These findings provide strong quantitative support for the anti-predator hypothesis and provide the first unequivocal evidence that helpers can enhance nest success by increasing hatchability. ¬© 1996 The Assodation for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={This study examines the non-lethal effects of an odonate predator (Anax junius) on the competitive interactions among several size classes of anuran larvae. In an outdoor experiment using cattle watering tanks, we estimated the effects of both large and small bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) on themselves, on each other, and on small green frogs (R. clamitans) in the absence and non-lethal (caged) presence of Anax. The presence of Anax depressed both growth and survivorship of small bullfrogs and green frogs. In contrast, the presence of Anax had positive effects on growth rates and size at metamorphosis of the large bullfrogs. Increasing density of competitors also decreased survivorship of small classes, and growth rates of all classes. The per-unit-biomass competitive effects of the small bullfrogs on target classes were much greater than those of large bullfrogs. The presence of Anax significantly altered the per-unit-biomass competitive effects of small bullfrogs but not large bullfrogs, presumably because individuals in the small class reduced their activity rates in the presence of Anax. Overall production of new tadpole biomass was quite similar across experimental units, with decreases in production of small size classes in the presence of Anax compensated for by increases in production of the large size class. Thus the non-lethal presence of Anax had substantial effects on the nature of competitive interactions in this system, and we discuss the implications of such behavioral indirect effects in the study of ecological communities. Our results also illustrate the futility of attempting to partition the effects of competitors and predators, as both competitors and the non-lethal presence of predators significantly affected growth rates and death by starvation of small larvae. Finally, our results illustrate how individual behavioral responses may be translated to community and ecosystem properties.},

This paper describes a study carried out in October 1991 to assess the physical health status of 860 underprivileged pupils aged 10 - 14 years in Standards 3 - 5 at three schools in New Crossroads, near Cape Town. Data on nutritional status, age at menarche, blood pressure, eyesight, physical abnormalities, injuries and use of hospitals were obtained. The response rate was 90%. Of all the children, 7,2% were below the 5th percentile weight-for-age. The proportion of boys (13,1%) below the 5th percentile weight-for-age was significantly higher than that of girls (3,7%). Of all the children, 19,5% were below the 5th percentile height-for-age. The proportion of boys (24,4%) below the 5th percentile height-for-age was also significantly higher than that of girls (16,7%). The average age at menarche was 13 years, similar to that (12,8 years) reported for the UK. In 5% of the children, the diastolic blood pressure was > 90 mmHg and the findings show some increase with age. Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital accounted for 30,9% of hospital attendances. 'Chest' complaints (19,5%) were frequent reasons for consultations, while 15,2% of the children reported being injured, with car accidents (16,0%), fractures (27,5%) and burns (20,6%) being the most common injuries. It is suggested that the provision of a 24-hour day hospital will ease the load on the referral hospital, i.e. Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital. Social policy aimed at a safer environment will reduce the number of injuries and related physical disability.},

abstract={One of the major goals of an ecomorphological analysis is to correlate patterns of interspecific differences in morphology with patterns of interspecific differences in ecology. Information derived from functional morphological studies may provide a mechanistic framework supporting the correlation, but the move from a correlational relationship to a causal relationship requires experimental evidence that the interspecific morphological differences create performance differences and therefore ecological differences. The goal of this study was to examine ecomorphological relationships in the diets of cottid fishes (Scorpaeniformes: Cottidae) from the northeastern Pacific by using functional classifications of predators (based on their mode of attack) and of prey (based on their anti-predator defenses). The proposed ecomorphological relationships were tested by examining capture success among the cottids in attacks on prey with different escape abilities. As predicted on functional morphological grounds, both multivariate and univariate analyses indicated that the gravimetric importance of 'elusive prey' (i.e. fishes, shrimp, mysids, and octopods) was greater in cottid species with a larger relative mouth size. Supporting a causal link between morphology and ecology, performance tests indicated that larger-mouthed cottids had significantly higher capture success on Heptacarpus shrimp than did smaller-mouthed species. As predicted, there were no differences in capture success among predators regardless of their attack style or ecomorphological patterns in attack on crabs (Cancer and Petrolisthes spp.) when the crabs were presented on a sand surface (i.e. 'easy prey'). Several difficulties still exist when trying to apply a functional group approach to ecomorphology. These include the behavioral plasticity of the predators, the confounding factor of evolutionary history in identifying correlated ecomorphological features, multiple morphological solutions to common functional problems, the limitations of traditional dietary studies during extremes of prey abundance, and an inadequate understanding of the anti- predator defenses of most prey, including modifications that occur during ontogeny or in different habitats. ¬© 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={Background: Numerous psychosocial factors have been hypothesized to play a role in coronary heart disease. However, existing studies have yielded inconsistent results. Methods and Results: The relations between type A personality as well as suppressed versus expressed anger and risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) were studied in 340 patients and 340 age-, sex-, and community-matched control subjects. Subjects were interviewed at home to assess behavioral and medical cardiovascular risk factors, and fasting blood samples were obtained. Type A personality was associated with nonfatal MI in crude matched-pair analysis (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.20; P=.008). Adjusting for known cardiovascular risk factors (including treated hypertension, body mass index, treated diabetes, family history of premature MI, physical activity, smoking, alcohol, total calories per day, and saturated fat) did not substantially change the magnitude of the point estimate, although the finding was no longer statistically significant (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.97 to 2.09; P=.069). Further adjustment for lipids, including total cholesterol, total HDL, its subfractions (HDL2, HDL3), LDL, VLDL, and triglycerides, markedly attenuated the association (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.90; P=.687), an effect due almost entirely to HDL cholesterol. Suppressed anger was positively but not statistically significantly associated with increased risk of MI in crude matched-pair analysis (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.81; P=.065), in analysis adjusted for behavioral and medical cardiovascular risk factors (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.78; P=.193), or after adjustment for lipids (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.82; P=.695). Conclusions: These findings suggest a possible association of type A but not suppressed anger with risk of nonfatal MI that may be mediated by alterations in HDL cholesterol level. If decreases in HDL are not in the same causal pathway, then the apparent association between type A personality and risk of MI is due to confounding, principally by HDL.},

abstract={Adolescent sexual activity is increasing globally. Abstinence and a delay in the start of sexual intercourse may be the most effective methods in preventing the consequences of teenage sexual activity. However, these goals are seldom met. With the change in social norms, peer pressure and media influences; teenagers are engaging in premarital sex earlier. Family life education in countries like Sweden and Finland reduces teenage pregnancy and abortion. It is unrealistic to expect sexually active adolescents to stop their sexual activity. An effective contraceptive method will provide an alternative to prevent teenage pregnancy. Issues on compliance of contraceptive use, especially at the very outset of sexual activity should be addressed. Most of the problems associated with teenage pregnancy are now thought to be related to the social circumstances of the mother, the poor nutritional status before pregnancy and poor attendance at antenatal clinics. Risk-taking behaviour in this age group will also make them more prone to contracting sexually transmitted diseases. High risk groups should be screened and treated early. Contraceptive methods with protection against sexually transmitted diseases should be advised.},

Under the influence of naloxone, an antagonist of opiate receptors, the proportion of orienting responses decreased, and the number of passive defensive avoidance and freezing reactions increased.

abstract={Diet width theory is a branch of optimal foraging theory, used to predict which fractions of the potential food encountered should be pursued. For pelagic fish, it is generally assumed that light is the dominant stimulus for both prey encounter rate and mortality risk. In order to achieve encounter rates allowing selective feeding, the pelagic predator exposes itself to enhanced predation risk for a prolonged time. The gain in growth obtained by diet selection may seldom outweigh the fitness cost of increased mortality risk. More generally, pelagic feeders will have a higher reproductive rate by searching the depth where feeding will be encounter-limited, and hence be opportunistic feeders. Literature reports of pelagic diet selection either fail to distinguish between the catchability of the prey in a gear and the encounter rate with its predator or neglects the vertical structure in pelagic prey distribution that may give differences in diets for unselective predators operating at different depths. The principal differences between the pelagic habitat and habitats where diet selection will be expected will include one or both of the following: (i) the continuous and steep local (i.e. vertical) gradients in mortality risk and (ii) the lack of local shelter where a newly ingested meal may safely be digested. ¬© 1995 Academic Press Limited.},

abstract={We examined the association of the common whelk Buccinum undatum with the predatory asteroid Leptasterias polaris in the Mingan Islands, northern Gulf of St. Lawrence. Quantitative sampling, using SCUBA diving, of surfaces of the sea floor in the vicinity (within 150 cm) of feeding and non feeding L. polaris and surfaces devoid of asteroids showed that both immature and mature whelks generally avoid L. polaris. Surprisingly, densities of mature whelks up to 12 times the average were occasionally encountered near asteroids when they were consuming a large prey, usually the surf clam Spisula polynyma. Comparisons of the stomach-content mass of whelks approaching L. polaris feeding on S. polynyma with that of whelks which were departing from the same type of feeding bout demonstrated that whelks obtained significant food gains by approaching L. polaris. Previous studies failed to identify the food resources that could account for the high biomass of whelks in the Mingan Islands. The association with L. polaris potentially explains a substantial part of the whelk's diet. Whelks of the Mingan Islands have evolved a flexible behavioural response to L. polaris which permits them to make adaptive and risk-sensitive decisions when choosing between avoiding a major predator and taking advantage of food resources it makes available. ¬© 1995.},

abstract={The dinoflagellate Pfiesteria piscicida (gen. et sp. nov.). a toxic 'ambush predator', has been implicated as a causative agent of major fish kills in estuanne ecosystems of the southeastern USA. Here we report the first experimental tests of interactions between P.piscicida and estuarine zooplankton predators. specifically the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis and the calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa. Short-term (10 day) exposure of adult B.plicatilis to P.piscicida as a food resource, alone or in combination with the non-toxic green algae Nannochloris and Tetraselmis. did not increase rotifer mortality relative to animals that were given only non-toxic greens Similarly, short-term (3 day) feeding trials using adult A.tonsa indicated that the copepods survived equally well on either P.piscicida or the non-toxic diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. Copepods given toxic dinoflagellates exhibited erratic behavior, however, relative to animals given diatom prey. The fecundity of B.plicatilis when fed the toxic dinoflagellate was comparable to or higher than that of rotifers fed only non-toxic greens We conclude that, on a short-term basis, toxic stages of P.piscicida can be readily utilized as a nutritional resource by these common estuarine zooplankters. More long-term effects of P.piscicida on zooplankton, the potential for toxin bioaccumulation across trophic levels, and the utility of zooplankton as biological control agents for this toxic dinoflagellate. remain important unanswered questions. ¬© 1995 Oxford University Press.},

abstract={COMPETITIVE interaction between females of the same social group is characteristic of most primate species1‚Äì3. In Old World monkeys, females of high social rank maintain priority of access to scarce resources and harass low-ranking companions1‚Äì6. But different field studies have found differing correlations between female dominance and reproductive success: several populations show an advantage of rank whereas others do not1, 3, 5, 7. Although such variation may reflect divergent levels of predation, food availability or social stress in different environments, female competitive ability may also be balanced by significant reproductive costs and thus be subject to strong stabilizing selection. We report here that high-ranking female baboons (Papio cynocephalm anubis) at Gombe National Park, Tanzania, enjoy shorter interbirth intervals, improved infant survival, and accelerated maturation of their daughters. These advantages, however, are countered by a significantly higher probability of miscarriage, and a proportion of high-ranking females suffer from reduced fertility. ¬© 1995, Nature Publishing Group.

Dams and their 5-pup litters were observed for 45 min at night on days 9, 14, and 19 of lactation and during the day on day 14. A novel behavioral instrument was used to observe maternal and pup behaviors. At night, food-restricted animals engaged in more nursing behaviors than AL animals. Differential pup stimuli may account for this difference. AL animals engaged in more nursing behaviors during the day than night, whereas 70 AL animals demonstrated the opposite diurnal pattern. Time of feeding may explain this difference. On the other hand, 85 AL animals behaved similarly during the day and at night. Therefore, alterations in circadian behavior patterns are less pronounced in rats mildly restricted (85 AL) than in rats more food restricted (70 AL). ¬© 1995.},

Mean densities increased and mean home range size decreased in populations with supplemental food. Food acted indirectly on home range size via the effect of food on population density. Compared with other treatments, voles with supplemental food were less aggressive toward one another and showed fewer long movements between trapping sessions. Exposure to predation did not affect aggression among voles, but it appeared to reduce long movements between trapping sessions. This was probably a direct behavioural response of voles to the presence of predators. It is concluded that factors extrinsic to the vole populations can influence behaviour directly or indirectly. -from English summary},

One year later, findings based on Eating Style were replicated and extended in smaller groups of the original University subjects. Appreciable relationships occurred almost uniformly between Eating Style (addressing hunger, deprivation, and restraint) and proposed correlates. Feeling Deprived (a measure of avowed deprivation) correlated consistently with beliefs about weight control and weight variables, but not symptoms.

abstract={The role of delayed density-dependent processes in the dynamics of animal populations poses a problem for ecologists; although generally assumed important in populations that show cyclic or chaotic fluctuations, little experimental evidence for such processes exist. Through manipulation of vole densities within enclosed areas it was shown that reproduction, recruitment, and body growth rate in introduced populations were negatively affected by high previous density. In addition, female movement patterns shifted, and territoriality as well as home-range size was increased after high density. The observed changes in female spacing-behaviour suggested that negative effects of previous density were partly mediated by social interactions, and agreed with the finding that smaller (less competitive) females were the ones suffering most from increased competition. Contrary to expectations from recent work, predation could be excluded as the cause of delayed density-dependence in this study. Instead, chemical analyses of a dominating food plant suggested that herbivory at high vole-density had delayed negative effects on food quality.},

abstract={To investigate the function of the amygdala following traumatic brain injury (TBI), rats were tested on a gustatory neophobia task that is sensitive to amygdala and hippocampal damage. Rats were either injured at a moderate level of fluid percussion injury (2.1 atm) or surgically prepared but not injured (sham-injury). Seven days after injury (n = 8) or sham injury (n = 9), rats were habituated to the testing chamber without food items present for 30 min. All rats were then food deprived. Twenty-four hours later, rats were placed in the testing chamber for 30 min and allowed to eat freely from four dishes of different foods: rat chow, raisins, potatoes, and cookies. Results showed that injured and sham-injured rats did not differ in their ability to find hidden food, suggesting that TBI does not produce an enduring impairment of olfaction. There was also no difference in the total amount of food eaten between injured and sham groups (p > 0.05). The percentage of each type of food consumed did differ between the two groups with sham controls consuming more familiar food (rat chow) compared to the unfamiliar foods (p < 0.01). The injured animals distributed their eating evenly among the four foods with no particular preference for any one food (p > 0.05). This pattern of eating behavior in injured animals is similar to animals that have lesions to both the hippocampus and amygdala (Sutherland and McDonald, 1990). Therefore, the results of this experiment suggest that, in addition to the hippocampus, the amygdala may also contribute to the behavioral changes observed following TBI. ¬© 1995, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

Development of exploration and interactions with mothers and other group members were studied in 14 of these infants up to the age of 1 year. Activity profiles changed from 3 to 8 weeks as infants began to move off mothers and explore their environments. From 2 to 6 months time with mothers decreased; time alone increased correspondingly. Time spent with other group members did not vary significantly over the first year. By 7‚Äì9 months capuchin infants spent more time alone or with other group members than with mothers, although weaning was still not completed by the end of the first year. Simple environmental exploration began in the 2nd month and reached stable levels by 4 months. Complex manipulation of food and objects first began at 3‚Äì4 months and increased to stable levels in the second half of the first year. Some preliminary differences were evident between infants living in indoor cages and those living in indoor/ outdoor runs. Infants in cages spent less time in dorsal contact with mothers, and less time in social play and proximity to other animals than those in runs. Instead, infants in cages spent more time alone and engaged in more manipulation of food. Some measures of social and exploratory behavior showed a high degree of variability which may be useful in exploring individual differences in infant temperament or reactivity. ¬© 1995 Wiley‚ÄêLiss, Inc.

abstract={Objective: The primary purpose of this study was to compare obese versus nonobese adults and weight cyclers versus maintainers on measures of dietary helplessness, nutrition concern, dietary restraint, and disinhibition. Method: Dietary helplessness, nutrition concern, dietary restraint, and disinhibition were assessed in 385 healthy obese and nonobese men and women in the RENO Diet‚ÄêHeart Study, a 5‚Äêyear prospective investigation of cardiovascular risk factors, weight cycling, and lifestyle. Results: The results indicated that dietary helplessness and disinhibition were significantly greater in obese individuals, subjects with a history of weight cycling, and weight fluctuators (prospectively measured). Women were found to score significantly higher than men on measures of dietary helplessness, disinhibition, and cognitive restraint. Discussion: The role of nutrition attitudes is discussed in relation to dietary self‚Äêregulation, weight fluctuation, and management of body weight. ¬© 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

abstract={The anxiogenic action of bradykinin was investigated in rats and compared with that of yohimbine, a known anxiogenic agent. Bradykinin (0.5, 1 and 2 Œºg/rat) was administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.), whereas yohimbine (2 mg/kg) was administered i.p. The experimental methods used were the open- field, elevated plus-maze, social interaction and novelty suppressed feeding latency tests, and estimation of brain tribulin activity in terms of endogenous monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and MAO B inhibition. The behavioural and biochemical effects induced by bradykinin were qualitatively similar to those of yohimbine. Thus, both the drugs reduced ambulation and rears, and increased immobility and defecation, in the open-field test. They decreased the number of entries and time spent on the open arms of the elevated plus-maze, reduced social interaction in paired rats and increased the feeding latency in an unfamiliar environment in 48 h food-deprived rats. These effects are known to be associated with anxiety in animals. Bradykinin and yohimbine increased rat brain tribulin activity, the effect on the MAO A inhibitor component being more marked than that on the MAO B inhibitor component. The MAO A inhibitor component has been postulated to be the major anxiogenic moiety of tribulin. Lorazepam, a well known benzodiazepine anxiolytic agent, attenuated the anxiogenic effects of bradykinin and yohimbine, which may not be a functional effect. The investigation indicates that, like cholecystokinin (CCK), bradykinin may function as an endogenous anxiogenic peptide. ¬© 1995, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract={1. The effects of food level on the development of crests by Daphnia carinata in the presence of Anisops grains (Notonectidae) were investigated in two laboratory experiments and in the field. 2. in the laboratory experiments D. carinata were grown at different food levels either in the presence of A. gratus or in predator‚Äêfree water. in the field study the effects of six variables (temperature, food level, density of Daphnia, density of Anisops, brood size and maternal nutrition) on development of crests in the next generation of Daphnia were investigated over a 12‚Äêmonth period at a single field site. 3. in the laboratory food level had a small but significant effect on relative crest height of D. carinata. in the presence of notonectid predators the rate of crest growth relative to body length was higher than for control D. carinata only during embryogenesis and/or the first two neonatal instars. Beyond this age the rate of crest growth was similar in both morphs. 4. in the field study, crest height was negatively correlated with density of Daphnia and positively correlated with density of Anisops and maternal nutrition (maternal nutrition was defined as the somatic weight of a female with a body length of 2.5 mm, calculated from the length‚Äêdry weight regression based on a sample of the population). However, these data were biased by a short period when no Anisops were present in the pond. When these data were excluded, the only factor which significantly correlated with crest height was maternal nutrition. This finding indicated that relative crest height of the next generation was determined primarily during embryogenesis on the basis of maternal feeding success and possibly on food availability during the first two instars.

abstract={The availability of food to fish larvae influences the mean and variance of the growth rate in a cohort. At higher food densities, slower developing herring, Clupea harengus, larvae in the pre-metamorphic stage may co-occur with more developed, post-metamorphic individuals. The development of schooling in herring is closely associated with metamorphosis. To assess whether the presence of schooling conspecifics encouraged the premature development of schooling in larvae, laboratory reared larvae (length 29-31 mm) were exposed to wild-caught schooling juveniles (length 55 mm) for the duration of the experiment. Observations of larvae from the experimental group were carried out for 37 days and the behaviour of the fish was recorded on video for subsequent analysis. These larvae were observed in the presence and absence of schooling juveniles with no food in the observation tank, and a few minutes and 1 h after food was added. The behaviour of these two groups (juveniles present and juveniles absent) was compared with that of two additional groups (different rearing densities), where the larvae had not been exposed to schooling herring. The exposure to schooling conspecifics did not affect the degree of interaction among herring larvae unless the juveniles were present in the observation tank. Consequently, in the presence of a school the larvae seemed to opt for the increased protection of the school, regardless of associated disadvantages, such as greater competition for food. These findings are discussed in relation to larval vulnerability to predators. ¬© 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Recent experiments have shown that: 1) A chronic 10 month daily administration to rats of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor antagonist, flumazenil (FL; 4 mg/kg in drinking water), from the age of 13 through 22 months, significantly retarded the age-related loss of cognitive functions, as ascertained by the radial arm maze tests conducted two months after FL withdrawal. 2) An equal number of 8 rats died in the control and FL-treated group before the behavioral tests were completed and the animals were sacrificed; the life span of the FL-treated 8 rats equaled 24.0 (¬±0.6 SEM) months, while that of the control 8 rats equaled 22.3 months (+0.7 SEM), and the group difference was marginally significant (p=0.04 Mann-Whitney test). 3) In rats sacrificed 3 months after FL withdrawal and behavioral testing, the protective action of FL, relative to age-matched controls, was revealed by a significant reduction in the age-related loss of neurons in the hippocampal formation. 4) In the time period of 3 months between the drug withdrawal and sacrificing of the animals, stress experienced by the aging rats during behavioral testing, related to excessive daily handling of the animals and partial food deprivation to motivate them to perform in the radial arm maze, apparently had excitotoxic effects on the hippocampal neurons, as indexed by the presence of 30% neurons in a state of moderate pyknosis found both in the FL group and the age-matched controls. In the 6 months ‚Äúyoung‚Äù control group, the number of pyknotic neurons equaled only 3.5%. It was concluded that the drug withdrawal and stress of behavioral testing unleashed the previously FL-controlled age-related degeneration. On the basis of these results and the literature, showing that the tone of the GABAergic system increases with age, and particularly in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD), the hypothesis of brain aging was formulated. It postulates that in mammals, with growing age, and prematurely in humans with AD, the increasing tone of the BDZ/GABAergic system interferes with antero- and retrograde axonal transport through a chronic depolarizing block of preterminal axon varicosities of the ascending aminer-gic and cholinergic/peptidergic systems, which are indispensable for normal metabolic/trophic glial-neuronal relationships. Such a state leads to discrete anatomic deafferentation of forebrain systems, and particularly of the neocortex, where block of the anterograde axonal transport results in induction of the cortical mRNA responsible for synthesis of the Œ≤-amyloid precursor protein (Œ≤APP). The simultaneous block of retrograde transport from chronically depolarized preterminal axon varicosities may account for toxic accumulation in cortex of the nerve growth factor (NGF) and other trophins, without which the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons degenerate. The general pharmacologic profile of FL has been discussed on the basis of FL administration to animals and healthy and diseased humans. This profile shows that FL: 1) increases brain metabolic functions; 2) reduces emotional responses, thereby stabilizing the functions of the autonomic system in both humans and animals challenged by adverse environmental stimuli; 3) improves cognitive and coordinated motor functions in both humans and animals; 4) uniquely combines anxiolytic, vigilance and cognitive enhancing, i.e. nootropic, properties, which may, in part, stem from FL-induced emotional imperturbability (ataraxy); 5) facilitates habituation of healthy humans and animals to novel but inconsequential environmental stimuli, and promotes non-aggressive interactions among animals; 6) in single i.v. doses, and administered chronically to humans, FL has antiepileptic actions in the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and other forms of epilepsy characterized by ‚Äúspike-and-dome‚Äù EEG patterns; these actions are likely to depend on FL‚Äôs disinhibition of the serotonin system; 7) administered in single i.v. doses to healthy humans, or chronically to 3‚Äì4 month-old rats in drinking water, FL causes restless, curiosity-driven and non-aggressive exploratory beha-vior, an effect which is probably related to increased brain metabolic functions, which in rats is indexed by increased time the animals spend in REM sleep without disturbing slow wave sleep EEG patterns. ¬© Freund Publishing House Ltd.},

abstract={Individually identified Ourebia ourebi (Bovidae) were observed in Serengeti National Park for 1‚Äì8 mo, annually, from 1987 to 1993 to study flexibility in the size and composition of territorial groups. A total of 236 O. ourebi were resighted over periods of 1 yr or more. The modal number of adults in groups was three in all years (range: 1‚Äì7; xÃÑ = 3.1, SE = 0.2, n = 5 yr; 136 groups overall); maximum group size with adolescent young and calves was eight. In 32% of 136 identified groups, two adult males were resident for at least 1 yr, as were three adult males in 4% of all groups. Groups with up to three adult females were common (range: 0‚Äì5). Overall, 25% of 32 adult males and 27% of 26 adult females were still present on the territory where first identified after 4 yr. Only 14% of 35 male‚Äêfemale dyads remained intact over the same period. O. ourebi in Serengeti appear to be primarily polygynous, with a moderate rate of yr‚Äêto‚Äêyr residency in particular groups, and with a low rate of long‚Äêterm pairing between males and females. Groups with more than one adult male are not unique to Serengeti but their significance has not been previously considered. Comparisons across O. ourebi populations in Africa show that polygyny is positively correlated with the ratio of adult females to males, population density, mean group size, and the prevalence of multi‚Äêmale groups, but there is less evidence that these variables influence the number of adult males in groups. Experiments are required to determine how demography, predation pressure, and the quality and distribution of food influence group size and composition in O. ourebi and other small antelope. 1995 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Objective: The Stroop task is aimed at assessing attentional bias. Words are displayed one by one on a computer screen and subjects are instructed to name the color in which every word is printed. The attentional bias is supposed to be reflected in the extent to which the word meanings interfere with the speed of color naming: The longer the color naming latency, the larger the attentional bias. Experiments using this task have demonstrated attentional bias for eating and body shape‚Äêrelated words in bulimic, anorexic, and restrained subjects. Explanations of these results have generally been formulated in terms of restricted food intake or emotional concerns about food and body shape‚Äêrelated themes. In contrast, in the present article it was proposed that Stroop interference might reflect a tendency either to withdraw or approach food or body shape‚Äêrelated stimuli. Method: Fifty‚Äêone subjects (25 unrestrained, 26 restrained) were administered a Stroop task containing neutral, food, and body shape‚Äêrelated words. There were two conditions to which subjects were randomly allocated: the ‚Äúappetizer‚Äù and ‚Äúno‚Äêappetizer‚Äù condition. The appetizer was a bit of pudding to be ingested by the subject just before the Stroop task. Following the Stroop task an ice cream taste test was presented in which the subjects were allowed to eat as much as they liked. The amount of ice cream eaten was registered secretly. Results: The results show that in unrestrained subjects Stroop interference for food words was found only in the appetizer condition. Restrained subjects, however, showed a permanent interference for food words. A significant correlation of .58 between Stroop food‚Äêword interference and ice cream intake was found only in unrestrained subjects. In restrained eaters the correlation was near 0. No effect of condition or restraint was found on Stroop body shape‚Äêword interference. Discussion: The findings indicate that (1) ingestion of an appetizer seems to have evoked an attentional bias for food words in nonrestraints that correlated with food intake; (2) restrained eaters showed continuous attentional bias. This appears to support the urge‚Äêto‚Äêact explanation of Stroop interference. The lack of correlation between restraints' attentional bias and ad lib food intake could have been caused by inhibition of approach which is one of the characteristics of restrained eating: The present procedure seems not to have triggered disinhibited eating in these subjects. Among other things it is concluded that Stroop interference, as a measure of ‚Äúcraving‚Äù triggered by food cues, might be a useful aid in assessing the risk of relapse in treated binge eating patients. ¬© 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

abstract={Ecotoxicologists and ecologists have examined the effects of pollutants on individuals and populations largely in terms of one or only a few effects. Yet the recent trend toward a holistic approach to ecological risk assessment suggests that a rigorous paradigm should be applied to toxicants, from hazard identification to risk characterization. Recent discussions have recognized that an up-front problem formulation phase is more critical in ecological risk assessment than it is for human health risk assessment. In this article a modified environmental health risk assessment paradigm is used to examine the risk of lead to birds. This risk analysis is largely conceptual, based on laboratory and field data, and incorporates information currently available. The model expands the hazard identification phase to create a target identification phase that includes the identification of receptors, endpoints, relationships, spatial and temporal scales, and indicators. The target identification phase is unique to the particular hazard, species, population, or community being examined. Lead can cause mortality, or can indirectly affect populations through effects on the food base, avian behavior, reproductive success, and recruitment. Lead can (!) decrease the abundance and availability of prey, (2) bioaccumulate in prey causing increased lead toxicosis in predators, or (3) increase prey availability by interfering with its hiding or escape behavior. Moreover, lower abundance of prey can lead to starvation or nutrient deficiencies, which amplify the absorption and retention of lead. Lead also causes decreases in clutch and egg size, mortality of embryos and nestlings, depression of growth, and deficits in behavior that affect survival. Lead decreases migratory behavior, and increases vulnerability to cold stress, hunters, and other predators. Research needs for evaluating the risk of lead in birds include obtaining data on (!) metal dynamics within various tissues as a function of dose and time since initial exposure, (2) low-level effects on embryos, (3) effects on chicks following fledging and in the period prior to recruitment, (4) effects on adult foraging skills and reproductive behavior, and (5) the relationship between effects from exposure in the laboratory and those from exposure in the wild. This latter point is extremely important, particularly if wild birds have other means of ridding the body of lead not available or less apparent to laboratory birds. ¬© 1995 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Animal welfare, or well-being, is a social issue with ethical, scientific, political, and aesthetic properties. Answering questions about the welfare of animals requires scientific definition, assessment, solutions, and public acceptance. With respect to the actual well-being of the animal, most issues are centered on how the animal "feels" when managed within a specific level of confinement, during special agricultural practices (e.g., tail docking, beak trimming, etc.) and handling. Questions of this nature may require exploration of animal cognition, motivation, perception, and emotional states in addition to more commonly recognized indicators of well-being. Several general approaches have emerged for solving problems concerning animal well-being in intensive production systems: environmental, genetic, and therapeutic. Environmental approaches involve modifying existing systems to accommodate specific welfare concerns or development of alternative systems. Genetic approaches involve changing the behavioral and (or) physiological nature of the animal to reduce or eliminate behaviors that are undesirable within intensive system. Therapeutic approaches of a physical (tail docking, beak trimming) and physiological (drug and nutritional therapy) nature bring both concern and promise with regard to the reduction of confinement stress. Finally, the recent focus on commodity quality assurance programs may indirectly provide benefits for animal well-being. Although research in the area of animal well-being will provide important information for better animal management, handling, care, and the physical design of intensive production systems there is still some uncertainty regarding public acceptance. The aesthetics of modern intensive production systems may have as much to do with public acceptance as with science.},

abstract={An individual-based population dynamics model (IBM) was used to examine the effect of different behavioral, bioenergetic, and physiological assumptions on individual growth and development of the copepod, Metridia lucens, in the North Atlantic Ocean. Both intrinsic (nutritional condition, feeding history, size) and extrinsic (temperature, food resources) factors that might determine individual growth and development rates were examined. An advantage of an IBM is that it allows for inter-individual variability, and can thereby provide an indication of the range of responses that might arise from natural variation in environmental conditions. The model is a refinement of an earlier model that successfully reproduced the observed stage structure and abundance of Metridia pacifica in the sub-arctic Pacific (Batchelder and Miller, 1989). Consequently, parameters for the ingestion and metabolic functions were set initially to those found appropriate for M. pacica from previous model studies. Extrinsic forcing variables used to drive the population model were depth-specific temperature and chlorophyll a concentration. The model was run in two modes: chronological and individual. In the former mode, the model used measured temperature and chlorophyll a data to reproduce the life-history timing (phenology) and seasonal stage-structure of a M. lucens population measured in the early 1970s from Ocean Weather Station India in the North Atlantic. The individual mode was used to examine variation in growth caused by inter-individual variability in short-medium term starvation and feeding success. Ingestion, growth, and development were sensitive to variations in food resources. Factors that increased consumption rates, such as more effective searching for high chlorophyll layers, or recent starvation resulting in a ‚Äúhunger response‚Äù in the functional response relation, led to markedly faster growth and development rates. Model simulations indicate that inter-individual variability in growth dynamics decreased for copepods capable of plasticity in the physiological hunger response or more effective food-searching behavior. Such searching behavior accentuated already existing inter-annual and intra-annual differences in individual growth dynamics forced by temperature and food. Conversely, hunger acclimation reduced intra-annual (seasonal) variability and reduced, although only slightly, inter-annual variability in growth dynamics. These model results highlight the importance of understanding how copepods respond to environmental conditions. Two methods ‚Äì behavioral modification and physiological acclimation ‚Äì by which copepods might ameliorate low food conditions, lead to different responses to temporal and spatial variability of resources. ¬© 1995 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

The 'addicts' reported a significantly greater number of eating episodes and consumed a larger amount of chocolate than controls. 'Addicts' also rated depression, guilt and craving higher and feeling content and relaxed as lower before eating than controls. However, eating chocolate resulted in increased feelings of guilt in the 'addicts' and no significant changes in feeling depressed or relaxed. On indices of disordered eating and depression, 'addicts' scored significantly higher than controls; however, eating chocolate did not improve mood.

abstract={The present review focuses on the relation to human behavior and development of anthropometric or dietary indexes of mild-to-moderate malnutrition. The primary goal of the review is to integrate previous research findings with current findings from correlational studies conducted over the past decade. From this integration, the following conclusions may be drawn: 1) Chronic, mild postnatal malnutrition is associated with a variety of cognitive and behavioral deficits across the life span. The role of prenatal malnutrition in this process is less clear. 2) To understand the role chronic mild malnutrition plays in behavior and development, it is necessary to move beyond protein-calorie deficits to consider the role of intake of animal source foods and specific micronutrients such as iron, zinc and B vitamins. 3) Chronic mild malnutrition is embedded in a host of other biological and psychosocial risk factors. As a result, chronic mild malnutrition appears to be a necessary but insufficient condition for producing behavioral deficits. 4) The salience of chronic mild malnutrition as a risk factor is accentuated when other psychosocial-contextual risk factors are also present or when multiple low-level nutrient deficits are interacting. Suggestions for future research directions include an emphasis on interactions between nutrients and between specific psychosocial and nutritional risk factors; the ways in which individual (e.g., gender) or cultural characteristics can moderate nutrition development relations; and a broader range of populations, such as sibling or elderly caregivers, and outcome variables, such as social-emotional development, temperament and mental health.},

The four independent predisposing factors for the outcomes of incontinence, falling, and functional dependence included slow timed chair stands (lower extremity impairment), decreased arm strength (upper extremity impairment), decreased vision and hearing (sensory impairment), and either a high anxiety or depression score (affective impairment). There was a significant increase in each of incontinence, falling, and functional dependence as the number of these predisposing factors increased. For example, the proportion of participants experiencing functional dependence doubled (7% to 14% to 28% to 60%) (X2=119.8; P<.001) as the number of predisposing factors increased from zero to one to two to at least three. ‚ÄîOur findings suggest that predisposition to geriatric syndromes and functional dependence may result when impairments in multiple domains compromise compensatory ability. It may be possible to restore compensatory ability and prevent or delay the onset of several geriatric syndromes and, perhaps, functional dependence by modifying a shared set of predisposing factors. Perhaps it is time to take a more unified approach to the geriatric syndromes and functional dependence. ¬© 1995, American Medical Association. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Follow-up of early-treated children with PKU has shown that diet discontinuation in childhood presents risks of cognitive and emotional dysfunction in a substantial number of adolescents and young adults. This dysfunction includes IQ loss, mental processing abnormalities, learning difficulties, anxiety and personality disorders. In addition, neurologic deterioration has been reported in several such individuals. As a consequence of this current understanding of PKU, diet continuation, at least through adolescence and in the young adult years, is now recommended. Many centers are extending this to a policy of "diet for life". This represents a major challenge to adolescents and their families. Metabolic control using the criteria applied during childhood is virtually impossible to achieve past 12 years of age. Time constraints, social pressures, financial limitations and growing independence from the family combine to interfere with dietary control. Added to these difficulties are the biological changes during teenage years which reduce phenylalanine tolerance. To meet these challenges, we have identified a number of psychosocial factors that interfere with adherence to medical recommendations. The factors most highly related to metabolic control were social support for the diet and positive perceptions of treatment. This information has led to the development of support programs for adolescents and young adults with PKU.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract={The effects of diet history, hunger and predation risk on short-term behavioral decisions of dogwhelks were tested in a specially designed test apparatus, termed a linear feeding array (LFA). The LFA consists of a sequential series of prey items mounted in a flume with unidirectional current directed towards a test (predatory) animal, and into which potential olfactory cues regarding predation risk are introduced. For dogwhelks the array was constructed vertically to accomodate intertidal foraging movements and is termed a vertical linear array (VLA). The behaviors exhibited by the dogwhelks were interpreted from distribution patterns in the VLA. Recent experimental studies and advances in optimal foraging theory provided the basis for the hypotheses tested in the VLA, which included: foraging and other behaviors are affected by predation, animals will avoid risk in the presence of predation threat, responses to predation threat will be proportional to the number and kinds of predator cues present, and starved animals will take greater risks than fed animals. We also test the proposition that foraging decisions are further modified by age. Three groups of juvenile and adult animals were maintained on diets of barnacles, mussels or no food (starved). The scent of crabs and damaged conspecifics served as olfactory cues to predation risk. Dogwhelks exhibited a range of behaviors in the VLA including: sheltering, searching, feeding, and aerial climbing. Distribution of animals in the tank assumed a relatively stable pattern after 2-3 h. These patterns were interpreted as the consequence of heirarchial decision making including: (i) a decision to become active, leaving the resting place or water refuge adopted during initial placement, followed by (ii) a decision to move vertically upwards or downwards, and (iii) a decision to attack prey when encountered. Analysis of movement patterns revealed that the initial decision, analogous to leaving a crevice as the tide comes in, was influenced in adults by predator cues and in juveniles by both predator cues and diet history. Perceived risk, as crab and damaged-conspecific odors, made individuals more likely to remain inactive, a risk-avoiding strategy for animals already in a refuge. Starved animals were more likely to descend into the tank and attack prey than fed animals. Our results support the hypotheses that higher-order predators affect the foraging decisions of dogwhelks and that juveniles and satiated animals are more sensitive to predation risk than starved ones. Together, these and earlier studies suggest that dogwhelks assess their environment before foraging, and that they are attuned to reducing the risks of mortality. ¬© 1994 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The themes of sex, gender, and women's health have been analyzed by various sciences. Medical and public health literature report on clinical aspects and epidemiology of risks affecting women, especially those of the reproductive process. The sexual division of labor means that the natural function of the woman is not considered economically productive in contrast to men. Women tend to be concentrated in lower grades of the remuneration scale, prestige, and autonomy, a phenomenon called the feminization of poverty. The construction of genders in the perspective of health means that being a man or a woman produces sexual differences in attitude and activities, which bring about specific risks for health and differentiation in the levels of access to health resources. On the macro level institutionalized sex differences manifest themselves in the high prevalence of malnutrition among girls in Latin America, the 2-3 times higher rate of depression among women, the high incidence of mortality among women from cancer, and the abuse of medical technology such as cesareans and hysterectomies. The Program of Integrated Assistance in Women's Health was conceived for the prevention and diagnosis of cervical uterine cancer, breast cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, and access to and choice of contraceptive methods.},

abstract={The most serious health problem in Uganda is AIDS, and prevalence rates range from 2% in remote areas to 30% in cities. AIDS is often seen in infants who were infected by their mothers and who generally die by age 5. The disease is rare in children between age 5 and 14 years, at which time sexual activity begins and infection occurs. By 1993, approximately 115,000 children in Uganda had been orphaned by AIDS. Because of widespread poverty, orphans are at jeopardy for malnutrition and reduced educational opportunities. The health infrastructure, hampered by low spending and an emphasis on curative rather than preventative measures, has been seriously overburdened by the AIDS crisis. The economy has also been affected, since AIDS has taken a particularly heavy toll on those 15-40 years old upon whom economic activities, such as labor intensive farming and growing cash crops, depends. Investments in other areas are in jeopardy also as highly trained professionals leave work to care for the sick or become sick themselves. Declines in domestic income and savings have repercussions throughout the national economy. Widespread poverty also exacerbates the AIDS crisis, especially since poverty drives individuals into adopting risk-taking behavior such as prostitution. Domestic violence has also increased as wives have refused to have sexual intercourse with husbands whom they believe have HIV infections. In order to deal with this crisis, the entire Ugandan society must be mobilized. Alternative sources of income must be sought for the poor, income-generating activities must be available to AIDS patients and their families, health care expenditures must increase, and home-based health care should be promoted. It is absolutely urgent for Ugandans to translate their knowledge about the causes of AIDS into changes in their sexual behavior which will protect them from the disease.},

abstract={Although commonly accepted, there is essentially no direct support for the assumption that preventing weight gain after smoking cessation will improve the likelihood of remaining abstinent from smoking. First, developing interventions to prevent this weight gain has proven to be extremely difficult. To date, no adjunct behavioral treatment has been shown to be successful in attenuating cessation-induced weight gain in healthy ex- smokers. Reasons for this failure may stem from inadequate intensity of interventions, poor compliance due to the complexity of interventions aimed at both eliminating smoking and controlling weight, or to biological pressures for weight to increase after removal of the weight suppressing effects of smoking (i.e. altered energy regulation). Pharmacological interventions, despite being successful during brief periods of active use, have not been studied beyond several months' duration of treatment. Second and more importantly, prospective studies have not reported that weight gain after cessation directly predicts relapse, and results of a recent intervention indicate that adjunct weight control treatment may be associated with greater smoking relapse. Although contrary to common belief, these findings are very consistent with a large body of basic animal research showing that food or weight restriction increases drug intake. In light of these observations, a more prudent and fruitful approach for basic and clinical research may be to re-examine the fundamental relationships among smoking, eating, body weight, and perhaps weight-related attitudes, rather than developing intensive strategies for combating weight gain after smoking cessation. If further study continues to find no positive relationship between this weight gain and risk of subsequent smoking relapse, it may be necessary to consider developing treatments designed to help ex-smokers accept, rather than fight, weight gain after cessation.},

abstract={Predation and hunger are threats for most organisms, and appropriate behavioural responses to both factors should be shaped by natural selection. In combination, however, the behavioural demands of predation avoidance and effective foraging often cannot be satisfied at the same time and lead to a conflict within organisms. We examined the behavioural responses of two closely-related species of tadpoles, Rana lessonae and R. esculenta, to simulated predation by fish and hunger. Tadpoles, hatched and reared in the laboratory, were tested in a three-way factorial (predation risk √ó hunger √ó species) experiment with four predation levels and four hunger levels. Both species decreased their swimming activity with increasing predation risk. Predation risk did not influence the amount of activity time invested in feeding but caused the tadpoles to spend less time in patches with food. Refuges were not used to avoid predation. R. esculenta was more sensitive to predation risk than R. lessonae. Hunger increased both the activity of tadpoles and the amount of activity time invested in feeding, thus indicating an increased energy intake. No interactions were observed between predation risk and hunger. These results show that tadpoles possess genetically-based behavioural mechanisms that allow them to respond in a graded manner to predation and hunger. However, they did not balance the two conflicting demands of predation avoidance and effective foraging; the two mechanisms appeared to act independently. ¬© 1994 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Many species of animals face the continual problem of balancing the trade-off between reducing predation risks and maintaining or increasing their reproductive fitness. The terms of the trade-off are often asymmetric: each separate behavioral decision may lead to only a marginal increase in fitness, but may place the organism's entire future reproduction in jeopardy. Consequently, the organism's reproductive value is an important component of most antipredator decision problems. In this paper reproductive value is considered as an asset in need of protection. The "asset-protection principle" states that the larger the current reproductive asset, the more important it becomes to protect it. Because reproductive value is usually age and condition dependent, optimal antipredator behavior also often depends on these variables. I use a uniform modeling technique (dynamic programming) to address a variety of issues related to antipredator behavior ¬© 1994 International Society for Behavioral Ecology.},

abstract={In this study we investigated the effects of dietary fatty acid (FA) composition combined with postweaning environmental enrichment on brain fatty acid composition and behavior in mice. There were three dietary conditions: a saturated fat group deficient in essential fatty acids, a group deficient in n-3 fatty acids only, and a control group containing both n-3 and n-6 fatty acids in a ratio of 0.27. Animals were fed these diets during pregnancy and lactation and after weaning. Brain fatty acid composition was determined on days 1, 9, 17 and 25 after birth and in adult animals at 3 months. At weaning two females from each litter were assigned randomly to either an enriched or standard environmental condition. After six weeks in these environments they were tested in the Morris water maze and open field. Adult percentages of 22:6n-3 were present in the brain within the first week after birth. These values were reduced by 50% in the n-3 deficient diet and by 80% in the saturated fat diet; adult animals on the saturated fat diet were also severely retarded in growth. Animals fed the saturated fat diet were initially slightly slower in locating the hidden platform in the Morris maze relative to the control group, but this was not apparent in the reversal learning phase; a cued learning task using a visible platform indicated that these effects did not appear to be related to differences in motor or motivational capacities. The n-3 deficient group did not differ from either the saturated fat group or the controls. All dietary groups showed beneficial effects of environmental enrichment in decreasing their latency to locate the hidden platform, and these effects appeared to be partially independent of the increased swimming speed of the enriched animals. Enriched animals in all groups showed less rearing activity in the open field and spent more time stationary; the animals fed saturated fat reared less and travelled shorter distances more slowly. In all cases the effects of diet and environment were additive, thereby providing little support for the hypothesis that dietary fatty acid composition would affect the animals' capacity to benefit from the functional effects of environmental enrichment. ¬© 1994.},

abstract={This study determines the health profile of institutionalized street children in a Place of Safety in Durban. Fifty black street children who had been institutionalized for a period of not more than fourteen days were interviewed and health assessments were carried out. The children's weights and heights were recorded on growth charts and structured interviews were held. Generally the children were found to be deprived, both socially and physically. Minor health problems were common and some had more serious problems. Recommendations for effective primary health care are put forward.
In July 1991 in South Africa, nurses conducted health and growth assessments of and interviews with 50 street children 12-16 years old (40 boys and 10 girls) institutionalized in the Durban Place of Safety for no longer than 14 days to determine their current health status. 56% of the children were functionally illiterate, suggesting that most street children will be illiterate adults who will be unable to benefit from health education and will find it difficult to change their life-styles. All the girls were above the 3rd percentile for weight and 6 fell below the 3rd percentile for height. 62.5% of boys fell below the 3rd percentile for height. 37.5% of boys fell below the 3rd percentile for weight. The leading conditions included dental caries (25), skin conditions (e.g., scabies) (21), urinary problems (e.g., schistosomiasis) (19), injuries and old bone fractures (19), and malnutrition (13). Dental caries were most frequent among 12 year olds. 11 of the boys and none of the girls had dental caries. Children 12-13 years old were more likely to be malnourished than children 14-16. Boys were more likely to have blood in the urine while girls were more likely to have protein in the urine. 10 children had not been immunized, so the Durban City Health Department immunized them. The girls were more likely to be sexually active than boys (80% vs. 12.5%). One girl had had sexual intercourse with her father. Two girls had sexually transmitted diseases. The major drugs used were cigarettes (16), alcohol (9), cigarette stumps (8), and benzine (5). When ill, the children did not seek the services of medical personnel because they feared physicians and nurses and they had no money. These findings show that street children are at high risk for ill-health. Community health care workers trained in identifying street children and attending to their health needs are needed as well as intensified health education at the primary school level.},

abstract={The incubation routine and mass changes of male and female Blue Petrel Halobaena caerulea were studied at the Kerguelen Islands to investigate factors influencing the durations of incubation stints and foraging trips at sea and the factors determining nest desertion and return to the nest. The body mass at the start of an incubation shift and also when the bird was relieved varied throughout the incubation period, whereas the mass when birds deserted the nest was stable. Birds deserted the nest when their mass decreased to threshold, independent of the duration of the fast. Temporary egg neglect was observed in successful as well as in unsuccessful breeding attempts, but it increased the risk of breeding failure. The net and daily massgained at sea during the second part of the incubation period were higher than during the first part, suggesting an increase in food availability. During the first part, the mass gained at sea and time spent foraging were inversely related to the mass of the bird before it left the burrow, whereas a similar relationship did not occur thereafter. The results suggest the occurrence of a fixed mass threshold when birds decide to leave the nest if not relieved by their partner. The mass when a bird left its nest inffuenced the time spent foraging or mass gained when food was scarce. Although decision rules to leave the nest or return from the sea are related to body condition. the possibility of neglecting the eggs temporarily enables Blue Petrels to regulate the trade‚Äêoff between risks of breeding failure and risks of an increase in adult mortality. A model for behavioural decision to stop incubating or stop feeding, based on a variable set point, is proposed. Copyright ¬© 1994, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract={A role for the 5-HT1A receptor in learning and memory has been suggested by diverse evidence. The present paper deals with the acute effect of 8-OH-DPAT (a 5-HT1A agonist) administered to rats before or after training in an autoshaped lever-press response (a model of associative learning). The results show that 8-OH-DPAT improved consolidation of the conditioned response (CR) when injected post-training, but impaired it with pretraining administration. Both effects were time-dependent. When the compound was administered pre- or post-training to free-feeding or prefeeding animals, they did not learn the CR. When it was administered to retrained food-deprived animals, the compound was also inactive. However, with retrained animals on a free-feeding schedule, pre- or post-training administration of 8-OH-DPAT enhanced retrieval in a dose-dependent fashion. Pretraining administration of 8-OH-DPAT impaired food intake and exploration, and therefore learning. The present results strongly suggest a role of 5-HT1A receptors in the consolidation and retrieval of learning. Such improvement is independent of food intake. ¬© 1994 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract={Previous work with the ant Camponotus floridanus demonstrated that perception of competition can be clearly differentiated from effects of mortality and decreased resources. That is, brood biomass in ant colonies decreases as a consequence of a behavioral decision(s) rather than because of limited food availability or reduced numbers of brood tenders. The experiments presented here extend that work. Under experimental conditions, colony growth in C. floridanus is modified by distance between brood and unrelated conspecifics and by worker age distribution. When nonnestmates are encountered at the nest versus at a separate foraging site, less brood is maintained by a colony. Although colonies with older workers maintain a brood biomass similar to that of colonies with younger workers, that biomass is concentrated in fewer, larger, more rapidly maturing larvae. These effects seem to be due entirely to worker control. ¬© 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

abstract={This article explores recent research in psychology, physiology, endocrinology, and animal behavior that bears on the relationship between compulsive athleticism and the eating disorders. There are several differences and a number of likenesses between these groups. Both groups are composed of persistent, perfectionistic, high-achieving persons. Compulsive ('addicted') athletes appear healthier than eating-disordered patients on psychological tests, even though the athletes may do or say things that appear irrational. The relationship between compulsive athleticism and the eating disorders can best be described in terms of a risk-factor model. Perfectionistic persons can be easily caught up in a diet or exercise program and can become even more committed through social reinforcement and the formation of a reciprocal feedback loop. When perfectionistic persons engage in extreme exertion while following a restricted, 'healthy' diet, this can increase obsessional behavior by affecting mood and cognition. Eating-disordered patients experience similar changes in personality and behavior secondary to stress and dietary restriction.},

abstract={The performance of a passive avoidance task (measured for two trials based upon number of complete step-downs and latency to respond) and blood glucose levels were examined in five groups of animals. The groups included vasopressin-deficient (DI) and vasopressin-containing (LE) rats under ad lib (AL) and food-restricted (FR) conditions, as well as DI-FR animals provided with access to an 8% sucrose solution (SUC). In the AL condition, no significant differences were found between DI and LE animals in either step-down occurrences or blood glucose levels. However, the DI animals were significantly slower in latency to respond in trial 1. With FR, the LE animals resembled the LE-AL animals in both passive avoidance behavior and blood glucose levels. The DI-FR animals that were not provided with SUC showed an impairment in passive avoidance behavior and low blood glucose levels, whereas DI-FR animals provided with SUC showed an amelioration of passive avoidance deficiencies and had blood glucose levels comparable to AL animals and LE-FR animals. On trial 2, a significant negative correlation was found between number of step-down occurrences and blood glucose levels, and a significant positive correlation was found between latency to respond and blood glucose levels. The experiment demonstrates that: 1) because DI rats have a different responsiveness in novel situations, caution must be exercised in using response latency as a measure of passive avoidance performance in the AL condition; 2) AL and FR conditions produce different responses in DI, but not LE, animals; 3) deficiencies in passive avoidance behavior in DI-FR rats can be ameliorated by the consumption of exogenous carbohydrate; and 4) there is a significant correlation between blood glucose levels and passive avoidance behavior. ¬© 1994.},

abstract={Risk-sensitive foraging theory predicts that animals under energetic stress will prefer variable over constant food resources as a means of avoiding starvation. The foraging worker honey bee from a colony deprived of food should prefer to feed on variable flowers. Individual bees were given repeated binary choices between variable (10% and 30% mg solute/mg solution) and constant (20% mg solute/mg solution) sucrose concentrations delivered in plastic flower tubes of different colours. Sucrose concentration, rather than sucrose volume, was varied so that bees feeding on either constant or variable flowers would experience equal mean sucrose concentrations (20%) and nearly identical (on average within 0¬∑04 J/s) net rates of energy gain. Honey combs were removed or added to a colony to alter the colony's energy state. There was no difference between the preferences of bees from colonies with large amounts of honey and those from colonies with small amounts of honey. Fifty-three per cent of the 9775 flower visits made by 40 bees were to constant flowers. Because of the large number of foraging bees in the colony and the large number of flower visits that individual honey bees make during each foraging trip, the colony achieves close to the true mean of variable resources. Hence, honey bees are little affected by the variance of resources. ¬© 1993 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The long-term effects of wearing a radio collar, aerial radio-tracking and lair examination were assessed in cheetahs, a species potentially sensitive to disturbance and non-trivial handling. Females wearing collars weighing less than 2% of their body weight reproduced regularly, had equivalent food intake and hunting success and were in similar body condition to uncollared females. Collared and uncollared females failed to catch prey for the same reasons. Aerial radio-tracking that involved flying at tree height to pinpoint the locations of cheetahs did not appear to disturb habituated females or cause them to abandon their cubs. Entering lairs on foot to count and weigh cubs while the mother was absent did not appear to increase the likelihood of cub predation by other carnivores or abandonment by the mother. These results indicate that the behaviour and reproduction of even sensitive mammals need not be affected by field techniques, provided lightweight collars are used and stringent precautions are followed. Measures devised to determine the effects of non-trivial handling in this study are discussed in relation to those that can be obtained in other studies of large mammals. ¬© 1994 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={This study was intended to establish the pathogenic significance of sport and exercise in the development of eating disorders. Hospitalized eating disordered patients and an age-matched control group were assessed. Historical and current physical activity data were collected. An in-depth interview was also conducted to ascertain the age of onset of the diagnostic symptoms for eating disorders, and to determine whether; (i) exercising predated dieting; (ii) patients had been involved in competitive athletics; (iii) exercise was excessive; and (iv) weight loss was inversely related to level of exercise. The results indicated that patients were more physically active than controls from adolescence onwards, and prior to the onset of the primary diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa. A content analysis of the interview data indicated that 78% of patients engaged in excessive exercise, 60% were competitive athletes prior to the onset of their disorder, 60% reported that sport or exercise pre-dated dieting, and 75% claimed that physical activity levels steadily increased during the period when food intake and weight loss decreased the most. Together our results suggest that overactivity should not be routinely viewed as a secondary symptom in anorexia nervosa, equivalent to other behaviours. For a number of anorexic women, sport/exercise is an integral part of the pathogenesis and progression of self-starvation. ¬© 1994, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In the course of the German Collaborative PKU Study, the results of the Personality Questionnaire for Children (PFK 9-14) of 58 10-y-old patients treated early for phenylketonuria were analyzed. The main message of our data is that patients with phenylketonuria who were treated early and strictly did not show a higher risk for severe emotional and behavioral maladjustment compared with healthy controls at the age of 10 y. The patients were characterized only by ‚Äúless masculinity of attitudes.‚Äù Because no significant correlations were observed between the quality of dietary control and the results of the questionnaire, the noticed personality characteristic of the patients could be interpreted as a psychosocial consequence of the chronic disease. ¬© 1994 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.},

The children's levels of behavioral neophobia were significantly related to both their levels of trait neophobia and their parents' predictions of their willingness to eat the foods (r = 0¬∑38 and 0¬∑34, respectively, p < 0¬∑001). In addition, children's and parents' behavioral and trait neophobia scores were significantly related (both r = 0¬∑31; p < 0¬∑001).

abstract={The great flexibility of the feeding strategies exhibited by the ponerine ant Brachyponera senaarensis (Mayr) allows it to exploit either seeds or animal prey items as food resources. Predation is generally limited to small prey and is very similar to scavenging behavior. In laboratory conditions, the predatory behavior of B. senaarensis is not different in structure from that known in other carnivorous ants species. The workers forage individually and return to the nest using a series of cues involving light, a chemical graduated marking system near the nest entrance, and memory. During nest‚Äêmoving, recruitment by tandem running was observed. However, in colonies where the food supply is regular, workers that discover food do not recruit nestmates, but make repeated trips between the nest and the food source. On the contrary, in starved colonies, the introduction of prey may produce a massive exit of foragers, corresponding to a primitive form of mass recruitment similar to that observed in some other ant species. 1994 The Netherlands Entomological Society},

abstract={Physical contact between the freshwater ciliate Euplotes octocarinatus and its turbellarian predator, Stenostomum sphagnetorum, elicits a behavioural response of the potential prey which is different from the normal ‚Äúavoiding reaction‚Äù of Euplotes. Because of its defensive character it is called ‚Äúescape response‚Äù. The response was analysed by the use of a video camera and recorder system. It was found that the escape response takes a regular course, beginning with sudden backward moving of Euplotes, followed by a rapid turn around and a subsequent forward movement. Velocities during the escape response are 1 to 5 times higher than calculated for control cells. The whole reaction lasts about 2 s. Within this time a Euplotes cell moves more than 1,000 ¬µm away from its predator. While 90% of well-fed Euplotes cells demonstrated the defensive response, starved cells cultivated separately from their predators revealed fewer escape responses, however, several of the starved cells regained the capacity for the escape response after exposure to Stenostomum or Stenostomum-conditioned medium for 20 h. It is discussed whether or not the inducible behavioural response is triggered by the same predator-released substances that are known to induce defensive morphological changes in Euplotes. ¬© 1994, Gustav Fischer Verlag Jena.

abstract={Follow‚Äêup of early‚Äêtreated children with PKU has shown that diet discontinuation in childhood presents risks of cognitive and emotional dysfunction in a substantial number of adolescents and young adults. This dysfunction includes IQ loss, mental processing abnormalities, learning difficulties, anxiety and personality disorders. In addition, neurologic deterioration has been reported in several such individuals. As consequence of this current understanding of PKU, diet continuation, at least through adolescence and in the young adult years, is now recommended. Many centers are extending this to policy of ‚Äúdiet for life‚Äù. This represents major challenge to adolescents and their families. Metabolic control using the criteria applied during childhood is virtually impossible to achieve past 12 years of age. Time constraints, social pressures, financial limitations and growing independence from the family combine to interfere with dietary control. Added to these difficulties are the biological changes during teenage years which reduce phenylalanine tolerance. To meet these challenges, we have identified number of psychosocial factors that interfere with adherence to medical recommendations. The factors most highly related to metabolic control were social support for the diet and positive perceptions of treatment. This information has led to the development of support programs for adolescents and young adults with PKU. These programs include an annual New England maternal PKU camp, resource mothers program in which mothers of young children with PKU are matched to women with PKU who are either planning pregnancy or are pregnant and assist with meal planning, cooking, metabolic monitoring, and transportation to medical appointments as well as provide enormous emotional support to these young women, and PKU CORPS which brings together on‚Äêdiet adolescents for training and emotional support and then matches them with younger phenylketonuric children on diet. The benefits of these programs are becoming clear in terms of improved metabolic control, successful re‚Äêinstitution of diet, a more comfortable acceptance of PKU and better self‚Äêimage.

abstract={The effects of undernutrition during suckling, early environmental stimulation and naltrexone administration on the locomotor activity test were investigated in adult rats. Young rats were undernourished from delivery until weaning (23 days) by feeding their dams a diet containing 7% casein diet. Mothers of well-nourished rats were fed a 25% casein diet. After weaning, both groups of rats received standard lab chow. From day 2 to day 8 after delivery the animals were stimulated by being placed individually in plastic containers for 4 minutes. From day 12 to 19 the litters were removed from their home cages and placed for 10 min in plastic cages. Exploratory behavior was assessed using a biocompartmentalized open field. The number of crossings from one compartment to the other and the number of rearings were recorded. Undernourished animals crossed less frequently than control animals and presented a higher latency to the first crossing response. Early handling increased the total number of rearing responses regardless of nutritional treatment. Naltrexone administration caused a dose-dependent reduction in the number of rearing responses only in the well-nourished group.},

abstract={In four experiments with rats, the effects of the NMDA antagonist ketamine on several forms of gustatory learning were studied. Replicating previous findings, in Experiment 1 ketamine was shown to impair one-trial acquisition of a flavor aversion at the dose of 25 mg/kg, but also produced a significant state-dependency effect. In Experiment 2 ketamine did not alter the process of habituation of neophobia to a new flavor. Abolition of latent inhibition by ketamine injected before preexposure in Experiment 3a was not replicated in Experiment 3b when ketamine was injected before all phases of the experiment. Finally, in Experiment 4 rats injected with ketamine showed slower acquisition of a flavor aversion with a multiple-trial procedure but finally reached a level similar to that shown by saline controls. The implications of these results for an interpretation of the effects of ketamine on flavor aversion learning in terms of interference with flavor memory storage are discussed. ¬© 1994 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract={Predator-prey relationships mediated by chemicals (kairomones) in lake zooplankton communities are reviewed. Many zooplankton species change their morphology (anti-predator devices) in response to kairomones released from potential predators. Development of protruding structures (neckteeth, high helmets, long tail-spines) by the cladoceran Daphnia is induced by kairomones during the embryonic or juvenile stage. These structures are lost when the kairomones disappear. Rotifers are affected by kairomones indirectly through the mother's oogenesis. The effect of kairomones on morphology is influenced by temperature, food conditions for the prey, and by the nutritional state and density of the predators. Chemicals other than predator kairomones, such as chemicals released from non-predatory zooplankton and pesticides, can also induce morphological changes. Predator kairomones affect the prey's behaviour as well as morphology. Some zooplankton species migrate vertically to avoid predators in response to the kairomones. Cladoceran species show deterioration of life history parameters and a reduced population growth rate in the presence of kairomones, probably because they use energy for the morphological and behavioral responses. Kairomones reduce the tolerance of cladocerans to environmental stresses such as high temperature, food shortage, pesticide contamination and oxygen deficiency. -from English summary},

abstract={The effect of novelty, an environmental background variable affecting feeding and appetitive learning performance, was examined in a behavioral study of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. Transfer of snails into a novel aquatic environment (clean water) evoked exploratory behavior which manifested itself in an increased number of spontaneous rasping movements of the mouth over the second to fifth minute after exposure to the novel environment. The intensity of this behavior was much weaker in a familiar environment (used water from the home tank). Similarly, sucrose-induced feeding rates were highest when the snails were given the sucrose stimulus in a novel environment. The effectiveness of appetitive conditioning using tactile stimulus paired with food (Kemenes & Benjamin, 1989a) improved when the snails were subjected to conditioning in a novel environment. Satiety, an internal variable, suppressed the stimulating effects of the novel environment on the spontaneous, unconditioned, and conditioned feeding alike. After training in the novel environment, the conditioned response was retained for up to 12 days and thus provided a robust behavioral paradigm for the extension of the analysis to the neurophysiological mechanisms of factors affecting appetitive learning in molluscs. ¬© 1994 Academic Press, Inc.},

The trade-off between feeding maximization and predator avoidance in sticklebacks varied, depending on distance to cover, hunger level and the distance to the other fish. Hungry fish and the satiated fish in the safe areas were willing to risk feeding in confusing densities of prey (as in swarms), while satiated fish far from the cover were not.

abstract={Though logically distinct, functional and causal questions are intertwined in numerous ways. This is exemplified in both the meaurement and the analysis of anti-predator behaviour of two songbird species. Two non-trivial problems of measurement may hamper any in-depth analysis. First, when confronting one and the same predator stimulus situation, subjects may respond with one of a number of highly diverse protective types of behaviour. The diversity may be due to a hypothetical polyethism of performers versus non-performers of any particular ploy, or it may arise because of ploys being elicited at different motivational levels in some equally hypothetical common underlying command unit. Prior to investigating functional questions about any polyethism, the causal question of the motivational basis of behaviour performance must be answered. Once this question is settled, both functional and causal questions can be asked. Second, only once measures have been validated, are causal and functional questions complementary in both directions. First, the study of mechanisms may remain grossly incomplete if it fails to ask functional questions; entire risk-assessment mechanisms, for example, coping with predators in their overt absence may be overlooked. Furthermore, the study of function may yield the discovery of new perceptual, if not cognitive, abilities and force the researcher to look for alternative, for example, constraint-based, explanations. The latter are, at a more basic level, either causal or functional in nature. On the debit side of the functional approach, two benefits may accrue from a causal one. First, studies of function build on the existence of causal mechanisms, for example, the phenotypic, flexible self-assessment of residual reproductive value. Second, studies of causation may suggest a diversified look at function and thereby may help pinpoint targets of selection otherwise not thought off. Finally, the question of whether the mutualism between the functional and the causal approach is symmetrical is considered. ¬© 1994 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={In addition to being a pharmacological agent, alcohol (ethanol) can also be considered a food; the body can utilize effectively its calorific contribution. The consumption of alcohol has in many respects the same characteristics as the intake of food. In animal experiments, food intake decreases in relation to the calorific value of the alcohol consumed; in human studies, various results have been obtained from no compensation to full compensation for the contribution from alcohol. If a choice is possible, primarily the carbohydrate part of the diet is decreased for compensation to ethanol intake. Food, in turn, can influence alcohol consumption. There is evidence that it is the carbohydrate content of the diet which influences alcohol drinking. The daily intake of alcohol is equally or even better regulated than intake of carbohydrate, protein, or fat. There is a circadian rhythm of alcohol consumption which resembles the rhythm of food intake. However, the mechanism which regulates alcohol intake does not have a very strong influence on the behaviour of most animals or humans, and its control is often overpowered by outside factors. Nevertheless, it is important to identify the precise mechanism because a better understanding should provide valuable information for use in the search for risk markers and pharmacological treatments for alcoholism.},

abstract={An elevated plus-maze was used to study the ontogeny of the exploratory behaviors of early-protein-malnourished animals in an experimental aversive situation. Rats were malnourished by feeding their dams a 6% protein diet during the lactation period (0‚Äì21 days of age); controls received a 16% protein diet. From 21 to 100 days of age, all rats received a balanced lab chow diet. At 21, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 days of age, independent groups of malnourished and control animals were exposed to the elevated plus-maze and allowed to explore for 5 min. During this period, 12 behavioral categories (number of entries and time spent in the open and enclosed arms, total arms entries, attempts to enter open and closed arms, closed-arm returns, latency of first closed-arm entry, total immobility time, total grooming time, total rearings, total head-dippings, and total stretch attend posture) were recorded. The results showed that anxiety increased with age and that protein malnutrition produced alterations in the ontogeny of exploratory behaviors. It was shown that malnourished rats maintained or increased exploration in the maze with age, in contrast to well-nourished animals, which exhibited a steady decrease in exploration as they matured. The higher number of entries and time spent in the open arms suggest that the protein malnutrition causes a permanent increase in the impulsiveness and/or an increased drive to explore open-arm novelty, leading to a behavior consistent with lower anxiety in malnourished animals, relative to that in well-nourished animals, in this naturalistic animal model of anxiety. ¬© 1994, Psychonomic Society, Inc..

abstract={Coronary risk factors such as obesity, dyslipoproteinaemia and low physical fitness are often prevalent in childhood. In contrast, regular physical activity and healthy nutrition have been shown to be effective in primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. An increment in physical activity with concomitant weight loss has a profound influence on peripheral lipoprotein metabolism and has shown to improve the atherogenic lipoprotein profile. As risk factors often track from childhood into adulthood it seems inevitable to prevent or diminish risk factors as early as possible. Therefore, intervention programmes for prevention of coronary artery disease have to be conducted in childhood. Experience from an own intervention programme of obese children has shown that the combination of intensive dietary and physical education improves physical fitness, body composition as well as lipid metabolism. Whether short-term benefits will continue into adulthood and reduce coronary artery disease in midlife will have to be shown. Nonetheless, it seems out of question that children showing risk factors such as obesity or hypercholesterolaemia will benefit from early intervention programmes when changing dietary and exercise behaviours.},

abstract={Objective: Oxygen supply dependency at normal or high oxygen delivery rate has been increasingly proposed as a hallmark and a risk factor in critical illnesses. We hypothesized that as fas as an adequate oxygen delivery is provided, oxygen consumption, when determined by indirect calorimetry, is not dependent on oxygen delivery in critically ill patients whereas calculated oxygen consumption is associated with artefactual correlation of oxygen consumption and delivery. Design: Oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption and their relationship were analyzed prospectively. Metabolic data gained from both measured and calculated methods were obtained simultaneously before and after volume loading. Setting: The study was completed in the intensive care unit as part of the management protocol of the patients. Patients: 32 consecutive patients entered the study and were divided into 3 groups according to a clinical condition known to favour oxygen supply dependency: sepsis syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome and acute primary liver failure. Intervention: The rise in oxygen delivery was obtained by colloid infusion (oxygen flux test) performed in hemodynamically and metabolically stable patients. All were mechanically ventilated. No change in therapy was allowed during the test. Measurements and results: Oxygen consumption was simultaneously evaluated by calculation (Fick Principle) and direct measurement using indirect calorimetry. Oxygen delivery was derived from the cardiac output (thermodilution) and arterial content of oxygen. Oxygen supply dependency was considered while observing an increase in oxygen delivery greater than 45 ml/min¬∑m2. Irrespective of patient's clinical diagnosis and outcome, measured oxygen uptake remained unaltered by volume infusion whereas both oxygen delivery and calculated oxygen consumption increased significantly. Arterial lactate level&gt;2 mmol/l and measured oxygen extraction ratio&gt;25% failed to identify oxygen supply dependency when measured data were considered. Conclusion: Analysis of oxygen uptake, when measured by indirect calorimetry, failed to substantiate oxygen supply dependency in the vast majority of the critically ill patients irrespective of diagnosis and outcome. Mathematical coupling of shared variables accounted for the correlation between oxygen delivery and calculated oxygen consumption. ¬© 1994 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Stress intensifies release of catecholamines and corticosteroids that increase survival of normal animals when their lives are threatened. When magnesium (Mg) deficiency exists, stress paradoxically increases risk of cardiovascular damage including hypertension, cerebrovascular and coronary constriction and occlusion, arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). In affluent societies, severe dietary Mg deficiency is uncommon, but dietary imbalances such as high intakes of fat and/or calcium (Ca) can intensify Mg inadequacy, especially under conditions of stress. Adrenergic stimulation of lipolysis can intensify its deficiency by complexing Mg with liberated fatty acids (FA). A low Mg/Ca ratio increases release of catecholamines, which lowers tissue (i.e. myocardial) Mg levels. It also favors excess release or formation of factors (derived both from FA metabolism and the endothelium), that are vasoconstrictive and platelet aggregating; a high Ca/Mg ratio also directly favors blood coagulation, which is also favored by excess fat and its mobilization during adrenergic lipolysis. Auto-oxidation of catecholamines yields free radicals, which explains the enhancement of the protective effect of Mg by anti-oxidant nutrients against cardiac damage caused by beta-catecholamines. Thus, stress, whether physical (i.e. exertion, heat, cold, trauma-accidental or surgical, burns), or emotional (i.e. pain, anxiety, excitement or depression) and dyspnea as in asthma increases need for Mg. Genetic differences in Mg utilization may account for differences in vulnerability to Mg deficiency and differences in body responses to stress.},

abstract={Aims. In recent years, inmates with concomitant drug and/or alcohol abuse have consistently grown in number in Italy. In the same period, the number of HIV-seropositive subjects and those with AIDS-related disorders has increased. For this reason, research to evaluate the relationships between psychiatric disturbances, drug abuse and HIV diffusion was conducted in the prison of Udine, a city in northeast Italy. Method. All inmates (485 subjects) admitted to the prison in 1990 were investigated. HIV infection was detected by the ELISA test; positivity was confirmed by the Western blot test, Hemalog, lymphocyte type test, antigen HIV p24 test and skin test (Multitest Merieux). Psychiatric disturbances were evaluated using the DSM- III-R criteria. Results. 29 subjects (6%) were HIV-seropositive; 25 subjects because of intravenous drug use, and 4 because of sexual contacts or tattooing. AIDS-related disorders were found in 17 (59%) of the HIV- seropositive. HIV-seropositive inmates had a higher incidence of personality disorders (72% antisocial behavior) and of multiple previous imprisonments (93%). In prison, they manifested more frequent auto-agressive behaviors (35%) and neuropsychiatric disturbances (10%). Conclusion. 'Antisocial' traits in inmates were the main risk factor for the exposure to HIV due to their 'high-risk' sexual behaviors, tattooing and intravenous drug use and due to the precarious living conditions and malnutrition status of this group.},

abstract={Limited information is available on the educational and behavioral functioning of short children. Through 27 participating medical centers, we administered a battery of psychologic tests to 166 children referred for growth hormone (GH) treatment (5 to 16 years) who were below the third percentile for height (mean height = -2.7 SD). The sample consisted of 86 children with isolated growth-hormone deficiency (GHD) and 80 children with idiopathic short stature (ISS). Despite average intelligence, absence of significant family dysfunction, and advantaged social background, a large number of children had academic underachievement. Both groups showed significant discrepancy (p <.01) between IQ and achievement scores in reading (6%), spelling (10%), and arithmetic (13%) and a higher-than-expected rate of behavior problems (GHD, 12%, P <.0001; ISS, 10%, P <.0001). Behavior problems included elevated rates of internalizing behavior (e.g., anxiety, somatic complaints) and externalizing behavior (e.g., impulsive, distractible, attentionseeking). Social competence was reduced in school-related activities for GHD patients (6%, p <.03). The high frequency of underachievement, behavior problems, and reduced social competency in these children suggests that short stature itself may predispose them to some of their difficulties. Alternately, parents of short, underachieving children may be more likely to seek help. In addition, some problems may be caused by factors related to specific diagnoses. ¬© 1994 by Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={Despite much debate over a presumptively somatic vs psychological etiology of nonatopic food and chemical sensitivities, little systematic research has addressed the issues. The present study investigated self-reported illness from several common foods (wheat, dairy, eggs) and chemicals (pesticide, car exhaust, paint, perfume, new carpet), symptom patterns, and psychological profiles of a sample of young adult college students (n = 490, age 19.4 ¬± 2.4, 52% female/48% male).Subjects were divided into 4 groups on the basis of sample medians for frequency of illness from the foods (FI) and chemicals (Cl): High FI with high Cl (FI/CI), high FI alone, high Cl alone, and NOILL (low FI and Cl). FI was associated with more defensiveness (denial of negativity) while Cl was linked with more shyness (avoidance of novelty). Women outnumbered men in all groups (FI/CI: 61%; FI: 80%; Cl: 55%) except the NOILL (40% women). Nevertheless, the FI/Cl, FI, and/or Cl groups still had significantly higher total symptom scores as well as more indigestion, headache, and memory trouble than did the NOILL group, even after depression, anxiety, shyness, defensiveness, and gender were covaried. The illness groups reported significantly more limitation of foods that mobilize endogenous opioids or generate exogenous opioids (sweets, fats, bread) as well as more illness from opiate drugs, small amounts of beverage alcohol, and late meals. Nasal symptoms from pollens or animals were more common in the FI/CI (42%) and Cl (42%) than in FI (26%) or NOILL (28%) groups. Premenstrual tension syndrome and irritable bowel were also more common in the FI/CI group. The findings indicate that young adults outside the clinical setting who are relatively higher in FI and/or Cl have distinctive symptom and psychological patterns. Covariate analyses suggest that important symptoms in FI and Cl individuals such as indigestion, headache, and memory problems may occur in addition to rather than as simply part of emotional distress. The data are consistent with a previously hypothesized role of olfactory-limbic and hypothalamic pathways and with a time-dependent sensitization model for illness from foods and chemicals. ¬© 1993 American College of Nutrition.},

At the beginning of the year, the large Daphnia produce large neonates. With the coming of the warm season, a decrease in size at first reproduction and minimum size of neonates is observed which may be related to the increase in food availability. Also the maximum size attained tends to decrease from spring to summer, probably in relation to the increase in fish predation. A general increase in size is again found in late summer (August) as a result of the increase in head length and in head/carapace ratio, mainly observed in the smaller size fraction of the population (‚â§ 1000 Œºm). This result supports the hypothesis of invertebrate predation as a major factor responsible for the success of 'long head morphs'. ¬© 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={Paltothyreus tarsatus workers show an adaptive predatory strategy compatible with central place theory which predicts that single-prey loading is an extension of the optimal diet choice while multiple-prey loading behavior would correspond to the optimal use of patches. The insight learning involved in the quick modifications of predatory strategy enables P. tarsatus to hunt all available prey in a great diversity of sizes and species. Nevertheless, this generalist predator strongly preferred termites and very large prey such as giant diplopods and crickets to other choices within its diet. In the hunting of these favorite prey, the recruitment of nestmates enhanced the efficiency of total predation, though the release of a chemical trail appeared to depend on the hunger-satiety balance of the colony. In addition to the hunger, the miscapture of prey also triggered the release of chemical trails. The strategy for capturing grouped termites was characterized by the loading of multiple prey at a single time, by a concentrated search in a restricted area and by an optional recruitment of nestmates. These behavioral characteristics of ponerine ants probably account for the flexibility of their predatory strategy for hunting aggregated small prey. ¬© 1993 Japan Ethological Society.},

abstract={A field experiment was performed to examine the effect of a change in energy reserves on the trade-off between foraging and predator vigilance. Free-living juvenile female Belding's ground squirrels, Spermophilus beldingi, were observed in three-step experiment. First, a squirrel's behavioural response to a tape-recorded conspecific alarm call was observed (playback 1). Then, over a 6-day period, either ad libitum foraging was supplemented with an energy-rich food (peanut butter mixture), or foraging opportunities were restricted for a few hours every day, during which an energy-poor food (lettuce) was available. These two treatments resulted in weight gain ('supplemented' group) or moderate weight loss ('deprived' group), respectively. Finally, a squirrel's response to a second alarm call was observed (playback 2). During playback 2, deprived individuals were less vigilant and foraged more than supplemented individuals. At playback 2, vigilance was positively related and foraging was negatively related both to a measure of body condition and to the mass change during treatment. Body condition and mass change during the previous week were not independent, making it difficult to determine which had a greater impact on foraging activity. However, in the week after playback 2, when all squirrels were foraging freely, the deprived group showed a greater rate of mass gain than the supplemented group. These results suggest that (1) the foraging versus vigilance decision is affected by body mass deviations from a 'set-point', and (2) a moderate reduction in energy stores can influence the trade-off between foraging and vigilance even though there is no short-term threat of energetic shortfall. ¬© 1993 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={To examine consumer concern about food safety, identify characteristics of those most concerned, and determine behavioural responses to concerns, we used mailed questionnaires to survey a random sample of 630 adults. Eighty‚Äêeight percent of respondents were very or somewhat concerned about safety of the food supply. Subjects perceived greatest likelihood of harm from chemicals and lowest likelihood of harm from bacterial contamination. Relative to other concerns about food such as cost or taste, food safety ranked low. Because the concern was across all ages, education levels, genders, and places of residence, we were unable to define a type of person most likely to be concerned about food safety. Less than half the subjects had changed dietary behaviour in response to food safety concerns. Foods reduced or eliminated from the diet most often were meats, fruits, eggs and vegetables. The findings indicate that consumers need risk assessment education and help in making food choices that do not compromise diet quality. Copyright ¬© 1993, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract={In S-central Norway, during the day in winter, smaller brown trout (<25 cm) sheltered passively in the substrate or in submerged vegetation, and were almost never active during daylight hours. This behaviour was consistent throughout the winter until water temperatures rose in spring. Larger trout (25-60 cm) were actively aggregating in deep-slow stream areas during the day. During the night the trout exhibited a third behavioural strategy. Fish were exposed and holding positions above or on the substrate. The trout were active throughout the night from dusk to dawn, and this behaviour was consistent throughout the winter. Spatial niches at night were selected principally on the basis of focal microwater velocities. The fish minimized energy expenditure by selecting habitats with low water velocities (pools, back eddies, stream bank areas). When passively sheltering during the day, interstices in the substrate or macrophytes providing shelter were the more important microhabitat characteristic. Feeding continued at night during winter, but the nocturnal activity pattern was not principally determined by food availability, since invertebrate drift did not show such periodicity. The behaviour and spatial niche selection by brown trout is explained as an ecologically adaptive homeostatic behavioural response to buffer the energy deficit and adverse environmental conditions experienced by the wintering fish. The nocturnal activity strategy reduces the risk of habitat exclusion and microhabitat inclusion by ice formation, and sheltering in the day reduces the energy expenditure and the risk of predation. Thus, the behaviour in winter is best described as a cost-minimizing shelter-and-move strategy. Little aggression in trout during winter suggests that social interactions may be less important as a factor regulating populations in winter than in summer. -from Authors},

abstract={Previous work has shown that chain manipulation and excessive drinking develop in sows, Sus scrofa, only when the sows are food restricted and confined, and that their occurrence is concentrated mainly in the post-feeding period. The present study investigated whether ingestion of food stimulates the performance of these stereotypies. In experiment 1, sows had been exposed to 7 months of restrictive housing and feeding conditions (2.5 kg of food/day; normal feeding time 0900 hours), during which they had developed stereotypies, mainly stereotyped chain manipulation and excessive drinking. Treatments, applied at 1350 hours, were the introduction of a novel sound (duration 10 min) and delivery of an extra meal (ingestion time approximately 10 min). Each treatment was applied to all sows simultaneously on two separate occasions. Levels of stereotypies measured over 2 h after the novel sound did not differ from preceding control days. In contrast, levels of stereotypies measured over the 2 h following ingestion of the meals were significantly higher relative to controls. In experiment 2, subjects were sows normally fed a meal of 2.5 kg of concentrated food at 0900 hours, which had already developed chain manipulation and excessive drinking. On treatment days, at 0900 hours, they received 0, 0.5, 1.25 or 5 kg of the same food. Non-delivery of food was followed by reduced levels of both chain manipulation and drinking. Ingestion of a smaller or larger meal than usual had little effect on levels of post-feeding stereotypies. The results of both experiments suggest that ingestion of food stimulates the performance of established stereotypies. The effect cannot be explained simply by differences in nutritional status, and it is suggested that it reflects changes in motivational state and behavioural activation. ¬© 1993 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The future revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) will describe diagnostic criteria for two anorexia nervosa subgroups: a binge eating or bulimic subtype, and a severe food restriction subtype. The present literature review will help orient nutrition and dietetic students, educators and researchers to the empirical bases for these subtypes. Available research on these two subtypes is equivocal. However, some important trends have emerged. Compared with restricting anorexics, bulimic anorexics are described by others as being significantly more unhappy during childhood and displaying a greater range of impulsive behaviors. In addition, bulimic anorexics have a higher lifetime prevalence of formal mood disorders, tend to use more alcohol and drugs, and tend to meet the criteria for DSM III-R Cluster B Personality disorders rather than those for Cluster C. Also, the bulimic subtype tends to have a more chaotic family environment. Finally, more patients of the bulimic subtype seem to show subaverage bone density, suggesting a higher risk for chronic osteoporosis. The present review discusses the significant research and treatment implications of the differences between these anorexic subtypes. ¬© 1993, Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior.

abstract={Motility, feeding and growth of a planktonic ciliate and copepod were investigated in a computer simulation. Growth, expressed as reproductive output, declined as food heterogeneity increased, but with a kinetic behavior and a transient response, copepods and ciliates were able to utilize the scarce, but high concentration food layers in the most patchy environments. Ciliates grew more at high food concentrations than copepods did, due to differences in the functional response. Predation risk associated with each behavior was calculated for an ambush predator and was proportional to diffusion rate of the prey. Cruising and visual predators were treated qualitatively. Because of the larger size and higher search motility, copepods experienced a larger total predation risk than ciliates. Natural selection should favor high ingestion in ciliates, but for copepods, predation avoidance is as important as high ingestion for overall fitness. -from Authors},

Population cycles take place in spite of stabilising social mechanisms, not because of them. Studies have uncovered correlation between social organisation and quality of food and habitat. This led to comparisons between species and among populations. Questions studied were the effect of familiarity of interacting individuals on population growth and spacing behaviour, comparison of dispersal patterns between Microtus and Clethrionomys, and the effects of odours of conspecific and heterospecific rodents and of predators on the reproduction of individual voles. Recently research has focused on predatory-prey interactions between rodents and their main predators, mustelids and raptors. Results imply that behaviour of voles exhibits great phenotypic plasticity as response to changing environment. -from Authors},

Evidence of saccharin's distinctive taste in rats is reviewed, followed by discussion of several modulating variables. Procedures that influence rats' responses to saccharin and their measurement are summarized, and the argument is advanced that saccharin can be used to study the relationship of taste and ingestion to learning, stress, and emotional processes in rats and humans. ¬© 1993 Pergamon Press Ltd.},

abstract={This study aimed to assess the suitability of using video images to study social facilitation of feeding behaviour in domestic chickens (Gallus domesticus). A comparison was made between the chickens' responses to a real bird feeding in an adjacent cage (RB) and a video image of the same bird feeding, displayed on a television screen (VB). The amount of food consumed by the subject bird was significantly greater (P < 0.05) during the RB treatment than when the stimulus cage was empty (RC). Likewise, the amount of food consumed was significantly greater (P < 0.05) when the video and sound of a bird feeding (VB) was presented than when the video image was of an empty cage (VC). The number of food pecks, although greater in the RB than in the RC treatment (P < 0.001). was not significantly different between the VB and VC treatments (P < 0.07). Dividing each of the 30-min trials into three consecutive 10-min intervals and repeating the analysis, suggested that this lack of overall difference may have been due to the initial novelty of the television screen or to a delay in recognizing and responding to the video image since, by the final 10-min interval, the number of pecks was greater in the VB than in the VC treatment (P < 0.05). It was concluded that video could be used to study social facilitation of feeding behaviour and, possibly also, of other behaviour patterns which occur less frequently or are not so easily elicited by prior deprivation. Video images may also provide an opportunity to identify the key stimuli in feeding behaviour that elicit the social facilitation, since the sequence of the behavioural components can be edited or the image experimentally manipulated independently of the behaviour of the subject bird. ¬© 1993.},

abstract={An elevated plus-maze was used to investigate the effects of repeated testing on the locomotor and exploratory behaviors of malnourished rats. Pup malnutrition was induced during the lactation period (0 to 21 days of age) by feeding the dams a protein-deficient diet (6% protein) and the animals were allowed to recover from weaning to 70 days of age by eating a commercial lab chow diet. Control animals were suckled by dams receiving a normal protein diet (16% protein) during the lactation period and were fed a commercial lab chow diet after weaning. At 70 days, malnourished and control animals were placed on the central platform of the elevated plus-maze facing an enclosed arm and allowed to explore for 5 min. This procedure was repeated at 24-h intervals for 6 days. The repeated testing in the elevated plus-maze did not change the total number of arm entries and attempts to enter open arms, but decreased the percentage of open arm entries, time spent in open arms, and total time spent on the central platform. These data suggest an increase in anxiety with repeated testing in the elevated plus-maze. In addition, the malnourished animals showed a larger number of both rearings and attempts to enter the open arms, suggesting a high level of exploration and/or high impulsiveness of these animals as compared to control. The elevated plus-maze proved to be a useful animal model to evaluate exploratory behaviors in early protein malnourished animals. ¬© 1993.},

abstract={Heteromyid rodents (kangaroo rats, Dipodomys spp.; kangaroo mice, Microdipodops spp.; pocket mice: Perognathus spp. and Chaetodipus spp.) make excellent models for answering questions about the evolution of diverse behaviour patterns. Most heteromyids, unlike other rodents, are nocturnal inhabitants of arid environments. As many as six species of these seed-eating mammals co-exist in habitats ranging from wind-blown sand and desert shrub to grassland and chaparral. A key question in the foraging literature is how desert granivores co-exist. Foraging choices are complex, and heteromyids optimize foraging based on interactions of multiple factors: Size, distribution, energy, nutritional value and water content of seeds; soil density and texture; and their ability to cache and recover seeds. Another question of interest is how heteromyids avoid diverse predators in open habitats. Many heteromyids avoid visually hunting predators on moonlit nights by switching their activity from open microhabitats to shrub habitat. Kangaroo rats and mice escape by bipedal locomotion after detecting either low-frequency sounds made by predator movements, or snake odours. Two kangaroo rat species confront snakes by kicking sand and footdrumming. Comparative studies of heteromyids also can answer questions about the evolution of mammalian social organization, such as: How social are solitary rodents? Solitary heteromyids have a well-integrated social system promoted by the establishment of familiarity with close neighbours. Spatial overlap and delayed dispersal, which lead to temporary family groups and long-term occupancy of the same home ranges, facilitate neighbour recognition. Heteromyids of both sexes mate with familiar neighbours in both exclusive and multiple matings. A final question related to social behaviour is: How do mammals communicate in desert environments? Kangaroo rats communicate identity through scent deposited at sandbathing sites, and at least one species (D. spectabilis), through individual footdrumming signatures. Both means of communication appear to be effective in sandy soils and open habitats. In conclusion, heteromyids can be used in future studies to examine a variety of behavioural patterns, ranging from individual foraging and predator defence to mating strategies and other social interactions. ¬© 1993 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={The authors propose a computational theory of the hippocampal region's function in mediating stimulus representations. The theory assumes that the hippocampal region develops new stimulus representations that enhance the discriminability of differentially predictive cues while compressing the representation of redundant cues. Other brain regions, including cerebral and cerebellar cortices, are presumed to use these hippocampal representations to recode their own stimulus representations. In the absence of an intact hippocmpal region, the theory implies that other brain regions will attempt to learn associations using previously established fixed representations. Instantiated as a connectionist network model, the theory provides a simple and unified interpretation of the functional role of the hippocampal region in a wide range of conditioning paradigms, including stimulus discrimination, reversal learning, stimulus generalization, latent inhibition, sensory preconditioning, and contextual sensitivity. The theory makes novel predictions regarding the effects of hippocampal lesions on easy‚Äêhard transfer and compound preexposure. Several prior qualitative characterizations of hippocampal function‚Äìincluding stimulus selection, chunking, cue configuration, and cotextual coding‚Äìare identified as task‚Äêspecific special cases derivable from this more general theory. The theory suggests that a profitable direction for future empirical and theoretical research will be the study of learning tasks in which both intact and lesioned animals exhibit similar initial learning behaviors but differ on subsequent transfer and generalization tasks.

abstract={In order to evaluate the action of central nervous system Corticotropin-Releasing Factor (CRF) in the control of feeding behavior the present studies employed a dietary self-selection task sensitive both to overall appetite as well as preferential intake of familiar versus unfamiliar foods. Prior to the diet selection test, one group of nutritionally stressed animals was fed a protein deficient diet in order to increase the preference for unfamiliar foods relative to nutritionally replete subjects. Both CRF (0.05 and 0.5 Œºg ICV) and physical restraint (30 min) attenuated selectively the consumption of a novel food choice by deficient animals without affecting concurrent intake of familiar food. Further, CRF administration did not alter water intake or consumption of either diet by the replete control group suggesting that the peptide produced a stress dependent, enhanced response to novelty without a general effect on appetite. The CRF antagonist, Œ±-helical CRF9-41 (1, 5 and 25 Œºg ICV), increased familiar diet consumption in nutritionally deficient subjects without affecting the self-selection pattern or replete controls. Chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) also increased selectively the intake of familiar food suggesting that this action is the anxiolytic complement of the effect of stress in this paradigm. The CRF antagonist (5 and 25 Œºg) reversed the anorexia produced by CRF (0.5 Œºg) as well as that induced by restraint stress. These results favor a direct role for endogenous CRF systems in coordinating the behavioral responses to dietary stress. ¬© 1992 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The hermit crab Pagurus acadianus (Benedict) possesses two major defences against mobile aquatic predators, viz., fleeing and refuging in its gastropod shell. When approached by a potential predator, a crab must choose to either continue its current activity (e.g., feeding), flee or hide in its shell. If a foraging crab flees when threatened, it must secondarily decide whether to carry its food item and, if so, how far to carry it whilst escaping. Alternatively, if the crab takes refuge in its shell, it must then decide how long to remain hidden and when to resume locomotory activity following emergence from the shell. Because these behavioural alternatives have associated costs (e.g., energy expenditure, predation risk, lost foraging opportunity), the crabs' decision as to which behaviour to adopt should be sensitive to the respective cost of each. We tested specific predictions of this general economic hypothesis of behavioural decision making by varying the weight of food items presented to crabs (= lost feeding opportunity cost, energetic cost of carry) and the amount of time the crabs were "handled" by a predator following "capture" (= predation risk). Most crabs tested fled from an approaching lobster predator model. Contrary to expectation, flight initiation distance was unaffected by the mass of the food item available to the foraging crabs. As predicted, however, the distances fleeing crabs carried individual food items varied inversely with the food's weight. Time spent hiding in the shell and latency to resume locomotion following a predator "attack" were relatively unaffected by the size of the food item available. As expected, the crabs' decision to emerge from their shell following a threat appeared sensitive to their perceived risk of predation, as evidence by an observed positive relationship between refuging time (in shell) and the duration of preceding handling of the crab by the predator. These findings are interpreted within the cost-benefit framework of behavioural decision making. ¬© 1992.},

abstract={Male rats (Rattus norvegicus) were given continuous access to estrous female rats for 24 hr each day for 10 days. During the first 12 hr, the rats achieved an average of 10 ejaculations, followed by a 1- to 2-day recovery period with little sexual activity. During the last 7 days, the rats maintained a reasonably stable equilibrium level of 3 ejaculations per day. These occurred predominantly during the dark phase of the diurnal cycle, they frequently occurred in a cluster, and they usually occurred shortly after the introduction of a novel estrous female. Except for quantitative differences, these results are generally consistent with conventional research but systematically extend the generality of the results to the context of the free behavior situation. The availability of sexual activity had no appreciable effect on food and water intake, but it did decrease the amount of running activity.},

abstract={The original, prescientific Western belief that the mantis is a pious, helpful creature became a widely held explanation for the mantid's unique resting (apparently prayerful) posture, and for one of its cryptic displays (extending the forelegs straight out). This belief was a characteristic part of a broader discourse about nature in which ancient authority, religious beliefs, and superstition, but few original observations, mixed freely. Gradually, the belief in mantid gentleness and piousness became a commonplace through the continual retelling of the myths and superstitions surrounding this fascinating insect. By the seventeenth century, a growing interest in observation had begun to replace blind reliance on established wisdom and ancient authority. However, the various young sciences to which the period gave rise did not progress equally, and neither did the subdisciplines within each scientific field; biology, especially entomology, was particularly slow to free itself from past beliefs and contemporary superstitions. In the specific case of the praying mantis, the situation may have been at its worst. Early observers of nature found evidence that seemed, at first, to disconfirm the well-established belief that mantids are gentle creatures. These few observers, faced with startling firsthand information about mantid voraciousness, created a new characterization of mantids as merciless predators and then often juxtaposed the two images in their descriptions. However, it was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century that the two characterizations-gentleness versus cruelty-became reconciled. An amalgamation of these seemingly mutually exclusive characterizations was achieved by an interesting accommodation of each to the other. That is, while it could no longer be maintained that mantids are simply gentle insects, neither could it be accepted that they are all cruelty and viciousness. The melding of the two characterizations yielded a hybrid explanation which claimed that the praying mantis actually has two sides to its character! On the one hand, and like other creatures, mantids must nourish themselves, and do so quite reasonably by capturing small insects for food. However, even when "well nourished," and without "the excuse of hunger," their other, vicious side may surface; when this happens, the darkest of behaviours, cannibalism, is the result. To understand the remainder of the story one must pause to consider what had happened in the other sciences up to this point. In the mid-seventeenth century, professional scientific societies (such as the Royal Society of London, the Acad√©mic Royale des Sciences in France, and the Accademia del Cimento in Florence) were established throughout Europe. The societies, and the various journals and periodicals that they produced or encouraged, represented an institutionalization of both science and its special, structured discourse. However, as we have stated, entomology lagged behind; and in the case of some insects, superstitions and anthropomorphisms did not fade from descriptions of their behavior for centuries to come. By the time the new scientific discourse was applied to mantids the creatures were already firmly shackled with a dual personality, and this assumption was never challenged. In fact, it was functionally impossible to disconfirm. Captures of small prey were considered part of the mantid's normal side; captures of large prey (including conspecifics) were considered part of the mantid's abnormal side. There was no alternative explanation. As luck would have it, by the time that the strictures of scientific discourse had tightened sufficiently to disallow the use of anthropomorphisms in the explanation of insect behavior, another acceptable explanation of mantid cannibalism became immediately available: cannibalism became part of mantid mating behavior. That is, the fundamental explanatory model remained unchanged; it was merely couched in more appropriate terms. The acceptance of this new explanation for cannibalism was virtually immediate and complete. For instance, no one ever asked the following questions: If the headless male remains able to mate as a putative precaution against female cannibalism, for what reason does the headless female remain able to fashion "a perfectly constructed ootheca"? Or: If female-on-male cannibalism plays a role in mating behavior, what role is played by genderindifferent cannibalism, especially that among immature mantids? The latter phenomena were simply ignored - they were just uninteresting artifacts of insect life. However, the grand logic of nature was immediately apparent in the headless male's ability to mate. The ruling theory, to use Chamberlin's term, had been able to accommodate itself to, and assimilate, the new scientific discourse. It remained unscathed. A persistent question posed by several historians of this particular topic has been, Why did not the results of Ken Roeder's experiments debunk the myth that males are regularly cannibalized by the females with which they mate? The reason, which we hope is now clear, is that there were (and are) two interdependent ruling theories operating here. If one accepts the argument that mantids' cannibalism is simply a normal part of their prey-catching behavior, then one attacks not only the theory that mantids have two separate predatory strategies, but also the more recent theory that mantids have evolved to be the ideal fly-catching machines. This second theory found its first confirming support in the centuries-old (fortuitous) practice of feeding flies to captive mantids. Again, the disconfirming evidence of mantids eating prey of various sizes had no impact on the theory. Confirming observations were accepted: disconfirming observations were seen as anomalies. Additional confirmation of both ruling theories was garnered in experiments done in the mid-twentieth century. These experiments were based on the assumption that the original conceptualizations were correct, and consequently they did not test other hypotheses. The combined strength of the two theories is evidenced especially in the Raus' failure to account for the fact that their empirical observations were at odds with many of the conclusions that they drew, and in the fact that Roeder's work is still used to support the belief in the regularity (or necessity) of mating-related cannibalism despite the fact that Roeder, himself, argued the opposite. with both theories well entrenched, it is virtually impossible to promote an alternative theory of mantid behavior: namely, that mantids are generalized, opportunistic predators that manage to survive in spite of the fact that cannibalism sometimes occurs. ¬© 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={1. Larvae of Chironomus tentans Fab, decreased the amount of time they spent outside their tubes as the presence of predatory pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus L.) increased. Greatest reductions in activity occurred at low levels of fish presence; above a certain level further increases in fish presence had little effect on activity. 2. Whether the pattern of predator presence was ordered or random had no effect on larval behaviour. Larvae did not habituate to short‚Äê or long‚Äêterm predator presence. 3. Larvae were less active when more food was available and predator‚Äêinduced reductions in activity were negatively related to food availability. Larval activity was much higher in the dark than it was in the light. 4. Over 7 days, presence of fish reduced the proportion of third‚Äêinstar larvae that moulted but did not affect head width or dry mass; low food availability reduced the number of larvae that moulted as well as head width and dry mass of larvae in the fourth instar. 5. Results indicate that the behavioural response of larval chironomids to predator presence depends strongly on environmental conditions and that estimating the developmental costs of these behavioural responses under field conditions will be complicated.

abstract={Data are presented showing that perception of competition can be experimentally demonstrated and differentiated from effects of actual competition through mortality or decreased resources. Specifically, worker ants of Camponotus floridanus keep significantly smaller brood biomasses when unrelated conspecific workers are perceptible than when conspecifics are absent. This reduction occurs although no mortal injuries to workers can occur (conspecifics are separated by mesh), and despite ad libitum food availability. Thus, decreased brood biomass is a consequence of behavioural decision(s) rather than food limitations or reduced numbers of brood tenders. Despite lower brood biomass, such a response can theoretically maximize total colony biomass if it decreases forager mortality.},

abstract={The sea urchin Diadema antillarum increases the relative size of Aristotle's lantern (length of demipyramid) when food limited. This provides a tool for investigating algal abundance and biotic interactions in the past. A field collection of D. antillarum provided a baseline relationship between demipyramid length and body size (test diameter). Experimental manipulations of food availability and population density resulted in shifts in relative demipyramid length. The baseline and experimental data provide a range of responses that was compared to museum specimens collected over the past 100 yr from 30 locations in the Caribbean. Relative demipyramid size is indirectly influenced by human activity and varies with geographic region. This suggests that human fishing pressure has influenced Caribbean coral reef community structure by affecting predator-herbivore relationships. However, this human impact may be small relative to naturally occurring variation in demipyramid size. -from Author},

abstract={Successive feeds taken by the polyphagous grasshopper Taeniopoda eques generally declined when food remained the same but increased as different food became available. This led to repeated switching between food items. In the field, the switching rate was highest when feeding bouts were very short, but when feeding bouts lasted a minute or more, the switching rate stabilized at about one switch every three feeding bouts. In the laboratory, the pattern of declining feeding-bout length on one item, foolowed by an increase on a novel food was demonstrated with very acceptable food plants, and even with nutritionally balanced and identical artificial diets, differing only with respect to flavour. When the chemicals imparting the flavours were either injected into the haemolymph, or given as an oral dose in semi-micro-gelatin capsules, no effects on acceptability of the flavoured diets were observed. This highly polyphagous insect species demonstrated a predilection for novel flavours or variety, suggesting that several descriptors of processes associated with changing acceptability of food in other animals may have a common mechanism. ¬© 1992 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

In tests for anorectic activity, A71623 was found to suppress 60-min intakes of a liquid diet in both deprived and sated rats, and the effects were blocked by a selective CCK-A antagonist, A70104. Compared with CCK-8, A71623 was found to have improved potency and duration of action; the most potent route of administration was intraperitoneal. A71623 also suppressed the intake of a liquid diet and a 0.2 M sucrose solution in lean and obese Zucker rats. In daily injection studies, the anorectic activity of CCK-8 diminished rapidly, whereas the suppressant effects of A71623 on food intakes and body weight gains persisted throughout the 11-day treatment period. Finally, A71623 reduced the spontaneous locomotor activity of rats at doses above those required to suppress intakes. These studies are the first to describe the behavioral effects of a potent and highly selective CCK-A receptor agonist.},

abstract={Personality dimensions and psychopathological symptoms were assessed in 50 female patients hospitalized for the treatment of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa and in 19 healthy female controls of similar age. Restricting anorexia nervosa patients, who had lost weight by consistently reducing their food intake, reported significantly greater self-control, inhibition of emotionality, and conscientiousness than controls or bulimia nervosa patients, before and after the data were corrected for depressive and eating pathology. Both nonbulimic and bulimic anorexia nervosa patients expressed stronger than normal conformance to moral and family values. On the impulsivity dimension, bulimia nervosa patients scored in the high normal range, whereas bulimic anorexia nervosa patients rated in the low normal range. The results suggest that a personality disposition toward overcontrol and reserve might constitute a risk factor for the restricting type of anorexia nervosa through fostering restrictive behavior toward food and avoidance of personal relationships.

abstract={The fifteen-spined stickleback, preying on the mysid, Neomysis integer, and the amphipod, Gammarus locusta, maximized its energy intake by adjusting its predatory behaviour to the prey being attacked. The escape speed of Neomysis placed an upper constraint on the size of the prey available to fish of a given size. The increase in importance of Neomysis in the natural diet of larger sticklebacks reflected size-dependent limitations of the fast-start performance in these fish. The escape speed of Gammarus did not limit its availability to the sticklebacks; the limiting factor for this prey was its cross-sectional area. The fish expended 20 times more energy attacking Neomysis than Gammarus, but Gammarus took up to 159 times longer to ingest. Neomysis always responded to an attack with a tail-flip, which usually resulted in movement at an angle of approximately 90¬∞ to the direction of attack. Although Gammarus occasionally used a tail-flip response, it was never used to escape a fish attack. Adoption of a stationary C-shape often deterred the fish from attacking Gammarus. ¬© 1992 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The major determinant of infant mortality in the United States is low birthweight (LBW). Health behaviors related to LBW are inadequate prenatal care, poor nutrition, smoking, and moderate to heavy alcohol use. Before interventions can be designed to assist women in modifying these health behaviors, more must be understood about their causes. The Health Belief Model (HBM) is a framework for analyzing beliefs that motivate health behaviors and is well established as a model for understanding health behavior decisions. The chief aim of this study was to develop an instrument to assess women's health beliefs during pregnancy. Questions for the instrument were generated around the four major constructs of the HBM: perceived susceptibility, seriousness, benefits, and barriers. Four focus group interviews, a literature review, and consultation with an HBM expert provided content for questions. The questionnaire was administered to a convenience sample of 127 women. The measurement models were tested using confirmatory factor analysis. Parsimony was achieved by reducing the original 106-item scale to 64 items. The final instrument provides support for the HBM but not for all of its discrete constructs. ¬© 1992, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.},

To develop predictive and explanatory models of suicidal behavior it is necessary to consider all of these domains. A stress-diathesis model is proposed that classifies risk factors for suicidal behavior into those that are trait-dependent and those that are statedependent. The timing of suicidal behavior is determined by state-dependent factors. The relationship of psychopathologic factors such as severity of depression or anxiety to suicide will be discussed. Biologic changes that correlate with suicide may be either state- or trait-dependent. Particular emphasis will be given to changes in the serotonin system and how these may represent a constitutional risk factor as opposed to a state-dependent risk factor for suicidal behavior. ¬© 1992 by Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={Geocoris punctipes (Say), a predaceous lygaeid not previously documented as a whitefly predator, was tested in the laboratory as a natural enemy of the sweet potato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Genn.). Its stalking behavior with whiteflies as prey was similar to that observed with aphids. A previously unobserved behavior was noted that involves the predators using salivary secretions to fasten the wings of prey to various surfaces, allowing labial probing and feeding. Prey consumption as a function of prey number appeared to follow the pattern of the Holling type II functional response. Handling time per prey item ranged from about 180 to 240 seconds. No changes were observed in handling time devoted to earlier versus later catches. Nutritional quality of whiteflies was measured using crude protein, lipids and carbohydrates as criteria. Performance, in terms of predator behavior, total daily handling time, functional response, energy budget and nutritional quality all support the hypothesis that G. punctipes is a promising candidate for biological control of sweet potato whiteflies. 1992 The Netherlands Entomological Society},

abstract={Gender-planned health services are planned on the basis that women and men play different roles in society and have different medical needs. The feminist movement has provided a broad charter of rights for women, reflecting women's needs, but these have yet to be translated into operational programmes. National programmes for women would allow co-ordination of broad-based programmes to improve women's health and social position. To change social norms discriminating against women will require changing male attitudes. Health programmes for males have received little attention, except from family planning organizations, although in most countries, males have a high rate of accidents, infections and parasitic disease. Controlled studies are required to evaluate the benefits of gender-planned health services.
Gender-planned health services acknowledge the fact that women and men have different social roles and different medical needs. To date, most gender-specific health issues have been addressed to women's reproductive health needs, and women's groups have criticized maternal and child health services for their emphasis on child health. Justifications have made for adopting a broader reproductive health approach and redefining women's health care needs for the 1990s. Such an approach would improve access and quality in: 1) prenatal and maternity care, 2) family planning (FP) services, 3) legalized abortion, 4) special services for adolescent girls, 5) the area of nutrition, 6) treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), 7) treatment of infertility, and 8) information and medical services in cases of female genital mutilation. Access to FP has received the most donor support to date. All of these issues, however, are now a recognized part of a holistic approach to women's health, and more emphasis is being placed on prenatal care, abortion, and adolescent reproductive health needs. Women's "other" health needs include food security, access to water, ways to combat violence, treatment for drug abusers, and occupational health needs. Women's health status is related to the level of female education, the status of women in society, equal access to income activities or credit, and control over these resources. Men, too, need specific care, especially in areas related to risk-taking behavior. They need improved occupational health services that emphasize prevention; organized recreational activities, especially for adolescents; rehabilitation services for criminals; better health and sex education in schools; and strategies to avoid smoking, accidents, and STDs. Health programs can also change the attitudes of men toward women, including attitudes that are detrimental to women's health such as the belief that women are weak and that good women are quiet, subservient, and bear many children. Men should be knowledgeable about health services for women, because men are a source of information and financial support for women. Reproductive health strategies for men have been sidelined by the concern of feminists that women gain the right to control their fertility decisions. But FP groups do offer men information and education in an effort to increase men's responsibility for contraception. This has had mixed results because, in some areas, older female relatives have more influence over family fertility than men and may be a more appropriate audience. Since care givers have no prior experience in gender planning, clinical health problems must be assessed in terms of how they affect men and women as they function in their society.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to examine the hypothesis that a psychosocial model was associated with natural killer cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) in HIV-1 infection. A sample of 62 HIV-1 seropositive homosexual men at CDC stages II and III were given a psychosocial battery assessing life stressors, social support, and coping style. A regression model quantifying these variables along with control variables for alcohol use, substance use and nutritional status was estimated. Active coping style was directly and positively associated with NKCC, and trends toward a negative relationship of life stressors and a buffering effect of social support on lifes stressors were also observed. The results suggest that (1) control variables should be included with psychosocial models and that (2) psychosocial factors, especially active coping, may have a deterrent effect on loss of NK cell function. Active coping style may merit a specific focus in future research of life stressors and the immune system. ¬© 1992.},

abstract={The present study evaluated the utility of combining measures of body dissatisfaction and borderline personality features in screening high-school girls who may be at risk for bulimia nervosa. Two samples (777 high-school girls and 22 bulimic women in-treatment) completed scales assessing borderline traits, body dissatisfaction, eating symptoms, and associated psychiatric disturbances. Students were divided into four groups, respectively showing: (a) high body dissatisfaction and borderline traits. (b) high body dissatisfaction alone, (c) high borderline traits alone, or (d) neither vulnerability component. Clinical and nonclinical groups were then compared for severity of eating and psychiatric symptoms. Girls displaying the combination of high body dissatisfaction and borderline traits (our presumed "high-risk" group) showed an elevated profile of eating and associated disturbances, highly comparable to the bulimic group. They were also more likely to receive threshold and subthreshold diagnoses of bulimia nervosa (according to simulated diagnoses based on self-report items) than subjects in other high-school groups. Implications of these findings were discussed with reference to the "two-component" model of eating disorders. ¬© 1992.},

abstract={Early identification and prevention of mental retardation helps in terms of treatment for some conditions, better planning and management of cases, and counseling. Diagnostic procedures are available during pregnancy for early detection: blood tests, amniocentesis, ultrasound, fetoscopy, and urine tests; tests available for the newborn are blood tests for hypothyroidism, PKU; urine tests for metabolic disorders; apgar scores for screening of neurological deficits; neurobehavioral assessments, developmental schedules; neurodevelopmental screening; sensory examination; speech and language assessments; EEG; and imaging techniques. Early identification of mental retardation is beneficial in aiding the child's development and personality and in helping parents adjust mentally and learning to cope with caring for the child. Sometimes, it can help to limit the number and extent of the handicap. Prevention can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. The emphasis is on planned pregnancies, regular prenatal care, regular health checkups for mother and child, immunization, nutrition, prevention of environmental hazards and accidents, early identification and screening, genetic studies and counseling, family planning, and creation of awareness among the general population. Inadequate prenatal care is associated with prematurity and low birth weight, which are linked to mental retardation. Prenatal care for the pregnant woman involves participating in regular prenatal checkups, maintaining good nutrition, having preliminary screening, attending promptly to illnesses and infections, and getting immunized at the appropriate time. Avoidance of the following is recommended: unnecessary and nonprescribed drugs, physical accidents, exposure to radiation and teratogens, alcohol and tobacco consumption, exposure to infections such as measles, rubella, or syphilis, toxins and poisons such as lead, and attempts at abortion. Genetic counseling can provide information on the disorders, the mode of inheritance, risks of recurrence, and options available as alternatives. Complicated pregnancies and labors require hospital delivery. Trained personnel at home or at a health center is appropriate for normal deliveries. High-risk infants need intensive care. The best age for mothers to bear children is between 20 and 30 years. The community can disseminate information as a prevention effort.},

abstract={Background.‚ÄîWhile some analytic studies have sug gested that individuals in occupations representing higher compared with lower socioeconomic status have a de creased risk of coronary heart disease, it is unclear whether occupation itself has an etiologic role in the development of coronary heart disease or whether differences in as yet un controlled coronary risk factors may account for these dif ferences in risk. Methods.‚ÄîWhite collar vs blue-collar occupation and risk of coronary heart disease was evaluated among 230 male patients hospitalized for a first myocardial infarction and 222 control subjects of the same age, sex, and neigh borhood of residence. Information on coronary risk factors was obtained from home interviews, and blood specimens were drawn to test lipid and lipoprotein levels. Usual occu pation was dichotomized into white-collar and blue-collar occupation according to the Edwards‚Äô classification. Results.‚ÄîThe relative risk of myocardial infarction of white-collar compared with blue-collar workers was 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 1.19) after controlling for age, cigarette smoking, family history of premature myocar dial infarction, history of treatment for high blood pressure, body mass index, history of diabetes, alcohol consumption, type A personality, leisure-time physical activity, total calo ries, and percentage of calories consumed as saturated fat. However, there was no residual association after control for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol yielding a relative risk of 0.98 (95% confidence interval, 0.59 to 1.63). Conclusions.‚ÄîThese results suggest that white-collar oc cupation per se does not appear to protect from coronary heart disease. Any apparent protective effect on myocardial infarction that has been previously observed in white-collar compared with blue-collar workers may be attributable to differences in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. ¬© 1992, American Medical Association.

Contrary to previous reports (Andreasen et al. 1986; and Pearlson et al. 1989), in the present sample schizophrenic patients did not have smaller heads. The relationship between height and head size for schizophrenic subjects, schizotypal siblings, and nonschizotypal siblings was also examined. As in Andreasen et al.

abstract={Some 5-15% of children aged 3 to 15 years in both developing and developed countries suffer from mental handicaps. There may be as many as 10-30 million severely and about 60-30 million mildly or moderately mentally retarded children in the world. The conditions causing mental handicaps are largely preventable through primary health care measures in developing countries. Birth asphyxia and birth trauma are the leading causes of mental handicaps in developing countries where over 1.2 million newborns die each year from moderate or severe asphyxia and an equal number survive with severe morbidity due to brain damage. The other preventable or manageable conditions are: infections such as tuberculous and pyogenic meningitides and encephalopathies associated with measles and whooping cough; severe malnutrition in infancy; hyperbilirubinaemia in the newborn; iodine deficiency; and iron deficiency anaemia in infancy and early childhood. In addition, recent demographic and socioeconomic changes and an increase in the number of working mothers tend to deprive both infants and young children of stimulation for normal development. To improve this situation, the primary health care approach involving families and communities and instilling the spirit of self-care and self-help is indispensable. Mothers and other family members, traditional birth attendants, community health workers, as well as nurse midwives and physicians should be involved in prevention and intervention activities, for which they should be trained and given knowledge and skills about appropriate technologies such as the risk approach, home-based maternal record, partograph, mobilogram (kick count), home-risk card, icterometer, and mouth-to-mask or bag and mask resuscitation of the newborn. Most of these have been field-tested by WHO and can be used in the home, the health centre or day care centres to detect and prevent the above-mentioned conditions which can cause mental handicap.
5-15% of all 3-15 year old children in the world are mentally impaired. In fact, 0.4-1.5% (10-30 million) are severely mentally retarded and an additional 60-80 million children are mildly or moderately mentally retarded. Birth asphyxia and birth trauma account for most cases of mental retardation in developing countries. 1.2 million newborns survive with severe brain damage and an equal number die from moderate or severe birth asphyxia. Other causes of mental retardation can also be prevented or treated such as meningitis or encephalitis associated with measles and pertussis; grave malnutrition during the 1st months of life, especially for infants of low birth weight; hyperbilirubinemia in neonates which occurs frequently in Africa and countries in the Pacific; and iodine deficiency. In addition, iron deficiency may even slow development in infants and young children. Current socioeconomic and demographic changes and a rise in the number of employed mothers may withhold the necessary stimulation for normal development from infants and young children. Primary health care (PHC) interventions can prevent many mental handicaps. For example, PHC involves families and communities who take control of their own care. Besides traditional birth attendants, community health workers, nurse midwives, physicians, and other parents must also participate in prevention efforts. For example, they should be trained in appropriate technologies including the risk approach, home risk card, partograph, mouth to mask or bag and mask resuscitation of the newborn, kick count, and ictometer. WHO has field tested all these techniques. These techniques not only prevent mental handicaps but can also be applied at home, health centers, and day-care centers.},

Offspring sired by ALC-treated males did not differ from the offspring of PF males on several developmental parameters including body weights, when developmental landmarks appeared, or on tests of sensorimotor development. As adults, male offspring groups did not differ on tests of activity or on an object exploration/recognition task.

abstract={Background. It is not known whether psychological stress suppresses host resistance to infection. To investigate this issue, we prospectively studied the relation between psychological stress and the frequency of documented clinical colds among subjects intentionally exposed to respiratory viruses. Methods. After completing questionnaires assessing degrees of psychological stress, 394 healthy subjects were given nasal drops containing one of five respiratory viruses (rhinovirus type 2, 9, or 14, respiratory syncytial virus, or coronavirus type 229E), and an additional 26 were given saline nasal drops. The subjects were then quarantined and monitored for the development of evidence of infection and symptoms. Clinical colds were defined as clinical symptoms in the presence of an infection verified by the isolation of virus or by an increase in the virus-specific antibody titer. Results. The rates of both respiratory infection (P<0.005) and clinical colds (P<0.02) increased in a dose-response manner with increases in the degree of psychological stress. Infection rates ranged from approximately 74 percent to approximately 90 percent, according to levels of psychological stress, and the incidence of clinical colds ranged from approximately 27 percent to 47 percent. These effects were not altered when we controlled for age, sex, education, allergic status, weight, the season, the number of subjects housed together, the infectious status of subjects sharing the same housing, and virus-specific antibody status at base line (before challenge). Moreover, the associations observed were similar for all five challenge viruses. Several potential stress‚Äîillness mediators, including smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, diet, quality of sleep, white-cell counts, and total immunoglobulin levels, did not explain the association between stress and illness. Similarly, controls for personality variables (self-esteem, personal control, and introversion‚Äîextraversion) failed to alter our findings. Conclusions. Psychological stress was associated in a dose-response manner with an increased risk of acute infectious respiratory illness, and this risk was attributable to increased rates of infection rather than to an increased frequency of symptoms after infection.

abstract={An important aspect of motivated behavior is that organisms will perform complex instrumental behaviors to gain access to stimuli such as food. In the present study, food-deprived rats were tested in an operant chamber in which the animals had a choice between pressing a lever to obtain a more-preferred food (Bioserve pellets), or free feeding on a less-preferred food (lab chow). Typically, rats pressed the lever to obtain the preferred food pellets, and ate little of the less-preferred food even though it was freely available. Pre-fed rats showed suppression of both lever pressing and feeding. Systemic administration of 0.1 mg/kg haloperidol (HP) led to a dramatic shift in the behavior of these rats, such that the number of lever presses was substantially reduced, but the amount of less-preferred food consumed showed a significant increase. This result occurred if the rats pressed a lever on either a CRF or FR5 schedule. Injection of 3.5-7.0 Œºg HP directly into the nucleus accumbens, or intra-accumbens injections of 6-hydroxy-dopamine, also decreased lever pressing for food and increased feeding on laboratory chow. Thus, interference with brain dopamine suppressed a highly active instrumental response for food, although the behavior of the animal was still directed towards food acquisition and consumption. ¬© 1991 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={NPC 12626 (2-amino-4,5-(1,2-cyclohexyl)-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid), a newly developed drug which crosses the blood-brain barrier, is a competitive antagonist of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. In Experiment I, the effects of NPC 12626 on perforant path - dentate gyrus LTP were tested. NPC 12626 (100 mg/kg, i.p.), injected 150 min prior to tetanization, prevented potentiation of the EPSP slope and population spike amplitude. EPSP-spike potentiation was also prevented. Post-tetanus administration was ineffective. In Experiment II, mice were injected with NPC 12626 (35 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline 35 min prior to spontaneous alternation testing. NPC 12626 significantly decreased alternation rates, but did not affect turn bias or the mean delay between arm entries. This pattern of results may reflect impaired learning or memory. In Experiment III, mice were tested on an inhibitory avoidance task. NPC 12626 (35 mg/kg, i.p.), administered before but not after training, significantly impaired performance. When the drug was administered before training as well as before testing, performance was similarly impaired, indicating that the observed deficits were not attributable to state-dependent learning. Pre-test injections were ineffective. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that some forms of learning require the participation of NMDA receptors and that this participation is largely limited to acquisition processes. In addition, these results point to the utility of peripherally administered NPC 12626 as a tool with which to examine the involvement of NMDA receptors in LTP and learning. ¬© 1991.},

abstract={Comparison of the size, shape and shell morphology in littoral and sub-littoral morphs of the Antarctic limpet Nacella concinna reveal differences in shell morphology which are enhanced by structural anomalies within the shells of the two types. Infestation of sub-littoral shells by the conchocelis phase of an endolithic alga significantly affects shell density and total chlorophyll levels in the two shell morphs. The surface sculpture of sub-littoral shells is characterised by a series of grooves, the configuration of which closely resembles that of the radular teeth in N. concinna. Limpets utilise the available food supply within the shell matrix of other limpets by grazing the shell material. Epibiotic growth of calcareous algae prevent erosion and preserve underlying shell layers. In severe cases, where protection is lacking, intraspecific shell grazing may remove parts of the shell exposing the internal tissues.The Dominican Gull, Larus dominicanus, is a major shore predator of both shell morphs. Gull middens contain both shell types but are dominated by the more accessible littoral shells. Comparison of living populations and midden assemblages indicates that size and shape selection of prey occurs, with pear-shaped limpets between 21 mm and 29 mm in length being taken preferentially.Apparent differences in shell form are induced by physical, biological and behavioural influences. Littoral animals are robust in nature, resist avian pre-dation and are not extensively grazed whereas those of the sub-littoral are not subject to the same degree of predatory attention but suffer a gradual depletion of their shallower shell form through a combination of algal infection and intraspecific shell grazing. ¬© 1991 The Malacological Society of London.},

abstract={Mayfly larvae of Paraleptophlebia heteronea (McDunnough) had two antipredator responses to a nocturnal fish predator (Rhinichthys cataractae (Valenciennes)): flight into the drift and retreat into interstitial crevices. Drift rates of Paraleptophlebia abruptly increased by 30 fold when fish were actively foraging in the laboratory streams but, even before fish were removed, drift began returning to control levels because larvae settled to the substrate and moved to areas of low risk beneath stones. This drifting response was used as an immediate escape behavior which likely decreases risk of capture from predators which forage actively at night. Surprisingly, drift most often occurred before contact between predator and prey, and we suggest that in darkness this mayfly may use hydrodynamic pressure waves for predator detection, rather than chemical cues, since fish forage in an upstream direction. Although drifting may represent a cost to mayfly larvae in terms of relocation to a new foraging area with unknown food resources, the immediate mortality risk probably out-weighs the importance of staying within a profitable food patch because larvae can survive starvation for at least 2 d. In addition to drifting, mayflies retreated from upper, exposed substrate surfaces to concealed interstitial crevices immediately after a predator encounter, or subsequent to resettlement on the substrate after predator-induced drift. A latency period was associated with this response and mayflies remained in these concealed locations for at least 3 h after dace foraging ceased. Because this mayfly feeds at night and food levels are significantly lower in field refugia under stones, relative to exposed stone surfaces, predator avoidance activity may limit foraging time and, ultimately, reduce the food intake of this stream mayfly. ¬© 1991 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Experimental tests of the hypothesis that natural selection favors predators that search and select prey species that are more profitable are reported. The predator studies was the stigmaeid mite, Zetzellia mali (Ewing). It was observed that Aculus schlechtendali (Nalepa) and Panonychus ulmi (Koch) were more profitable prey than Tetranychus urticae Koch. However, Z. mali attacks prey independently of their nutritional value. Behavioral observations and experiments documented that Z. mali does not detect kairomones of the prey species. Therefore, prey location is due only to random encounters. Apparently, Z. mali does not search and select prey that are more profitable. The correlation coefficients of Z. mali, A. schlechtendali, and P. ulmi were investigated in an apple tree. Results revealed that the association depends on season and type of prey. Zetzellia mali and A. schlechtendali were positively associated in the spring (r=0.3, P<0.05) and fall (r=0.36, P<0.01). Zetzellia mali and P. ulmi were not statistically associated. The term 'associational response' is proposed as an ecological process that quantifies the association of predator and prey. The associational-response data suggest that Z. mali, in the natural ecosystem, responds more to the density of A. schlechtendali than to the density of P. ulmi. ¬© 1991 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.},

abstract={The effect of dietary restriction of n-3 fatty acids during development on brain phospholipid fatty acid composition and exploratory behavior has been studied in male Sprague Dawley rats. Female rats were fed semipurified diets containing either 5.5% safflower oil or 6% soybean oil for 6 wk prior to mating and throughout gestation and lactation. Control rats were maintained on laboratory chow. The male pups were weaned to the diets of the dams except for one group which was switched from safflower to soybean oil at weaning. Behavioral studies and brain phospholipid analyses were conducted at 16-18 wk of age. Rats fed safflower oil showed significantly lower levels of 22:6n-3 in phospholipids of synaptic membranes and myelin than rats fed soybean oil or chow. The decrease in 22:6n-3 was compensated for by an increase in 22:5n-6, the total content of polyunsaturated fatty acids remaining approximately constant. The brain phospholipid fatty acid composition of rats switched from safflower to soybean oil at weaning was similar to that of rats fed soybean oil throughout the experiment. There was no difference in spontaneous locomotor activity among the different dietary groups. However, rats raised on safflower oil displayed a significantly lower exploratory activity (horizontal movements and rearings) in a novel environment than rats fed soybean oil or chow. In contrast to the brain phospholipid fatty acid composition, there was no recovery of exploratory behavior in rats raised on safflower oil and switched to soybean oil at weaning suggesting a specific requirement of n-3 fatty acids during development. ¬© 1991 American Oil Chemists' Society.},

abstract={In attempting to understand the mechanisms underlying the development of stereotypic behaviour patterns it is important to determine those environmental factors that contribute to the development of such behaviour. The effects of restraint and food restriction on the development of stereotypies in pregnant nulliparous sows, Sus scrofa, were investigated. In the two housing conditions used in the present study, food restriction, but not restraint, was a major factor in increased levels of activity and in particular high levels of drinking and chain manipulation. Food-restricted sows also increased their feeding rate significantly over the experimental period. Restrained sows spent more time in behaviour such as standing inactive and sham chewing that did not involve manipulation or exploration of substrates. Hughes & Duncan (1988, Anim. Behav., 36, 1696-1707) proposed that stereotypies result from long-term performance of elements of appetitive behaviour. Their model suggests that, in the present study, stereotypies resulted from both environments preventing the animal proceeding to the consummatory phase of foraging behaviour and 'switching off' the underlying motivation. This explanation, however, is not consistent with the observation that time spent in appetitive behaviour did not decrease when the level of stereotypy increased, and that stereotypies were concentrated in the post-feeding period. It is also not consistent with the high levels of drinking and chewing of substrates that the food-restricted sows developed, as these activities appear to be more closely related to consummatory behaviour than to appetitive behaviour. It is concluded that there remain a number of aspects of stereotypies in pigs and other species that cannot be wholly explained by current models. ¬© 1991 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Patterns of home range use by a mountain gorilla group are examined here in relation to variation in food abundance and quality, diet quality and rainfall, to interactions between different social units and to the distribution of hazards (poaching risk). Variation in habitat quality influenced both long-term area occupation densities and shorter-term movement parameters (day journey length and the distance moved between consecutive feeding sites). Observed home range use patterns increased the gorillas' foraging efficiency. Rainfall influenced the evenness of home range use slightly, but this was the only seasonal variability. Interactions with other gorillas and poaching risk had proximate effects superimposed on the fundamental influence of food distribution patterns. Data from a larger sample of groups show a positive influence of group size on day journey length, but this was apparent only at very small and relatively large group sizes. The absolute distance travelled per day tends to be short even for large groups. The data support arguments that the costs of social foraging are low for mountain gorillas.},

After interacting, both members of a pair of rats, each of which had just eaten a different, novel food exhibited, enhanced preferences for the food that their respective partners had eaten.

Changes in diet preference as a result of information exchange depended, on exposure of each interactant to food-related cues in the context provided by the presence of its partner. ¬© 1991 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Weight reduction was primarily by dietary restriction. The typical bulimic syndrome and major depression were uncommon. There were multiple aetiological factors, but no pre-morbid obesity and little pressure to pursue slimness for beauty. Instead of displaying an intense fear of obesity and a distorted body image, patients more commonly attributed poor food intake to abdominal bloating. As such, they only partially fulfilled current criteria for diagnosis.

abstract={Alternative hypotheses for the costs of aggression in male mountain spiny lizards, Sceloporus jarrovi, were examined using testosterone manipulations and food supplementation. In the first experiment, feeding testosterone-implanted males increased both their energy stores and survivorship relative to those of males given empty implants. This evidence supports the hypothesis that lower survivorship of testosterone-implanted males is a result of the energetic costs of increased territorial aggression. This result, by itself, does not eliminate the hypothesis that testosterone-implanted males have lower survivorship as a result of increased conspicuousness to predators, because feeding may have altered conspicuousness. Contrary to this possibility, it was further demonstrated that giving supplementary food to testosterone-implanted males results in a slight increase in conspicuousness. These fed testosterone-implanted males displayed a slight increase in activity after male-male encounters compared with testosterone-implanted males that were not given supplementary food, but the two groups did not differ with respect to daily activity period, territorial displays or escalation of aggressive encounters. Therefore, because fed testosterone-implanted males were slightly more conspicuous, but still survived better, the data from these two experiments strongly support the hypothesis that energetic costs, rather than costs related to increased conspicuousness to predators, constrain levels of aggression in male S. jarrovi during the summer non-breeding season. ¬© 1991 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Foraging animals will behave in such a way that they maximize foraging efficiency while minimizing risk to predation. Using a behavioral paradigm in which laboratory rats (Rattus norvegicus) were provided with food at one end of an elevated beam and a refuge to which they could carry the food at the other end of the beam, we examined the effects of travel distance, travel difficulty, ambient lighting, predation risk, and food size on foraging behavior. Both lengthening travel distance (by increasing beam length) and increasing travel difficulty (by decreasing beam width) decreased food carrying. When plotted as a function of travel time, the effects of the two treatments appeared to be partly different. Decreasing ambient illumination decreased food carrying, although the rats still responded to distance and food size. In contrast, predator‚Äôs odor (cat) stopped foraging altogether. When a store of small food pellets was available, the rats ate for prolonged periods in the open, and eating time increased with travel distance; however, when large food pellets were also available, the rats immediately selected and carried them to the refuge. The experiments show that food-carrying behavior in the rat is influenced by a variety of independently acting factors, which include eating time, food size, travel distance, travel risk, illumination, predation, and exposure time. The varied and flexible foraging behavior of the animals is discussed in relation to optimal foraging theory. ¬© 1991, Psychonomic Society, Inc.. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The effects of changes in both predation risk and the quality of a food patch on the formation and attractiveness of groups of foraging teal were studied. Several predictions as to whether the predation-avoidance hypothesis or the food-finding hypothesis best explains goups foraging were tested by examining the decisions of teals flying over a food patch to land on the patch, with different combinations of the following variables: the presence of foraging teals on the patch; the predation risk; and the number of passing teals. Foraging groups already on the patch clearly attracted teals flying over it, but the atractiveness of very large groups decreased with a decrease in the quality of the food patch. The presence of a predator decxreased the landing frequency of passing teals. Landing on the empty patch was unrelated to the number of passing teals. In the presence of the predator, however, landing on the emply patch seemed to decrease more among solitary than among group flyiong teals. Overall, changes in landing frequency in relation to changes in patch emptiness. predation risk and number of passing teals did not support the predation-avoidance hypothesis of grouding for teals; support for the food-finding hypothesis of group formation and attractiveness was stronger. ¬© 1991 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Courting male Neumania papillator vibrate their first and second pairs of legs when near a female. Females often respond to this vibration as they do to moving prey, by orienting to and clutching at trembling males; it is only after males have deposited spermatophores that females appear to recognize them as potential mates rather than prey. The hypothesis that male trembling elicits predatory responses from females was supported in several ways: (1) male leg-trembling frequencies fell within the range of vibrations produced by copepod prey; (2) females were unlikely to orient or clutch except in the presence of males or copepods; and (3) females deprived of food oriented to and clutched courting males significantly more often than did well fed females. Initial male recognition of females involves contact chemoreception; eliciting predatory responses from females may benefit the male by allowing him to differentiate between an actual female and her chemical trace on the substrate. The female's response to trembling may also allow males to manipulate her orientation to favour uptake of his spermatophores. Males did not appear to assess female quality during courtship. ¬© 1991 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Female runners (n = 174) were assessed on their levels of dietary restraint, depression, and binge eating, as well as a number of exercise variables. Thirty-eight (19%) of the women in the sample were found to meet diagnostic criteria for DSM-IIIR Bulimia Nervosa. The level of exercise was unassociated with any of the affective and eating variables as was the risk for meeting diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa. Severity scores for depression in bulimic runners were notably lower than in earlier nonexercising samples. The relationships between the variables were similar to those found in previous research, with dietary restraint, particularly in interaction with depression, predicting the severity of binge eating in both bulimic and nonbulimic runners. These data suggest that bulimia, rather than anorexia, may be the most prevalent eating problem in female runners. ¬© 1991.},

abstract={Abstract Two rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) learned that the arabic numerals 0 through 9 represented corresponding quantities of food pellets. By manipulating a joystick, the monkeys were able to make a selection of paired numerals presented on a computer screen. Although the monkeys received a corresponding number of pellets even if the lesser of the two numerals was selected, they learned generally to choose the numeral of greatest value even when pellet delivery was made arrhythmic. In subsequent tests, they chose the numerals of greater value when presented in novel combinations or in random arrays of up to five numerals. Thus, the monkeys made ordinal judgments of numerical symbols in accordance with their absolute or relative values. Copyright ¬© 1991, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract={Colonies of Camponotus floridanus were maintained on diets with three levels of access to insect prey. More insects always had linear effects on queen-influenced traits, such as increasing egg number, total egg clutch biomass and larval number, or decreasing the mean weight of individual eggs. Queens responded consistently to insect protein and nutrients and appeared to be relatively invariant in behaviour. However, worker-influenced traits, such as larval and total brood biomass and pupal numbers, were more complicated in that colonies grew fastest on intermediate levels of insect protein. Similar results in an ant/lycaenid mutualism, where colonies tending fewer amino acid-producing caterpillars grew larger as well as other social insect examples suggest that larvae serve multiple functions in a colony, one of which may be as nutrient storage vessels to be cannibalized when needed. From a survey of social insect data, cannibalism appears to be more prevalent in colonies than previously appreciated. However, for a multiple-function hypothesis to explain observed colony growth phenomena, it implies that adult workers pay a survival cost to maintain extra brood. Whether such trade-offs do occur should be of considerable interest for future research. ¬© 1991.},

abstract={Behavioural and ecological consequences of pregnancy in a medium-sized herbivore were examined by testing the hypothesis that pregnant females should move to areas that maximize nutrient intake once the demands of gestation are high, even at the risk of increased predation. Observational and experimental data were contrasted for six populations of bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis, living in heterogeneous environments with natural predators at Great Basin (N=4), Sonoran Desert (N=1) and northern prairie (N=1) study sites. Manipulations included the alteration of dietary protein (via alfalfa supplements) in habitats that varied in predation risk when females were at different stages of pregnancy and, hence, protein requirements. Both sexes left the mountainous terrain during late winter to feed on bajadas where emergent new grasses were highest in crude protein. In these areas females were more than twice as likely as males to flee from natural predators. Females also (1) remained closer to mountainous slopes while feeding and (2) incurred greater losses in feeding time when away from slopes than males. These data suggest that predation pressure affects the sexes differently. Results of the experimental manipulations were consistent with the posed hypothesis since protein supplements on bajadas were consumed by both sexes until emergent new grasses became more abundant on mountainous slopes. However, natural variation in female reproductive status allowed a further refinement of the extent to which pregnancy incentives and predation constraints affected habitat use. Ewes not accompanied by lambs or yearlings used areas where they were at risk from predators, such as bajadas, more frequently than those without young, observations that favour the tenet that potential predation pressure overrides increased nutrient demands during late stages of pregnancy. These data suggest that species of mammals with access to heterogeneous environments prior to parturition are ideal subjects in which to examine the extent to which habitat shifts result from balancing increased dietary requirements during late gestation and safety from potential predators. ¬© 1991 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The behavioral reactivity in an "open-field" test and plasma cortisol levels were studied in 72 pigs from 12 litters fed for 3 wk one of three diets with different levels of tryptophan: deficient (.14%), adequate (.23%), or excess (.32%). "Open-field" tests were performed three times: 5 d (day W + 5), 23 d (day W + 23) and 45 d (day W + 45) after weaning. The exploration time and the number of grunts provided an adequate measure of the individual emotional reactivity at day W + 5. Significant correlations were obtained between exploration time and the number of grunts at each time (r = -.83 at day W + 5; r = -.46 at day W + 23; r = -.71 at day W + 45). The distinction between animals remained (P less than .05) in terms of exploration time at both 23 and 45 d after weaning. At day W + 23, exploration time was lower in the group fed the adequate diet than in the two other groups. This effect was maintained subsequently after feeding all pigs the same adequate diet (day W + 45). In 36 pigs slaughtered at day W + 23, brain TRP concentration was higher with the excess dietary TRP than with deficient or adequate levels. Conversely, other plasma amino acids (particularly threonine) accumulated only in the brains of pigs fed the deficient diet. Plasma cortisol level assayed at weaning (W) and 2 wk later increased with age and was higher in 16-h fasted (day W + 15) than in 3-h fasted (day W + 17) pigs. Correlations were observed within litters in the fasting state, between the cortisol level and behavioral traits measured at day W + 23 (r = .70 for number of grunts, r = -.60 for exploration time). Dietary TRP did not affect the plasma cortisol level irrespective of the nutritional state after weaning. However, an interaction was noted between plasma cortisol and TRP status (P less than .05). Although dietary TRP induced large variations in brain amino acids and 5-hydroxyindole concentrations, changes in behavioral and cortisol responses were relatively minor.},

abstract={A group of fifteen-spined sticklebacks were given the choice of two food sources. The fish sampled both sources, but with decreasing frequency as each trial progressed. Sampling was more frequent when the fish were hungry than when partially satiated. The fish spent more time at the more profitable source, discrimination being marked when profitability was determined by delivery rate, but less pronounced when determined by prey size. Given food sources of equal mean delivery rate, hungry fish concentrated on the variable source and partially satiated fish on the constant source. The fish became more reluctant to feed and to visit a source where there had recently been a simulated threat of predation, but reluctance was less when the dangerous source was also more profitable, especially when the fish were hungry. The fish distributed themselves in proportion to the profitability of the food source (ideal free distribution). Competitive ability varied among the fish according to their size. The two largest, competitively superior fish sampled the food sources more frequently than their inferior competitors. They quickly intercepted food and could efficiently track any short-term changes in delivery rate. Inferior competitors sampled frequently at first, but then settled for one food source, concentrating on prey missed by their competitive superiors and reducing travel costs. Fifteen-spined sticklebacks, therefore, behave in accordance with the 'energy maximization premise', subject to the constraints that risks of starvation and predation are minimized and that adjustments must be made towards competitors. Sampling is a conspicuous feature of the foraging behaviour and is appropriate to the temporally and spatially heterogeneous, natural food supply of these fish. ¬© 1991 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={This paper presents a series of simulations designed to determine optimal diet breadth under shortfall avoidance models. Profitability and encounter rate functions were varied, and means and variances of energy intake rate were generated using a simple simulation procedure. The resulting mean-variance sets assumed three distinct shapes: u-shaped, arched, and looped. These simulations show that certain mean-variance sets allow the forager to employ simple behavioural rules to determine the optimal diet breadth. This situation occurs when low ranking diet items have small handling times, and these conditions may be quite common. In other cases, mean-variance sets may be too complicated to allow for easy behavioural rules designed to minimize starvation probability. The ability to characterize foraging problems into a limited series of mean-variance set types benefits workers examining the evolution and maintenance of foraging strategies, since these sets have clear implications for the ability of animals to develop simple behavioural rules. Unfortunately data are lacking on the profitability and encounter rate distributions animals face in nature. ¬© 1991 Chapman and Hall Ltd.},

abstract={The plant compound, 6-methoxy-2-benzoxazolinone (6-MBOA), is found in the meristematic tissue of young, vegetatively growing grasses, and its ingestion stimulates the reproductive system of rodents in both short and long photoperiods. The present study demonstrates the existence of a novel mechanism whereby the presence of 6-MBOA in the diet of pregnant prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) enhances gonadal development in their male offspring. Female voles were fed specially milled food in which 6-MBOA was present (50 Œºg of 6-MBOA/g food) or absent (0 Œºg of 6-MBOA/g food) prior to the birth of their young; all of these dams received a diet that lacked 6-MBOA after the pups were born. Other females were fed food without 6-MBOA throughout pregnancy, but received one of the two diets during lactation. The pups from all experimental groups were weaned at 3 weeks of age and fed thereafter one of the two diets for 3 additional weeks. Prenatal exposure to 6-MBOA enhanced male reproductive development. Maternal ingestion of 6-MBOA during lactation or postweaning intake of 6-MBOA by the young did not influence reproductive development of males. This mechanism may be involved in the rapid rate of sexual maturation observed prior to peak population densities of microtine rodents. ¬© 1991.},

abstract={A dynamic programming model was developed to evaluate conditions that promote food caching. Long-term observations (3-4 months per bird) of caching behaviour by Carolina chickadees, Parus carolinensis, are discussed in the light of the predictions from the model. Two different fitness functions were modelled: net energy-rate maximization and survival-rate maximization. Under most simulated conditions, energy-rate maximizers are predicted to cache at uniformly high rates. Two tradeoffs are important in caching decisions of survival-rate maximizers. (1) When fat levels are high, caching decisions should reflect trade-offs between time allocated to foraging and non-foraging behaviour. At the highest fat levels, the expression of non-foraging behaviour should be relatively more valuable than foraging. As a result, caching is not predicted because it increases foraging time and thus reduces time available for alternative behaviour. As fat levels drop below the maximum, foraging requirements become more important and caching rates are predicted to increase. (2) At intermediate to low fat levels, caching decisions should reflect a response to trade-offs affecting starvation risk. At very low fat levels, the forager should eat any food at the site of discovery to reduce the risk of starvation in the near term. At intermediate fat levels, the forager is not at immediate risk of starvation, so it should cache to reduce starvation risk in the long-term. These mass-dependent trade-offs should also affect diurnal patterns in caching rates: caching rates should be low at dawn, when the forager's fat reserves are at their minimum, and at dusk, when fat reserves are at their peak; caching rates should be highest at midday. The experimental results suggest that chickadees do not maximize net energy intake rates; instead, their behaviour is in broad agreement with the predictions of a survival-rate maximizer. However, one additional prediction was clearly not supported: larger birds cached less than smaller birds. Observed seasonal patterns in caching, retrieval and recaching rates are also discussed. ¬© 1991 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The author finds that teenage pregnancy is more complicated than access to contraception or abortion. At risk teenagers are not identifiable, only at risk factors such as isolation, lack of perception of future opportunities, lack of self esteem, lack of self worth, poor performance in school, poor role models or lack of role models at home or in the community. There is indictment of parents who are just as much in need. The focus on teen pregnancy as one dimensional belies the reality that health, family, work, social and cultural experience affect people's decisions and sexual behavior. The recommendation is for a holistic approach, regardless of race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic background. Adolescents need education and jobs as well as preventive health, body image, and nutrition in conjunction with contraceptives. Where success is defined by motherhood or fatherhood, birth control pills sit in drawers at home. Teenagers need to be convinced that there is some benefit in being connected to mainstream society. Support services need to help teenagers answer the question of what's in it for me? Why? Teenagers need assistance in attaining educational success, job success, the ability to handle anger, and leadership opportunities. A holistic approach is not only realistic but also is the most practical with the longest term benefit. With resources for teen pregnancy superseded by the problems of AIDs and crack gangs, there is a constantly changing political agenda for resource allocation. In fact, teenage pregnancy is reflective of social ills in an urban society simultaneous with drug abuse, school dropouts, juvenile crime and gang activity. The common denominator is that teens all need good educational opportunities, good health, and good housing. Parent involvement is needed, and it is presumptuous to believe that a couple of hours of contact a week can change lives.

abstract={Mutual inhibition among behavioral command systems frequently has been suggested as a possible mechanism for switching between incompatible behaviors. Several neural circuits in crayfish that mediate incompatible behaviors have been found to interact through inhibition; this accounts for increased stimulus threshold of one behavior (e.g., escape tailflip) during performance of others (eating, walking, defense). To determine whether mutual inhibition between command systems can provide a mechanism that produces adaptive behavior, I developed a model crayfish that uses this mechanism to govern its behavioral choices in a simulated world that contains a predator, a shelter, and a food source. The crayfish uses energy that must be replaced by eating while it avoids capture by the predator. The crayfish has seven command systems (FORAGE, EAT, DEFENSE, RETREAT, ESCAPE, SWIM, HIDE) that compete through mutual inhibition for control of its behavior. The model crayfish was found to respond to changing situations by making adaptive behavioral choices at appropriate times. Choice depends on internal and external stimuli, and on recent history, which determines the pattern of those stimuli. The model's responses are unpredictable: small changes in the initial conditions can produce unexpected patterns of behavior that are appropriate alternate responses to the stimulus conditions. Despite this sensitivity, the model is robust; it functions adaptively over a large range of internal and external parameter values.},

abstract={Conflicting evidence exists concerning a "restricter/binger" dichotomy aligned with personality traits of obsessionality versus impulsivity, and family traits of enmeshment versus incohesion. The present study explored relationships among reported personality and family traits, on the one hand, and subtypes of eating symptoms, on the other, in a sample of 715 high-school girls. Symptomatic eaters (most displaying subclinical eating problems) consistently displayed more Mood Problems, Body Concerns, and Self-Criticism than did asymptomatic girls. Differences were observed between restrictive eaters and binge eaters on other variables: Restrictive types were more Perfectionistic, whereas bingers were more Impulsive and rated their families as more Incohesive. Results were discussed in the light of two views on restricter/binger differences. That they reflect: (a) premorbid features acting in predisposition to the eating disorders (EDs). (b) state-dependent features associated either with restrictive or binging phases of eating disturbances. ¬© 1991.},

abstract={Waist to hip ratio (WHR) was measured in 487 middle-aged women participating in the Healthy Women Study. Upper body fat distribution was found to be associated with numerous behaviors that affect cardiovascular risk, including smoking, low exercise levels, weight gain during adulthood, and higher caloric intake. Moreover, WHR was also associated with higher levels of anger, anxiety, and depression and lower levels of perceived social support. Women with upper body fat obesity had higher systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B and lower levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) and the HDL subfractions 2 and 3. These associations remained significant after adjusting for body mass index. Among 108 women who had repeat measurements of WHR, changes in WHR over a 3-year period were significantly correlated with changes in activity and with decreases in HDL2. Thus, WHR appears to be an integral component of the cardiovascular risk profile. WHR is related to those behaviors and psychosocial attributes that influence cardiovascular risk.},

abstract={The functional significance of sex differences in the size of the corpus callosum was investigated using a prenatal alcohol exposure paradigm that influences the fetal hormonal milieu. Adult male and female Long-Evans rats were selected from one of 3 prenatal treatment histories: prenatal alcohol-exposed (35% ethanol-derived calories), nutritional control (0% ethanol-derived calories) or standard control (lab chow). Subjects were assessed for open field activity at 85 days of age. At 100 days of age, midline sagittal areas of the corpus callosum and the anterior commisure were determined for these subjects. Male control subjects had significantly larger callosal areas than female controls. Prenatal alcohol exposure significantly decreased the total callosal area, and abolished this sexual dimorphism. When the callocal measurements were analyzed using Denenberg's regions, differential effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, undernutrition and sex were dissociable by subarea. There were no significant sex differences or effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in the midline sagittal area of the anterior commissure. Callosal size 0as negatively correlated to open field activity, suggesting a possible role in normal exploratory behavior and to the overactivity observed after prenatal alcohol exposure. ¬© 1990.},

abstract={Previously, the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A receptor agonists 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and buspirone and the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ICS 205-930 have been shown to exert anxiolytic-like effects in several animal models. In the experiments reported here the effects of these compounds on feeding behaviour and food preference in a novel environment were examined, and compared with the effects of the anxiolytic drug chlordiazepoxide and the anxiogenic compound FG 7142. Chlordiazepoxide significantly reduced the latency to begin eating and prolonged the total time spent eating; chlordiazepoxide also abolished food neophobia, by significantly increasing the time spent eating novel food items. In contrast, FG 7142 significantly increased eating latency and reduced eating duration. Both 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone significantly enhanced eating duration, but unlike chlordiazepoxide eating was directed only towards the familiar food. In addition buspirone, but not 8-OH-DPAT, reduced eating latency. ICS 205-930 significantly increased eating latency and reduced eating duration; however, these effects were observed only at the lowest dose tested. All of these behavioural effects were observed only when animals were unfamiliar with the testing situation, and cannot be accounted for in terms of changes in mechanisms controlling hunger. The behavioural paradigm used in these experiments may induce a competition between the drives to explore a novel environment and to eat. It is suggested that the tendency of buspirone and 8-OH-DPAT to suppress exploratory activity may thus result in enhanced feeding duration. Similarly enhanced exploratory activity induced by ICS 205-930 may result in animals taking longer to contact food, and spending less time eating. These results serve to illustrate that compounds which have different pharmacological actions, but which have been shown in other tests to have anxiolytic-like activity, can induce different behavioural effects. The suitability of this behavioural test for assessing anxiolytic effects of drugs is discussed. ¬© 1990 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={It has been proposed that morphological defenses against predation have demographic costs. We measured the cost of a predator-induced morphological defense, using predaceous phantom midge larvae Chaoborus americanus (Insecta, Diptera) and the prey species Daphnia pulex (Crustacea, Cladocera). The induced defense is a neck tooth (and other pleiotropic structures) developed in juvenile D. pulex in the presence of C. americanus. Laboratory life table experiments, in the absence of predation, indicated the population growth rate of typical D. pulex was 11% to 39% greater than that of D. pulex exposed to C. americanus extract, or C. americanus-conditioned water. The reduction in population growth rate was most frequently associated with an increase in the time between birth and first reproduction. Induced individuals required twenty more hours at 23¬∞C, and twenty five more hours at 20¬∞C, to develop to the age of first reproduction. Under limiting food conditions age-specific survivorship and the number of offspring produced per female by the induced form were reduced relative to the typical form. As a result, the difference in population growth rates among forms was greater at the low food level as indicated by a highly significant food by form interaction effect. In addition to neck teeth and lowered reproductive rates, the offspring of induced form individuals had significantly longer tail-spines (7.2-7.5%), and primiparous adults from the induction treatment were significantly shorter than controls (3-8%). ¬© 1990 Springer-Verlag.},

The major propositions derived and posited in this paper lend considerable support to intuitive notions with respect to the effects of anxiety on human behaviour in risky decision situations. Namely, that the willingness of an individual to pay to reduce health risks (an economic indicator of individual welfare associated with reduced morbidity or increased longevity) tends to be positive and higher when anxiety is present than when it is not. The formal results of the analysis show that when psychological considerations are incorporated into a state-dependent utility model, the normative results customarily obtained concerning value-of-life need to be qualified.},

The frequency of foraging of sea urchins in each treatment and in three size classes was determined. Starved sea urchins increased their foraging behavior while fed animals remained sedentary. Intermediate-sized animals were most inclined to forage for food. Under laboratory conditions, E. mathaei maintained a sedentary mode of feeding as long as drift food was available but began to forage when starved. Size-related differences in foraging were observed and may be related to factors such as differing food requirements, susceptibility to predation and intraspecific competition for space. ¬© 1990.},

abstract={Juvenile Nucella lapillus of two different shell phenotypes, exposed shore and protected shore, were maintained in running seawater under each of three experimental conditions for 94 d: a) laboratory control, b) exposed to the effluent of crabs (Cancer pagurus) fed frozen fish ('fish-crab'), and c) exposed to the effluent of crabs fed live conspecific snails ('snail-crab'). Rates of barnacle consumption and rates of body weight change varied significantly between phenotypes and among experimental conditions. Individuals from the protected-shore consumed consistently fewer barnacles and grew consistently less than those from the exposed shore. Body weight increases in the fish-crab treatments were from 25 to 50% less than those in the controls and body weights in the snail-crab treatment either did not change or actually decreased. The perceived risk of predation thus appears to have a dramatic effect on the rates of feeding and growth of N. lapillus. At the end of the experiment, size-adjusted final shell weights for both phenotypes were consistently higher than controls (no crab) in both the fish-crab and snail-crab treatments. In addition, apertural tooth height, thickness of the lip, and retractability (i.e. the extent to which a snail could withdraw into its shell), with few exceptions all varied in an adaptive manner in response to the various risk treatments. Similar changes in the shell form of starved snails exposed to the same stimuli suggest very strongly that the morphological responses of both phenotypes were not just due to differences in rates of growth. These differences, at least in part, represented a direct cueing of the shell form of Nucella lapillus to differences in the perceived risk of predation. Somewhat surprisingly, the extent of phenotypic plasticity appeared to differ between the populations examined. Both field and laboratory evidence suggest that the exposed-shore population was much more labile morphologically than the protected-shore population. In many instances, particularly among starved snails, the development of antipredatory shell traits was greater in the fish-crab treatment than in the snail-crab treatment. Because the scent of crabs was present in both treatments, these results suggest a) that, at the frequency/concentration used in the experiments, the scent of damaged conspecifics may have been a supernormal stimulus and b) that the morphological response in these treatments might have been greater if the stimulus had been provided at a lower level. ¬© 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={Two major causes of mortality in early life stages of marine fish are starvation and predation, both of which may be influenced by vertical position in the water column. This study examined under controlled laboratory conditions the behavioral response of juvenile walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma Pallas (60-90 mm) to light, thermoclines and food, factors which have been correlated with their vertical distribution in the sea. Juveniles generally showed a preference for low light intensities and low reflectance. However, when given a choice between two very low intensities equal to full moonlight and quarter moonlight, preference shifted towards higher intensity. When cold water (3 ¬∞ C) was introduced into the bottom of the experimental tank to form a thermocline, the fish avoided it by swimming upward and remaining in the warmer upper water column (9 ¬∞ C). When food was introduced below the thermocline, the motivation to feed caused the fish to descend transiently into cold water thereby altering their vertical distribution. The results are consistent with findings from previous field studies and suggest how behavioral responses to light, temperature and food availability may determine vertical distribution. ¬© 1990.},

abstract={Phencyclidine (PCP) sensitivity of rats, whose body weights were maintained at 70% of free-feeding controls, was compared to drug sensitivity on the controls in terms of unconditioned (exploratory) behavior and plasma corticosterone levels. Low doses of PCP HCl [0 (saline vehicle), 0.3 or 0.9 mg/kg, SC] were given to food-deprived rats and to free-feeding controls 15 minutes before measuring unconditioned behavior for 90 minutes; then PCP in brain and corticosterone in plasma were assayed. An additional group (0.43 mg/kg) was established from the reduced-weight rats in order to compare with free-feeding rats given 0.3 mg/kg, the same absolute dose-a circumstance reflecting "street" usage in which doses are not adjusted for body weight differences among users. These low doses of PCP altered exploratory behaviors, but there did not appear to be an interaction between food-deprivational status and drug, with the possible exception of an altered effect of PCP upon habituation in the lighter animals. PCP elevated plasma corticosterone levels over saline controls only in the reduced-weight rats. The drug, possibly reflecting a tranquilizing action of the lowest dose, reduced corticosterone levels in free-feeding controls. Brain levels of drug were directly related to dose, and were elevated in the food-deprived animals 26-30% over those at the same per-weight dose levels in the free-feeding rats, in spite of being given lower absolute amounts of drug. In the 0.43 mg/kg reduced-weight dose group, given the same absolute dose as the 0.3 mg/kg free-feeding group, brain levels were doubled over the latter group, and exploratory behavior was correspondingly different from the free-feeding group. Behavioral and endocrinological consequences of lipophilic drugs (like PCP) are magnified in states of weight loss with fixed-amount dose regimens, and this might have a dispositional basis. ¬© 1990.},

abstract={Tritium-labelled phencyclidine (PCP) hydrochloride (12 mg/kg) was injected SC for six consecutive days into two groups of eight male rats maintained at 85% of their initial free-feeding weights. Eight days after the last injection, electric footshock raised fat levels of PCP 28% over nonshocked controls, and lowered blood levels 18%, but did not alter brain levels of the drug significantly. Thus, application of an acute stressor does result in redistribution of tissue stores of phencyclidine as predicted in the literature; however, the direction of the redistributions was to fat, rather than to brain. To explore the relation of a long-term stressor (one that eliminates adipose tissue as a sink for mobilized PCP), exploratory behavior was evaluated in male rats during six days of food deprivation commencing after six daily injections of PCP HCl (2 or 4 mg/kg, SC). Exploratory behavior of the 4 mg/kg dose group was abruptly altered, compared to saline controls, at six days of food deprivation, when the rats' body weights were about 70% of initial weights and when body fat would be severely reduced or depleted. To assess replicability and generalizability of this phenomenon, PCP HCl (4 or 8 mg/kg, SC) or dextroamphetamine sulfate (3.2 or 6.4 mg/kg, SC) was injected into male rats for six days and food deprivation followed afterward for nine consecutive days, or until similar body weight reductions as in the first experiment were achieved. Again, exploratory behavior was altered in comparison to saline controls in phencyclidine-treated rats (at the 4 mg/kg dose level) when rats reached about 70% of initial weights. Behavior of dextroamphetamine-treated animals (at 3.2 mg/kg) was also different from controls, suggesting that interactions between food deprivation (stress) and lipophilic drugs of abuse occur when body fat stores reach a threshold. ¬© 1990.},

abstract={Risk-sensitive foraging preferences in bitterlings were examined in relation to changing food deprivation and intake relative to estimated requirement. When running above estimated requirement and presented with a choice of constant and variable feeding stations, a group of seven fish were all risk-averse (avoiding high variance in reward rate). When running below, six out of the seven fish showed increased risk-aversion and one became risk-prone (choosing high variance). Increasing the degree of food deprivation while running below requirement for one of the risk-averse fish, however, resulted in a switch to risk-proneness, a response that was repeated in a second group of six fish running below requirement. Variance in reward rate also appeared to influence the choice of a potential breeding site by a male bitterling. When breeding sites of apparent equal quality were provided at the constant and variable feeding stations, the fish preferred the constant station; the variable station was preferred only when breeding site quality at the constant station was relatively low. ¬© 1990 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={In a small-scale experiment the effects of four variables were investigated in male and female Wistar rats fed on a standard laboratory chow and not deliberately exposed to any carcinogen. The variables investigated were (i) diet restriction by limiting access to food to 6.5 hr/day instead of 24 hr/day; (ii) housing males in a single-sex room as distinct from a mixed-sex room; (iii) life-long segregation of males from females, as distinct from access to one virgin female for 5 days during each alternate week; and (iv) uniparity in females versus life-long virginity. The endpoints compared were body-weight gain, longevity, visible and palpable swellings, absolute and relative organ weights, microscopically confirmed malignant neoplasms that contributed to death before the end of the study at 2 yr, incidence of other neoplasms in decedents and rats killed at the end of the study, and the incidence of various non-neoplastic conditions including myocardial inflammation and fibrosis, chronic progressive nephropathy, liver glycogen storage and fatty degeneration, mammary gland hyperplasia and secretory activity, pancreatic polyarteritis, radiculoneuropathy and certain testicular changes. The results indicated major beneficial effects of dietary restriction on most of the endpoints. By comparison the other variables had only marginal effects. Leydig-cell hyperplasia and neoplasia occurred at significantly higher incidences in males housed intermittently with females than in permanently segregated males. No convincing differences were seen between females that littered once and those that remained virgins. The relevance of these findings to the prediction of cancer mortality risk in man and to the design of rodent carcinogenicity studies is discussed. ¬© 1990.},

abstract={THE adaptive significance of diel vertical migration by planktonic organisms is often explained in terms of daily changes in foraging locations that reduce the risk of depth-stratified predation1-3. The timing, extent and rate of migration are usually presumed to be more or less invariant (closed4) behaviours that have evolved under local predation regimes5-8. Observational and experimental evidence, however, indicate that migratory patterns in the presence of predators may be altered substantially by short-term reduction in the availability of food9-13. Behavioural flexibility of food-limited individuals rather than genetic change of populations seems likely13. Whether individuals are also sensitive to changes in the risk of predation is unknown, though some field observations are highly suggestive14. Here I report rapid initiation (&lt;4 h) of vertical migration in previously non-migrating freshwater copepods inside large in situ enclosures on exposure to an invertebrate predator. Responses of copepods to water that had previously held captive predators suggests that a chemical cue is involved. These results show that crustacean zooplankton may be capable of flexible, predator-sensitive foraging and suggest a mechanism for rapid changes in migration patterns. ¬© 1990 Nature Publishing Group.},

Voles raised with supplemental food displayed less aggression toward one another, but there was no effect of food on home-range size when comparing treatments for a given density. Thus food appeared to act indirectly on home-range size via the effect of food on population density. Voles with supplemental food moved less between trapping sessions, which may indicate less shifting of home ranges with greater availability of food. Exposure to predation did not affect aggression among voles, but it appeared to reduce home-range size, even after correcting for the effect of density. This reduced movement was probably a direct behavioural response of voles to the presence of predators. -from Authors},

abstract={In a study of cardiovascular reactivity to dietary manipulation of sodium and calcium, we pretested 30 young black normotensive males who were equally divided by positive and negative parental histories of hypertension with a 12-item anger questionnaire we devised and the Cook-Medley Hostility, Manifest Hostility, Overcontrolled Hostility, and Inhibited Hostility scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. Contrary to expectations, we found no correlation of resting blood pressure or cardiovascular reactivity to repeated mental demands with the two measures of inhibited hostility. We did, however, find resistance to habituation of cardiovascular reactivity in subjects with high Manifest Hostility and positive family histories of essential hypertension. Our findings suggest that vulnerability to hypertension may be revealed by the perseveration of blood pressure reactivity to repeated mental challenge. We propose that the perseveration of blood pressure reactivity is a disinhibitory phenomenon caused by a difficulty in the management of multiple inhibitory demands that disrupts the natural course of habituation and could be an important etiologic factor in essential hypertension. ¬© 1990 Behavioral Medicine.

abstract={Most moles and mole rats spend their lifetimes within the confines of tunnel walls, constructing, maintaining, and modifying burrow system structure in response to changing external circumstances and changing internal needs. Thus, anatomy, physiology, behavior, and distribution are all greatly affected by the burrow environment, with temperature, humidity, gas concentrations, living space, availability of food and mating partners, and protection from flooding and predation all being influenced by burrow architecture. Regrettably, the burrow structure of almost all subterranean mammals is unknown, or known only from several incomplete excavations. Moreover, existing data is often vague without any mention of particular structures or surrounding habitat, which makes the placing of burrow structure in an adaptive perspective difficult. Reasons for these short-comings are understandable: excavations require laborious excavation which can extend for hundreds of meters, reaching depths in excess of a meter; it is often difficult to remove the occupant prior to excavation which avoids modification of the system by the animal during excavation; particular types of subterranean mammals are limited in distribution to particular continents so that the literature is often localized and a global perspective difficult to obtain; and there is no standardization of terms relating to burrow structure, making intergroup comparison confusing. This paper addresses the above difficulties and encourages further investigation in this central area of study by making obvious the paucity of information for most subterranean mammals, presenting a synopsis of known burrow structures of major groups which will make particular gaps in our knowledge evident, providing a bibliography of major papers on burrow structure with coverage of most moles and mole rats, establishing a checklist of burrow features to better analyze future excavations and facilitate intergroup comparison, and lastly, to indicate possible adaptive significance of various burrow features to promote further observation, speculation and experimentation.},

abstract={Large temporal and spatial variations in both the frequency (percentage of birds) and intensity of distraction displays performed by red grouse were examined in relation to four hypotheses. First, that the display is performed in response to the risk of brood predation was supported by an increase in the frequency of high-risk distraction display with predator pressure, brood size and poor cover (for males but not females) although females disturbed when brooding were not more likely to display than females not brooding. Second, that the frequency of display depends on the predation risk on the parents was supported by a lower level of display by females whose mate was absent and a significant correlation between the levels of display of members of a pair. Third, that the condition of the parent bird influences the frequency of display was refuted since distraction displays in females with reduced parasite burdens and hence improved body condition did not display more than parasitized females. Fourth, that the frequency of display is related to the costs of replacing a brood was not supported since there was no association between frequency of display and either clutch size or brood age. The adaptive value of the large variation in the frequency of brood defence is discussed in relation to predator naivety. ¬© 1990 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Experiments were conducted in male rats to assess the motor effects of bilateral intraperifornical microinjections of sulpiride, dopamine (DA) and other drags. Sulpiride increased locomotion of the animals in all the experiments reported here. DA (10 Œºg) administered 5 minutes before sulphide (8 Œºg) reduced the motor stimulant effect of the neuroleptic from 1601.3 ¬± 337.6 to 742.5 ¬± 180.4 counts/30 min. SCH 23390 (15 Œºg), haloperidol (2.5 Œºg) and atropine (18 Œºg) did not modify the locomotion level of animals acclimated to the actimeters. After carbachol (5 Œºg) the animals attained a level of hyperactivity (1459.5 ¬± 146.5 counts/ 30 min) similar to that induced by sulpiride (1595.7 ¬± 365.7 counts/30 min) in the same experiment. In other experiments DA (10 Œºg) administered 30 min before sulpiride again blocked the effect of 8 Œºg of sulpiride, and reduced the initial hyperactivity of food-and water-deprived animals previously familiarized with the actimeters (922.4 ¬± 49.38 counts/15 min under saline, vs. 544 ¬± 29 counts/15 min under DA). The same DA dose did not modify the initial spontaneous activity of nonfamiliarized nonfood-deprived rats (508.9 ¬± 96.1 after saline vs. 520.9 ¬± 47.1 after DA).These results suggest the presence of cells in the lateral hypothalamus involved in the control of locomotion. These experiments also suggest that locomotion triggered by the LH may be exploratory behavior essential to the search for water and food. As a corollary, DA in the LH appears to be involved not only in the inhibition of feeding and drinking but also in the inhibition of exploratory and food- and water-directed locomotion. ¬© 1990.},

abstract={Litters of domestic piglets show strong sibling competition, large differences among litter-mates in birth weight and rate of growth, and, in the absence of human intervention, a high mortality rate. This combination of traits suggests that pigs are using a reproductive strategy similar to that of certain bird species which produce one or more small 'spare' young whose death or survival is determined by sibling competition. Death through competition is natural in such species. Prevention of death requires the early identification and separate rearing of unsuccessful competitors. The major behavioural pathways leading to piglet deaths are considered to be malnutrition through unsuccessful suckling behaviour, and crushing of piglets by the sow. Crushing involves two distinct behavioural sequences: posterior crushing (beneath the sow's hind quarters) and ventral crushing (beneath the udder and rib cage). Farrowing crates are designed to prevent posterior but not ventral crushing. Malnourished piglets appear to be more vulnerable to crushing, perhaps because persistent suckling attempts cause them to spend more time near the sow. Prevention of crushing thus requires a reduction in malnutrition, not merely restriction of the sow's movements. Under certain conditions, dehydration may be an important but neglected aspect of malnutrition. Some litters of piglets have much higher death losses than others, presumably because of risk factors that apply to the litter as a whole. Early malnutrition, resulting from hypogalactia in the sow in the first days after farrowing, appears to be an important risk factor. Farrowing difficulties leading to piglet hypoxia during the birth process may be another. Risk factors that affect whole litters deserve greater emphasis in future research.},

abstract={The tropical water bug Diplonychus indicus is a highly versatile predator that alternates quickly from active foraging to ambushing. The influence of hunger level, the presence of prey and environmental complexity on swimming, diving resting and foraging by adult males was investigated at the individual level, in a factorial experiment with three main treatments. There were simple relationships between these factors and the water bug's behaviour, and interactions between these three factors also affected foraging. The general distribution of foraging tactics between active search and ambushing was significantly influenced by the presence of perching sites (vegetation), but not by hunger levels although hungry bugs as well as bugs in the absence of perching sites were significantly more active than well-fed subjects or bugs in the presence of perching sites. In the presence of vegatation, predatory attempts included fewer dives and more attempts from ambush including preliminary orientations. Hunger level, however, did influence the distribution of ambush predatory tactics; the attempts by hungry subjects included more preliminary orientations. Capture efficiency was not affected by hunger level, but it was affected by the presence of perching sites. Under these experimental conditions the bugs appeared to be capable of modifying, to a certain extent, their predatory tactics in relation to the environment. Nevertheless, the choice of a predatory tactic did not appear to be taken on an all or none basis. ¬© 1990 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The objectives of the present study were a) to examine behavioral and sociodemographic factors associated with voluntary response to a health risk appraisal (HRA), and b) to assess the effect of HRA feedback on subsequent preventive health behaviors and risk-taking behaviors. After collection of health behavior data from a larger sample participating in a Navy-wide health promotion evaluation, an HRA was mailed to a random subsample of 625 individuals. A total of 270 (43%) people responded to the HRA and received printed feedback. Follow-up health behavior data were collected one year later from 93 of the 270 HRA respondents. These 93 individuals were then matched with a control group who did not receive an HRA but had provided health behavior data both times. Analyses revealed that HRA respondents were older, better educated, had higher health status, smoked less, consumed less alcohol, and used seat belts more often than nonrespondents. Separate analyses of HRA respondents and matched controls indicated that HRA participation had no significant effect on subsequent preventive health behaviors or risk-taking behaviors. Results suggest limitations of the HRA as an effective cue to behavior change.},

abstract={In a prospective study of 283 myocardial infarction (MI) patients, state-dependent feelings of anxiety, depression, and irritability were assessed twice during hospital stay, and four times during a 3-5 yr follow-up. A K-mean cluster analysis identified six subgroups of MI patients with different pattern of emotional reactions. Two groups, containing nearly half of the sample, had low average levels of emotional upset at all assessments. Two groups showed an intermediate long-term outcome: one of these had a high level of initial emotional upset that subsided during the first six months after discharge, whereas the other group showed increasing levels of emotional distress long-term follow-up. Finally, two groups failed to achieve long-term emotional readjustment. For one of these, a high level of emotional upset was evident from the first in-hospital assessment, whereas the other one had a sharp increase in emotional distress after discharge. In a series of psychological, social and medical variables, the former pattern was associated with more pre-MI medical and psychosocial problems, whereas the delayed emotional reaction was related to lower levels of cardiac health knowledge. Furthermore, high levels of emotional upset preceded both failure in resuming work and increased long-term rehospitalization. The findings indicate that emotional reactions after a MI should be monitored during convalescence to identify patients at risk for a failure in emotional readjustment. Furthermore, effective treatment of initial emotional reactions could promote resumption of work and reduce long-term morbidity. ¬© 1990.},

abstract={Based on a system to categorize high-risk situations for relapse in addictive disorders, instruments were developed to assess cue strength and self-efficacy relevant to weight loss attempts. Two versions of the Situational Appetite Measure (SAM) were developed, one to assess urges to overeat in selected situations and the other to assess self-efficacy in controlling urges to overeat. In a sample of college student dieters and enrollees in commercial diet centers, the measures were found to be highly correlated, such that as consummatory urges increased, self-efficacy to control overeating decreased. High-risk situations were represented by five relatively distinct and reliable subscales: relaxation, food present, hunger, reward, and negative feelings. Low cue strength and high self-efficacy for controlling overeating in situations involving negative feelings predicted weight reduction among female dieters in treatment. The multidimensional nature of the SAM allows for differential prediction of eating behavior across situations. ¬© 1990.},

abstract={Altough standard risk factors are clearly related to cardiovascular diseases; even taken together they account for about half of the incidence rates in prospective studies. Therefore psychosocial variables - among them work related characteristics - are of increasing significance for research and prevention in CHD. Thus, an enlarged version of the KARASEK-conception was studied in the GDR-MONICA- Population, aged 25 to 64 years. Additional to the original Karasek-questionnarie, the more 'objective' work characteristics as well as the scale 'Social Interaction at workplace' are implemented. Based on data of this study, the usefulness but also the limitations of the diversified Karasek conception (Job Demands, Decision Latitude, Social Interaction at work) are demonstrated. In spite of the relevance for smoking, blood pressure, cholesterol and overweight of the Karasek-model recommended also the objective work characteristics as well as other mediating variables should be taken into account. As a consuquence from our results, the GDR-MONICA-center has started a research programme which uses a complex system of diagnostic methods, among them the following conceptions: - Health knowledge/Attitudes - Social support/social network variables - Vital exhaustion - Life events - mediating personality factors (Type-A behaviour pattern etc.) together with other lifestyle-related factors, for instance physical activity, nutrition and smoking habits. Results from this multifactorial and integrative MONICA-Psychosocial study can be expected in the near future.},

abstract={Female parents of Elasmucha dorsalis attend their offspring and show specific sequential defensive behavior when disturbed. Intense responses of brooding females such as wing fanning were usually triggered by exposure to crushed nymphs. Maternal care continued for a long time, sometimes into the fourth or last nymphal instar. Female removal experiments showed that maternal defense is highly effective under field conditions. High egg mortality observed in the field was probably due to the predation by an ant, Myrmica ruginodis, which occurred at high densities on the host plant, Aruncus dioicus. Most of the egg masses were found on the leaves subtending axillary inflorescence of the female plants, and nymphs usually aggregated and fed on fruits in the inflorescence. Because the food of nymphs is temporally limited, the female can produce only a single brood. Thus, temporality of food resources as well as a heavy predation pressure may have led to prolonged maternal care. ¬© 1989 Japan Ethological Society.},

abstract={The stalkless crinoid Antedon mediterranea (Lamarck) is a passive suspension-feeder, relying on exogenous currents to supply it with food. The animal uses aerosol filtration mechanisms to remove particles from suspension and thus can feed on particles which are smaller than the mesh of its filter. The influence of food availability on feeding activity of Antedon were monitored quantitatively in a laboratory flow chamber. Because the rate at which the animal encounters food particles, is a combined function of particle concentration and of ambient current speed, both these variables were manipulated simultaneously and their combined influence on feeding activity were monitored. Ambient current speeds were varied between 0.4 and 3.7 cm ¬∑ s-1 and concentrations of food (the unicellular alga Hymenomonas) ranged from 0 controls to 10000 cells ¬∑ ml-1. Both particle concentration and ambient current speed shape the functional response of Antedon at all values tested; however, they do not show an interactive effect. I.e., the feeding activity of the crinoid is not a function of the rate at which particles approach the filter but depends only on the ambient particle concentration and current speed. This observation can be accounted for by hydromechanical effects at the filter and a complex behavioral modulation of the feeding response. In addition to the above effects, a novel form of hysteresis in the feeding behavior was discovered: response to a given current velocity depends on whether that velocity was reached by an increase or a decrease in speed. This response may result from down regulation of receptor mediated events. ¬© 1989.},

abstract={Queueing models are developed for predators that make captures while handling. The predator 'serves' prey by eating them, and 'customers' captured while the predator is feeding represeni a queue of prey awaiting 'service'. Holling's disc equation for the type II functional response is shown to be a special case of a queueing model. Optimal foraging models for queueing predators predict that behavioural choices by predators should be contingent upon current queue size. For predators choosing between prey types, the decision to attack low-quality prey depends on queue size at intermediate densities of high-quality prey. At these densities, low-quality prey should be attacked if the predator is unoccupied, but ignored if the predator is already handling prey. For predators choosing when to abandon prey and resume searching, the giving up criterion is predicted to depend on current queue size. Predators should tolerate a greater degree of depletion of the food available in a prey item (longer handling times) when there are no prey waiting in the queue. Studies of foraging in queueing predators have ignored the potential importance of such contingent behavioural choices. However, observations on the relationship between handling time and queue size in one queueing predator are consistent with predictions of the queueing model. ¬© 1989 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The 16‚Äêyear data of a Great Tit population, breeding and overwintering in a nest box area at Oulu, northern Finland, were studied to reveal the factors governing the annual fluctuations in density and local survival. The breeding density at Taskila was high after a cold spring (March‚ÄêApril) and a warm August the year before was also followed by a large breeding population. A similar relationship resulted for the local survival of fledglings, and there was a tendency for immigrant yearlings to settle to breed in large numbers when the spring was cold. In the north, Great Tits cannot survive the winter in the forests but gather around feeding tables near human settlements. A cold spring evidently suppresses the birds' dispersal before the breeding season. For a population which is time‚Äêlimited, it is adaptive to remain in order to breed nearby instead of searching for territories out in the forests when conditions become favourable late in the spring. Thus, the negative correlation between spring temperature and the size of the following breeding population may be the result of a spatial distribution of juveniles achieved by behavioural responses to unfavourable conditions. The causality behind the high survival of resident juveniles after a warm August may be attributable to food availability during the time when the birds undergo their postjuvenile moult, which is an energy‚Äêdemanding process. The survival rate of breeding adults was highly dependent on the intensity of nightly predation upon individuals roosting in nest boxes. Stoats Mustela erminea, the prime predators, preyed on tits when the populations of their main prey species, small rodents, were low. When the effect of predation was eliminated, the density‚Äêdependent survival of adult birds disappeared. During low predation years the adult survival rate was negatively related to the number of fledglings produced per pair; this suggests that investment in descendants is a substantial survival cost for reproducing individuals.

abstract={Economic utilisation of wild herbivores has been argued on biotechnical, socio-economic, and environmental grounds. Biotechnical arguments include environmental adaptations, complementary diets, high sustained productivity, and desirable carcase qualities of wild ungulates. Socioeconomic arguments include complementary patterns of inputs in relation to conventional animal agriculture, access to a broader range of markets, and provision of culturally consistent livelihoods for indigenous peoples. Environmental benefits may derive from maintenance of natural habitats, competition with illegal markets, and sometimes provision of an ultimate genetic refuge for rare species. However, the degree to which these benefits accrue depends on how wildlife production systems are designed. Ultimately, systems are constrained by the physiological, ecological, and behavioural needs of animals. But these often must be compromised in the interests of conflicting human needs such as a fixed domicile, nutritional and economic security, or competitive demands for labour and capital. The marketplace and public perceptions further limit options. -from Authors},

abstract={Animals working for any one of a variety of positive reinforcers (food, water, brain-stimulation...) produce dramatic decrements in operant performance when challenged with dopamine antagonist neuroleptic drugs. This well-established fact has generated considerable research aimed at identifying the precise nature of the drug-induced behavioral impairment. The two most oft-cited hypotheses suggest that much of the reduction in operant responding can be accounted for by either an "anhedonic" or "motoric" consequence of dopamine antagonism. Several novel behavioral paradigms are described which were devised to more clearly elucidate both the motor and reward impairing qualities of neuroleptic agents. Motor performance was assessed in a food-reinforced task in which a computer-operated force-transducer was used to obtain detailed analyses of the biophysical properties of operant responding. These studies suggested that neuroleptics impair the temporal nature (i.e., "timing") of normal operant behavior and not the physical capacity of the animals (i.e., the ability to emit "force"). This identification of a robust "slowing" effect of neuroleptic challenge, suggested that the investigation of putative "reward" impairments should best be conducted with behavioral paradigms in which the test data are collected from undrugged animals. Three such paradigms are described: a partial reinforcement extinction test, an incentive motivation test, and a conditioned place preference test. To date, our results suggest that when motor confounds are avoided, dopamine antagonist drugs can still produce patterns of operant behavior that very closely resemble those observed with actual reductions in reward magnitude. Such data provide support for the contention that central dopaminergic substrates play a role in the neurobiology of positive reinforcement. ¬© 1989 Pergamon Press plc All rights reserved.},

Much of the work regarding adaptations to enteral feeding have described the pathophysiological and experiential responses of individuals - that there is less emphasis on the physiological and behavioral responses is evident in the literature. Also, little investigation has been focused on the environmental risk factors or the person vulnerability factors that are associated with less than optimal adaptations to enteral feeding. However, it is the understanding of all three of these aspects that will lead to comprehensive strategies for promoting satisfactory adaptations. To date, the majority of clinical therapeutic studies have focused on obviating or managing untoward reactions to enteral feeding by manipulating environmental physical factors. Certainly, more needs to be done, particularly with respect to temporal and rhythmicity considerations. However, there is an obvious lack of information about manipulating social circumstances or person factors (such as, knowledge deficit) for therapeutic ends. Examination of the multiple dimensions of patient responses to enteral nutrition modalities, the interaction of these various dimensions (concentrating on the social and person), and the physical elements is congruent with the holistic and caring nature of nursing practice and should guide future study.},

abstract={The hippocampal formation is thought to be involved in spatial learning. A role as a more general, intermediate-term memory store has also been suggested. In this report, we address a moderately persistent change in propagation of excitation through hippocampal circuitry which resulted from exposure of animals to environments in which they were free to move and explore. Rats were prepared for chronic recording of perforant path-evoked dentate granule-cell population responses. A large increase in the synaptic component of this response developed over the first several minutes after the animals were transferred to a different but not necessarily novel environment, and decayed with a time constant of about 5 min. This apparent growth in synaptic strength was remarkably well correlated with the animal‚Äôs recent history of exploratory behavior, and was not due simply to handling or to the electrical stimulation. The amplitude of the population-spike component also varied over time, but was not obviously correlated with changes in the synaptic component. These response changes were different in both apparent mechanism and time course from previously reported, longer lasting, environmentally induced changes in the population-spike component. They also differed from the behavioral state-dependent gating effect reported by Winson and Abzug (1977) to the extent that the present effects long outlasted the behaviors that produced them. Although further analysis is required, it is possible that this phenomenon may reflect one mode of information storage in the hippocampal formation. ¬© 1989, Psychonomic Society, Inc..

abstract={Obesity, defined as an excess of body fat, can be measured with a variety of techniques, but in most epidemiologic studies it is estimated from height and weight or from skinfold thickness. The "gold standard" for body fat is the body density from which fat and fat-free body mass can be calculated. The new technique of bioelectric impedance analysis may substantially improve the estimation of total body fat. For estimating regional fat distribution, either waist to hip circumference ratio or subscapular skinfold have been most useful. Using the body mass index, defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (kilogram per square meter), the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey estimated that 26%, or 34 million, adult Americans aged 20 to 75 were overweight. The prevalence of severe overweight (a body mass index above 30 kg/m2) is higher in the United States and Canada than in Great Britain, the Netherlands, or Australia. Obesity results from an increase in energy intake relative to expenditure. Total daily energy expenditure includes energy used during resting metabolism, energy associated with the ingestion of food, and energy needed for physical activity. The obese are often observed to be less active, but since carrying a heavier load requires more energy, their total energy expenditure may not be low. A low resting metabolic rate has been sugested as a predictor of future risk of becoming obese. Adipose tissue is the major site for fat storage and may contain more than 90% of total energy stores. The increase in body mass index or degree of body weight is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, gall bladder disease, and diabetes mellitus. When fat is centrally located in either males or females, the risk for these diseases is also increased, and may be a more important risk factor than total overweight itself. Genetic factors form the background from which obesity develops. The best estimates suggest that these genetic factors may be of less importance than environmental events in determination of total body fat and its distribution. Obesity can be classified on the basis of the total number of fat cells and regional fat distribution by using the etiological factors which caused the obesity or by determining the age at which the obesity began. Regardless of the cause, treatment for obesity should be based on an evaluation of the individual's risk from obesity as compared with the risk of the treatment under consideration. Low-risk treatments, such as modest caloric restriction, exercise, and behavioral strategies, are appropriate for individuals with low risk from obesity. As the risk increases with a rising body mass index, the use of pharmacologic agents, very low calorie diets and, for those in the very high risk category (body mass index above 40 kg/m2), surgical treatments. Behavioral strategies appear to be among the most effective in dealing with obesity and should be a part of any treatment program. ¬© 1989.},

Results on lane-changes-cars passed indicated greater risk-taking in driving by high sensation seekers. Interaction of alcohol expectancy and sensation seeking indicated high sensation seekers took more risks when they believed they had consumed alcohol.

abstract={Medical examinations of employees are subject to special legal conditions, depending on the circumstances. In the framework of the discussion about genetic engineering and thus about possible genetic testing of employees the following principles are to be observed: 1. The obligation to guarantee the employees' rights to privacy rules out that a comprehensive personality or health profile is established in the course of preemployment medical examinations or periodic medical examinations of employees. Genetic testing may therefore only be done if it is limited to detecting illnesses which are job-related or which arise from substances the employee is exposed to; it must however not cover the possible risks of an employee to contract a disease. This also corresponds to the employer's restricted right to put questions to the employee. This means that in respect of any previous genetic testing conducted on the employee the employer's right to put questions to the employee is limited to job-related illnesses or illnesses related to the work substances he was exposed to. 2. Genetic testing requires the employee's special covered consent. 3. Periodic mass examinations which under the aspect of occupational medicine do not serve to protect the employees or third parties have to be prohibited by act of law. 4. Genetic testing may be justified in the framework of occupational medical examinations to detect an increased risk for an individual employee to develop a disease. In these cases as in other cases of risks which are due to the individual person's condition it has to be ensured that third parties are only informed about such an examination result after extensive guidance of the employee and only with his consent. The employee must be entitled to refuse genetic testing without having to fear adverse consequences for his job. The provisions governing occupational medical examinations have to correspond to these principles.},

abstract={Strains of Aedes triseriatus from sympatry with the tree-hole dwelling predator Toxorhynchites rutilus produced more surviving adults when exposed to predation than did strains from allopatry to the predator. Sympatric strains also had greater survivorship under low food conditions without predation than did allopatric strains, although allopatric strains produced larger adults and had shorter development periods. Per capita rate of population change was always greater for sympatric than for allopatric strains. Results show lower vulnerability to predation of sympatric vs allopatric strains, but do not support the hypothesis that defense against predation has associated costs. No evidence was found for differential ability to use physical complexity as a refuge from predation. Environmental differences between sympatric and allopatric regions, eg different climates and different numbers of potential competing species, along with presence/absence of the predator, may influence vulnerability to predation, developmental plasticity and resource use. -from Author},

abstract={The present studies concerned a perceptual mechanism that could partially explain the anorexic's severe eating restraint despite continuing hunger. If a woman values a thin body, unrealistic perception of food's fattening effects should increase the aversiveness of ingesting food and foster restraint eating. The first study considered the perceived thinness/fatness of women's bodies without and with food cues present. College women who (1) shared the stress‚Äêgenerating personality characteristics of anorexics (AP); and (2) judged models as fatter after food cues were introduced (enhancers) reported more stress than AP non‚Äêenhancers; no effect of enhancement upon stress was observed in controls. This moderator effect was replicated in a second study. Thus, women with the personality characteristics and high stress that put them at‚Äêrisk for anorexia also displayed the perceptual distortion involved in the proposed mechanism. Self‚Äêratings verified the same perceptual mechanism in the high‚Äêstress AP woman's perception of her own body. Copyright ¬© 1989 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company},

Controls were children receiving routine primary pediatric health services at a university based clinical office. Children with bottle caries were more likely to be living in a single parent household (p = 0.005). A higher incidence of sleep difficulties and strong temper also was reported (p = 0.05). Cases were more likely to take the bottle to bed and, to an older age than controls. They received less professional advice regarding weaning as well as less fluoride supplementation (p = 0.025).

Rotter‚Äîlocus of control, reinforcement values, social context‚Äîas predictors, 21% of the variation in reported nutritious food behavior was explained. The results show that those who believe they are in control of their destinies (internally-controlled) score higher on reported nutritious food behavior than do those who believe outcomes are due to outside forces (externally-controlled). Similarly, differences exist among reinforcement values groups and among social context categories.

Three doses of progesterone (0, 40, 80 mg/kg body weight) were administered during the final 3 days of the second experiment. Eighty mg/kg progesterone decreased rearing activity, but increased ambulation; motivation to retrieve food pellets was not affected. These effects of 80 mg/kg progesterone were observed at least as long as 2 hours after injection. Forty mg/kg progesterone did not produce such effects.

abstract={In this report the neurotoxicity of aspartame and its constituent amino acids aspartic acid and phenylalanine is reviewed. The adverse reactions ascribed to the consumption of aspartame-containing products, as reported in the U.S.A., are discussed and placed in perspevtive with the results of recent behavioural studies in humans and animals. The issue of common intake levels associated with proposed uses of aspartame is addressed. In brief, the following conclusions can be drawn: When aspartame is consumed at levels within the ADI-limit of 40 mg/kg body wt, there is no significant risk for an aspartate-induced neurotoxic effect in the brain. When aspartame is consumed at levels within the ADI-limit by normal subjects or persons heterozygous for phenylketonuria (PKU) the resultant plasma phenylalanine concentrations are practically always within the normal post-prandial range; elevation to plasma concentrations commonly associated with adverse effects has not been observed. Persons suffering from phenylketonuria (PKU-homozygotes) on a phenylalanine-restricted diet should avoid consumption of aspartame. PKU-homozygotes on the (less strict) phenylalanine-liberalised diet should be made aware of the phenylalanine content of aspartame. In the available behavioural studies in humans with acute dosing, no adverse effects were observed. Long-term studies on behaviour and cognitive function in (sensitive) humans are lacking. Analyses of adverse reaction reports made by consumers in the U.S.A. have not yielded a specific constellation of symptoms clearly related to aspartame that would suggest a widespread public health hazard associated with aspartame use. Focussed clinical studies are now being carried out in the U.S.A.; the results should provide additional evidence concerning the interpretation of the reports on adverse reactions ascribed to aspartame. In the regulation of admitted uses for aspartame the possibility of intake levels exceeding the ADI-limit in some groups of consumers should be a point of attention. ¬© 1988.},

abstract={Epidemiologic evidence increasingly implicates psychosocial variables in the development of coronary heart disease in human beings, an association that appears to be independent of the effects of other coronary disease risk factors. It has been hypothesized that behavioral influences on coronary heart disease are mediated by activation of the sympathetic nervous system, perhaps through exacerbation of coronary artery atherosclerosis. This article summarizes several studies of the effects of stress and sympathetic arousal on atherosclerosis in a nonhuman primate model of atherogenesis. The application of a behavioral stressor involving periodic reorganization of social group memberships resulted in worsened coronary atherosclerosis among male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) fed a cholesterol-containing diet, relative to control animals housed in groups of fixed (stable) membership, but only among those monkeys that retained dominant social status during the course of the study. This effect could not be attributed to concomitant variability in blood pressure or serum lipid concentrations. When the same experimental procedures were applied to males fed a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, the manipulation of group memberships similarly led to development of greater atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries. In related observations, monkeys that exhibited the largest heart rate responses to a standardized behavioral challenge had more extensive coronary atherosclerosis than animals showing a less pronounced cardiac responsivity to stress. In a final investigation, we observed that the exacerbated atherosclerosis of dominant monkeys consuming an atherogenic diet and housed in unstable social groups could be prevented by long-term administration of a Œ≤-adrenoreceptor-blocking agent, propranolol hydrochloride. ¬© 1988.},

abstract={Rats shifted from 32% to 4% sucrose consume less 4% sucrose than animals that experience only the 4% solution. Previous experiments have suggested that a stress/emotional factor may be causally related to this negative contrast effect on the second postshift day, but not on the first postshift day. The present experiment was concerned with the possibility that contrast on the first postshift day is related to a neophobic response to the postshift solution. Results showed that giving animals experience with variously flavored (seven different flavors) 32% sucrose during the preshift period reduced degree of contrast when the animals were shifted to 4% sucrose. These data are considered in terms of solution novelty, specific loss of "sweetness", and caloric loss as contributors to negative contrast.},

abstract={We studied the involvement of altered noradrenergic function in the behavioral consequences of fetal ethanol exposure. Pregnant rats were fed a liquid diet containing 35% Ethanol-Derived Calories (EDC), pair-fed a 0% EDC diet with sucrose substituted isocalorically for ethanol, or fed ad lib lab chow. In Experiment 1, offspring from these prenatal treatment groups were injected with the alpha-adrenergic agonist clonidine (0.5 or 2.0 mg/kg) at 10 or 42 days of age and showed age-characteristic, dose-dependent increases in locomotor activity, exploration, forelimb treading, and catalepsy. In Experiment 2, offspring were injected with clonidine (0.25 or 1.0 mg/kg) at 10, 14, or 18 days of age, and locomotor activity and wall-climbing were observed in a warm chamber (33¬∞C). Catalepsy and rectal temperature were also scored. There were no significant differential effects of clonidine on any prenatal treatment group at any age for any measure of activity or rectal temperature. The results do not support the hypothesis that fetal ethanol exposure alters noradrenergic systems in behaviorally significant ways. ¬© 1989.},

abstract={This study examined the extent to which the responses of single cells in the striate cortex (V1) and the extrastriate cortex (V4) of the alert rhesus monkey are modulated by visual stimuli whose relevance in a behavioral task is varied. The animal had to detect the repetition of a visual pattern (i.e. detect similarity), preceded by a randomized number of alternations between two different patterns. The responses produced by the last, reward contingent stimulus were compared with responses obtained to that same stimulus earlier in the sequence. Modulatory effects in V1 were moderate: 31% of the cells (63 of 200) showed response increments of 20% or more to the last, reward contingent stimulus. In V4 the effects were much more pronounced: 72% of the cells (110 of 154) showed modulatory effects of more than 20%. In V4 but not in V1 orientation tuning curves showed a significant narrowing as well as a peak response increment to the behaviorally salient stimulus, suggesting a feature specific mechanism associated with the detection of similarity. Although a response decrement was observed in many cells during the repeated alternations, this effect was significantly smaller than the modulation produced by the detection of similarity. Controls included the presentation of novel stimuli during the presentation sequence which did not produce an enhanced response. It is hypothesized that the feature specific effects reported here are produced by higher order feedback systems. ¬© 1988 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={This paper describes and discusses events observed in the Madrid colony of hamadryas and hybrid baboons, when a novel group of 3 adult males, 3 adult females and 1 unweaned infant was introduced to the resident colony comprising 12 adult females, 11 juveniles and 6 unweaned infants. Novel males took over resident adult females in any reproductive condition, and all acyclic females (i.e. Lactating, pregnant and immature) exhibited a dramatic enhancement of sexual activity. Lactating females shortened their postpartum amenorrhoea periods and resumed oestrous cycles around day 14 following the introduction of the novel males, without infanticide occurring. Their return to breeding condition was not affected by the age of their current infant or the day they were taken over by the males. A female in an early stage of pregnancy aborted spontaneously and resumed oestrus on day 26. The other pregnant female significantly shortened her gestation time, delivered a viable infant on day 13, and resumed breeding activity 39 days post-partum (on day 52), while suckling her infant. A cycling female adopted and suckled a 74-day-old infant, continued showing oestrous cycles and conceived. Immature females reached menarche significantly earlier than expected and only then joined one of the newly established harem units. It is argued that the observed enhancement of sexual activity was not imposed by the males‚Äô aggressive behaviour but rather was a spontaneous female response to male novelty. This single causal factor was potent enough to override the role that nutrition and lactation normally play in the control of the females‚Äô reproductive activity. Differences in latency until the appearance of the response were probably due to the different constraints imposed by the female‚Äôs current reproductive state. It was also hypothesized that when (a) sexual swellings are attractive to males, (b) novel males are especially active in the process of bonding with new females, and (c) males are important sources of coalitionary support, females might by developing sexual swellings compete more successfully against other females and attain a higher position in the female hierarchy of the newly established unit. This would have the ultimate effect of increasing their potential reproductive success. In several cases females did gain socially by coming into oestrus, but attained no immediate reproductive advantage. ¬© 1988 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract={Constructs a model of territoriality relating the probability of starvation in a nonstationary, variable environment to the costs and benefits of feeding, defense, and exploration and their variances. The model suggests that survival in a territory increases with increasing food abundance and with decreasing defense and exploration costs. Territoriality, a risk-averse behavior, is favored when animal's net expected energy balance is positive. When the expected energy balance is negative, risk-prone behavior, abandoning the territory to become a marginal or floater, is appropriate. The model allows discussion of the impact of habitat diversity on the density of territorial animals and on the control of pest populations. By stabilizing the variance of herbivore abundance, greater crop diversity should increase both survival and packing of the herbivore's territorial predators. This should maximize herbivore consumption by territorial predators (spiders) and thus increase their contribution to the control of the phytophage population in agroecosystems. -from Authors},

abstract={The predator functional response to several prey types and densities may be conceptualized as a multi-dimensional version of the one-dimensional Holling functional-response curves; however, this empirical approach requires inordinate amounts of data to develop and test. A simulation method of modelling this functional response is to consider the behavior of a predator faced with the choice of several prey types. In this model, when all prey are available the predator‚Äôs selection will depend on the absolute abundance of the most-preferred prey type, irrespective of the abundances of the less-preferred prey types. Consequently, the predator will consume only the most-preferred prey types while that type is available in sufficient numbers. When abundance of the most-preferred type declines below a certain level, the predator will begin to include in its diet the second-most-preferred prey type along with the most-preferred prey type. This order-of-preference technique holds up well when the model is compared to population data from Oligonychus pratensis (Acarina: Tetranychidae)/Neoseiulus fallacis (Acarina: Phytoseiidae), and is consistent with optimal foraging theory. Implementation is simple, and the data requirements are reduced to determining the predator‚Äôs order of preference and normalizing the nutritional values of the prey types to a single type. ¬© 1988, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

abstract={The preschool years are a remarkable period of dramatic growth in the areas of physical, affective, and cognitive development. Physical development is characterized by a slow but steady rate of somatic growth and the mastery of motor skills that facilitate the child's achievement of autonomy and independence. Major themes in affective development include the achievement of autonomy and independence from family, a lessening of attachment to parents and the alleviation of separation anxiety, and the acquisition of impulse control and socialization skills. Cognitive development during the so-called preoperational period is best characterized by the mastery of language. The remarkable developmental gains achieved during this dynamic period culminate in a child who can function independently and competently and begin the major occupation of childhood-attending school. Health maintenance issues during the preschool years directly reflect the child's developmental stage. For example, nutritional issues reflect not only physical growth and motor skills, but also negativism and the child's struggle to achieve autonomy. Similarly, safety and injury prevention relate to the "motor-minded" behavior so characteristic of children at this age, as well as the illogical, egocentric thought that predominates during this period of cognitive development. Examples of other stage-related issues addressed during health maintenance visits include discipline and behavior problems, sleep problems and night awakening, and toilet training. The unique aspects of development during the preschool years also have implications for other components of child health maintenance, including developmental screening, procedures and immunizations, and physical assessment. A number of clinical issues are of special significance during the preschool years. For example, the most common causes of children's short stature, constitutional delay in growth and familial short stature, may result in major parental concerns at this time. Recurrent otitis media is an important problem during this period of language acquisition. Among preschool children with urinary tract infections, the risk of an underlying structural anomaly of the urinary tract and the danger of irreversible renal damage is greater than for older children. Although chronic nonspecific diarrhea of childhood is mainly a problem for infants and toddlers, such diarrhea may persist during the early preschool years. Examples of behavioral and developmental issues of particular significance include language impairment, depression, hyperactivity, and such social stressors as the death of a loved one and parental separation or divorce. The early identification of children who are not ready to begin the formal task of classroom learning has been increasingly emphasized by educators, psychologists, parents, and pediatricians. Reasons for this emphasis on early identification include the critical influence of the early childhood years on later competence, the policy of determining school entry by chronological age rather than developmental status, and legislative factors such as P.L. 94-142. The pediatrician, as the professional concerned with monitoring children's growth and development, is uniquely suited to participate in the identification of children unready for school. Effective participation requires recognition of the various factors influencing school readiness, including general health, developmental competencies, temperament and behavior, and social and environmental issues. Possible pediatric roles include screening children for school readiness and clinical problem-solving when issues or concerns arise. ¬© 1988.},

abstract={For at least the last 200 years it has been suspected that somatic manifestations of psychological distress play a role in the medical recognition and treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). The cardiovascular system is intricately linked to the experience of emotion, and these links may explain how and when neuroticism can cloud the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. A possible source of anginal symptoms in the absence of angiographically documented CAD is high standing on the personality dimension of neuroticism, which is a broad dimension of individual differences in the tendency to experience negative, distressing emotions and to possess associated behavioral and cognitive traits. A brief review of the clinical cardiologic literature on chest pain is presented, with special attention to distinguishing true angina pectoris from pseudoangina and related syndromes. After a brief description of the major dimensions of normal personality, especially the domain of neuroticism, empirical evidence is reviewed on 1,191 adult men and women who 10 years earlier had made chest pain or discomfort reports part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The findings illustrate neuroticism's links to illness and disease. When the mean initial neuroticism levels of the chest pain groups were compared, significantly higher initial levels of neuroticism were found for those who reported any pain or discomfort. As hypothesized, logistic regression results on myocardial infarction death indicated no increased risk due to neuroticism. Neuroticism was related to increased somatic complaints, including chest pain or angina-like complaints, but was not causally or etiologically related to objective signs or pathophysiologic evidence of disease, especially CAD. Implications of assessing patients' neuroticism for diagnosis of their chest pain are examined. ¬© 1987.},

abstract={The prevention of ischemic heart disease requires intervention on the natural history of coronary artery disease (CAD). Because a variety of so-called risk factors influence that natural history, it is logical to consider modification of these risk factors as a way to prevent CAD. Although this approach is effective in both the primary and secondary prevention of CAD, this presentation will focus on behavioral intervention on multiple risk factors in the secondary prevention of CAD (i.e., after the initial cardiac event). A number of studies have suggested that lifestyle modification plays an important role in preventing CAD recurrence or death. Risk factors that require this modification of human behavior include: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, cigarette smoking, obesity, hypertension, physical activity and, although controversial, coronary prone personality. The assessment of these multiple factors can be performed in most acute care settings. The intervention on the factors requires a structured approach to the patient, taking advantage of the heightened awareness and concern at the time of a cardiac event. Often, several behaviors require modification simultaneously and other disciplines (behavioral medicine, nutrition, exercise physiology) are often useful when integrated into a single treatment plan. Involvement of the patient's social support network is essential. The effectiveness of the modification of each risk factor is assessed, as a means of recognizing behavior change as a way to prevent recurrence of the disease. ¬© 1987.},

abstract={Study of development of early forms of behaviour was carried out on intact kittens of the first month of life, who endured in 5 days age uni- and bilateral sections of the lingual nerve, and on shame-operated and undernourished animals. It was shown that bilateral deafferentation caused significant disturbance of alimentary behaviour at the stage of sucking, manifested in disturbance of natural sucking and appearance of shame sucking, i.e. rhythmic sucking movement without nipple grasping. At the one-month age, in conditions of artificial feeding, natural sucking in operated animals was restored and the shame one disappeared. Bilateral section of the lingual nerve led to acceleration of ripening of sensory and motor systems and accelerated development of homing, exploratory and playing behaviour. Possible role is discussed of sensory trigeminal nuclei neurones in organization of normal patterned sucking and at limited sensory inflow. It is suggested that elimination of sensory input developing in the norm earlier than others, changes natural terms of other channels development, what accelerates the change of early behaviour forms.},

abstract={The influences of hunger and prey size on prey selection by the stonefly Hesperoperla pacifica (Perlidae) were explored in the laboratory by observing behavioral responses toward ten prey taxa and three nonprey taxa. Patterns of behavior were consistent with most assumptions and predictions of optimal foraging theory predicting sizebased prey selection by pursuing predators. Handling time appeared to increase as an exponential function of prey mass, and prey profitability (mg/s) was highest for small and intermediate-sized prey. Fasted stoneflies consumed a wide range of prey sizes, whereas well-fed stoneflies concentrated their attacks on intermediate-sized prey. Responses of H. pacifica to nonprey taxa, however, suggest that prey recognition and selection are not based on size alone. ¬© 1987 Springer-Verlag.},

The hypothyroid rats also pressed less when heat wasthe reinforcer. On the other hand, hyperthyroidal rats produced by thyroid powder ingestion showed reduced emotionality in the open field. Acute exposure to cold failed to increase their alimentary or heat reinforced behavior. The results suggest that hypothyroidism produces a general inattention to the environment.

abstract={We describe a novel procedure for measuring instrumental sexual behavior in the male rat by using a second-order schedule of presentation of sexual reinforcement, an estrous female. Experimental assessment and validation of the paradigm have been achieved by examining (a) the importance of the conditioned stimulus in maintaining instrumental responding by measuring the effects of its omission during a test session, (b) the effects and motivational specificity on instrumental behavior of the postejaculatory refractory period (a period of sexual unarousability) and of satiety for food by measuring the impact of each manipulation on animals working for food and for a female, (c) the effects of replacing an estrous female with an anestrous one as the earned reward, and (d) the correlations between conditioned and unconditioned measures of sexual behavior. We conclude that the second-order paradigm provides a means of distinguishing between the effects of neuroendocrine manipulations on incentive motivational and performance variables underlying the expression of sexual behavior.},

abstract={Four groups of rat pups were reared: mother-reared control (well-fed) and undernourished (MRC, MRU) and artificially-reared control and undernourished (ARC, ARU). AR rats were fed expressed rats' milk (days 5-7), mixtures of rats' milk and milk substitute (days 8-16), and milk substitute only (days 17-20) by intermittent infusion via a gastric cannula. Undernutrition, imposed from 5-25 days, was effected initially by underfeeding the mother (MRU) or by infusing restricted quantities of milk (ARU). Weaning was at 21 days and undernutrition from 21-25 days was by restricting the supply of solid food. All rats were fed ad lib from 25 days. From 18 weeks, male rats were subjected to 3 behavioural tests: open field, social behaviour (encounters between rats of like treatment group) and bar-pressing for food (CRF, FR5, VI 1‚Ä≤, VI 2‚Ä≤ and Extinction). Previously undernourished rats responded at higher rates on FR5, received fewer rewards on VI 2‚Ä≤ and displayed more aggression during social interaction. These findings may reflect direct effects of nutrition on brain growth. In the open field and social situations ARU were generally less active than ARC animals, whereas MRU and MRC rats differed little. These results are discussed in terms of MRU pups being maternally "buffered" against the worst effects of undernutrition and ARC rats displaying characteristics of "early stimulated" animals. ¬© 1987.},

abstract={Many studies have suggested that following the experience of 'stressful' life events the risks of myocardial infarction, accidents and perhaps other diseases are elevated. In the OPCS Longitudinal Study routinely collected data on deaths, and deaths of a spouse occuring in a 1% sample of the population of England and Wales in the period 1971-1981 are linked together, and with 1971 census records of sample members. The timing and patterns of death following the potentially very stressful event of conjugal bereavement may thus be analysed. Overall the mortality (from ischaemic heart disease) was less than 10% in excess of that in all members of the LS sample. As in many earlier studies, some increases in death rates shortly after widowhood are observed. Unusually, for deaths from all causes these increases are more marked in widows than in widowers with, for example, a two-fold increase in mortality from all causes in the first month after widowhood. However, no peak of post-bereavement mortality from ischaemic heart disease is clearly established in either sex. Although the study is large, with a well-chosen control group, only a limited characterisation of study members from data collected in the census is possible. In particular, no measures of personality, behaviour or diet are available. Investigation of potential effects of social or familial support, as measured by household structure and numbers of children, led to equivocal results. Several possible explanations for the increased mortality rates are examined. Hypotheses based on common marital environment, homogamy or simultaneous accidental death are seen to be of very limited value. The observed patterns, although consistent with an early effect of a stressful life event, do not suggest that stress following bereavement leads to an excess of ischaemic heart disease mortality. ¬© 1987.},

abstract={Over the past 10 years behavioral approaches to the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD) have become widely recognized as being a significant complement to traditional medical and surgical therapies. The success of approaches to secondary prevention now relate to quality, as well as quantity, of life. A multifaceted program, including dietary management, smoking cessation, physical exercise, modification of type A behavior, and psychological counseling are components of many cardiac rehabilitation programs. Behavioral interventions are effective in reducing traditional risk factors for CHD events, and for improving the quality of life among victims of a disease with significant psychological, as well as physical, consequences. However, the effectiveness of behavioral interventions for prolonging life is less certain and requires more careful evaluation. The mechanisms by which behavioral treatments may influence clinical CHD end points is also in need of further investigation.},

abstract={This is a review of short‚Äê and long‚Äêterm consequences of low birth weight (LBW) and of some of its determinants. The results of observational studies and of nutritional experiments aimed at clarifying the relationship between maternal nutrition and birth weight are reviewed. Areas for future research are noted. LBW is a major public health problem in developing countries. LBW is strongly associated with infant, and especially neonatal, mortality, and there is some indication that it is also related to preschool mortality rates (1‚Äì4 years). Long‚Äêterm measures of physical growth, immune response, and mental development are all adversely affected by LBW. The duration and magnitude of these effects appear to be a function of the type and severity of the weight deficit at birth. Determinants of LBW in developing countries include maternal nutritional status before and during pregnancy, maternal diet, and perhaps exposure to smoke and infection rates during pregnancy. Studies from around the world have demonstrated that dietary intervention during pregnancy is almost always associated with increased birth weights. It is now known that nutritional supplementation interacts with maternal nutritional status; newborns of well‚Äênourished women benefit little, if any, from dietary supplementation of their mothers during pregnancy, whereas newborns of poorly nourished women (thinnest and shortest) show substantial improvements in birth weight. However, when best to begin dietary supplementation during pregnancy remains an unresolved issue. Many areas are deserving of further research. Long‚Äêterm studies of the significance of birth weight, particularly in poor countries, are needed. Experiences with dietary interventions during pregnancy in areas where mean birth weights are very low (i.e., at or below 2,800 g) need to be documented. Advances need to be made in the design of locally appropriate dietary interventions for pregnant women and of risk scales capable of identifying those women who are more likely to benefit from these programs. The influence of a number of factors on birth weight needs to be clarified: intrauterine infection, maternal physical activity, lactation during pregnancy, exposure to cooking smoke, and adolescent pregnancy. Finally, the impact of nonnutritional interventions on birth weight needs to be assessed. These include, for example, family planning, medical care, health and nutrition education, and socioeconomic development programs. Copyright ¬© 1987 Wiley‚ÄêLiss, Inc., A Wiley Company},

abstract={Success in sports, as measured by competitive performance, is dependent upon a number of significant mental and physical components. Somatotype, motor skills, age, nutritional status, physiology, psychology, training level, genetic endowment, and injury risk are the major independent variables influencing performance. Unfortunately, the data available in this area of sports medicine are not always reliable or allow interstudy comparisons. This article reviews the historical and current information used to predict human performance in sports at the childhood and adolescent level. Although mesomorphy, and to a lesser extent ectomorphy, are positively associated with enhanced performance, successful athletes tend to have or acquire somatotypes characteristic of individuals already successful in a particular sport. For the most part, motor skills are age (chronological) and gender dependent. In general, the efficiency of movement progressively improves throughout childhood and into early adolescence and is highly dependent on environmental influences. A lower anaerobic and aerobic capacity reduces performance in the child and adolescent. Nonetheless, regular training can favourably improve motor skills and physiological fitness parameters. The relationship between endurance performance and aerobic capacity, however, is not strong at any age during childhood. Performance levels are reduced if nutrition is inadequate. A number of mental factors s uch as aggression, spirit, and self-confidence are also related to sports performance, although their correlation is unclear at present. Performance is influenced by the effect of genetic factors on specific traits in 30 to 85% of cases. Risk factors that negatively impact on performance levels include a history of previous injury, excessive training schedules, decreased fitness endurance, joint looseness or tightness, and certain personality traits. It is suggested that sport performance may be optimised by the early identification of individuals with positive genetic and somatotypic markers and negative risk factors. Motor skill development and physiological parameters can then be maximised by using regular, non-excessive training protocols, sound nutrition patterns, a safe environment and protective gear. Further investigations in this important area of sports medicine are essential in order to more fully characterise those criteria essential for successful sports participation. In particular, such studies should be purely longitudinal and should control for multiple confounding factors operating at different times. ¬© 1987, ADIS Press Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The present experiments explored the relation between a mode of behavior produced by unpredicted presentations of an unconditioned stimulus (US) and subsequent interference with responding to a conditioned stimulus (CS) (the context-blocking effect). The US was food, the CS was a moving ball bearing, and the subjects were rats. The typical response to a moving bearing that predicts food is predatory interaction, and the behaviors that developed under unpredicted US presentations involved focused search and waiting oriented to the food tray. Experiment 1 manipulated the number of unpredicted food presentations and showed that the reduction in subsequent bearing contacts was more clearly related to the occurrence of initial food-tray behavior than to the number of prior food presentations. Experiments 2 and 3 manipulated the conditioning of food-tray behavior while holding constant the number of prior food presentations, and again showed a strong inverse relationship between initial food-tray behavior and ball-bearing contact. The latter experiments also indicated that the locus of interference with bearing-directed behavior was neither primarily central (associative or attentional) nor peripheral (motor interference), but resulted from the incompatibility of two modes of food-getting behavior, a more general predatory search mode versus a mode of focal search and waiting. A behavior-system account of these results does not preclude an associative basis for context-blocking effects, but it argues that such effects may occur at several levels and must function within appetitive structures underlying the animal's food-getting behavior. ¬© 1986 Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

abstract={In New York State, today and every day, 180 teenagers become pregnant. However, pregnancy in adolescents is not just a technical or demographic issue. It has cultural and practical dimensions. Nationally, unmarried black teenagers are five times more likely to give birth than white teenagers. In other words, one in every five non-white babies has a teenager for a mother! This has long-term societal consequences incalculable dimensions; and black leaders are increasingly concerned. It is recognized that sex-role socialization is an important component of personality development. Yet, few researchers have examined the unique situation of black girls in a society which denigrates both the female and the black role. As pluralistic as our society may be, and no matter how relevant cultural and subcultural values may be, it is an incontrovertible fact that, by exceedingly early child-bearing, poor teenagers who are black immeasurably increase their inherent disadvantages to pursue education and acquire marketable skills, not to mention attractive jobs. On the other hand, more women in upper socio-economic categories are characteristically delaying, childbearing, and even marriage, into their thirties. The immediate and long-range consequences of unplanned teenage pregnancies are many. These include poverty, stress, suboptimal environment, nutritional inadequacy, and frequently, late or no prenatal care. Negative outcomes include low birthweight, prematurity, child abuse and development disability. There are, in addition, many delayed effects. Therefore, physicians and other health professionals must ensure that wanted pregnancies yield a healthy child. Young women and young men must be convinced that early childbearing will foreclose chances of a better socio-economic future for themselves and their progeny. Finally, Governor Mario Cuomo's Teen Pregnancy Initiative envisions the availability and promotion of alternatives to childbearing, which all too frequently is the only and fastest way to adulthood for poor youngsters. Long-range commitment of the more fortunate members of respective communities, whose obligation it is to stand as achievable role models, such as physicians, other health professionals, and representatives of churches and helping organizations, must work together to fulfill the essentials of the Initiative to bring adolescents to mature and fulfilling adulthood. ¬© 1986 Human Sciences Press.},

abstract={Defensive aggregation by Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis has been invoked as the fulcrum for the transformation of macroalgal beds into coralline barrens in the northwest Atlantic. We critically examined some of the mechanisms contributing to aggregation behavior by experimentally manipulating sea urchins, purported predators and food during autumn 1983 and spring 1984 both in the laboratory and field. We utilized several approaches to examine a range of sea urchin responses to the presence of food, tethered predators, caged predators, crushed con-specifics in the field and predators in laboratory tanks. Some of the field cages had the property of allowing free passage to sea urchins while retaining lobsters; this allowed distinctions to be made between artifacts caused by cage walls or topographic barriers and unrestricted behavioral responses of sea urchins. The results falsified the hypothesis that aggregations of S. droebachiensis are elicited by predators. Except in the presence of algae, sea urchins always avoided decapod predators (but not sea stars) and fled from the vicinity of injured conspecifics. However, avoidance behavior was subordinate to feeding responses, demonstrated by mass migrations of sea urchins into cages (with lobsters) to feed on algae. We reaffirmed by observation and manipulation previous studies which showed that sea urchins aggregate only in the presence of food. Two types of sea urchin groupings were delineated: (1) surficial two dimensional associations, often caused by topographic or other features which inhibited dispersal and (2) cohesive three-dimensional aggregations induced by food. ¬© 1986 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Social behaviour and reproductive performance in a herd of semi-wild Scottish Highland cattle were assessed over a period of 4 years. Dominance relationships were very firm. Being predictable to each other, the animals had little reason for overt aggressive conflicts and they settled the majority of disputes by agonistic activities that involved no physical contact between opponents (threatening and spontaneous withdrawing) and hence no risk of injury. Social standing depended on age and sex, with older animals generally being dominant to young ones and males dominant to females. Young bulls overruled adult cows when they reached about 2 years of age. All four offspring of the top-ranking cow had outstandingly high rank positions despite the fact that their mother never intervened when they were involved in disputes. Dominance-associated aggressiveness (number of aggressive acts directed against individual subordinate partners) did not correlate with rank position, but was closely related to rank distance. Aggressiveness showed no sex difference. Mock fighting was a friendly contact behaviour shown by both sexes and all ageclasses. Participants did not try to defeat each other. The playful intention was underscored by the fact that invitations were made by the subordinate partner as often as by the dominant partner of a pair. Licking was a social service primarily performed by subordinates and received by dominant animals. Mounting was a playful behaviour shown by calves of both sexes and by bulls but not by cows. The activity was not used as a dominance demonstration, as has been reported in sheep, goats and muskox. Calves sometimes mounted their mothers to attract their attention. Heifers first gave birth at 2 or 3 years of age. Breeding was synchronized in May and June and calving coincided with the spring flush of grass, indicating a correlation between food quality and timing of pregnancy. The herd's average calving interval was 391 days, and calving mortality within the first year of life was 5%. It was concluded that the low aggressive tension resulting from the firm hierachy may have been one reason why reproductive performance was so good, despite the fact that no veterinary care was provided. ¬© 1986.},

abstract={It has been suggested that baboon predation upon vertebrates may tend to peak in the dry season because insect food is then less available, and that males obtain animal nutrients primarily from vertebrates whereas other troop members obtain them primarily from invertebrates. The development of meat and insect eating by 22 male and 24 female infants studied for 25 months was compared with that of 18 male and 46 female adults studied for 37 months. Systematic sampling allowed quantitative comparisons between meat and insect eating, infants and adults, and males and females. Infants ate no meat, but their insect eating began early and increased steadily during the first year of life. In comparison with insect foods, meat was a minor ingredient of the adult's diet. Insect eating occurred less during dry than during rainy months, but meat eating was spread across the year. Reliable sex differences in insect eating did not occur. The findings were related to theories offered to explain the attractiveness of animal foods to primates and to the suggestion that a sex difference in predatory inclinations of hominid ancestors may have been a preadaptation underlying the eventual emergence of male hunting and female gathering.

abstract={Investigated size-selective predation upon Daphnia pulex and D. magna by Gambusia affinis. Gambusia actively chose to attack small prey (shown to be more profitable). Gambusia's preference increased monotonically, or decreased, or peaked at an intermediate prey size, depending upon fish size, prey size, and fish satiation level. Results contrast with the hypothesis that 'gape-limited predators' select the largest prey available, and 'size-limited predators' select small or intermediate-sized prey. Optimal diet theory predicts that a predator should drop less profitable prey items from the diet at higher prey densities. Gambusia maintained a mixed diet and its preferences did not change in response to changes in either the absolute or the relative abundance of prey. Gambusia did sharply alter its size-selective feeding behavior in response to its own satiation level: this factor is probably correlated with prey density in the field. -from Authors},

abstract={Bulimia is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating and severe self-deprecation, often accompanied by self-induced vomiting and/or laxative abuse. It is most often found among young women in their late teens to mid-30s. Estimates of the disorder's prevalence vary widely, depending on the diagnostic criteria used, but usually range from 5% to 20% of college age women. Binge eating typically begins in late adolescence, frequently after a period of dieting to lose weight. Self-induced vomiting usually follows the onset of binge eating by about a year. To date, theories of the disorder's etiology have included several biological models, a psychosocial model, and a biopsychosocial model. The biological methods proposed have viewed bulimia as a form of biological depression, neurological disturbance, or metabolic disturbance. The psychosocial model suggests that society's pressure on young women for extreme thinness leads to excessive dietary restraint, deprivation, and, paradoxically, binge eating. The presence of anxiety or depression exacerbates the process. The biopsychosocial model appears to be the most promising. It proposes that young women with biological predispositions toward over-weight, depression, or metabolic disturbance are particularly vulnerable to social pressure for thinness, the binge eating that may result from excessive dieting, and, hence, bulimia. The complex nature of bulimia suggests that a multidisciplinary team approach treatment is appropriate.},

abstract={The most important risk factors that may predict the transition from borderline to established hypertension are revised, focusing on those pathological changes that have been investigated for their value as predictors of established hypertension. A patient commonly is diagnosed as a borderline hypertensive if several pressure values are somewhere above as well as below 140/90 mm Hg. Patients in this category generally are regarded as hypertensive when they are younger than age 40. Studies largely favor the hypothesis of polygenic inheritance of essential hypertension, yet the detailed nature of heredity continues to be disputed. Several biochemical markers reflect the hereditary etiology of established hypertension, e.g., a variation in the electrophoretic pattern of plasma proteins, urinary concentration of kallikrein, and an alteration of cell membrane transport of cations. In Western populations, arterial pressure increases throughout life. About 40% of the white population and over 50% of the black population over age 65 have hypertension (blood pressure of 160/95 mm Hg or greater) or isolated systolic hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mm Hg). Essential hypertension is more prevalent and vascular disease more severe in blacks than in whites. There is a well-documented association between obesity and hypertension; obesity increases the prevalence of hypertension 3 to 8 times. Numerous studies have been published about the relationship between arterial hypertension and excessive dietary salt intake, but the results continue to be controversial. In a cross-cultural analysis, a strong relationship was observed between salt intake and the prevalence of hypertension. Also noted was the modifying impact of sodium intake on the increasing prevalence of hypertension with age. Premenopausal women have a lower prevalence of essential hypertension and its risk factors than men of the same age because of the influence of estrogen, but if these women take oral contraceptives, arterial pressure increases and transient hypertension, often severe or even malignant, can be induced. Some behavioral patterns and personality traits appear to be associated with borderline hypertension, but evidence that these factors determine the transition from borderline to established hypertension in later life has not been demonstrated thus far. Measurements of resting heart rate and responses to dynamic exercise have some predictive value in predicting the development of hypertension. Ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure might allow for differentiation of patients with transient elevated blood pressure from those with more sustained hypertension.},

abstract={There is considerable evidence that the goal of health care has moved beyond mere survival to positive health. The surgeon general's report emphasized the necessity to modify social environments by reducing risk-taking behaviors and life-styles. The increased attention the American people now pay to exercise, nutrition, environmental health, and occupational safety reveals the interest and concern with health promotion and disease prevention (Public Health Service, 1979). Naisbitt noted the increasing growth of wellness and fitness centers across our country and he projected that health care, nutrition, and fitness will be among the prime economic growth areas in the future (Naisbitt, 1982). Central to the concept of optimal functioning is the existence of a positive state of health in the whole person. This humanistic approach to health care in the United States, as called for in the surgeon general's report, is evidenced by a new self-help paradigm and changes in personal habits to achieve this state of wellness. Gilfoyle spoke of creative partnerships in her inaugural address (1986). We can use this concept to encourage occupational therapists to become more involved in creative partnerships with other health professionals and the public to achieve the goal of a healthy society. There is now a unique opportunity for occupational therapists to be among those determining significant changes in the outlook on health care. Health, considered in terms of individual and societal fulfillment and accompanied by feelings of purpose and worth, has long been the goal of occupational therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract={Contributors to CHD include atherogenic personal attributes, living habits which promote these, signs of preclinical disease, and host susceptibility to these influences. Atherogenic traits include the blood lipids, blood pressure, and glucose tolerance. High LDL cholesterol is positively and high HDL cholesterol inversely related to CHD incidence. Hypertension, whether systolic or diastolic, labile or fixed, casual or basal, at any age in either sex contributes powerfully to coronary heart disease. The impact of diabetes on CHD is greater for women than for men and varies according to the level of the foregoing risk factors. The faulty life-style is typified by a diet excessive in calories, fat, and salt, a sedentary habit, unrestrained weight gain, and cigarettes. Alcohol used in moderation may be beneficial. Oral contraceptives worsen atherogenic traits and, when used for long periods beyond age 35 in conjuction with cigarettes, predispose to throm boembolism. Type A persons with an overdeveloped sense of time urgency, drive, and competitiveness develop an excess of angina pectoris. Men married to more highly educated women are at increased risk, as are men married to women in white-collar jobs. Preclinical signs of a compromised coronary circulation include silent MI, ECG-LVH, blocked intraventricular conduction, and repolarization abnormalities. Exercise ECG may elicit still earlier evidence. Measures of innate susceptibility include a family history of premature cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, and gout. Optimal prediction of CHD requires a quantitative combination of risk factors in multiple logistic risk formulations that identify high-risk persons with multiple marginal abnormalities. Preventive management should also be multifactorial. Although the efficacy of some of the proposed preventive measures requires further validation, they are rational and worthy of consideration by prevention-minded physicians. However, greater skill is required in behavior modification to effect the needed changes in life-style. ¬© 1986.},

The results indicated that a) smoking was a major factor in gastric ulcers, and b) existence of ulcers in first or second degree relatives and eating at irregular intervals were two major factors for duodenal ulcers. Psychosocial factors such as frustration at work and in the family were not significantly associated with either gastric or duodenal ulcers.

abstract={Behavioral toxic effects caused by a relatively small dose of the 'peripheral' neurotoxin, p-bromophenylacetylurea (BPAU), and of its vehicle, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were investigated. BPAU induces, in rats, a central-peripheral distal axonopathy similar to that produced in humans by toxic organophosphorus-containing compounds, and has been proposed as a model to study this type of toxicity in a convenient experimental mammal. Rats were injected with BPAU (50 or 100 mg/kg) in DMSO (1 ml/kg), with DMSO alone, or with saline. 100 mg BPAU/kg produced permanent weight loss and hind limb paresis; the low dose did not. Behavioral testing, 2 days to 4 mo post-treatment, indicated that DMSO and/or 50 mg/kg of BPAU retarded habituation of spontaneous exploratory activity, impaired acquisition of conditioned (autoshaped) behavior, and changed the dose-response relationship for d-amphetamine-induced suppression of operant (fixed ratio 32) responding. BPAU-treated animals were also impaired in initial performance of operant behavior maintained by a fixed ratio schedule of reinforcement, at high (‚â• FR 16) ratio values. Thus, neurobehavioral toxicity may occur at doses too low to induce organophosphorus-type sensorimotor impairment or pathology. Further, DMSO may also exert effects on neurobehavioral function, suggesting it too may be potentially toxic within this domain.},

Adult females were selected which differed in parity and reproductive risk. The 29 dyads were housed individually to reduce external environmental influences. Large variation was observed in maternal and neonatal behavior, but it was not significantly associated with maternal or infant risk variables and could not identify six unsuccessfully reared pairs. Among the 23 successfully reared dyads, variation in nutritional and behavioral measures hypothesized to be associated with infant growth were found to be independent of neonatal weight gain. These 23 infants were separated from their mothers after 30 days and their responses at reunion were observed. Some infants clung to the mother's ventrum (attached response) while others jumped away quickly (aloof response). Prior dyadic interactions were not significantly associated with this dichotomous response, nor were maternal and most infant variables. These results suggest that dyads at risk for neonate separation when living in captive groups are not necessarily at risk in individual housing conditions. Further, pig-tailed neonates appear unaffected by variations in mother-infant interactions that do not result in separation, but neonatal characteristics may show continuity across development. ¬© 1985 Japan Monkey Centre.},

abstract={An apparatus for measuring locomotor activity (LA) of rats is described and demonstrated. Conventional cages were modified to tilt in response to animal LA. Cage movements were detected by a piezoelectric crystal transducer, and the amplified signals outputted to electronic digital counters. The activity cages were utilized to investigate the effects of several dietary levels of vitamin B-6 (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 6.0 mg pyridoxine-HCl/kg diet) and two different temperature conditions (23¬∞ and 27¬∞) on the LA of post-weanling rats. Throughout most of the 31/2 week study period, animals in the 0 and 0.5 mg groups were less active (p<0.001) than the 1.0 and 6.0 mg groups. Activity levels were also reduced (p<0.0001) at the higher temperature. These data provide an example of how nutritional and environmental conditions may affect one form of animal behavior. The relevance of behavioral measurements to nutritional studies is discussed. ¬© 1985 Pergamon Press Ltd.},

abstract={In an exploratory study in women, the relationships between scales of emotional eating, external eating, and restrained eating, and body mass index (BMI = weight/height2) were studied, as well as the interrelationships between these three eating behavior components. In addition, the relationships between the three eating behavior scales and 19 personality scales were examined. Finally, differences between obese and latent obese women with respect to eating behavior and personality were investigated. Significant relationships were found between BMI and emotional eating, and between BMI and external eating/perceived hunger, but not between BMI and Restrained Eating. Also, restrained eating was found not to be related to the other two eating behavior components. Of the three eating behavior components, emotional eating was shown to have the clearest relationships with a number of personality traits. No difference was observed between the eating behavior of latent obese and obese women, but these groups differed as to a number of personality traits.

abstract={A measure of fitness applicable to herring gull (Larus argentatus) life histories is introduced and related to short-term risks which depend on behaviour. This allows calculations of the relationship between fitness and behaviour if one can measure the risks an animal takes behaving in particular ways in specified situations. This method is used to evaluate the fitness of herring gulls during the incubation period at Walney Island, U.K. Two causes of egg mortality are considered, death by predation and death by exposure, and the latter is shown to be less important than the former. The chances of death by predation depend on the number of adults present on the territory and are estimated to be approximately 0¬∑045 eggs per h if no parents are present on territory, 3¬∑5√ó10-4 eggs per h if one parent is present and 6¬∑7√ó10-4 eggs per h if two parents are present. Adult death by starvation is assumed to occur when energy reserves are exhausted; however a fitness cost is incurred if an animal maintains excess energy reserves. To restrict the number of behaviour sequences examined to manageable proportions, attention is restricted to the behaviour sequences that result from decision rules in which feeding occurs when energy reserves fall below a set point. Then optimal behaviour is characterized by (1) energy reserves maintained between 500 and 1200 kcal; (2) complementarity of mates' feeding preferences such that at least one of the pair feeds at a refuse tip; (3) parental desertion of offspring if energy reserves fall below 200 kcal; (4) parents spending the minimum possible time together on territory. These results are shown by sensitivity analysis to be insensitive to parameter errors in the model. Treating these characteristics of optimal behaviour as predictions about actual behaviour reveals that predictions 1 and 2 are correct, and prediction 4 is wrong. An experiment was designed to test prediction 3 by estimating the fat reserves of life birds and measuring how long each would continue incubation in the absence of its mate. Fatter birds did continue incubation for longer though the quantitative detail did not match prediction 3 exactly. Thus two aspects of behaviour tally with our calculation as to what is optimal, but one does not. This conclusion is discussed. ¬© 1985.},

abstract={A review of the literature on the positive benefits of light and moderate alcohol consumption suggests the following: 1. (1) Alcoholic beverages are food, containing approx. 7 calories per gram of ethanol. Beer contains small percentages of the recommended daily allowance of vitamins and significant proportions of the recommended daily allowance of trace metals and minerals. Wine, while possessing significantly smaller amounts of vitamins and minerals than beer, has considerably more iron. Both beer and wine have a favorable potassium to sodium ratio. 2. (2) Coronary heart disease (CHD) seems to have a negative association with regular alcoholic beverage use. While some report a linear relationship, most studies agree that the relationship is U-shaped. Many studies have suggested that this inverse relationship is due to alcohol's effect of increasing levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), which acts in the removal of cholesterol from tissue. Other explanations for moderate alcohol's cardio-protective effect include: associated diet changes in moderate drinkers, the silicon content in wine and beer, decreased platelet aggregation and coagulation, and the ability to lessen stress and/or alter personality patterns associated with CHD risks. 3. (3) Dry non-sweet wines and diluted distilled spirits have been recommended in the treatment of diabetes. It has been suggested that alcohol may improve glucose tolerance and blood glucose response to ingested carbohydrates. Due to reported decreased HDL values in diabetics, alcohol has been suggested as useful for its HDL-increasing function. ¬© 1985.},

abstract={Several psychological outcomes that accompany acute and chronic exercise have medical significance. Transient reductions in somatic tension and subjective anxiety appear most reliable. Symptom abatement in moderate depression can occur with chronic exercise in a manner comparable to psychotherapy and may offer a better prognosis in some instances. Other cognitive, behavioral, and perceptual events associated with exercise may assist in managing mental health, and exercise has been successfully used as a therapeutic adjunct in a variety of psychiatric disorders. Regular exercise may also complement treatments designed to manage aspects of coronary-prone behavior and psychoendocrine responsivity to mental stress. The lack of strict experimental control or effective placebo contrasts in most exercise studies precludes a convincing argument that exercise causes the psychological outcomes observed. Rather, expectancy of benefits, generalized treatment or attention effects, social reinforcement, and past history or selection bias represent likely alternatives. These competing explanations do not discount, however, that many individuals benefit in a clinically significant way. Exercise offers a low-cost alternative or adjunct with side effects that appear largely health-related. Although the effective psychological dosage or modality has not been quantified, current physiologic guidelines of the American College of Sports Medicine (large muscle rhythmic activity, for 20 to 60 minutes, 3 to 5 days per week at 60 to 80 per cent age-adjusted maximal heart rate), or a weekly caloric cost of 2000 kcal, should be effective with little medical risk. However, no evidence confirms that an increase in metabolic or psychoendocrine tolerance to exercise is necessary or sufficient for psychological outcomes to occur. Although biologic adaptations are known to follow exercise training and subside with diminished activity, there is currently no objective evidence that habitual exercise leads to dependence. If exercise has use in managing subjective or somatic symptoms, these may return during periods of exercise abstinence. Moreover, despite popular hypotheses concerning endorphins and biogenic amines, no direct relationships have yet been shown between exercise-induced mood swings and peripheral biochemical events. A proportion of habitual runners have reported acute episodes of euphoria-like states during or following exercise, but this remains a subjective and unpredictable event that may be related to psychophyiologic relaxation or acute changes in self-esteem. No verified guidelines exist for the diagnosis and treatment of exercise abuse; it remains an indeterminant event. But in severe cases, excessive exercise behavior appears to be secondary to acute or chronic psychologic disorder. Personality and history should thus be considered to best interpret the origins of exercise motivation and the likelihood of compliance with alternative prescriptions when they are medically indicated. Furthermore, the prevalence and severity of emotional disorders among habitual exercisers do not seem to exceed those found in other athletic samples, and these are comparable to those of the general population. Athletes may, however, have a less favorable prognosis following a psychiatric episode if they have difficulty assuming a sick role. Available evidence supports that exercise can be a suitable adjunct or alternative medical prescription for several clinical disorders related to behavior, and it appears likely that future research will document the common wisdom that moderate habitual physical activity plays a central role in promoting behavioral health.},

abstract={This study identifies the pattern of mental retardation in 291 Nigerian children in Enugu. In 33.99% the etiology of mental retardation was congenital (present at birth), in 43.99% the cause was acquired and in the rest 23.02% no definite cause could be identified. The results, problems of diagnosis and management in relation to Nigeria are discussed. Massive support from the Government for improving the maternal and child welfare services as well as care for the mentally retarded children is solicited. The high % of cases due to birth trauma (23.38%) and severe neonatal jaundice (8.59%) reflects the quality of maternal and child welfare services as well as the obstetric care in the area. Full use of the available services and intensive health education in towns and villages could be most valuable. The increasing association of mental retardation with epilepsy in Nigerian children has been noted in other studies in this hospital. In the present study, epilepsy was found to cause mental retardation in 12.5% of cases in the acquired group and about 5% of the total number of cases. Malnutrition as a cause of defective mental development has been noted by several authors. However, in the present study, malnutrition could not be identified as a primary cause of mental retardation. In the congenital group, the high representation of Down's syundrome is striking. Children with this syndrome make up about 42.71% of the congenital group and 14% of the overall number of mentally retarded. The majority of mothers were over 35 and multiparous. The care of the mentally retarded child in Nigeria leaves much to be desired. Except for a few states, there are no homes or centers for the furthering of these handicapped children. Since the inception of the Pediatric Neurology Clinic in this hospital, efforts have focused on diagnosis and assessment. Some children aged 5-12 years have been referred to a privately-owned Therapeutic Day Center in Enugu for early furthering and play therapy.},

abstract={The finding that there is an effect upon measurements relevant to school performance, depending on whether or not the child had breakfast that morning, may seem trivial and like common sense to any parent who has had to remind their child not to leave for school without breakfast. Yet, it is an example of a hypothesis finally being tested. Caffeine in children and adults tends to increase vigilance. Differences in caffeine effects are seen among different personality types and among those who self-select high or low amounts of the stimulant in their diets. There is no clear behavioral toxicity from caffeine in normal children. Those self-selecting selecting high caffeine diets generally do not seem to get negative effects. Whether most other beliefs about behavioral effects of foods and nutrients are facts or myths still needs to be determined. Until adequate scientific evidence is collected, individual beliefs about sugar, hyperactivity and crime must remain only beliefs, regardless of how strongly public policy may or may not endorse them. At this time, there is no proven causal relationship. More studies with adequate design details are needed to assess behavioral toxicity as well as the benefit/risk ratio of any dietary manipulation.},

abstract={Two quantitative models of the handicap principle are presented which incorporate phenotypic plasticity, i.e. flexibility in the expression of a handicapping trait. The first model ("multiplicative model") applies to instances in which greater development of the trait improves male mating success while lowering survival. Two examples treated are antler size in deer and tail length in birds. The second model ("additive model") applies to instances in which an individual performs a display which, though potentially costly, may nevertheless deter an opponent (or predator). Stotting in gazelles and roaring among stags illustrate application of the second model. The conclusions of the models are that optimal development of the handicap will correlate positively with the "condition" (e.g. the nutritional state) of the individual. This allows a female (or predator) to benefit by choosing (or avoiding) a mate (or prey) of better condition on the basis of the size of the handicap alone. The benefit to the choosing individual is discussed. The multiplicative model appears quite robust. Most importantly, in nearly all plausible situations, the model indicates that those individuals displaying the greatest handicap will at the same time survive best, and vice versa. On the other hand, the additive model appears valid only under a narrow range of conditions; therefore caution is advised in applying this model. The models suggest conditions which favor the evolution of phenotypic plasticity and indicate why, in nature, survival and fecundity (e.g. mating success due to intrasexual or intersexual selection) are often positively correlated. ¬© 1984 Academic Press Inc.

abstract={In rats, conditioned place preferences are produced by morphine and conditioned place aversions produced by naloxone. In the present studies, several issues concerning the demonstration and interpretation of place conditioning findings were examined in a two-compartment (black and white) tilt box: (1) the responses of naive rats to testing, (2) place conditioning in rats with strong unconditioned biases to one of the sides, and (3) modifications of the testing situation so that naive rats respond to the black and white sides with a minimum of initial bias. Experiments involving manipulation of the conditions of training and testing, use of pentobarbital, and use of a three-compartment test box helped to control for morphine's ability to produce state dependent learning as an explanation of its conditioned place preference. In addition, we examined previous place conditioning studies that failed to show aversive effects of naloxone. These negative findings were suggested to be due to the use or procedures insensitive to aversive stimuli and to the IP administration of naloxone. Finally, in the course of the experiments, novel data on general parameters of the place conditioning were provided. Dose-response curves for subcutaneous (SC) morphine (0.04-5.0 mg/kg) and naloxone (0.02-5.0 mg/kg) were established. Conditioned preferences were also shown to occur after at three pairings of SC drug, and they were retained for at least 1 month. ¬© 1984 Springer-Verlag.},

Food deprivation increased feeding and responsivity to 5 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide but attenuated some sedative effects of 15 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide. Preference for familiar food was shown only by food-deprived, test-experienced rats. The time devoted to eating novel food, but not the amount eaten, was increased by chlordiazepoxide.

abstract={The causes and risk factors of acute intoxication during long-term administration of antiepileptic drugs(AED)of tolerated maintenance doses were investigated in 10 intoxication cases.In 4 of 10cases,overdose or misuse due to non-compliance and so-called epileptic personality disorder was considered to be the cause of acute intoxication. In the other 4cases,total plasma levels of phenytoin were elevated soon after fever or slight cold and lead to acute intoxication.No dysfunction of the kidney or liver nor drug interaction with salicylates were found in those cases.In some cases of phenobarbital and phenytoin intoxications,no apparent reason for the elevation of plasma levels could be found.Apart from overdose and misuse,it was stressed that the subtle alternation in body conditions such as fever or fatigue could change AED pharmacokinetics and lead to acute intoxication. Risk factors such as non-compliance,epileptic personality disorder,subclinical or subtle chronic AED intoxication,complication of neurological deficits,and polypharmacy (especially combination with barbiturates) may not only make the patients sensitive to acute intoxication,but also make intoxication serious and prolonged. It is, therefore,important to clarify the risk factors in order to predict and prevent acute intoxication. Acute AED intoxication occurring during administration of tolerated maintenance doses usually had a good prognosis and disappeared only in a few days without any treatment.However, phenobarbital intoxication,intoxication accompanied by abovementioned risk factors,and severe intoxication sometimes lasted for about a month and, therefore,it was required to reduce the causative agents when the symptoms of intoxication did not diminish in several days of observation. ¬© 1984, JAPAN EPILEPSY SOCIETY.

abstract={On the basis of Western studies suggesting that infants with difficult temperaments are at greater risk for behavioral and physical disorders, the author postulated that Masai infants with difficult temperaments would be at greater risk in the harsh environment created by the sub-Saharan drought in 1974, which disrupted the life of the Masai people of East Africa and resulted in increased infant mortality. Two groups of infants with difficult and easy temperaments were defined and followed. Contrary to expectations, mortality was greater for the infants with easy temperaments. The infant's contribution, child-rearing orientation, and feeding practices were factors influencing survival.
The hypothesis that Masai infants with temperaments which make them difficult to manage are more likely to experience malnutrition than Masai infants with temperaments which make them easy to manage was tested in a field study conducted among the Masai in Kenya during the severe drought of 1974. Studies in western countries suggested that infants who were difficult to raise, intense, inflexible, and irregular caused family stress; consequently they were more likely to experience abuse, injery, illness, and developmental problems than infants who were more docile. The field study was conducted among a group of Masai in the Kajiado District, who in 1974 still maintained their traditional nomadic way of life. Infants were generally fed on demand and children, especially male children, were highly valued. Child care responsibilities were shared by the relatives in each household and infants received considerable attention. The temperaments of 45 Masai infants aged 4-5 months were evaluated on the basis of their mothers' responses to the standardized Infant Temperament Questionnaire. The instrument was modified slightly to accomodate for cultural differences. The instrument measured 10 temperament dimension, e.g., persistence, distractibility, intensity, adaptability, and activity. On the basis of the scores obtained on the 10 dimensions, 10 of the infants were identified as easy to manage and 10 were identified as difficult to manage. These 20 infants were scheduled for follow up 2-3 months later to assess whether the more difficult to handle infants had a higher rate of malnutrition than the easier to handle infants. During the intervening months, the drought worsened. Many families were forced to migrate to distant areas and family life was severely distrupted. Only 13 of the 20 families scheduled for followup were located. Of the 13 infants followed up, 7 were previously classified as easy infants and 6 as difficult infants. Unfortunately, 7 of these 13 infants died prior to followup. 5 of the easy infants and 2 of the difficult infants were dead. The deaths appeared to be related to the severe ecological conditions which existed during the intervening months. Although the number of cases was too small to permit drawing firm conclusions, the findings suggest that, contrary to the hypothesis, in Masai society infants who are more demanding are more likely to survive during periods of severe ecological stress than infants who are more docile. Perhaps infants who are more aggressive and demanding are more likely to be fed and to have their needs met than infants who are more docile and easier to ignore. Perhaps the Masai pattern of interaction between parents and infants during periods of severe stress constitutes a mechanism for the selection of behavioral traits necessary for the survival of the Masai. Assertiveness is a highly valued trait among the Masai and probably a necessary trait for the nomadic warriors and herders.},

abstract={1. As wild vertebrates are increasingly studied in more than one area or at more than one time instraspecific variation in social systems (IVSS) is increasingly observed. Intraspecific variation has been observed in a number of social systems. Individuals within a single species may be alone or in groups. Their spacing system may be territoriality, coloniality, lekking, dominance or despotism. They may breed monogamously, polyandrously, polygynously or promiscuously. Either both parents or a single parent may care for the young. The parents may or may not have helpers. Parents may or may not pool their young and care for them communally. 2. The evidence so far suggests that most species manifest one of two alternative systems of the same general type, i.e. one of two mating systems or parental care systems. This suggests that there are constraints on their flexibility. These constraints probably include the psychological complexity of the shift from one alternative to another, the compatibility of a particular system with other aspects of the species‚Äô natural history, and the species‚Äô phylogenetic history. 3. Several ecological variables have so far been identified as correlates of alternative social systems within a species. These variables are generally those currently considered important in interspecific socioecological analysis: differences in 1) the distribution and abundance of food, 2) the level of competition for food, 3) the level and kind of predator pressure, 4) the level of population density and 5) habitat saturation. 4. Alternative social systems are usually viewed as adaptive responses to the costs and benefits of the observed social system compared to alternative social systems. In this respect, IVSS is treated as intraspecific socioecology. 5. Intraspecific socioecology differs profoundly from interspecific socioecology in the approach taken in accounting for observed social systems. Species differences are typically assumed to be caused by genetic differences resulting from distinct natural selection histories in the populations under consideration. IVSS, on the other hand, often involves facultative switching between alternatives that are clearly not traceable to genetic differences. IVSS may be produced by a number of proximate mechanisms. Nutritional state, hormone levels and particular experiences can all predispose animals to different degrees of aggressivity, which in turn may influence the form of social system that emerges from their interactions. Different experiential histories may make one animal inclined to be a member of a group, and another inclined to be solitary. A high level of one kind of social activity may preclude engaging in another. For example, a territorial male under high intruder pressure may be too busy defending space to give paternal care. 6. Progress in the description and interpretation of IVSS will enrich animal behavior as a discipline. In addition, the ability to predict, and possibly even influence, rapid changes in social systems may contribute substantially to conservation strategies. ¬© 1984, Brill. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Socioeconomic status appears to be one of the most important determinants of the ultimate level of brain function in children of low birth weight, and this is true with respect to neurologic, psychologic and educational outcome. Social class also has an indirect effect through birth weight, frequency of perinatal brain injury and other biologic variables, as well as maternal habits, the quality of nutrition and health care for mother and child, and other 'cultural' factors. To some extent it may be possible to compensate for social disadvantage by careful environmental, medical and educational assistance throughout early childhood.
The categories of low birth weigth infants, social vs. racial factors, factors increasing the risk of low birth weight, prevention of low birth weight, social factors in the development of low birth weight children, the influence of social factors vs. other variables, and implications for management are reviewed. In 1948 the World Health Assembly designated children who were born weighing 2500 g or less as "immature" and further stated that a liveborn infant with a period of gestation of less than 37 weeks or specified as "premature" may be considered as the equivalent of an immature event. In 1961 it was recommended that babies weighing 2500 g or less should no longer be referred to as being "premature" and that the concept of "prematurity" in the definition should give way to that of "low birth weight." Intrauterine growth curves for liveborn males and females were devised from data on birth weight and gestational age. Infants born prior to 37 completed weeks of gestation whose weight lies between the 10th and 90th percentiles on such curves may be called preterm with a weight appropriate for gestational age (AGA), whereas infants born after any length of gestation whose birth weight is at or below the 10th percentile may be named hypotrophic or small for gestational age (SGA). On a worldwide scale it has been estimated that about 22 million low birth weight babies, representing roughly 1/6 of all births, are born alive each day. Only about 1 million of them (mostly preterm) are born in developed countries; of the 21 million born in developing areas, roughly 16 million are SGA full-term and not preterm babies. Socioeconomic status appears as 1 of the most important dterminants of the ultimate level of brain function in children of low birth weight, and this is true with respect to neurologic, psychologic, and educational outcome. Social class also has an indirect effect through birth weight, frequency of perinatal brain injury, and other biological variables as well as maternal habits, the quality of nutrition and health care for mother and child, and other "culture factors." The following seem important facets of the management of low birth weight children: optimal obstetric and perinatal care; "bonding" by parents visiting the intensive care nursery and handling the infant; anticipatory guidance; regular pediatric follow-up for at-risk infants; infant stimulation; early correction of refractive errors, strabismus, other visual defects, hearing defects and orthopedic deformities; and developmental assessments and school readiness tests.},

The model postulates that given that ethnic, socioeconomic, and biological statuses (exogenous variables) are homogeneous, a health risk-taking behavior in a population is a function of direct, additive, and interaction effects of five categories of independent variables both internal to the persons and external in the action environment. Although the model is tested on contraceptive behavior, it is argued that the determinants and basic processes of this risk-taking behavior are similar to those involved in other health risk behaviors and that the five basic factors identified affect nutritional behaviors as well. The paper presents several broad implications on the model for nutrition education and research; but holds that specific implications could be best derived by the specialists in nutrition field.},

abstract={Fish should respond to low levels of food availability by altering their behavior to ensure higher feeding rates, larger feeding territories and broader diets. The gastric sensation of hunger and its rate of change may act as appropriate cues to food availability; hunger-motivated changes in feeding behavior can produce all of these predicted effects. Juvenile coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch alter their behavior in an adaptive manner when faced with variable degrees of threat of competition from territorial intruders, and of risk of predation. Learning is an important mechanism providing behavioral flexibility, and changes in fish feeding behavior with experience are summarized. A graphical model shows that these changes can result in training biases and food specialization. Learning also results in increased feeding rates.-from Author},

abstract={A series of experiments assessed the effects of pimozide on spontaneous alternation in a Y- and 8-arm radial maze, and on approach to food or cues that had previously been associated with food. Mice treated with pimozide (0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg) displayed a dose dependent reduction of alternation performance, without engendering a presverative tendency and apparently without affecting the course of habituation. When food deprived mice entered an arm of the maze that was baited with a food pellet they consumed the food and remained in the vicinity of the food cup. Moreover, upon retesting in the non-drug state mice still exhibited a preference for cues that had been associated with food. It seems that although pimozide at the doses tested produced a haphazard pattern of exploration, the drug did not alter the rewarding value of secondary reinforcers. Contrary to an anhedonic hypothesis, it is suggested that higher doses of pimozide may actually increase, rather than decrease, the saliency of biologically significant stimuli. ¬© 1983.},

abstract={We studied the effect of neonatal undernutrition and its attendant stresses on the behavior and thermoregulation of adult rats in the absence and presence of morphine. Undernutrition was accomplished by fostering half the pups in each litter to a nonpregnant, nonlacting female rat every other day for the first 6 days of life. As a control, the remaining pups were fostered to lactating rats. Significant alterations in body and brain weight and in brain DNA, RNA and protein were noted in undernourished rats at 10 and 21 days of age. At 6 months of age, no difference was observed in unconditioned exploratory behavior or in the acquisition and performance of a conditioned autoshaped lever touch response. Differential sensitivity to morphine was observed in nourished and undernourished rats performing the autoshaped response to asymptotic levels. At 1 year of age, undernourished rats displayed lower rectal temperatures than controls and showed an altered thermic response to morphine. These data demonstrate that poor nutritional status and other nondrug factors may be responsible for the altered thermoregulation and opiate sensitivity observed in rodents perinatally addicted to opioids, effects generally regarded as specific consequences of early opiate exposure.},

abstract={Swiss-Webster outbred mice were fed marginally or severely zinc deficient diets (9 or 2 ppm zinc) from day 16 gestation to day 15 postnatal. Control mice were fed a 100 ppm diet either ad lib or in amounts equal to the diet intake of deprived mice (pair fed controls). Male and female offspring were tested at 70 days of age in a one-trial passive avoidance task with a 30 min train-test interval. Both marginally and severely zinc deprived offspring (but not pair fed controls) had shorter avoidance latencies than offspring of ad lib fed zinc replete controls. Zinc deprived offspring did not differ from control mice when either baseline or "stressed" (exposure to novel environment) plasma corticosterone levels were quantitated. Further, zinc staining patterns of the hippocampus (Timm-sulfide stain) were not altered in the nutritionally deprived offspring. Thus marginal dietary zinc deficiency during development can lead to impaired passive avoidance performance in adult mice. This behavioral effect is not associated with altered pituitary-adrenocortical activity or with a permanent reduction in hippocampal zinc staining. This result has significant implications for the influence of zinc deprivation in utero and in the neonatal animal on adult behavior characteristics. ¬© 1983.},

Observed feeding activity does not follow the predictions of energy optimization models. The fitness response was determined for cohorts of D. magna at 0, 103, 104, 105 and 106 C. reinhardi cells/cm3. Most parameters indicative of fitness (eg. body growth, fecundity, survivorship, r and Ro) were maximal at 105 cells/cm. Optimum food concentration for growth and reproduction remained at 105 cells/cm3 when cohort life spans were truncated in a simulation of mass mortality due to predation of environmental deterioration. The fitness optimum occurred above the incipient limiting concentration and below the maximum food concentration encountered in nature. These appear to be 'suboptimal' behavioral and reproductive responses. However, reproductive models of parthenogenesis and resting egg formation along with these feeding, growth, and reproductive responses suggest that Daphnia track the environment in that they are adapted for rapid population increase and for recovery from mass mortality in cyclical environments with conditions for optimal growth that can be expected to reoccur but are of highly variable duration.-from Authors},

abstract={A series of experiments examined the behavioral and pituitary-adrenal response to novelty of perinatally malnourished rats tested as adults after nutritional rehabilitation begun at weaning. Neither the behavioral measures of ambulation, rearing and defecation, nor the plasma corticosterone response to a brief exposure to an open field differentiated the previously malnourished subjects from controls. Similar to controls, previously malnourished subjects were also capable of displaying a graded corticoid elevation to environments increasingly different from the home cage. However, exploratory behavior, as measured by head-dip frequency and duration in the hole-board, was reduced in the previously malnourished rats. Although latency and amount of fluid consumed in a novel environment did not differ, previously malnourished rats were unable to use the cues associated with a consummatory behavior to modulate the pituitary-adrenal response to novelty. Thus, perinatal malnutrition does not influence either the behavioral or physiological activational response to novel stimulation but appears to alter the ability of the animal to use a consummatory behavior to modulate this response. ¬© 1983.},

Main effects of nutrition were found in the open field and on the spatial learning and reversal tasks, as well as in body weight, eye opening, and time of appearance of body hair. Significant lesion effects were found in the open field and on spontaneous alternation and reversal learning. In contrast to two earlier studies, early diet had little effect on the response to later brain damage. These data show that the finding that early diet can affect the behavioral response to focal brain damage later in life may not generalize across all experimental conditions. ¬© 1984, Psychonomic Society, Inc..

Regarding the tests in animals which are expected to reflect antidepressant activity in man (hypothermias induced by reserpine, oxotremorine or a high dose of apomorphine, potentiation of yohimbine toxicity) clenbuterol acts at doses much lower than those required with two other Œ≤‚Äêadrenergic agonists, isoproterenol and salbutamol. Moreover, the active doses of clenbuterol and salbutamol being nearly the same at a peripheral level, the ratio of the centrally and peripherally active doses is highly in favor of clenbuterol. This suggests that the effects of clenbuterol on depressed patients should be studied. Copyright ¬© 1983 Alan R. Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Dog bites are a medical problem for millions of people, children being the most common victims. Human deaths attributable to dog bite injury (not rabies) are relatively infrequent. There have been some epidemiologic reviews, but this study is the first attempt to arrive at an understanding of bites involving predation on human beings by conducting behavioral examinations under controlled conditions of the dogs involved, and by interviewing victims, witnesses, and people familiar with the animals. The three cases studied involved two fatalities and an attack that was nearly fatal. The victims were 11, 14, and 81. In each case, owned pet dogs consumed some human tissue. The severity of the victims' injuries was not the consequence of a single dog bite, but the result of repeated attacks by dogs behaving as a social group. Factors that might contribute to a dog's regarding human beings as potential prey were examined, including hunger, prior predation, group behaviors, defense of territory, previous interactions with people, the presence of estrous female dogs, and environmental stimuli. In two of the cases, it was possible, by using similar stimuli, to duplicate the circumstances at the time of the attack. The results of the observations showed the value of behavioral analysis and simulations methods in evaluating possible factors in dog attacks. Among the many factors probably involved in severe dog attacks are the size, number, and nutritional status of the dogs; the dogs' previous aggressive contacts with people; the victim's age, size, health, and behavior; and the absence of other human beings in the vicinity.},

abstract={Under experimental clinical conditions diet modification has been shown to reduce serum cholesterol levels. This paper reports such a positive response to a nonpharmacologic, behavioral education program at the worksite. Employees at the New York Telephone Company corporate headquarters were assigned randomly to treatment and control groups. Treatment consisted of an 8-week group cholesterol reduction program conducted during employee lunch hours. It comprised a multiple-treatment approach-food behavior change techniques combined with nutrition education, physical activity planning, and self-management skills. The treatment group showed substantial change compared with the control group at the program's completion. Those treated displayed a significant 6.4% reduction in total serum cholesterol (266 mg% average at baseline) as compared with control subjects with a corresponding decrease in high-density lipoprotein levels. A significant increase in nutrition knowledge and moderate weight loss were also documented for this group. The magnitudes of a participant's baseline serum cholesterol level and his/her reduction in percentage of ideal body weight were positively and independently correlated with percentage changes in serum cholesterol levels. Over the same period, decreases in high-density lipoprotein levels and no changes in serum cholesterol, weight, and nutrition knowledge were observed for the control group. Overall, participants in the treatment program successfully reduced the coronary heart disease risk factors of elevated cholesterol and weight. Directions for future study are suggested. ¬© 1983.},

abstract={Within a quarter century the convergence of geographical and prospective epidemiology, clinical research, and laboratory investigation has provided strongly attested theories of coronary heart disease (CHD) etiology. Evidence that application of these theories will reduce CHD incidence is incomplete but adequate to justify their use at clinical and population levels. Additional etiological hypotheses (HDL, hyperinsulinism, personality type) are persuasive but await comparable investigation. Risk-benefit considerations require ongoing scrutiny; current evidence, however, does not give cause for concern that attainable reduction of plasma cholesterol has deleterious effects. To minimize lipoprotein-mediated CHD risk it may be necessary to attain population mean plasma cholesterol levels of less than 200 mg/dl, a target which is probably feasible by dietary modifications directed to lipid, fiber, and energy intake. A substantial obstacle to CHD prevention is the irresponsible rearguard action by small segments of the food industry and the medical profession, permitting inertia on the false grounds that scientific opinion is seriously divided. ¬© 1983.},

No sex differences occurred if animals were nondeprived throughout testing. However, if deprived during the interval between conditioning and reexposure, sex differences in both behavior and adrenocortical responses occurred: (1) Presession corticoid levels of females were higher than those of males. (2) On the first reexposure day, females showed a suppression of plasma corticosterone below presession levels, while males maintained elevated or increased corticosterone levels. (3) On the second reexposure day, when no longer deprived, males showed a marked suppression of intake compared to females, and females subsequently recovered to pretoxicosis intake levels faster than males. (4) Gonadectomy eliminated these sex differences. While ovariectomized females continued to resemble intact females in both behavioral and hormonal responses, castrated males exhibited a corticoid suppression on the first reexposure day, and subsequently recovered to pretoxicosis intake levels at the same rate as females. ¬© 1982.},

abstract={An ability to distinguish relevance from irrelevance has been attributed to an attention-related mechanism and may be disturbed in thought-disordered schizophrenics. Stimulus choice strategies depend on such mechanisms (ia) and are anomalous in some schizophrenics. An impaired function of the ventral tegmentum (VTA) has been postulated for schizophrenia. The effects of VTA damage on the relevance/irrelevance distinction and strategy formation in rats has been studied. Over a 5 day-period food-deprived rats were given nine sessions of ten trials each on a 16-hole board. They searched for food pellets placed consistently in four holes. During testing the control group (C) reduced the number of emtpy holes visited more than the group with VTA damage. The proportion of repeated visits to relevant holes (had food) to irrelevant holes (never had food) increased for the C but not for the VTA group. The frequency with which a preferred sequence of food-hole visits was repeated during a session increased over sessions for the C but not the VTA group. The VTA group changed their preference between sessions more often. Animals with VTA damage were capable of simple learning, but were impaired when complexity increased. This may be due in part to a deficit in attention-related mechanisms. This encourages further study of the contribution of the VTA to putative attentional dysfunction and the use of the hole-board search task as a model for the study of cognitive function and dysfunction.},

abstract={The mechanism by which developmental anomalies associated with the fetal alcohol syndrome are produced is not understood. Current hypotheses include altered maternal function and direct action of ethanol or its metabolic product, acetaldehyde, on embryonic tissue. Pregnant mice were fed liquid diets containing either ethanol (3.6%, w/v) or tertiary butanol in concentrations of 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00% (w/v) from day 6 to day 20 of gestation. Untreated surrogate maternal animals were substituted in half of the original litters to gain insight into the role played by maternal nutritional and behavioral factors. Quantitatively, t-butanol was approximately 5 times more potent than ethanol in producing a developmental delay in postparturition physiological and psychomotor performance scores. The existence of significant postnatal maternal nutritional and behavioral factors affecting lactation and/or nesting behavior were also evident at the higher concentrations of alcohol. The results from this study are consistent with the hypothesis that ethanol per se and not acetaldehyde is primarily responsible for the fetal alcohol syndrome.},

abstract={We argue that a map is meaningless unless we have a process for using it. Thus, in this paper, we not only offer the world graph as a representation of relationships among situations the animal has encountered and may encounter again, but we also offer algorithms for how the information encoded in the world graph may be used by the animal in determining its behavior. Each node of the graph encodes a recognizable situation in the animal's world, but a given place may well be encoded in a number of different nodes. Nodes not only require algorithms for the recognition of the situation; they store information about drive reduction associated with the encoded situation. We note that the use of graphs as a basis for exploring some search space is well known in artificial intelligence (AI), but we stress the importance of the animal's exploration of its environment for growing the graph, as distinct from the mathematically described potential nodes frequent in AI search spaces. To explore a number of hypotheses about the way information in the world graph is used to guide the animal's movement, we recall a number of classical experiments on maze exploration by animals, and use them to argue for the nonlocal hypothesis (selection of a path does not depend only upon information about the immediate environment of the animal) and the competing nodes hypothesis (more than one drive may enter into the determination of the animal's behavior at any time). An important feature of the model is that it yields exploration and latent learning without the introduction of an exploratory drive. We also note that the performance exhibited by the model appears to be state-dependent when the animal operates under high drive levels. The drive-interaction matrix is offered as a subject for future research. We complement the presentation of the world graph model, its drive dynamics, and how these are constrained by experiments on maze behavior, with a brief analysis of maps in the brain. We distinguish egocentric maps‚Äìwhich we relate to the many visual systems‚Äìfrom allocentric maps. We offer a somewhat unconventional view of short-term and long-term memory. We examine cooperative computation in somatotopically organized networks, relating this to visually guided behavior in the frog, and to the interaction of colliculus and cortex in the control of eye movements. We examine, but do not advocate, the hypothesis that the hippocampus is a cognitive map. We do stress that if it is a cognitive map, it must be seen as a chart of the local neighborhood, rather than the whole atlas; and we note that the cognitive map hypothesis would lead one to expect the region to exhibit activation of place cells before the animal leaves the previous place. ¬© 1982, Cambridge University Press.

abstract={4 types of theories attempt to explain why women continue to bottle feed their infants in developing countries despite increased infant health risk and extensive governmental campaigns to encourage breastfeeding: 1) 3rd World women, encouraged by unfair marketing and advertising practices, wish to emulate western women for reasons of prestige. 2) Infant feeding practices can be used as social indicators. Societies in disorganization, transition, or stress bottle feed, while breastfeeding is a sign of stability. 3) The mother chooses the feeding method that optimizes her contribution to the family group or the social unit rather than giving priority to the infant's development. 4) Breast milk is not adequate or is not perceived as adequate for optimal infant growth, especially if maternal nutrition is inadequate. The majority of research extends from the 1st theoretical orientation, which is supported by the World Health Organization. But most research has been conducted by male physicians searching for a cure to a medical problem, infantile diarrhea, rather than a social or behavioral syndrome. Epidemiological techniques have been stressed, perhaps because of the intimate nature of breastfeeding, which puts male researchers at a disadvantage. Research over the past decade by anthropologists and female researchers, mostly behavioral, has resulted in theoretical positions 2-4. Acceptance of the 1st position ignores contradictory evidence. Common problems in existing research including researcher bias, poor research design, and simplistic statistical techniques have helped to obscure the evidence. It has recently been suggested that infant feeding research should consider aspects of the environment, particularly the level of development of the society, in addition to variables affecting the mother and infant.},

abstract={A study of the breeding biology, feeding ecology, and behaviour of the Little Auk was carried out on Horse Head Island (73¬∞ 38‚Ä≤ N, 57¬∞ 08‚Ä≤ W) in west Greenland between July and August 1974. Distinct subcolony groups were recognized within the colony. During incubation, attendance at the colony increased to a peak between 2100 and 2400 h, with large rafts building up on the sea before engaging in aerial flights and then settling on land. During the nestling period, this pattern changed with further peaks at 0600 and 1800 h, and a decline during the afternoon, particularly during the late nestling period. Little Auks fed exclusively on copepods and amphipods (94%Calanus finmarchicus) usually captured within 2.5 km of the colony. Feeding rhythms fitted closely the known diurnal vertical migrations of Calanus with peaks between 2200 and 0800 h. Some individuals within subcolony groups showed synchrony of feeds, mainly between 1800 and 2400 h. The mean number of feeds to a chick in 24 h was 5.25. Growth rates of young were comparable between all four experimental groups and controls, although the latter attained higher weights. Mean daily weight increases were constant until 18 days of age when they declined sharply. This was not reflected in a change in mean daily weight increases with date and so suggests that food availability had not declined. Instead there was a reduced feeding rate to chicks from age 21 days to fledging. Breeding success was 50 %, mainly the result of egg desertion and predation by Arctic Foxes, and this may have been reduced by our own activities. Behaviour postures and the responses they elicited are described together with the diurnal patterns of different activities. Aerial flights are also described and their possible function discussed. It is concluded that the shortness of the time when abundant food is available has encouraged close breeding synchrony and this is achieved by mass flights and rafting on the sea beside the colony, and subdivision of the colony into groups with communal behaviour close to the nests.

abstract={Following a 5-week maintenance on a low-tryptophan diet, brain 5-HT content was reduced to 75%, whereas NA and DA levels remained unchanged as compared to controls. Reactivity to air-puffs as well as to the novelty of the open-field was increased. Incidence of mouse-killing was examined in 2 groups of Wistar rats maintained on the try ptophan-deficient diet for 2 and 4 weeks, respectively, before being tested with a mouse: 70% and 60% of them killed mice, compared to 20% killers in rats given free access to standard food, and 20% killers in rats given a limited access to standard food so as to reproduce the suppression of weight gain observed in the tryptophan-deficient animals. Prior non-aggressive interactions with mice significantly reduced later incidence of mouse-killing following a 4-week tryptophan-poor diet, thus confirming the suppressant effect of prior familarization with mice on elicitation of mouse-killing as a result of brain 5-HT depletion. Once initiated, mouse-killing persisted even when the rats were returned to standard food, demonstrating that reduced 5-HT activity is not necessary for the maintenance of this behavior. ¬© 1981, ANKHO International Inc.

abstract={The eight monkey species occurring in Surinam were studied in the Raleigh-vallen-Voltzberg Nature Reserve along the Coppename River. Special emphasis was placed on determining how these eight species divide up available habitat and food resources within a 300-ha study area. Cebus apella apella is probably the most adaptable of the Surinam monkeys. It was found mainly in the understory and lower to middle parts of the canopy of all five forest types (high rain forest, low rain forest, mountain savanna forest, liane forest, pina swamp forest) in the study area, and entered a variety of edge habitats. Saguinus midas midas, the only callitrichid in Surinam, also occurred mainly in the understory and lower to middle parts of the canopy of all five forest types, but was the only species to spend more time in edges than in non-edge habitats. Alouatta seniculus was most often seen in the middle to upper strata of high forest, but occasionally entered the four other forest types and a variety of edges. Cebus nigrivittatus is apparently less adaptable than its congener and was largely restricted to the understory and lower to middle strata of high forest. It occasionally entered two other forest types as well, but was rarely seen in edges. Chiropotes and Pithecia were both found almost exclusively in high forest and mountain savanna forest, but Chiropotes was mainly in the upper part of the canopy and in emergents, whereas Pithecia occupied the lower to middle parts of the canopy and the understory. Neither species made much use of edges. Ateles paniscus paniscus and Saimiri sciureus represent the extremes of primate adaptation in the Voltzberg area. Ateles was the most restricted species, and was found almost exclusively in high forest. It very rarely entered edges and was most often seen in the uppermost forest strata. In contrast, Saimiri was the only species that was not found most often in high forest, and it occurred consistently lower than any other monkey in the area. More than 50% of all Saimiri observations were in liane forest, a habitat rarely or never entered by most of the other species, and more than 60% were in the understory stratum. Saguinus, Saimiri, Cebus apella and C. nigrivittatus were omnivorous, with Saimiri apparently eating the most arthropods. The four remaining species were not seen feeding on insects or other animals. All eight species included a high proportion of fruit in their diet, with flowers and sometimes leaves usually playing a minor role. The two largest species, Alouatta and Ateles, were the most folivorous, but Alouatta was the only one that ate mature leaves and its leaf intake far exceeded that of Ateles. The three smallest species (Saguinus, Saimiri, Pithecia) did not eat leaves at all. Chiropotes was an important seed predator; Pithecia and C. nigrivittatus may also depend heavily on seeds. Alouatta and Saimiri were never seen acting as seed predators. Alouatta and Ateles were major seed dispersers. The other six species occasionally dispersed seeds, but to a much lesser extent. ¬© 1981 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract={Excessive grooming is a remarkable behavioral response for several reasons. Probably the most important is that it represents an almost unique behavioral assay for the injection of the longer ACTH fragments. Fractions of a microgram of ACTH1-24 or ACTH1-16 produce extensions of grooming bout duration to an extent that the animal does little else during the entire observation period. The specificity of the response is remarkable, as well. Few other neuropeptides induce excessive grooming, and those that do (e.g. [7-d-phe]ACTH4-10) are only of limited effectiveness. Also of special interest is the limited number of brain regions in which lesions influence the response. Only two such regions have been found: the substantia nigra and the hippocampus. A link to naturally occurring events is now provided by the observations which indicate that certain forms of environmental manipulations also lead to excessive grooming. These are conditions of mild stress, the most completely studied being that of 'novelty'. While providing a connection to real world events, the study of stress-induced excessive grooming has also led to certain difficult questions. In the study of stress conditions that produce excessive grooming, only certain ones have been found to be effective. These include handling, noise, transport, novelty, the anticipation of footshock and water immersion. Of these, water immersion has the most pronounced effects. From our pharmacologic studies, water immersion produces a type of grooming that is distinctly different from either that produced by novelty or other mild stress conditions and also different from that produced by central ACTH administration. For example, the excessive grooming induced by water immersion is not reduced by either substantia nigra or hippocampal lesions, neither is it reduced by the systematic administration of clonidine. On the other hand, these treatments and procedures reduce both novelty and ACTH-induced excessive grooming. The stress procedures which do not induce excessive grooming also bear consideration. They include the exposure to ether fumes, bodily restraint, and electrical footshock. In fact, the latter reduces excessive grooming. Putting aside, for a moment, the effects of water immersion, stressors seem to fall into two classes: those that produce excessive grooming after their termination and those that do not. It seems to us that this could come about in two ways: (1) the stressors that do elicit grooming may produce a different type of distribution of ACTH release in the brain than those that do not; or (2) all stressors may produce ACTH release in a similar fashion, but those that fail to elicit grooming may also elicit antagonistic activity, possibly involving the brain monoamine systems. While there is little evidence to support a differential pattern of release as a consequence of different stress conditions, the possibility cannot be ruled out. The second possibility, the activation of incompatible neural systems by certain stressors, seems more likely. If this is the case, then it could be proposed that the amount of excessive grooming displayed by an animal is positively related to the amount of ACTH affecting certain brain regions involved with the production of excessive grooming, and negatively related to the activity in opposing systems. ACTH could reach the target areas of the central nervous system from the anterior pituitary (de Kloet and de Wied, 1980; Mezey, et al., 1978) or from central ACTH networks. Beagley (1976) felt that this electrical stimulation at higher intensities may have activated an excitatory system for grooming that did not achieve behavioral expression because of the simultaneous induction of an opposing, inhibitory process. He proposed that the grooming system, however, had a longer afterdischarge than the opposing processes. Thus, when inhibition or the competing response tendencies declined in activity, grooming would be observed. Bolles (1960) came to a similar conclusion. He had found that the induction of motivation for food or water by deprivation decreased grooming as did the induction of fear. He concluded that these 'motivational' procedures did not induce grooming directly but that grooming-occurred after the conclusion of goal-directed acts or highly motivated episodes, presumably when competing neural mechanisms declined in activity. The relatively high levels of excessive grooming seen after water immersion seem to be quite different in some aspects from either novelty- or ACTH-induced grooming. Their resistance to lesions effects and pharmacological intervention suggest a different component or mechanism has been involved. It may be that this is related to increased 'maintenance' grooming (an attempt to remove water from the fur), but if this were the case, it would be necessary to account for the fact that from 1 to 3 min of water immersion is necessary to induce the effect. Exposure to water for less than one min fails to elicit the effect. It is also difficult to explain why the soiling and disturbances of the fur in the restraint procedures fails to elicit a similar amount of grooming on the basis of a maintenance hypothesis. The involvement of opiate-sensitive systems in the grooming response is based on the ubiquitous blocking effect of naloxone on all excessive grooming, including that induced by water immersion. It is certainly not a response common to all of the known endogenous opiates since the enkephalins and some endorphin fragments are ineffective in producing excessive grooming. In fact, the excessive grooming induced by Œ≤-endorphin is qualitiatively different from that produced by ACTH. Œ≤-endorphin seems to activate the animals into more behavioral activities including grooming, while ACTH acts to extend the duration of grooming episodes. The neurochemical mechanism by which ACTH induces the grooming behavior is not understood. However, the recent isolation of an ACTH-sensitive protein kinase from rat brain synaptosomal plasma membranes suggests that ACTH may modulate trans-synaptic neuronal activities by altering the degree of phosphorylation of certain synaptic proteins. The insensitivity of this protein kinase to endorphins and the unique ACTH structure-activity correlation between the induction of excessive grooming and inhibition of protein phosphorylation support this notion. Since excessive grooming is found after the termination of several stressors, it is possible that it is related to restorative neural and chemical processes. ACTH could be thought of and acting as an initiating factor in the mobilization of the organism to meet the emergency situation while at the same time initiating processes aimed at re-establishing a stable, internal equilibrium. The grooming response, itself, has been considered to play a deactivating role in animal behavior (for example see Delius, 1970; Delius, et al., 1976; Jolles et al., 1979a). It is also possible to cast the behavioral observations into a related but different context which removes some of the objections that can be made to the view that grooming should only occur before relatively inactive states. This would be that excessive grooming is a correlate of a central state in which behavioral activation may be present but without concomittant demands for fight or flight. This central state may be correlated with a number of classes of responses and the ones selected for exhibition would depend on environmental opportunities, the animals past history and genetic predispositions. Grooming may occur after extremely arousing conditions. This suggests that these acts may be correlated with pleasurable experiences. The slow body stretching and paw extensions found in cats by MacLean (1957) would be one example as would the signs of sexual excitation observed. Bertolini, et al. (1975) report similar signs of sexual arousal after injection of ACTH1-24 into the lateral ventricle of the rabbit. However, the presumed sexual arousal reflects an activation of the mechanisms related to sexual behavior without an enhanced motivation to copulate. During the peptide-induced stimulation the animals do not seek copulation. For example, the injection of the peptide into the ventricles of male rats does not increase the percentage of males copulating with females. It is as if the animal is 'tuned in' to its own pleasurable bodily reactions that may include those of a sexual nature. Bertolini et al. also provided evidence that the sexual activation in male rats or rabbits instituted by ACTH1-24 depends on the integrity of the testes. However, the excessive grooming observed in rats after the intraventricular injection of ACTH1-24 or Œ≤-endorphin, in the amounts used in our laboratories, as well as the grooming induced by novelty does not concentrate on the genital area. Few signs of sexual arousal can be observed. However, it is possible that a 'pleasurable', positive affective state is induced by these treatments and that at greater magnitudes the pleasurable state could facilitate signs of sexual arousal. This would suggest that in the rat the central state induced by i.c.v. administration of ACTH1-24 is closely limited to the grooming response but is may be tied to other, many more varied responses in other species. ¬© 1981.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of children to sense and to respond to internal hunger cues and to determine the role certain demographic, physiologic, and environment factors played in their responses. The eating behavior of ninety‚Äênine children in seven day‚Äêcare centers was observed on two occasions. The children consumed morning snacks of low or high caloric density (internal cue variable), followed by standardized lunches at noon. Each child participated twice, serving as his own control. Weights of food consumed at snacks and lunches were determined. A child was considered responsive to internal cues if he modified his lunch consumption to compensate for snack calorie intake; 42 percent failed to meet this criterion. Lunch calorie consumption was significantly affected by the order of treatments and by day‚Äêcare centers, but not by age, sex, weightlheight ratio, social status, race, or number of siblings. The immediate environment was concluded to have a greater effect on eating be havior than internal cues. Children tended to eat more at lunch on the first day of the experiment, regardless of the type of snack, apparently responding to a Hawthorne effect created by the novelty of the situation. This effect is itself interpreted as an external stimulus to eat. Children exhibiting insensitivity to their internal cues and overresponsiveness to their external cues were considered at risk of developing food habits contributing to problems of control of energy balance. 1981 American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences},

This latter appears to be the more sensitive index of anxiolytic drug action and occurs at doses which have no effect on rearing or grooming. DZP was effective following either acute or chronic (15 day) treatment at doses which had no effect on the food consumption by fasted rats tested in their home cages. The effects of the sedative benzodiazepine, flurazepam, were similar to those of DZP but were not statistically significant. Behavioral effects similar to those of DZP were seen in animals received additional handling prior to testing or in animals habituated to the open field.

abstract={Many of the behavioral actions of ethyl alcohol are mimicked by hippocampal lesions. With the present study, we begin to assess the extent to which alcohol's behavioral effects are actually mediated by the hippocampus. Using an appetitive runway task, the direct (pharmacological) and indirect (variously referred to as stimulus, dissociative, or state-dependent) actions of alcohol (dose increments from 0.75 to 1.12 g/kg) were investigated in rats with hippocampal or sham lesions. Alcohol facilitated performance (running time) during acquisition in both lesion and sham-operated rats, suggesting that the direct effects of alcohol were not dependent upon hippocampal mediation. Indirect ethanol actions were assessed in a 2 √ó 2 √ó 2 design, where half of the animals experienced a change from the alcohol or vehicle state that prevailed during training. Sham-operated animals displayed the usual asymmetrical dissociation, but lesion rats did not. They exhibited only the direct effects of the drug. Besides indicating the necessity of the hippocampus for indirect alcohol actions, the pattern of results permitted interpretation of asymmetry as the differential summation of direct and indirect drug effects. Finally, in every case-lesion or drug, direct or indirect action-the changes in runway performance were directly attributable to changes in the frequency of exploration within the alley that competed with running time, the usual performance measure. ¬© 1981 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract={Yellowfin tuna can detect and distinguish between odors of intact prey organisms, responding to odor quality of various prey rinses with different amino acid profiles. Chemical fractions of natural prey odors and synthetic mixtures of amino acids are less effective than whole natural rinses. Assuming uniform dilution, tuna can detect amino constituents of prey odors at about 10-11 M. Intensity of the behavioral response is modified by hunger. Feeding experience with new prey causes a gradual shift to maximum responses to its odor. We propose that one of the functions of the tuna's olfactory system is to form "chemical search images" which focus food search behavior for specific prey. The search image is thought to be modifiable and to be induced by prevailing prey abundance, so as to optimize the predator's feeding efficiency. ¬© 1980 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

These observations indicate that deprivation of water increases exploratory behaviour among M. hurrianae but food, and food-cum-water deprivation do not seem to influence it. The behaviour of M. hurrianae, when deprived of water, mostly alternated between exploration and drinking whereas feeding was the major behavioural component of the gerbils deprived of food, and food-cum-water. It appears that feeding behaviour among M. hurrianae is of a higher order than drinking behaviour since the animals depend chiefly on the available water content of the food in their natural invironment - the desert. ¬© 1980.},

abstract={Maintaining rats on a tryptophan-free diet for 4-6 days induced mouse killing in non-killer rats, and significantly facilitated killing in killer rats, as indicated by shorter latencies to kill the mice. The killing responses were similar in topography to the natural killing responses. These changes in killing behavior did not appear to be due to generalized changes in irritability. The increased killing after maintenance on a tryptophan-free diet was accompanied by a 26% reduction in brain serotonin (5-HT) and a 29% reduction in brain 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). When the tryptophan-free diet was supplemented with l-tryptophan (0.5 or 2%), brain 5-HT and 5-HIAA were increased above control levels, and the rat's killing response appeared normal both in terms of latency and topography, similar to that seen in control chow fed animals. While rats consumed less of the tryptophan-free and tryptophan supplemented diets, control subjects deprived of chow such that they lost as much weight as rats fed the tryptophan-free diet, did not show changes in killing behavior. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that central serotonergic systems exert inhibitory control over mouse killing behavior in rats. ¬© 1979.},

abstract={Meal size, intermeal interval (IMI), statiety ratio and postprandial behaviors of obese and lean male mice were measured after 1.5 to 6.0 hr of food deprivation in the dynamic and static phases of weight gain. Obese mice ate the same sized meal as lean mice after food deprivation except after 1.5 hr deprivation in the dynamic phase when obese mice ate more. Obese mice had significantly different satiety ratios than lean mice, but the nature of the difference depended on the phase of weight gain. In the dynamic phase obese mice had a significantly smaller satiety ratio after 1.5 hr deprivation, but in the static phase obese mice had a significantly larger satiety ratio after 1.5 and 3.0 hr deprivation. Thus the differences in meal taking did not persist from the dynamic to the static phase. Differences in postprandial behaviors did. Obese mice groomed less, explored less and rested more than lean mice in the dynamic and static phases of weight gain. This demonstrates that these differences in postprandial behaviors are dissociated from body weight and meal taking responses to deprivation. ¬© 1979.},

abstract={In Experiment 1, rats living in chambers containing bedding material were injected with a toxicosis‚Äêproducing dose of lithium chloride shortly after their initial taste of sweetened condensed milk. They consumed no additional milk and used the bedding to bury the spout through which the milk had been delivered, although they did not bury a concurrently available water spout. In another control condition, rats did not bury a spout containing a novel solution (saccharin) not paired with toxicosis. In Experiment 2, rats did not bury a milk spout until milk consumption was followed by toxicosis. In Experiment 3, rats buried a spout containing Tabasco pepper sauce but not a concurrently available water spout. Thus, burying the food source appears to be an integral component of the rat's defensive reaction to noxious food. 1979 Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior},

abstract={(1) We have demonstrated that if food and water are restricted to the morning hours, the circadian rhythms of the pituitary-adrenal system are re-entrained and the levels of plasma corticosteroids are elevated in the morning, whereas they are usually low during that period in the rodent. Following drinking, however, there is, within 5 min, a sharp decline in plasma corticoids accompanied by an equivalent drop in ACTH. Thus, in addition to the regulation of ACTH by the usual feedback of circulating corticosteroids, there appears to be an independent central nervous system inhibitory mechanism which can cause ACTH and corticosteroids to drop concomitantly. (2) We demonstrated that the availability of a consummatory response can reduce an organism's pituitary-adrenal response to a normally stressful situation. (a) When exposed to novelty, animals usually show a striking elevation of plasma corticosterone. However, if a consummatory response-drinking-is available in the novel environment, the response to this novel environment is markedly reduced. (b) The availability of an adjunct behavior-drinking-in a situation where animals are placed on an intermittent food reinforcement schedule also causes a significant reduction in plasma corticosterone levels. (c) Shock-induced fighting results in a reduced ACTH response to shock. Fighting behavior can also be viewed as a consummatory response. (3) We believe these experiments demonstrate the bidirectionality of the pituitary-adrenal system. Since the pituitary-adrenal system appears to provide a sensitive measure of arousal state, and since consummatory responses suppress the activity of this system, it therefore appears that consummatory behavior has arousal-reducing properties. ¬© 1979.},

abstract={This study investigated the factors controlling behavioural responses of the domestic cat to its prey. Experiment 1 identified three temporally-associated groups of behaviours, and associated these differentialy with killing. Cat behaviours were independent of prey activity. Hunger was not a necessary condition for killing. In experiment 2, I manipulated hunger and the size of the prey. I found that: (1) The probability of a kill increased directly with hunger. (2) When the prey was large or difficult, the probability of a kill decreased. (3) The probability of killing was predictable if the levels of the factors hunger and prey size were known. (4) When these factors were in conflict, cats tended to play with the prey before, after, or instead of, killing. The relevance of these results to other studies of the control of predatory and playful behaviours is discussed. ¬© 1979.},

abstract={Human ethology is defined as the biology of human behavior. The methods it employs and the questions it poses are elaborations of those generally used in the various fields of biology, but especially adapted to the study of man. Observation and experimentation in the natural and seminatural setting as well as the comparative method derived from morphology play important roles in human ethology, and the exploration of phylogenetic adaptations constitutes one of its focal interests. On the basis of observations on experientially deprived and nondeprived children, comparative primate and animal behavior studies, and cross-cultural investigations, certain universal phylogenetic adaptations (in terms of fixed action patterns, innate releasing mechanisms, releasers, innate motivating mechanisms, and innate learning dispositions) have been found to occur. However, human ethology does not restrict itself to the investigation of phylogenetic adaptations. The question as to how a behavior pattern contributes to survival can be posed with respect to cultural patterns as well. Similar selection pressures have shaped both culturally and phylogenetically evolved patterns. Through cross-cultural studies a number of universal social interaction strategies have been discovered. ¬© 1979, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Control and chronic undernourished newborn rat pups were exposed to cold stress for 3 min daily or left undisturbed on Days 2-11. On Days 25-29 (preweaning) and at 90 days of age, stressed and non-stressed pups in each group were tested in a cross-maze and a T-maze, and their preference for novel and social stimulation and activity levels were measured. At 90 days only, another group of such pups was trained to learn an active avoidance response to electric shock. The results on maze performance show that prior to weaning, stressed controls (SC) and nonstressed undernourished (NSU) pups exhibited shorter response latencies, and a greater preference for social stimulation than the non-stressed controls (NSC). At 90 days, SC and NSU again exhibited shorter latencies, and higher activity levels, and also a greater preference for novel stimulation than the NSC animals. In these parameters, there were no significant differences between stressed undernourished (SU) and NSU animals. In original avoidance learning, undernourished animals exhibited a slower rate of acquisition learning than controls. However, in reversal learning, NSU animals made significantly more errors than the SU animals. There were no significant differences between the two control groups and the SU group. These results show that early cold stress alone can have the same behavioral effects as early undernutrition alone and that early stress can have a significant reversing effect on the learning performance of previously undernourished adult animals. Statistical correlations between behavioral parameters (X- and T-maze behavior and active avoidance learning) and crude brain parameters (weight, cell number (DNA), cell density and protein) were investigated in the above animals. It was found that, in general, behavioral parameters whose high values appear to be of advantage for the animal (e.g. number of entries or social time in mazes and percent correct moves in the original and reversal learning) had significant positive correlations with weight, cell number (DNA), and protein content, at least in cerebral cortex and cerebellum, and negative correlations with cortical cell density. Conversely, parameters whose high values are of disadvantage (latency in mazes, or total trials to criterion and total errors in learning) generally had significant negative correlations with brain weight, cell number, and protein content, and positive with cortical cell density. Age, stress or undernutrition had no effect on these results. It is concluded that, statistically, even these crude brain parameters may be significantly correlated with behavior. That is, animals tend to perform better if their cortical cells are further apart and if their brain weight, cell number (DNA), and protein content are higher. ¬© 1979.},

abstract={Investigated the effects of ventral mesencephalic tegmentum (VMT) radio-frequency lesions on spontaneous and complex behaviors, such as food hoarding and alimentary patterns in 28 male Sprague-Dawley rats. Activity measures indicate that VMT lesions increased horizontal activity in both a circular corridor and an open field, whereas vertical activity (rearing) was decreased. After 12 hrs of food deprivation, food hoarding and alimentary patterns were evaluated in a square open field to which Ss had free access from their home cage. Controls hoarded food and had organized feeding behavior, but experimentals did not hoard. Moreover, increasing the open-field illumination did not reverse this deficit. Similarly, the VMT lesion induced disruption of the adaptative alimentary behavior in response to food deprivation. A strong correlation was observed between hoarding scores and the extent of locomotor hyperactivity. Results are discussed in terms of a possible implication of limbic-midbrain mechanisms in which the meso-cortico-limbic dopaminergic A10 neurons originating in the VMT might have a primary role.

abstract={Hooded rats which begin to kill mice while deprived of food display an orderly development of attack topography. Attack complexity is maximal at onset of killing when four component attacks comprising chasing, carrying, pawing, and biting mice predominate. Attack simplifies to two component pawing-biting attacks with repeated killing experience which result in rapid kills. Food satiation and a gradual decline in killing behavior reinstates attacks of intermediate complexity, comprised of chasing, pawing and biting. Redepriving the rats of food immediately results in simple and rapidly lethal pawing-biting attacks. With further killing experience some rats show the chasing-pawing-biting attacks once again. The data suggest that prey self-defense and the sensitivity of attacking rats to prey defense account for variation in some aspects of attack complexity. Factors intrinsic to the rat and dependent upon response to food deprivation and experience of killing account for other aspects of attack topography. Rats which do not begin to kill mice while food deprived show simple and fragmented attack topography unlike that of mouse-killing rats.

abstract={The role of the noradrenergic projections from the locus coeruleus to the cerebral and cerebellar cortices in the learning of a novel motor response was investigated using two techniques of administration of the relatively selective neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). In one technique, 8 Œºg of 6-OHDA was stereotaxically injected bilaterally into the fibres of the dorsal noradrenergic bundle in the mesencephalon. This produced severe depletion of cortical and hippocampal noradrenaline (NA) but did not damage the cerebellar projection. The second 6-OHDA technique involved intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg of 6-OHDA into neonatal rats on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 after birth. This produced depletions of cortical and hippocampal NA comparable to the dorsal bundle technique, but also gave a profound loss of cerebellar NA. Neither technique altered striatal dopamine (DA). These animals were tested on the acuisition of a complex motor learning task involving the pulling or pushing of a ball out of a tunnel in order to reach food. Neither preparation was impaired on acquisition of this novel motor response, nor in tests of behavioural flexibility requiring the transfer from pull to the push response and vice versa. Both NA depleted preparations, however, showed a marked difference from normals when tested in extinction. When food was no longer presented, the 6-OHDA treated animals continued emitting the response for longer and with greater rapidity than control animals. This resistance to extinction is a further demonstration of the role of the dorsal noradrenergic bundle in mechanisms involved in the extinction process. The findings are discussed in relation to noradrenergic theories of associative and motor learning and to previously demonstrated alterations in the extinction process in 6-OHDA treated animals. ¬© 1977.},

abstract={Three experiments investigated the effects of food deprivation on several behavioral categories in a total of 56 bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus and L. gibbosus, respectively). In Exp I, predatory behavior and general activity were observed under 5 levels of deprivation. For both species, predation measures increased in a similar negatively accelerating manner with increasing deprivation, while activity changed in a more complex fashion. Exp II examined the effects of deprivation on activity in a novel environment and showed that the deprivation effects of Exp I were masked by the response to the new setting. In Exp III, measures of aggression toward intruders of each species were recorded from resident fish of both species under 3 levels of food deprivation. Both species were more aggressive toward conspecifics, and bluegills were more aggressive overall. Aggression was significantly affected by food deprivation, with the effects dependent on the species making up the pair. Theories of motivational summation, generalized drive, and activity-mediated aggression are seen as inadequate to explain the differential effects of hunger on the 3 behavioral categories observed. A dynamic boundary-state model of behavior was, however, found to predict the motivational interactions observed between distinct behavioral control systems.

abstract={In rats housed normally (aggregated, food and water ad lib) for fourteen days Œî8-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) produced mild sedation and minimal hypothermia. An increase in noradrenaline synthesis was observed, but brain dopamine metabolism was unchanged. In rats removed from this 'normal' environment to conditions of isolation and food deprivation for 24 h THC produced immobility, marked hyper-reactivity, and hypothermia. Brain noradrenaline metabolism was unchanged by THC under these conditions, but significant changes in striatal dopamine metabolism were observed. These changes are consistent with increased dopamine reuptake in striatum produced by this combination of THC and novel environment. It is suggested that some of the behavioural effects of cannabis administered under stressful conditions may be related to alterations in striatal dopamine metabolism. ¬© 1977.},

abstract={The growth and development of 32 cebus monkeys were studied during a period of insult in nutritional or rearing conditions and after rehabilitation. Eight experimental groups of four animals each were subjected to one of four diets - control, protein restricted, calorie restricted, and protein-calorie restricted, and one of two rearing conditions - partial isolation or a comparatively enriched condition - in a 4 x 2 factorial design. The period of insult from 2 to 6 months of age was followed by 6 months of rehabilitation in both diet and rearing conditions. It was found that only diet affected physical growth, but both diet and rearing affected behavioral development and exploratory behavior. Whereas calorie deficiency produced a direct effect on behavior independent of rearing conditions, protein deficiency produced an effect only in combination with rearing restriction. The effect of protein calorie deficiency had some characteristics in common with each of the other deficiencies. Retardation in rate of behavioral development was less severe than retardation in growth, most notably in the protein-restricted, enriched group, producing animals who were behaviorally mature for their size. All groups caught up in physical growth during rehabilitation but the protein calorie restricted group failed to recuperate completely in exploratory behavior.},

abstract={The relationships between behavioral, ecologicaland demographic data are examined for a wild population of nearly 450 toque monkeys, Macaca sinica, of Sri Lanka, based on 3¬Ω years of continuous, plus 3 years of intermittent study. Under relatively stable ecological conditions troops fluctuated in size within limits, and the net growth of the population was zero (R0 = 1). Decrease in food supply caused a net decrease in population size. An abundant food supply stimulated population growth. A lifetable indicated that mortality differed markedly according to age and sex, and that this pattern was not attributable to predation or disease alone. Behavioral analysis revealed that 81.5% of all threats occurred during foraging. Threatened individuals were prevented from feeding, and their foods were usurped directly in 36% of all threat interactions. The observed frequency of threats between age-sex classes during foraging differed significantly from two progressively stronger null hypotheses. These hypotheses took into account, respectively, the age-sex distribution of the society, and the frequencies of nearest neighbor associations between animals of different age and sex. The agonistic discrimination between animals of different age and sex was mirrored by a similar affiliative discrimination. Some conclusions of this analysis were that adults dominated the juveniles which in turn dominated the infants, and among juveniles and infants males dominated their female peers. Adults likewise discriminated against the young females. The behavioral relationships during foraging influenced the foraging efficiency of animals, which was measured by the amount of time spent in foraging, feeding rates, and the quality of foods that were consumed. By these measures adult males fared best, then adult females, then juvenile males, and juvenile females fared worst. I proposed that as a consequence of these behaviorally imposed feeding efficiencies, young animals died at greater rates than adults, and infant and juvenile females died at greater rates than their male peers; behaviorally mediated access to other resources is likely to influence mortality in a similar manner. During the mating season, threatening and wounding increased markedly among adult and subadult males that competed for mates and that migrated. The peak of migration rates in males occurred during the subadult phase and coincided with the peak of mortality in males. This suggested that the rigors of migration (low priority of access to resources and frequent wounding) underlie the observed mortality. Mortality in adult males was (1) less than in subadult males which migrated more frequently, and (2) greater than in adult females which do not migrate. Competition between troops, in part, determines the amount of food available per troop, and thereby contributes to setting the upper limit to troop size. The molding of the age-sex structure is then determined by social processess within a troop. I hypothesized that the effects of social behavior (mainly aggressive and affiliative behaviors) and possibly its nature, change in accordance with the age and sex distribution of the society, its density, and available resources. Social behavior determines, through socially imposed mortality, the age and sex distribution and density of the society (and hence the population) in such a way as to maximize the reproductive success of some of its members, and results in bringing the society (and population) towards an equilibrium state (R0 = 1) with the resources and non-socially imposed mortality. ¬© 1977, Brill.

abstract={Jejunoileal bypass surgery for obesity is being performed frequently. Although voices of caution continue, the relative success reported by others, plus favorable psychiatric reports, suggests that the operation has achieved respectability. It is imperative to remember, however, that this procedure is by no means a benign curative surgical intervention. It is fraught with hazards for all who undertake it and fatal for a significant few. A few words of caution are therefore in order. The operation seems indicated at this time only for those in whom the obesity itself or some associated illness is sufficiently life threatening to justify the surgical and postsurgical risks; life long followup is essential; nutritional deficiency states must be looked for and treated vigorously, and vitamin and mineral supplements are necessary; the operative and postoperative risks suggest that only larger centers with adequate supportive care facilities undertake the surgery; a great deal more research is necessary before the side effects of jejunoileal bypass surgery and its ultimate benefits will be fully understood.},

abstract={This paper reviews a number of papers dealing with varying concepts and attitudes towards alcohol and legal responsibility. No attempt is made to clarify and simplify legal attitudes which defy such arbitrary handling, nor is there exploration of the very detailed and complex subjects of behavior disorders and criminality and the many facets of alcoholism, particularly in the light of current knowledge and classifications. Alcoholism is a reflection of social custom and individual tolerance. Alcoholism is a character or personality disorder. Alcoholism involves an acute reversible poisoning of the brain, or it may involve a spectrum of permanent brain damage. Alcohol aggravates an array of personality disorders, brain damage from other causes, explosive personality, episodic dyscontrol, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and almost every other mental or neurologic disease. The use of alcohol may result in head injury (falls and accidents). It may cause amnesia, blackouts, and grayouts. It may cause cirrhosis, malnutrition, esophageal varices, and varied neuropathies. Alcoholism is compounded by other drug and chemical intake, other illnesses, and the use of medication. Even when alcoholism is chronic, with fixed physical damage, it is characterized by transient events which are not demonstrable at a later time when evaluation is necessary. Alcoholism is compatible with the many facets of criminality in an associative rather than a causative fashion. At the very least, it interferes with ordinary judgment and neurological integrity. Evaluation of alcoholic problems is therefore one of the most complex problems facing the medical psychiatric examiner who is called for a clinical appraisal and who is asked to communicate findings in a reasonable, pragmatic fashion.},

abstract={Experiment 1 tested the generality of Carlton's hypothesis that central muscarinic cholinergic pathways are involved in habituation of exploration. The effects of 3 muscarinic antagonists were tested in a holeboard, under 2 test conditions, i.e. with objects absent or present. Both the frequency and the duration of head-dipping were used as measures of exploration. Scopolamine prevented habituation only of the frequency of head-dipping, and only when objects were present. Atropine and benzhexol did not impair the habituation of either frequency or duration of head-dipping in either test condition. The impairment of habituation seemed therefore to be specific to scopolamine, and to the more complex test condition, and thus there was little to justify the suggestion that central cholinergic paths were generally involved. Experiment 2 investigated the effects of muscarinic antagonists on habituation of distraction. None of the drugs affected the distraction to tones, nor the subsequent habituation to these stimuli. Central cholinergic paths do not therefore seem to be involved in habituation of this behavioural response. ¬© 1976.},

The enhancement of intake was further influenced by the schedule of saccharin preexposures in the absence of variations in the amount of solution tasted (Exp IV). The effect was not a function of the opportunity for Ss to determine their own pattern of contact with the saccharin flavor, the opportunity for association of the flavor with hunger and thirst reduction, or the amount of saccharin swallowed during preexposure (Exp V). Results suggest that mere exposure to a flavored solution is sufficient to increase subsequent intakes. The phenomenon is discussed in terms of the attenuation of neophobia elicited by the novelty of flavored solutions.

Hunger considerably shortens the preferable duration of pressing or leads to the appearance of an additional mode on the PDH.

Behavioral assessments of the newborn are being increasingly utilized to evaluate effects of intrauterine experiences, such as fetal malnutrition, exposure to alcohol and drugs, obstetric procedures such as maternal anesthesia and analgesia, cesarean section, as well as the effects of technics in neonatal management, such as phototherapy and drugs. Behavioral assessments can give us insights into individual differences among neonates and cross-cultural differences among groups of newborns. Behavioral assessments over time will give us insight into a baby's capacity to adapt to his environment and to overcome the physiologic stresses of delivery. We can begin to assess a baby's potential availability for processing information necessary to future progress. It may predict to his capacity to capture the attachment energies of his environment as well. In its most limited use, neonatal behavior becomes a sensitive indicator of the integrity of the central nervous system. In a more general sense, behavioral responses can be tied to other responses to reflect the integrity of the whole organism. And, eventually, the infant's capacity for total responses can become a measure of prediction for the response of the environment to him. Thus, behavioral assessment in the neonatal period can predict to at-riskness in the infant himself and to deficits in his environment as he becomes a participant in parent-infant interaction. Evaluation of a baby's abilities to respond and style of response provides the clinician with a powerful tool in his role of helping parents to foster a child's physical and emotional wellbeing. The pattern of recovery of his potential for behavior over the first week becomes the most important way of predicting not only to his immediate coping capacity but to his future reactions to stress. Thus, several assessments in the perinatal period become of significance. It is important now to follow up our neonatal behavioral assessment with behavioral assessments throughout the first year of life to begin to understand how developiental processes include both the infant's capabilities and those of his environment, as well as the relationship between them. This will give us a better handle on our goals to optimize emotional as well as physical development in our work with parents and their infants. ¬© 1976, Year Book Medical Publishers, Inc..

abstract={In contrast to wild rats the percentage of animals showing predatory behavior is very low among laboratory rats. Stimulation of this specific drive by systemic drug application has been mentioned only for pCPA and Œî9 tetrahydrocannabinol. As detailed investigations concerning this stimulating property of pCPA are not published, the effect was studied in selected non biting rats (without starvation and isolation) regarding dose and time dependence after single and repeated drug administration; further, D and L isomers of pCPA were included in the investigation. After single oral application of 200 to 3200 mg/kg DL pCPA a dose dependent stimulation of predatory behavior was found. Smaller doses (200 or 400 mg/kg PO) given repeatedly on 3 consecutive days showed effects comparable with those after single administration of much higher doses (1600 or 3200 mg/kg PO). With repeated oral application of 50, 100 or 200 mg/kg on 10 consecutive days no difference was found between D and L pCPA concerning efficacy and time course of drug effect. Both after single and repeated administration in all series of tests the effect reached its maximum not before several days and faded almost completely in the drug free after period. D methamphetamine HCl, investigated comparatively as a CNS stimulant, provoked no predatory behavior in a wide dose range (0.125 to 8.0 mg/kg PO) with repeated administration on 10 consecutive days. Within the control groups (total number of rats = 100) no animal showed predatory attack during an observation period of at least 3 wk.},

Digital simulation results for each model are presented and the effect of parameter variations on model behaviour is investigated While no attempt is made at formal validation, model behaviour is compared to that observed in nature.

abstract={Observed and scored the behavior of intact rats and rats with chronic gastric fistulas during a 60-min test period when they were offered liquid diet after 17 hr of food deprivation. The same 5 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were employed in 2 experiments. Intact Ss and Ss with closed fistulas displayed a specific behavioral sequence at the end of each meal: They stopped eating, engaged in grooming and exploration for a short time, and then rested or slept. Thus, a fixed behavioral sequence characterized satiety in Ss. Although the behavioral sequence of satiety was fixed, the cessation of feeding was not a sufficient condition for the appearance of the rest of the sequence: Quinine adulteration of the liquid diet stopped sham feeding but did not elicit the complete sequence. Intraperitoneal injection of the intestinal hormone cholecystokinin during sham feeding, however, elicited the complete sequence of satiety. The observation that cholecystokinin not only stopped feeding but elicited the complete sequence of satiety supports the hypothesis that endogenous cholecystokinin is a satiety signal for the rat.

abstract={Investigated behavioral correlates of selective disruption of hippocampal output in a series of 5 experiments. A total of 136 male albino Moll-Wistar rats were used as Ss. In 2 experiments an attempt was made through behavioral investigation to determine whether the CA1 neurons project to the fimbria or to the subiculum. Results support recent views that the subiculum is the recipient of CA1 axons. Disruption of the CA1 output in the dorsal hippocampus of Ss produced increased open-field activity, whereas passive avoidance and spontaneous alternation behaviors remained unchanged. No differentiation was obtained between CA1 damage and neocortical lesions in maze learning. Blocking of the fimbrial CA3 output from the dorsal hippocampus improved passive avoidance performance and impaired active avoidance performance, whereas open-field and spontaneous alternation behaviors were unaffected. Interruptions of the CA3 output from the ventral hippocampus improved active avoidance performance and reduced spontaneous alternation behavior. Open-field behavior and passive avoidance performance remained unchanged. Total fimbrial sections increased open-field activity, improved passive and active avoidance, and reduced spontaneous alternation. Results are discussed in terms of functional differentiation between the CA1 and CA3 of the dorsal hippocampus aknd in terms of functional in the fimbrial CA3 output from the dorsal and ventral hippocampus.

Rats pre-exposed to the free food container before being tested for responding in the presence of free food performed no differently from rats which did not receive this pre-exposure.

abstract={This chapter mainly focuses on the concepts in the regulation of food intake and the progress in the knowledge of nutrition, the importance of food, water, and nutrition for the survival of a living element and also the processes that take place during food intake. Nutrition consists of many biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes, all of them interlocked and geared to the specific function that is the survival of each animal. Food exists in the external environment. To obtain food requires a sense of need or appetite. Appetite or drive sets an animal in search for food. This requires locomotion, exploration, and examination. Recognition of food is made possible by the chemical senses. The animal must choose an adequate diet in accordance with its needs. Information about food in the external environment is integrated in the brain with information on bodily needs, leading to a choice of food best suited to the survival of the animal. The chapter covers topics like early concepts in the regulation of food intake, appetite, hunger, drive, urges for food, the gastrointestinal tract and regulation of food intake, role of adipose tissues in regulation of food intake, alimentary behavior, processing of food: flavors; obesity: impairment of regulation of food intake; diet and span of life. ¬© 1975, Academic Press, Inc.},

Animals which had experienced zinc deficiency avoided shock less well than the offspring of pair-fed control dams. The offspring of pair-fed dams avoided shock less well than animals which were the product of normal pregnancy. Response latencies were inferior in the zinc-defi-cient group, whereas intertrial responses were less on both the previous zinc-deficient and intrauterine starved animals. Zinc is essential for development of the brain. Fetuses of women who consume inadequate amounts of zinc during pregnancy may be at risk as far as intrauterine brain development and body growth are concerned.

Colonies of rats have been maintained for twelve generations on diets adequate (dietary-protein energy:total metabolizable energy (NDp:E) 0¬∑I) or marginally deficient in protein (NDp:E 0¬∑068) 2. In the malnourished colony, the proportion of ‚Äòsmall-for-gestational-age‚Äô offspring was ten times as high as amongst the well-nourished colony, growth was slow, sexual maturation delayed, especially in the females, and, when adult, both sexes were significantly lighter and shorter than adults of the well-nourished colony. Organs, other than the eye, weighed less than those of well-nourished ‚Äòage‚Äô controls, but when expressed relative to body-weight, the brain, pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, testes, thymus and eyes were larger, the pancreas unchanged and the kidneys smaller than those of the well-nourished ‚Äòage‚Äô controls. The relative weight of the liver showed little change, being slightly increased in the males and, like the ovaries, slightly reduced in the females. On a body-weight basis, the brains were about 50% heavier than normal, but in absolute terms were 5‚Äì5¬∑5% lighter than those of the well-nourished animals, the cerebellum (10¬∑5% lighter in males and 12¬∑9% lighter in females) being more severely affected than the cerebrum (4% lighter) 3. The young malnourished rats showed increased exploratory activity, transient head tremors and an increased sensitivity to noise, the latter being long-lasting if not permanent. When adult, they showed marked differences in behaviour and learning patterns and it was difficult to attract and hold their attention. In situations demanding a choice the animals were very excited, emitted loud squeals and tried to escape from what was clearly a stressful situation. However, a casual examination of the malnourished adults revealed a rather small, badly groomed, excitable rat without gross abnormalities 4.

abstract={The literature on child neglect is reviewed from the viewpoint of anthropology, sociology, social work, psychology and psychiatry and the findings are discussed under the headings of: definition; prevalence; etiology; sequelae; prevention and detection; treatment. Child abuse and child neglect are linked in lay, professional and legal thinking, but the study revealed much more attention and activity in the former area. The latter lacked even an agreed upon definition. To fill the gap the following working definition was proposed: 'a condition in which someone responsible for the child either deliberately or by extraordinary inattentiveness permits the child to experience avoidable present suffering and/or fails to provide one or more of the ingredients generally deemed essential for developing a person's physical, intellectual and emotional capacities'. Estimates of prevalence varied widely, e.g., 9.6 v 1.5/100,000 in adjacent and very comparable states: up to one million children in the U.S.A. Also lacking was any confirmation of the assumption that the prevalence was on the increase. Most studies placed the ratio of neglect to abuse at 3 to 1 or above. Etiological theories abounded: sociological and cultural and intrapersonal. Living in poverty was seen, if not causative, at least contributory to this condition. Class differences in child rearing and values attendant on children were explored as was the role of the breakdown of the nuclear family. Even in the area of parental pathology good studies were few, indicating, though inconclusively, the generational component in mothering incapacity: neglected child, neglectful parent, neglecting family. It also indicated high risk situations: the drug addict mother, alcoholism in one or both parents, infantile and immature personalities and psychiatrically disturbed individuals. The consequences of neglect vary with degree to the very serious and appear in nutritional damage to the brain, its cell count size and biochemistry. Emotional sequelae include the consequences of maternal deprivation, cognitive deficit and anti social behaviour. The neglected child is thus physically and intellectually disadvantaged, aloof, anxious, and chronically depressed but prone to aggressive and even dramatically brutal anti social acts. Preventive intervention includes available and publicized reporting centres, attention to separate rights for children, emphasis on family planning and day care resources. Treatment review concentrates on case work: identification and fact finding; decision making; guidance; information and counselling and individual therapy. Recognizing the difficulties of intervention, the conditions under which placement might be required are reviewed. Reference is made to other modalities, including group and family techniques, self help and social action groups, mental health contribution and the value of supplemental parenting (day care) or alternative living arrangements, including simultaneous admission of family and child to hospital. Much of the material is of necessity impressionistic. It is surprising how little is well established about this condition, be it in causality, consequences or preferred interventions.

Calorie restriction reduced activity. Rearing affected exploratory behavior more than did diet, but double restriction in protein and rearing produced particularly severe impairment.},

abstract={Groups of rats were depleted of norepinephrine (using 6-OHDA), of serotonin (using chronic PCPA), or of both, and were tested on a variety of behavioral tasks. 6-OHDA treated rats and PCPA treated rats showed different and in many cases opposed behavioral syndromes, but animals which received both drugs generally showed the greatest behavioral disruptions. Animals receiving PCPA showed decreased locomotion (freezing) in quiet novel environments but increased locomotion when stimulated, as well as increased shock elicited aggression. Rats receiving 6-OHDA showed an initially decreased rate of rearing in open field and decreased sucrose consumption when food deprived. The results are discussed in terms of the reserpine model of depression. ¬© 1974 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Drugs produce a variety of effects on performance, on the formation of memories, and on their retrieval. One of these effects is state dependent learning. To study state dependent learning, investigators commonly use a 2 x 2 experimental design in which 4 groups are first trained and then tested for recall under the conditions N-N, N-D, D-N, and D-D, respectively (N = no drug, D = drug). However, this design generally does not provide sufficient data to allow an evaluation of the relative strengths of the various possible drug effects. As a result, impaired performance caused by other drug effects is frequently attributed to state dependent learning and vice versa. The limitations of this design are discussed and alternative strategies are proposed. If a drug produces only a weak state dependent learning effect, learned behaviors may be made contingent on the drug state by a 'drug discrimination' training procedure. Such procedures are currently being used to answer a variety of questions about drug actions on the brain. This paper discusses available experimental methods, with emphasis on methods for deriving dose response relationships, on the interpretation of transfer test results, on methods that allow quantitative and qualitative comparisons of the discriminable effects of various drugs, and on the limitations of each method. It is concluded that drug discrimination procedures are less prone to yield erroneous conclusions than is the 2 x 2 experimental design. Data obtained with rats in a shock escape T maze task are presented to illustrate some of the properties and limitations of drug discrimination procedures.},

abstract={An effective state of malnutrition was imposed on rat pups throughout their postnatal period of development by feeding the lactating dams a 12% casein diet. Controls were fed a 24% casein diet. The malnourished pups exhibited such signs of retarded physical development as reduced body growth and delayed eye opening. At weaning brain weights were reduced and regional brain analysis revealed distortions of chemical composition. These changes included a general reduction of cholesterol concentration, decreased cerebellar DNA content (indicative of cell number), and reduced telencephalic and brain stem protein: DNA ratios (reflecting cell size). The cerebellum also displayed reduced AChE activity suggesting an appreciable effect on its synaptic elements, particularly involving the cholinergic system. Brain stem concentrations of 5-HT and 5-HIAA were increased, implying activation of the central serotonergic neurohumoral system. Possibly related to this, a concomitant increase of adrenal corticosterone was revealed, implicating the additional involvement of the pituitary-adrenal axis in the consequences of postnatal malnutrition. Behaviorally, the previously malnourished weanlings displayed a state of heightened 'emotionality'. Their performance in a 2-way shuttle task was also markedly abnormal. It is proposed that the enhanced activation of the brain stem serotonergic system may, at least partially, underlie the state of heightened 'emotionality', which is the most characteristic behavioral manifestation of perinatal malnutrition. ¬© 1974.},

abstract={Three groups of male hooded rats were preoperatively matched and then sham operated (SHAM), bilaterally lateral olfactory tract lesioned or anterior olfactory nucleus/anterior commissure lesioned. In one experiment, spontaneous behavior patterns emitted in an exploration field containing different odors were quantified during satiated and food deprived conditions. In other experiments, flinch and jump thresholds to electric shock and running patterns in an appetitively motivated straight alley experiment were measured. All lesioned animals were hyperactive and typically froze and groomed less than SHAMs while sniffing and rearing patterns differentiated the lesioned and SHAM groups in several ways. All animals had similar flinch and jump thresholds and also emitted similar types of responses to electric shock. In the straight alley, odors from normal and stressed rats had little effect on the running time of the experimental animals while a faint cat odor strongly inhibited SHAM running behavior. Responses to a novel chemical odor (trimethylpentane) and to changes in the alley floor or electric shock applied to the floor were minimal in all animals. The results were discussed against a background of other olfactory system lesions and some evidence separating the effects of olfactory cues from nonolfactory lesion effects was presented. Finally, problems associated with tests for olfactory discrimination were discussed. A need for more rigorous and specific discrimination tests in behavioral studies involving anosmia was emphasized. ¬© 1974.},

abstract={The spontaneous behavior patterns of four matched groups of male hooded rats were compared to SHAMs following different anosmia producing techniques. One group was peripherally blocked with lidocaine (XYL), and another with zinc sulphate (Zn). Two operated groups were either centrally deafferented (LB) or sustained olfactory bulb and peduncle destruction (DB). The lesioned and particularly DB animals were hyperactive and reared more than the other groups. Xyls were similar to SHAMs on most measures but many developed unusual locomotor patterns and Zns were hypoactive, reared less and groomed and froze more than all other groups. Food deprivation increased activity and rearing and decreased freezing and grooming in all groups but most intergroup differences were maintained. Some problems associated with anosmia tests were discussed and a technique to distinguish lesion induced anosmia from lesion side effects was investigated. Lesions tended to increase activity, rearing frequency and possibly sniffing frequency somewhat independently of anosmia whereas grooming and possibly freezing changes were more closely related to olfactory cue changes. A second experiment revealed that most of the zinc sulphate effects were due to systemic poisoning. Consequently, the common practice of comparing central and peripheral anosmia producing techniques to demonstrate olfactory deficits aside from lesion effects may be misleading. ¬© 1974.},

During repeated exposures on the same day in a rectangular observation box, UN rats moved about more and reared on their hind legs more often than controls, but defecated less frequently. Two measures of exploratory behavior, tendency to emerge from a familiar to an unfamiliar area and responsiveness to a novel object, did not differentiate the 2 groups, nor did control and UN rats differ in the rate at which they pressed a lever to produce a light stimulus in a dark Skinner box. These and other long‚Äêterm, activity studies indicate that previously undernourished rats are more active than controls in familiar, nonstressful situations.

These include: long bouts of excited feeding immediately after food is made available; examining and pecking moving targets and novel objects; persistent scanning, and inhibition of other behavior in a novel environment. Deaf birds behave precisely like controls, so that possible auditory deficits are not involved. During calling phases significant visual stimuli are treated as if they were startling or conspicuous. Conversely, continuous examination of a stimulus causes calling to diminish or disappear even though response continues; a brief period when the stimulus is not seen causes calling to begin again when it is once more perceived. In addition to the increased effectiveness of relevant visual stimuli, motor facilitation is usual in calling phases, as is inhibition of irrelevant responses. Emotional behavior in man and other mammals is compared to calling phases in the chick.},

abstract={Two exploratory studies were undertaken to investigate the role of certain variables on children's responses to TV advertisements for food products. In the first study, both the child and mother were interviewed; in the second study, children only were studied. The dependent variables studied were the child's reported preference for food advertised on TV and the actual consumption of snack foods over a 24-hour period. There was interaction among a number of different variables including the child's age, sex, the ability of the child's mother to discern the validity of nutritional information presented in advertisements, the amount of time the mother and child spent viewing TV together, the child's attitude to ads, the frequency of the mother and child grocery shopping together, and the frequency with which the child requests that the mother purchase foods seen on TV. The use of the entire family as the unit of analysis is suggested to provide the opportunity for the study of many variables and their interaction in an ecological framework. ¬© 1974, Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior.

abstract={In regulating the internal homeostatic environment mammals, by necessity, employ behavioral strategies that differ from the tactics used in coping with contingencies in the external environment. When an animal consumes a meal, the palatability of that meal is automatically adjusted in accordance with the ultimate internal effects of that meal. If the meal causes toxicosis, the animal acquires an aversion for the taste of the meal; conversely, if recuperation follows ingestion of the meal, the taste of that meal is enhanced. Unlike the learning that occurs when externally referred visual and auditory signals are followed by punishment in the form of peripheral pain or reward in the form of food in the mouth, conditioning to the homeostatic effects of food can occur in a single trial and rarely requires more than three to five trials, even though the ultimate effects of the meal are delayed for hours. Paradoxically, the animal need not be aware of the ultimate internal effect in the same sense that it is aware of external contingencies. For example, an aversion can be acquired even if the animal is unconscious when the agent of illness is administered. Thus, the way in which food-effects are stored in memory may be fundamentally different from the way in which memories of specific time-space strategies devised for external contingencies are stored. This separation of function is indicated by limbic lesions which disrupt conditioning to a buzzer that is followed by shock and facilitate conditioning to a taste that is followed by illness. Operationally speaking, one can describe both aversion conditioning and buzzer-shock conditioning in the spacetime associationistic terms of classical conditioning. However, psychologically speaking, one must realize that in aversion conditioning the animal does not act as if it were acquiring an "if-then" strategy. It acts as if a hedonic shift, or a change in the incentive value of the flavor were taking place. Such hedonic shifts are critical in regulation of the internal milieu. When an animal is in need of calories, food tends to be more palatable; as the caloric deficit is restored, food becomes less palatable. If the animal's body temperature is below optimum, a warm stimulus applied to the skin is pleasant. When body temperature is too high, the converse is true. In this way, homeostatic states monitored by internal receptors produce changes in the incentive values of external stimuli sensed by the peripheral receptors, and guide feeding behavior. In mammals at least, the gustatory system, which provides sensory control of feeding, sends fibers to the nucleus solitarius. This brainstem relay station also receives fibers from the viscera and the internal monitors of the area postrema. Ascending fibers bifurcate at the level of the pons and project toward the feeding areas of the hypothalamus and the cortex. The olfactory system which primarily projects to the limbic system does not play a primary role in adjusting food incentives. Rather, it plays a secondary role in the activation of feeding, as do other external sensory systems. This specialized conditioning mechanism, which specifically adjusts gustatory hedonic values through delayed visceral feedback, is widespread among animals, including man and rat. These two species are remarkably similar in their thresholds and preferences for gustatory stimuli. The behavioral similarities are based on the animals' having similar gustatory systems, similar convergence of gustatory and internal afferents to the nucleus solitarius, and similar midbrain regulatory mechanisms. Thus, it is not surprising that the feeding of obese rats with internal hypothalamic damage resembles the feeding of obese human beings insensitive to the internal signs of this caloric state. Obviously, man has a highly specialized form of symbolic communication and the rat does not, yet man's cognitive specialization does not prevent him from developing aversions to food consumed before illness even when he knows that his illness was not caused by food (43).},

abstract={Prenatal undernutrition has a serious effect on the growth and development of the central nervous system of the fetus. This may be secondary to maternal undernutrition or to impaired fetal nutrition, such as placental insufficiency, with normal maternal nutrition. It is uncertain if mild undernutrition in a previously well nourished mother would have serious effects on a child. Undernutrition early in infancy has permanent effects on the growth and development of the central nervous system and on CNS function for years afterward. This has been demonstrated in animals as well as in humans. Because there is a tremendous growth in the central nervous system during the first 6 to 12 months of life in the human, this is a critical period for permanent organic effects on the brain. There is little data that undernutrition after l year of age permanently affects the central nervous system in terms of decreased cell number, cell size, or DNA composition. Nutritional deficiencies after l yr of life do affect the ability of the child to learn, to attend, and to sustain interest in learning tasks. This is compounded by an increased rate of infections in the undernourished child. Such deficits in learning may be reversed by nutritional intervention. Children who are retarded or brain damaged prenatally or perinatally may not grow well. The basis for impaired growth may be a condition affecting brain function and may be treatable or remediable. Feeding difficulties, common in the physically handicapped child, may need intervention to increase intake and absorption. Poor growth, not due to an organic cause, may be associated with abuse, emotional deprivation, neglect, rejection of the child, or poverty. Nutritional problems not based on an organic etiology are signs of a more pervasive pattern of suboptimal parental care. The causes may be economical or social but most often, in the US, are associated with psychic or social dysfunction. Protein and calorie deprivation during the period of rapid brain growth causes central nervous system damage. In societies in which breast feeding is still accepted, serious undernutrition does not occur in early infancy. Insistence on early and regular evaluations of the infant could assure assistance for any child who is not growing well in infancy. High risk children, particularly small for gestation babies, should be kept under careful professional surveillance. Inasmuch as learning ability, perceptual abilities, and attention span have been related to nutritional deficits, we must provide adequate nutrition to children in our society. Nutrition, diet, and feeding affect and are affected by pathology or deviations in all arenas of life: biologic, social, and psychic.},

abstract={Investigated the effects of bilateral lesions of the anterodorsal caudate nuclei on reactivity in 5 experiments with male albino Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats. In the open-field apparatus, Ss with caudate lesions were more active, showed increased thigmotaxism, defecated more, and groomed less. Exp II showed that in a nonstressful situation Ss with caudate lesions defecated no more than those with cortical lesion or unoperated Ss. Under stressful conditions Ss with caudate lesions defecated significantly more than the control Ss. Exps III, IV, and V indicated that Ss with lesions of the caudate nucleus were hyperresponsive to conditions of illumination and food deprivation. It is suggested that the heightened reactivity of the caudate-damaged Ss reflects the role of the caudate nucleus in the modulation of CNS arousal mechanisms. (52 ref.)

abstract={Mechanistic principles from engineering, meteorology, and soil physics are integrated with ecology and physiology to develop models for prediction of animal behavior. The Mojave Desert biome and the desert iguana are used to illustrate these principles. A transient energy balance model for animals in an outdoor environment is presented. The concepts and relationships have been tested in a wind tunnel, in a simulated desert, and in the field. The animal model requires anatomical information and knowledge of the thermoregulatory responses of the animal. The micrometeorological model requires only basic meteorological parameters and two soil physical properties as inputs. Tests of the model in the field show agreement between predicted and measured temperatures above and below the surface of about 2 to 3¬∞C. The animal and micrometeorological models are combined to predict daily and seasonal activity patterns, available times for predator-prey interaction, and daily, seasonal and annual requirements for food and water. It is shown that food, water and the thermal environment can limit animal activity, and furthermore, the controlling limit changes with season. Actual observations of activity patterns and our predictions show close agreement, in many cases, and pose intriguing questions in those situations where agreement does not exist. This type of modeling can be used to further study predator-prey interactions, to study how changes in the environment might affect animal behavior, and to answer other important ecological and physiological questions. ¬© 1973 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={1. An animal's behaviour represents part of its ecological adaptation to the environment (inanimate surroundings, food, enemies, conspecifics and animals of other species). 2. In the case of feeding, plankton filter feeders are referred to which exhibit identical activity periods, the same choice of habitats and comparable types of movement during feeding; this parallelism is interpreted as adaptation to the mode of nourishment. Similarity in feeding behaviour is indicative of convergent development. In ophiurids, water-current filtration appears to be an ancient physlogenetic characteristic. It is present in numerous species, indicating that this type of behaviour is homologous. Garden eels (Heterocongridae) are also plankton feeders. Their mode of feeding reveals analogies to that of marine benthonic invertebrates. Fishes which feed on sea urchins exemplify adaptations to prey capture and enemy avoidance. Sea urchins have developed adaptive protections against being preyed upon; these tend to result in escaping potential predators or preventing contact with them. Nocturnal activity appears to be an adaptation leading to enemy avoidance. Behaviour patterns of predators are described and compared. Preying on sea urchins appears to be a convergent development based on pre-adaptations in behaviour patterns and morphological structures. Particular adaptations are always based on characteristics already present. 3. Social behaviour is also part of the ecological adaptation of an animal to its environment. The social behaviour of the Pomacentridae is cited as example. Studies on the monogamous anemone fish Amphiprion bicinctus showed that its well-developed aggressive behaviour to both conspecifics and non-conspecifics can be easily released. A. bicinctus drives away all large fishes from its territory, including predators of the anemone. Well-developed intraspecific aggression necessitates effective aggression inhibition with respect to the sexual partner. The potential aggression of one member of the pair must be continually neutralised by submissive behaviour on the part of its mate. Members of a pair recognise each other individually. In situ experiments showed that they recognise the partner mainly through visual characteristics. Comparison of social behaviour in A. bicinctus with that of other pomacentrids should reveal adaptations to life in the narrow confines of the sea anemone. 4. Butterfly fishes (Chaetodontidae), which live in coral reefs, are monogamous. Their social structure and conspicuous coloration are considered as adaptations to extremely high species densities (up to 14 sympatric species), which are ecologically specialised in various ways. Continual monogamy and conspicuous coloration enable sympatric species to live in the same environment. The difference in coloration between the juveniles and adults is considered species camouflage, a mechanism enabling the juveniles to survive and reach maturity within the home range of the adults. ¬© 1973 Biologischen Anstalt Helgoland.},

abstract={Previous studies of the effects of early undernutrition on behavior in adult rats have confounded underfeeding with maternal deprivation or membership in a large litter. In the present experiment food‚Äêdeprived rats received full‚Äêtime maternal care and lived in the same‚Äêsized litters as well‚Äêfed controls. In contrast to previous findings food‚Äêdeprived animals in the present study did not differ from controls in the open‚Äêfield test, in a test of motor coordination, and in 2 learning tasks. However, food‚Äêdeprived animals were more active than controls in a residential plus maze. Females showed less effect of food deprivation on body growth, but a much greater effect on activity, than males. These findings suggest that early undernutrition when not confounded with social and maternal deprivation may have more restricted effects on adult behavior than has been previously believed.

No significant changes in brain or spinal cord were observed with light microscopy. Behavioral tests revealed that experimental animals had more frequent feeding with smaller meal size, increased activity in the presence of environmental stimulation, fewer errors in learning spatial discrimination reversals, and more errors in problemsolving maze tests. Activity in dark environment, bar pressing for food on a progressive ratio schedule, and foot shock avoidance conditioning showed no significant difference between control and experimental groups.

abstract={Threatening cocks may suddenly peck at the ground, pick up a food grain and swallow it. The occurrence of a feeding pattern during threat appears to be out of context and seems functionally irrelevant. Kruiijt (1964) concluded from his data that ground pecking in threatening cocks is caused by disinhibition of feeding, in addition to which redirection of aggression plays a role. He further suggested that the occurrence of ground pecking depends on the ratio of the tendencies to attack and to escape. As this interpretation appears to be unsatisfactory in some respects, a further analysis of ground pecking in agonistic situations in junglefowl cocks was undertaken. In a controlled experimental environment the birds were tested singly or with an opponent. The agonistic situation was varied: cither two strange adult cocks were separated by a wire partition,, so that they showed mainly side display, or a number of cockerels developing a rank order and showing predominantly frontal display wene allowed to move freely in the test cage. Food deprivation conditions and eliciting stimuli for ground pecking were manipulated. The frequency of ground pecking varied from one situation to another, independently of the hunger-state, when this was kept constant and low. Attempts to find ‚Äî by studying correlation between ground pecking and other behaviour patterns in the performer ‚Äî¬∑ one or a restricted number of factors responsible for these variations were unsuccessful. Though ground pecking was negatively correlated with alarm behaviour and positively correlated with aggressive responses {e.g. kicking/j limping and raising of the feathers)! its occurrence was not sufficiently defined by these correlations. Attempts to find correlations with behaviour of the opponent only revealed distance as a variable affecting the peck frequency, but this variable proved to be only sufficient to explain a small part of the variation. It was finally concluded that within certain limits ground pecking occurs under a rather wide variety of conditions, with respect to the behavioural context, both of the pecking bird itself and of the opponent (Chapter III). Experiments on the influence of food deprivation show that factors controlling feeding behaviour affect ground pecking in agonistic situations, e.g. during frontal display and during side display (Chapter II). However, these factors only express their influence when particles associated with food intake are present. These may be food, sand (which becomes associated with food intake because chickens often find their food in sand), or small polythene particles, associated with food intake through an operant conditioning procedure (experiment 14). When the particles have not previously been associated with food intake ground pecks nevertheless occur, but these are hunger-independent. These hunger-independent pecks were observed in untrained birds pecking at the small polythene particles, when they were single as well as with an opponent, but more so during side display than in periods without threat or in isolation, Thus, factors associated with agonistic behaviour can cause ground pecks independently of factors controlling feeding. Some hunger-independent pecks can be considered as exploratory pecks, but in the presence of an opponent ground pecks occur, which are exclusively under the control of factors associated with agonistic behaviour. These results show that different motivational systems influence ground pecking either separately or together (Chapter IV). It has been attempted to explain the result that several different complexes of Controlling factors lead to ground pecking by assuming that not the control by these factors, but the performance of ground pecking is essential and that the performer executes ground pecks as an operant to manipulate its motivational state. Cocks were placed on a floor without sand or other particles. Ground pecks disappeared and ‚Äî compared with cocks on a floor with sand ‚Äî more alert looking around and less kicking/jumping and aggressive pecking during fights were shown. It is argued {e.g. on the basis of a control experiment with hirds without an opponent) that the increase in alarm behaviour could not be attributed to a direct effect of the absence of sand in the environment, but to the impossibility to perform ground pecks, because of the absence of eliciting stimuli. It is concluded that the performance of ground pecks leads to a reduction in alarm and an increase in aggressive behaviour in agonistic situations. Ground pecks are thought to have a direct feedback effect on the pecking bird itself. By producing changes in the tendencies to show alarm and/or aggressive behaviour, ground pecking may help to maintain the motivational state, so that ongoing behaviour can continue. It will have evolved in agonistic situations, because here the continuation of displays has often survival value. It is suggested that the birds learn to perform ground pecks, when this leads to favourable changes in motivation. As an ojierant response ground pecking can occur in different agonistic contexts, e.g. during frontal display and during side display (drive generalization). The occurrence of ground scratching closely linked with ground pecking can be considered as response generalization. The addition of vigorous hill heating to the normal pecking movements can be identified with the concept of induction in the literature on operant conditioning. ¬© 1973, Brill. All rights reserved.},

Groups of pullets deprived of calcium in large cages showed significant increases in spontaneous activity; both as measured by complete body movements and also as pecking activity. Deprived birds, but not controls, were observed engaging in an aberrant behaviour pattern, 'air pecking'. When the response of birds to various stimulus objects in an arena was tested, calcium deprivation resulted in significantly increased pecking activity, but it was not preferentially directed towards a potential calcium source and the pattern of pecking was similar to that observed in the controls. It did not prove possible to relate this increased activity to raised parathyroid hormone levels, and the fact that a similar increase in activity was seen under sodium deprivation suggests that the phenomenon may be of more general occurrence. ¬© 1973.},

abstract={Eighty‚Äêthree C3H mice were reared in litters of 2 or 8 pups until weaning and, thereafter, in isolation or in bisexual groups of 8‚Äê10 animals in a Litter Size √ó Postweaning Experience √ó Sex factorial design. At 70‚Äê75 days of age, subjects were tested in a modified version of the open‚Äêfield test, designed to overcome some of the reported difficulties in using the conventional test with mice. Animals reared in small litters obtained significantly higher scores than animals reared in large litters on 3 measures of exploratory behavior, though no differences were observed in defecation, eating, and grooming in the arena. Subjects isolated after weaning showed significantly more exploratory behavior and significantly less grooming, eating, and defecation in the test situation than animals kept in groups; males obtained significantly lower scores on 2 of the measures of exploratory behavior and on grooming than females. In general, the pattern of behavior shown by animals reared in larger litters, by animals grouped at weaning, and by males, is taken as indicating a higher level of emotionality.

abstract={Observations were made on the pecking behaviour of domestic chicks with electrolytic lesions of the isthmo-optic nuclei. Food-deprived, lesioned birds directed a higher proportion of their pecks at non-food objects than sham-operated controls and also showed an abnormal tendency to persistently peck at food grains with the beak closed. Lesioned birds also responded less readily to a novel object introduced into their posterior visual field than did controls. When tested on a food grain vs. pebble discrimination on a floor illuminated with a checkerboard pattern of light and dark, lesioned birds were almost as good as controls in the light areas but performed close to chance levels in the dark areas. These findings are consistent with earlier proposals that the centrifugal innervation to the avian retina may assist in the early detection of targets and aid visual search in shadowed areas. ¬© 1972.},

abstract={The effect of chlordiazepoxide on the retention of a passive avoidance response was determined in rats. Chlordiazepoxide or saline was given before testing in a two compartment passive avoidance response (PAR) apparatus or in an open field, and again after 48 and 72 h. The PAR was usually depressed by chlordiazepoxide (CDP) given during acquisition, and it remained present after 48 and 72 h. Treatment with chlordiazepoxide before the second and third testing abolished the depression of PAR. CDP had most effect on the acquired PAR. Shock treatment resulted in an increase in defecation and urination and a decrease in ambulation and rearing in the PAR apparatus as well as in the open field. These effects were reduced by CDP, irrespective of drug-state changes. A clear-cut reduction in defecation and urination under CDP in well-habituated home cages was also seen. The depressant effect of CDP upon the PAR is discussed in relation to the drug's inhibitory action upon the hippocampal theta activity. ¬© 1972 Springer-Verlag.},

In addition, a standardized notation system, capable of describing various maintenance procedures, is introduced and used to facilitate intra- and interexperiment comparisons. Evidence supports the conclusion that (a) the maintenance schedule variable is a relevant one in the determination of behavior; (b) hunger drive is probably determined by some joint function of body weight loss and maintenance schedule; and (c) some form of an adjusted percentage maintenance schedule appears to be the most appropriate for use in the study of rat behavior.

abstract={Five self-stimulation sites in 3 rhesus monkeys were found in the anterior and anterolateral hypothalamic areas. When the monkeys received telestimulation non-contingently at these points they showed initial behavioral hyperalerting and cessation of ongoing activity, followed by poststimulation decreases in exploratory and locomotor behavior. When paired with a more dominant monkey, non-contingent stimulation caused a marked shift to dominance behavior by the initially submissive implanted monkey. When paired with a submissive monkey, non-contingent stimulation produced much less increase in dominance behavior in the implanted animal. Pairs with initial high scores of social closeness became more distant as the stimulated animal expressed more dominance behavior. Because expression of dominance behavior appeared highly context-dependent, it was hypothesed that the primary stimulation effect was fear reduction, not induction of aggression. Further evidence for this hypothesis was obtained by demonstrating that non-contingent stimulation would reduce snake-induced fear when monkeys were tested in an avoidance-conflict paradigm. Self-stimulation at these points was unchanged by manipulation of food, water, or sex hormone levels, and the results reported were not due to poststimulus seizure activity. ¬© 1972.},

abstract={Trained 24 male albino Sprague-Dawley rats on 3 2-choice discriminations. The 1st and 3rd problems were learned to avoid shock (S1 and S3), and the 2nd problem to obtain food (F2). Immediately after reaching criterion on S3, Ss were given ECS, and retention of S1 and F2 was assessed. Under normal conditions, retention of F2 was good but retention of S1 was poor, replicating earlier findings of M. Robbins and D. Meyer (see record). However, retention of S1 was significantly improved, and retention of F2 disrupted, if a 2nd ECS was administered 15 min. before testing. A state-dependent hypothesis proposed to explain these data also accounts for a number of other ECS phenomena. A novel aspect of the hypothesis is that ECS produces retrograde dissociative effects, and that administration of a 2nd ECS creates conditions favorable to the recall of dissociated information.

Hunger potentiated mouse killing by naive Ss, but not by Ss familiarized with mice before and during food deprivation. Once Ss had been made hungry, mouse killing was unaffected by increasing or decreasing severity of food deprivation or by time of testing with respect to a regular feeding hour. Ss fed either dead mice, powdered chow, or hard pellets while on cyclic food deprivation were about equally likely to kill, showing that hunger does not indirectly potentiate killing by increasing practice of responses like pouncing and biting. Whether hungry or not, killers were likely to eat their prey, whereas nonkillers were unlikely to eat the same prey. Ss killed 12-14 day-old rat pups as often as they killed mice, but killed weanling rat pups less often. Findings question several common notions regarding predatory aggression. (26 ref.)

abstract={The effects of differential preweaning social isolation of rats during Days 17‚Äì22 on the development of muricide, open field behavior, and starvation stress tolerance were examined. Four weaning isolation groups were used in order to separate the effects of maternal and littermate isolation during this period. EMLI was deprived of maternal and littermate contact; EMI, maternal contact; and ELI, littermate contact. NWI rats were isolated on the day following normal laboratory weaning. The results indicated a marked decrease in muricide in response to maternal isolation (EMLI and EMI) and a slight decrease in response to littermate isolation. In the open field the maternally isolated rats were more active than the other groups and exhibited less defecation. There were, however, notable differences between EMLI and EMI. EMLI was more active than EMI in the open field and exhibited an increase in activity over the 4 testing periods while EMI, ELI, and NWI decreased activity. EMLI was clearly hyperactive during muricide testing while EMI was the least active. EMI rats weighed less than those in the other groups on Days 35, 50, and 100 but survived terminal food deprivation the longest. Significant differences in nonstressed adrenal gland weight were observed among groups but did not appear to correlate with any of the other measures. Terminal starvation eliminated these differences. Starvation also induced muricide in nonkillers in each of the groups. NWI rats appeared to be most easily converted and exhibited more consistent muricide than the other groups. These results are discussed in terms of a theory of altered forebrain regulation of emotional reactivity in response to preweaning stress and isolation. Copyright ¬© 1972 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

abstract={Appearance of behaviour patterns, their relative frequency of performance, pup-pup and pup-mother interactions were studied in gerbils raised under two levels of stimulation. Pups spent most of their time sleeping or nursing until day 18 (just prior to eye-opening) when many new patterns emerged and activity increased greatly. The more-stimulated groups spent significantly more time quietly than the less-stimulated group and a treatment√ódays interaction was found for sitting alert. No differences between both groups of mothers were found but both retrieved very infrequently as compared with rats and mice. The significance of these findings was discussed in light of hypotheses relating amount of infantile stimulation to later emotionality. ¬© 1972.},

abstract={The lack of terms representing time lags is a widely recognized weakness of the Volterra-Gause formulations of population growth and interaction. A number of analytical attempts to include time lag terms have been made in the past, but they have provided relatively little ecological insight. In this paper the Volterra-Gause equations for a predator and two competing prey are modified to include a number of time lags, and studied by simulation. The modifications include lags in the response to intra- and inter-specific competition and food supply, and terms that represent the "hunger" of the predator population. Predation is made size-selective as a function of hunger, and refuges are provided for the prey. Adding these factors greatly increases the variety of behavior exhibited by the model. Refuges for some minimum number of prey are required to assure persistence of the system. If the system persists its behavior ranges from damped to undamped oscillations of varying amplitude. Time lags in response of the predator to changes in prey abundance, the physiological food requirements of the predator, and the heterogeneity of the environment (as measured by prey refuges) all affect the form of the oscillations. The time lag terms can reverse the outcome of competition in some cases. In this model selective predation stabilizes otherwise unstable competitive relations. Certain results of laboratory predator-prey studies are difficult to explain in terms of the standard Volterra-Gause formalism. It is suggested that some of these features can be explained in terms of time lags in various population responses. ¬© 1972.},

abstract={Considers learning and memory within an adaptive-evolutionary framework, using an analysis of the role of learning in thiamine specific hunger. The demands of the environment on the rat, the contingencies in the natural environment, the importance of the novelty-familiarity dimension, and the realization of 2 new principles of learning, permit a learning explanation of most specific hungers. The 2 new principles, "belongingness" and "long-delay learning," specifically meet the peculiar demands of learning in the feeding system. An attempt is made to develop the laws of taste-aversion learning. It is argued that the laws or mechanism of learning are adapted to deal with particular types of problems and can be fully understood only in a naturalistic context. The "laws" of learning in the feeding system need not be the same as those in other systems. Speculations are presented concerning the evolution and development of learning abilities and cognitive function. It is concluded that full understanding of learning and memory involves explanation of their diversity and the extraction of common general principles. (108 ref.)

abstract={Mother rats were either fed ad libitum or undernourished for much of pregnancy and throughout lactation. Their offspring were cross-fostered at birth, such that the young were nutritionally deprived during only one period, either gestation or the suckling period. The growth and development of these rats were compared with those of rats from an earlier investigation which were fully fed or undernourished during both periods. Food restriction during gestation caused a 10% deficit in birth weight, but from the fifth postnatal day the growth rate was almost entirely determined by the postnatal nutritional regime. The effect of nutritional deprivation during gestation on reflex ontogeny and the development of physical features was negligible, while that of postnatal underfeeding was highly significant with respect to most characteristics maturing after day 10. Only the appearance of certain aspects of exploratory behaviour showed evidence of being retarded by gestational restriction. Nutrition during the suckling period was a major determinant of the frequency of upward responding in the open field. Balancing ability at 21 days tended to be impaired in rats underfed during the suckling period. The results are discussed in relation to the vulnerable period hypothesis of brain growth and development and its application to the human species. ¬© 1967.},

abstract={Examined S. Revusky's suggestion that long delay learning of taste aversions in rats can be explained by the "belongingness" or "preparedness" principle. The long-delay capability is attributed to minimal taste interference in the period between cs and ucs, I.e., only tastes have much associability with poisoning and rats ordinarily experience few tastes other than the one designated as cs within a long period prior to poisoning. In experiments with 153 female white rats, it was demonstrated that longer delays led to smaller learned taste aversions, even if no interfering tastes were available during the delay. The explicit introduction of 3 novel or previously poisoned interfering solutions during the delay interval did not prevent a learned aversion to novel sucrose. It is concluded that although the relative absence of interference may contribute to the long delays possible in taste-aversion learning, it cannot be the sole explanation of this phenomenon.

Within 10 min. following exposure to the water and after consuming approximately 3 ml/100 gm of body weight (about 60% of their total 1-hr intake), Ss began to eat. Data suggest that the inhibition of food intake (resulting from the need to defend the body water balance) was released very quickly following access to water.

The appearance of 2 out of 3 physical features, and of 4 out of 8 reflexes was significantly delayed in the undernourished group. Generally, characteristics which normally appear in the first week of postnatal life were not significantly affected; whereas most of those appearing later were significantly delayed. When rats were 9, 13, 17 and 21 days old their behaviour in an open field was observed. Exploratory responses were first seen significantly later in undernourished young. Though they moved about the field as much as the controls, they made significantly fewer upward-directed responses on the first 3 days of testing.

abstract={Lesions in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) of 13 adult female albino Sprague-Dawley rats produced hyperphagia, obesity, and finickiness and decreased the latency to feed in a novel environment, a test which should be little influenced by VMH damage according to the satiety center hypothesis. A similar decrease in latency to feed was produced in controls by food deprivation. Lesions in the corticomedial amygdala (CMA) of 7 Ss inhibited feeding in a novel environment but did not influence ad-lib food intake in the home cage. The CMA-lesioned Ss performed like controls in tests of open-field activity and shuttle-box avoidance, indicating that an interpretation of the observed inhibition of feeding in terms of increased emotional reactivity is unlikely. 6 Ss with combined VMH and CMA lesions responded to food like VMH-lesioned Ss, suggesting that the influence of the amygdaloid mechanisms is mediated by the ventromedial hypothalamus.

abstract={Ischemic heart disease occurs at near-epidemic proportions in Western civilization. Although all persons, especially Caucasian males, are "at risk," there is a constellation of factors that apparently characterizes those individuals whose lives may be jeopardized prematurely. Available epidemiologic evidence indicates that the presence of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and heavy cigarette smoking, either singly or in combination, are definite risk factors in the over-all population. Factors such as excessive obesity, heavy coffee drinking, diabetes mellitus and a positive family history of ischemic heart disease are also important, even though additional clarification of their over-all importance is still needed. In more recent years, two other areas of the life pattern have been strongly implicated as risk factors; namely, behavioral characteristics and habits of physical activity, either occupational or leisure-time. Unfortunately, these two areas were not well explored in some of the earliest large-scale epidemiologic studies, and further documentation of their influence on the natural history of ischemic heart disease is still required. The evidence available at present strongly suggests that individuals can be classified prospectively according to their behavioral traits and habits of activity. In general, the individuals with overzealous, poorly directed drive, increased Hypochondriasis (MMPI) and increased Activity Drive (TTS) have a higher incidence of myocardial infarction than do those subjects who lack these characteristics. Rosenman and Friedman labeled such individuals as possessing personality pattern Type A, whereas Wolf et al. suggested that their life style was patterned after that of the Greek mythologic character Sisyphus. The rate of myocardial infarction appears to be approximately one-half that of the sedentary population in men who are either regularly physically active throughout life or who enjoy an occupation that demands regular physical activity; i.e., bus conductors, mailmen, etc. In general, lifelong physically active men are characterized by a paucity of risk factors, whereas the sedentary population and Type A individuals often possess one or more. These findings suggest that the clinical manifestations of ischemic heart disease should be preventable if a suitable program were instituted in early life, preferably in the adolescent years. Such a program should be multifaceted and should include appropriate dietary manipulation, psychotherapy or improved education regarding behavioral traits, and supervised programs of regular physical activity. Of the three approaches, physical activity might be considered the keystone, since it offers a positive approach to health maintenance and can serve as the source around which an individual modifies the remainder of his life style. Coordination of the educational system and family structure with the efforts of the physician will be required to make such a preventive program feasible and successful.0. ¬© 1970 Year Book Medical Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={The consequence of early overnutrition on later behaviour of rats was tested during the first year of life under conditions of different complexity. The behaviour patterns of overfed rats were compared with those of animals, kept under common nutritional conditions and of rats undernourished prior to weaning. It was demonstrated, that early overnutrition is not beneficial for later exploratory behaviour, learning ability, and the resistance to the pharmacological or nutritional stress. The trend of the observed behavioural responses was identical both in the over-and undernourished rats, differences appeared to be quantitative rather than qualitative. ¬© 1970 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract={The problem is here reexamined of why the caterpillas of Lymantria dispar (L.) and Orgyia antiqua (L.) die of starvation while striving towards the light when inside a test tube (as observed by LOEB), but yet are able to turn away from light in their natural habitat if they reach the extremity of a leafless branch (as observed by DEEGENER). The results of the research are: 1. The caterpillars‚Äô tendency to crawl towards the light is inhibited by a specific stimulus namely: ¬´ lack of tactile stimuli in the forelegs ¬ª. 2. The ¬´ crawling straight towards ¬ª is suddenly inhibited by lack of tactile stimuli in the direction of light. 3. The ¬´ reorientation turn ¬ª or ¬´ steering mechanism ¬ª is inhibited by lack of tactile stimuli in the upwards direction after a few repetitions of the reaction. Both conditions are present when the caterpillars are on a horizontal stick but not when inside a horizontal test tube. 4. The inhibition of the reaction to light allows the caterpillars to revert to an ¬´ exploratory behaviour ¬ª that prevents the animal from being stuck at a dead end. This lasts for a certain period of time after which the crawling towards the light is resumed. 5. The period of time spent in exploratory behaviour crawling away from light becomes longer with subsequent inhibitions of the reaction to light. ¬© 1970 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Theta activity clearly demonstrated during exposure to a novel environment, decreased during repeated presentations of that environment. Food deprivation reinstated theta activity, but was immediately "blocked" when feeding was initiated. Water deprivation and drinking yielded results parallel to those obtained with food. A similar "blocking" was observed when the animal engaged in grooming behavior. In an effort to resolve certain conflicting results, a tentative hypothesis was suggested in which hippocampal theta activity was related to attention mechanisms (information processing) and hippocampal desynchronization (theta "blocking") was related to organized response patterns. ¬© 1968.},

abstract={Food deprived cats trained to press a lever on a variable interval schedule for milk reward displayed bursts of relatively large amplitude spindle ECoG activity topographically restricted to the parieto-occipital region during the consumption of reward. An attempt was made to explore the mechanisms involved in these ECoG phenomena known as post-reinforcement synchronization (PRS). When each lever press was rewarded, the parieto-occipital cortex displayed almost continuous spindle bursts whereas the somato-sensory cortex remained desyncronized. In trained subjects both milk or water produced identical PRS. However, when water was substituted for milk during the course of an experiment, PRS was completely suppressed and overt signs of emotionality appeared. Subjects allowed to drink milk from a bowl displayed a similar topographically restricted ECoG synchronization. Both types of consummatory ECoG synchronization were suppressed in darkness or by novel environmental stimuli, and both were indiscernible from sleep-spindle ECoG activity recorded from the same region in satiated subjects, although during sleep the occurrence of spindles did not depend on the presence of light and their cortical distribution was more diffuse. Subjects were habituated to a tone (850 c/sec) or click which did not disrupt their performance and the occurrence of PRS or sleep. The primary and secondary evoked potentials recorded from various cortical projections during bursts of PRS were conspicuously augmented. Their amplitude, much greater than that recorded during relaxed wakefulness in satiated subjects, was comparable to that observed during spindle-slow wave sleep. The evoked potentials recorded after non-rewarded lever pressing; i.e., during desynchronized ECoG activity were poorly developed; they were comparable to those observed during emotional excitement. Considering the similarity of PRS patterns and sleep ECoG synchronization and assuming that the amplitude of auditory evoked potentials produced by an irrelevant stimulus reflects the fluctuations in the tonus of the reticular activating system (RAS), our results suggest that: (1) PRS is triggered by a transient depression of RAS; and (2) there is a functional overlap between reward centers and hypnogenic (i.e., synchronizing) influences. ¬© 1968.},

abstract={1. Responsiveness to inanimate objects was studied in feral M. fuscata by: (a) observing reactions to naturally occurring objects, (b) placing novel toys along paths and on rocks, and (c) presenting novel dolls in conjunction with food, as in a conflict test. 2. Spontaneous manipulation seemed less frequent and less persistent than in laboratory primates. Children accounted for a vast majority of such activity. The dominant modes of reaction to novel objects were cautious in nature, albeit avoidance was often impossible to observationally distinguish from indifference, especially in adult males. Emotional displays were rare, presumably because of Ss' ability to make spatial adjustments and thus control the effective intensity of stimulation. 3. The larger a doll, or the closer it was to a food kettle, the fewer and the farther the approaching monkeys. With time more Ss began to approach, but adaptation was slow. 4. The data were discussed in relation to problems of social behavior and instrumentation, and to the general problem of measuring responsiveness in the laboratory and the field.},

abstract={This paper reviews briefly some salient findings concerning the relations between ecology and social structure of primate populations. Referring specifically to open country ground dwelling macaques and baboons correlations between a multi-male reproductive unit and a one-male unit and relatively food rich and food poor environments respectively are found. Predation and the availability of safe sleeping sites also affect structure. Intraspecific constrasts in social organization may be pronounced and appear to relate to well-defined differences in habitat. The maintenance and division of social groups is dependent upon population (group) size, the type of structure and the pattern of affiliative relations within groups. These determine the manner of group splitting. Kinship is considered a vital factor in maintaining the stability of social relations in these primate groups. In the heat of experimental research it is easy to forget that the meaning of an experiment rests upon full comprehension of the norms of a species behaviour. As primate social studies develop in the laboratory they must be matched with field studies of an equal sophistication. For these to be effective careful selection of personnel, resources for their training and an adequate financial backing are essentials. ¬© 1968.},

abstract={The habitats and foods of ten species of finches studied near Oxford, England, are described in detail, and differences in feeding habits between them are related to differences in bill‚Äê and leg‚Äêstructure, body‚Äêweight and behaviour. The Hawfinch, Siskin, Redpoll and Crossbill live primarily in woodland, the Greenfinch, Linnet and Goldfinch primarily in farmland, while the Bullfinch and Chaffinch breed, and occur throughout the year, in both these habitats. Habitat differences between species were probably more marked in primeval England than now, and the problems of studying animals in man‚Äêmodified environments are discussed in this context. Diet was studied by observation and by gut‚Äêanalyses of live and dead finches. Before roosting, finches usually accumulate food in their gullet, which is expandable but otherwise undifferentiated (the term ‚Äúcrop‚Äù is thus inappropriate). The Lesser Redpoll, the smallest species studied, can store up to about 0.8 c.c. of food in its gullet, but the Greenfinch, one of the largest finches, up to 2.5 c.c. Among the Carduelis finches, the Greenfinch lives mainly on the large seeds of various trees, cereal crops and agricultural weeds; the Goldfinch on the seeds of Compositae; the Siskin on alder and conifer seeds; the Lesser Redpoll on birch and other small seeds; and the Linnet on the seeds of various weeds of farmland. The Hawfinch and Bullfinch eat a greater proportion of buds and seeds from fleshy fruits than do other finches; but the Hawfinch prefers larger ones than does the Bullfinch. The three European crossbills feed almost entirely on conifer seeds; specializing on different tree species. In summer, the Chaffinch and Brambling live largely on invertebrates but in winter on beechmast or small seeds taken from the ground. In winter, Chaffinches reaching Britain from northern Europe tend to feed in large flocks in open areas and to roost communally, while residents tend to remain near their breeding places and roost singly. The migrations and distribution of finches in Europe are described briefly. At any time of winter, closely related species with similar feeding habits are often concentrated in different parts of a common wintering range. Furthermore, in some species, such as the Goldfinch and Chaffinch, the sexes winter mainly in different areas. In Oxford, food was least readily available during hard (winter) weather and there was then complete segregation in diet between different species, but at other times their diets often overlapped considerably. The overlap was much more pronounced in the species living in farmland (which is an artificial habitat) than in those living in natural or seminatural woodland; some tentative explanations for this are offered. The fringilline finches, the Chaffinch and Brambling, feed their young entirely on invertebrates, are territorial in the breeding season and collect food mostly within their territories. The cardueline finches, on the other hand, feed their young mainly, or entirely, on seeds, often nest in ‚Äúloose colonies‚Äù and usually gather food communally at some distance from their nests. The fringilline finches carry food in their bills to the young, which therefore receive small, but frequent, meals; whereas the carduelines feed their young by regurgitation and at longer intervals. Among the carduelines, the Hawfinch is exceptional in that seeds are first swallowed and regurgitated to the nestlings, whereas insects are carried in the bill. The Bullfinch develops in the breeding season special buccal pouches in which food is carried to the young. In general, most finches select diets for their young which differ from their own diets in the breeding season. The Crossbill and Linnet often feed their young on seeds alone, and some other species may do so occasionally. The breeding of these carduelines is therefore independent of a supply of invertebrates, but always coincides with an abundance of seeds. They breed at seasons when other birds do not; the most extreme cases are the three crossbills, which, given an abundance of suitable seeds, will nest at any time of year. The process of seed‚Äêhusking is described; the strength of the jaws, the extent of the gape and the width of the palatal grooves limit the size and hardness of seeds which a given species can take. No two species have bills of the same shape and size, and differences in diet between species are connected with differences in the structure of their bills and the way the bill is used. In general, the deeper the bill of a finch, the more numerous the types of seeds in its diet. The Greenfinch, Linnet and Redpoll have relatively short broad bills and feed more than do other Carduelis finches from plants whose seeds are relatively exposed (e.g. grasses) or enclosed within pods or capsules; they also pick up many fallen seeds from the ground, but each species concentrates on different sizes of seeds. The Goldfinch and Siskin have reIatively long, narrow bills and obtain much of their food by probing into cones and into the seed‚Äêheads of Com‚Äêpositae; unlike other finches, they also use a gaping movement while feeding. The Goldfinch has a longer bill and eats more Compositae seeds than the Siskin, while tlie latter eats more tree seeds than the Goldfinch. Further, male Goldfinches have slightly longer beaks than females, and hence can obtain teasel seeds more efficiently; females feed only rarely from these plants. The Bullfinch and Hawfinch obtain much of their food by crushing fruits, seed‚Äêheads, etc. in their bills and peeling off the outer layer to get the seeds. The methods used by the crossbill species to open cones of varying degrees of hardness are described in detail. The Chaffinch and Brambling obtain almost all their food by rapid pecks; they show none of the behaviour patterns used by carduelines to open various types of seed‚Äêheads. Species also differ in the proportion of food obtained from the ground, from vegetation, or on the wing. These differences are related to the various positions in which each species is able to feed. Those species (Goldfinch, Siskin, Redpoll and Crossbills) which are most adept at clinging and hanging feed mainly from trees and herbaceous plants, while those that are least adept at this (Chaffinch and Brambling) obtain almost all their food from the ground or from firm horizontal twigs. The remaining species are intermediate in the proportion of time spent feeding from the ground or from vegetation; and only the Chaffinch, Brambling and Bullfinch obtain an appreciable amount of food on the wing. Differences between species in the frequency with which various positions are adopted during feeding can be related to differences in their average body weights, and (to a lesser extent) in their leg‚Äêstructure; the most agile species are either light in weight or have relatively short strong legs. Body‚Äêweight, leg‚Äêproportions and bill‚Äêsize (and hence feeding habits) may vary considerably between different populations of the same species. In Appendix 2, the leg‚Äêproportions of certain English finches are compared with those of their German and Russian counterparts. Some finch species use their feet in coordination with their bill to obtain food. The extent to which various species do this in the wild is discussed in relation to the ease with which they can be taught experimentally to pull up food suspended on the end of a long thread. The ecology, structure and behaviour of finches is discussed in relation to some current ideas on speciation and the ontogeny of feeding behaviour. The young of several species of finches respond initially to a similar range of potential food‚Äêitems (both in size and appearance) and all attempt to deal with them in similar ways. However, each individual soon learns to concentrate on those foods it can obtain most efficiently with its own particular structures and behaviour patterns. It is thus the structural and behavioural differences between closely‚Äêrelated species which lead the individuals of each to prefer different foods. Further, some of the behaviour patterns themselves probably develop mainly as a result of learning conditioned by structure, so that some of the behavioural differences between species that affect food‚Äêchoice are in turn dependent on structural differences. This implies that, from an evolutionary viewpoint, two forms need diverge only in structure (and not necessarily ‚Äúpsychologically‚Äù) for some ecological segregation to be achieved. There are, however, certain differences in feeding behaviour between the fringillines and carduelines that cannot be attributed merely to structural differences between the two groups, so presumably some ‚Äúpsychological factor‚Äù is also important in the development of these particular behaviour patterns. A close relationship between the structure, feeding behaviour and food of an animal is usually taken for granted, but it is often difficult to decide which of these came first in evolution. Among finches, however, there are sometimes indications that a structural change was necessary before a new behaviour pattern or feeding habit could evolve, though further modification of structure may then occur through adaptation to the new foods thereby made available. Some evolutionary trends among finches are described, and the role of competition in the evolution and maintenance of ecological differences between species is discussed. The effect of social experience on feeding behaviour is also discussed, and some examples are given of the spread of novel food‚Äêhabits among finches, and of presumed traditional differences in feeding behaviour between different populations of the same species. Finally, some recent changes in food, and habitat‚Äêselection by finches are discussed in relation to problems of conservation. Copyright ¬© 1967, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract={This study, employing six groups of non-psychotic, unmedicated male subjects, ranging from six to sixty in number in each group, replicates and expands on previous work concerning the effects of a number of variables on the initial baseline transcephalic d.c. potential (IP) and the baseline d.c. shift (Œ¥P) after a 10-min test period involving the subjects in performing mental tasks. In agreement with prior studies, the range of IP was found to be from -25¬∑0 to + 30¬∑0 mV and appears to be unaffected by age or intelligence. Anxiety increases the variance of the group tested. Subjects tend to be most negative around 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. and 2-3 hr after eating. Heavy eaters show a decreased -Œ¥P in response to novel stimuli, faecal retainers show a more positive IP and a more negative Œ¥P, and mild urinary retention increases the variance of the IP. Subjects with an allergic history show a general increase of both negative IP and Œ¥P. A 20-min waiting period abolishes any effect of nicotine inhalation. The greatest stimulus to promote a -Œ¥P is one requiring the subject to develop a new and complex orientation in order to respond to a task. ¬© 1967.},

However the preference broke down when the calcium salt was offered in the form of calcium lactate in the drinking water, for both the deprived and control birds preferred distilled water. Finally deprived birds were tested to find out whether calcium deprivation led to a greater interest in bizarre objects of edible size, for specific hungers may lead to exploratory behaviour from which the animal may learn to correct its deficiency. The calcium deprived birds were found to show more interest in bizarre objects of edible size. ¬© 1966 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

abstract={1. An attempt has been made to correlate a group of symptoms that usually apperar will feelings of strangeness. They are: a felling of not belonging, inferiority feelings and a fear of being alone. Fears of death and "insanity" are frequently encountered. 2. Every individual, instinctively or biologically, requires affection, in the same manner that he requires air and food for the maintenance of his well-being. When the affection is not forth-coming from his parents, the child becomes starved or insecure. In his great hunger, the child looks eagerly about but can only ingest a consistent emptiness of affect that he finds in his parents. Therein lies the origin of the complaint of "feelinglessness" or strangeness. A child can only respond with sufficient feeling when it has absorbed adequate quantities from its environment. The findings of the absence of affective support are usually not elicited. In fact, information to the opposite effect is frequently obtained. The latter will be found to be the product of parental deification and the reaction formation in parents against their own deficiencies. 3. As a means of compensation, the very disagreeable feeling of strangeness is boldly employed by the organism as a protective measure against anxiety. Its fabric likewise infiltrates into the whole personality, inducing an artificial and affectless makeup, with a corresponding impersonal demeanor. ¬© 1963 Johnson Reprint Corporation.},

abstract={Long-term prognosis in the individual patient with coronary heart disease is unpredictable. However, there are broad patterns of survival in the various clinical syndromes which may be expressed in sufficiently quantitative terms to allow an estimate of insurability. Clinical and actuarial studies are surveyed comprising long-term follow-up of groups having: (1) acute attacks of myocardial infarction, (2) angina pectoris, (3) atypical chest pain, (4) asymptomatic electrocardiographic abnormalities, including bundle branch block and T-wave abnormalities, (5) electrocardiographic evidence of coronary insufficiency on performance of exercise or hypoxemia stress tests. Prognosis is expressed most conveniently in terms of mortality ratios (actual to expected deaths), i.e., the relative number in a group succumbing compared to the relative number in the general population of the same age and sex dying in the some period. In most clinical studies the long-term prognosis, i.e., survival after the initial period of acute coronary attacks, has been analyzed in terms of the percentage alive after five and ten years. Mortality in the first two years after a coronary attack is of the order of six to seven times normal (mortality ratio of 600 to 700 per cent). Thereafter it falls progressively, with increasing intervals of time after the attack. Other factors have significant bearing on survival after coronary attacks. The milder the acute attack, the more complete the recovery, and the older the age at which it occurs, the more favorable the long-term outlook. In such groups, life expectancy may far exceed the over-all average experience, which in most studies has been that 3 of 5 persons surviving acute infarction live a further five years, and 1 of 3 survives ten years. Conversely, in persons who have accompanying disorders predisposing to progression of coronary disease, such as diabetes, the long-term outlook is poorer than average. Mortality ratios are somewhat better in persons with angina pectoris than in those who have had known attacks of myocardial infarction, although in one very extensive study the five- and ten-year survival rates were not significantly higher. Long-term prognosis is slightly better in females than in males both in instances of angina pectoris and after coronary attacks. Asymptomatic electrocardiographic abnormalities also have an adverse effect on survival. Mortality in those with major T-wave abnormalities is approximately three and one-half times the normal, and in those with minor T-wave changes it is twice the normal. Bundle branch block, at one time considered an ominous finding, is not (in the absence of accompanying physical impairments) associated with any striking increase in mortality ratios and is prognostically less unfavorable than T-wave abnormalities. Among those who have ischemic electrocardiographic changes after exercise, mortality rates are almost threefold greater than among those with a negative response. Actuarial investigations, as well as epidemiologic studies on the rate of development of coronary heart disease, indicate that the risk of developing overt disease may be multiplied several fold in the presence of various predisposing factors, particularly when multiple factors are present concurrently. Among these are elevated serum cholesterol, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, strong family history of coronary disease, heavy smoking, sustained stressful personality pattern, and arcus senilis. There are indications that the course of coronary heart disease may be modified, and that the pattern of survival may begin to approach that of the average population by controlling some of the predisposing factors, and by application of such measures as dietary restriction of fat and prolonged anticoagulation. Persons with coronary heart disease, of whatever type, as groups, have an abbreviated life expectancy, and the great majority succumb to complications of their coronary disease, most commonly recurrent acute coronary attacks or sudden death, and, more particularly in older persons, congestive heart failure. However, clinical and actuarial experience indicates that long-term mortality ratios following attacks of myocardial infarction and in other syndromes of coronary heart disease are not prohibitive; and insurability may be considered in appropriate circumstances, e.g., at an interval after recovery from acute attack, when functional recovery is good, and when there are no accompanying adverse factors. ¬© 1959.},

abstract={The majority of studies referred to in the foregoing discussion of treatments directed presumptively against the nervous system lesions suffer from the defect of inadequate control of the methods used so that results reported lack statistical validity. As already pointed out, however, such control is difficult to attain in this disorder. In none of the therapies described has here been a high degree of benefit, uniform or lasting improvement, or significant corroboration by other investigators. Although it is unlikely that a generally effective or universally applicable specific therapy is available, the point must be born in mind that in each therapy proposed, there may be those who have had actual benefit from the therapy applied. Considering our continued ignorance concerning etiology and pathogenesis, the indefatigable efforts of clinicians to arrive at some solution to the difficult problem of specific therapy on empiric, presumptive, semirational, or rational grounds may be viewed as reflecting the constant striving of medicine to render help to the unfortunate victim of multiple sclerosis despite the severe difficulties encountered in this field. It is therefore reasonable, in order to give the patient every potential benefit, to carry out a trial of one or more such therapies, the selection being dictated by the status of the patient or more or less arbitrarily by the physician. It should be nevertheless emphasized that once therapies have been shown, after longer follow-up, through repeated endeavors, or under conditions of maximal control, to be valueless, it would seem unfair to perpetuate their use. Whether it is justified to continue to apply therapies which cannot be disproved to have value in some patients, even though proof of value in others or in all is lacking, remains debatable. General supportive and hygienic measures: Several studies have shown psychotherapy to be of probable value in ameliorating the course of the disease as shown by an apparent reduction in the frequency of recurrent episodes and apparent maintenance of a status of lesser disability.23,61,122 How this is brought about is unknown, though the prevention of possible pathophysiologic alterations secondary to pernicious emotional reactions, such as vasoconstriction, for example, has been postulated. General morale-building, supportive psychotherapy as well as more specific psychiatric treatment directed toward personality problems and emotional conflicts are often indicated for the well-being of the patient with multiple sclerosis and perhaps may be shown eventually to have more specific value if factors of life stress and attendant emotional factors contribute to pathogenesis. As a background for whatever other measures of therapy are directed toward the patient, the physician should demonstrate willingness to care for the multiple sclerosis sufferer and to preserve an optimistic attitude. Because first attacks and new episodes seem often to follow upon physical strain, exhaustion, or chilling, the avoidance of these should be sought. Limited programs of activity commensurate with the patient's capacity and tolerance during static or steadily progressive phases, and prolonged rest following new episodes are in all probability helpful in preserving optimal control over the course of the disease. Vigorous treatment of coexistent or intercurrent infections may diminish the possible risk of worsening of the disease or precipitating a relapse. It is doubtful whether removal to a warmer climate is of specific value in modifying the course of the disease except as it represents opportunity for rest and freedom from stresses inherent in the patient's usual situation. The preservation of optimal nutrition by means of a generally well-balanced, high calorie, high vitamin diet has already been referred to. Operations and general anesthesia should be avoided if elective and not absolutely essential. Certain types of anesthesia (such as spinal and perhaps inhalant with ether) may have a deleterious effect and should probably be avoided. The long-held notion of a deleterious effect of pregnancy on the course of the disease has been cast into doubt by recent statistical studies. On the basis of these reports, pregnancy would not appear to be contraindicated unless the emotional or physical stresses consequent upon subsequent child rearing are great. It is doubtful that pregnancy should ever be interrupted because of multiple sclerosis save where vital functions of the mother are threatened because of an advanced state of incapacitation. Symptomatic Therapy. - Symptomatic therapy will remain the most important aspect of the management of patients with multiple sclerosis until specific curative or preventive measures are at hand. Aid for symptoms of multiple sclerosis is available for motor dysfunction, bladder and bowel disturbances, ocular imbalance, and mood deviations. Motor dysfunction: The motor loss in multiple sclerosis consists of weakness, muscle wasting, loss of functional patterns, ataxia, intention tremor, impairment of fine skilled acts, spasticity, involuntary reflex spasms, and muscle contractures restricting full range of motion at the joints. Techniques of physical therapy developed to counteract all these phenomena may be used to advantage. In addition, drugs are being introduced, which are effective in counteracting spasticity and reflex spasms. Physical therapy is of no value for the nonmotor symptoms of multiple sclerosis (visual, speech, sensory, bladder, etc.). It is probably contraindicated in acute phases of the disease where rest would appear to favor reparative processes in the central nervous system. It may contribute to some extent to a slowing of the rate of progressive incapacitation in those cases where a slow steady downhill progression is evident. Its maximal usefulness appears to be in those patients who have residual motor disabilities but are in a relatively static phase of the disease. Gait training, to improve efficiency and safety and help in learning new ways of achieving the innumerable daily acts of living, are of special importance in increasing the independence of such patients. Drugs to reduce spasticity and reflex spasms continue to be evaluated. Mephenesin (Tolserol) and curare are but little used for this purpose now. Chlorpromazine (Thorazine) and meprobamate (Equanil, Miltown) have been shown to have slight muscle relaxing properties on oral administration. The most recently developed synthetic oral skeletal muscle relaxants, zoxazolamine (Flexin), methocarbamol (Robaxin), chlorzoxazone (Paraflex) appear in some patients to have some effect in reducing spasticity and flexor spasms, but as yet no ideal agent for this purpose is available. When spasticity is extremely severe with hyperadduction and scissoring of the lower limbs, excessive involuntary flexion spasms, and beginning deformity due to contractures, the likelihood of ever regaining useful function of the lower limbs is remote. In such instances, as a measure of last resort for symptomatic help, surgical intervention should be considered. This may be selective alcohol block or surgical section of lumbosacral motor nerve roots to bring about permanent relaxation of lower limb muscles. Such procedures usually add greatly to the patient's comfort and alleviate nursing problems, though permanent paralysis of the denervated muscle groups must be accepted. Bladder and rectal dysfunction: The lesser degrees of bladder dysfunction such as urgency, frequency, and occasional mild incontinence may be effectively relieved through the use of anticholinergic drugs including the belladonna alkaloids, especially atropine, and the synthetic preparations such as propanthelihe (Pro-Banthine) and isopropamide (Darbid). Though fecal incontinence is less common than urinary incontinence, these drugs similarly inhibit involuntary rectal overactivity. The more common rectal symptom of constipation has been effectively treated by use of an oral detergent, dioctyl sodium sulfocuccinate (Doxinate, Colace) and mild peristaltic stimulants such as senna derivatives (Senokot) or cascara. Another commercial preparation useful for the latter purpose has been Dorbane. Many patients are able to establish quite regular bowel habits with spontaneous evacuations every second or third day through the help of these agents. In other patients regular bowel emptying is impossible save with the use of regularly given enemas, usually not more often than at 2- or 3-day intervals. In patients with more advanced disease where there is total loss of bladder control, an indwelling catheter is essential to counteract the damaging effects of chronic urinary retention. The catheter may be attached either to a tidal drainage apparatus, providing a somewhat more physiologic and rhythmic filling and emptying of the bladder, or simply to a dependent rubber drainage tube leading to a reservoir. Rubber urinals strapped to the thigh are quite useful and practical for this purpose if the patient is ambulatory or in a wheel chair. Complications in relation to bladder disturbances are discussed below. Patients frequently seek symptomatic help for visual disturbances. The impairment of visual acuity due to retrobulbar neuritis cannot, of course, be helped, and patients should be discouraged from repeated refractions and changes of lenses. Diplopia, present as long as both eyes are open, may be eliminated through the use of a plastic eye shield alternately covering one eye or the other. Many patients with multiple sclerosis are euphoric and apparently in little emotional distress. Others, however, seem perpetually irritable, dissatisfied, tense, apprehensive, or depressed. The long-term use of one of the newer ataractics is justified if an ameliorating effect on the emotional disturbance is achieved by one of these agents. It should be borne in mind that aside from providing comfort and operating as a symptomatic measure, it is possible that the relieving of pernicious emotional states may be of benefit to the specific disease process itself. Treatment of Complications. - The complications of bladder dysfunction are those of secondary infection, formation of bladder calculi, and obstruction of bladder drainage from encrustation of the catheter. The prevention of these complications may be assisted through daily irrigation of the bladder with 180 to 240 c.c. of 0.5 per cent acetic acid, liberal intake of liquids, the daily administration of an antacid such as a colloidal aluminum gel, and substitution of clean sterile catheters at intervals. The inhibition of the excretion of phosphates in the urine, formation of stones, and encrustation of the catheter has been claimed to follow the use of oral antacids. In the absence of encrustation of the catheter and evidence of acute infection, the catheter may be left in place indefinitely. Regular urinalysis to determine the degree of inevitable pyuria, and culture of the urine especially when there is systemic or local evidence of acute genitourinary tract infection should be carried out, followed by treatment with appropriate chemotherapeutic and antibiotic agents when indicated. When patients are chair-ridden or bedridden, decubitus ulcers sooner or later become a problem and should be treated by the usual conservative measures, which will often lead to healing. These are avoidance of further pressure, wet dressings, in some instances the application of antibiotic solutions or ointments, in others simply exposure to air followed by dry sterile dressings. If necessary, surgical repair should be carried out, including d√©bridement and grafting. Though pain is an infrequent symptom in multiple sclerosis, the occasional occurrence of facial pain resembling trigeminal neuralgia demands help. High doses of orally administered nicotinic acid (100 to 200 mg. four times a day) seems in some instances to be associated with relief of the paroxysms. The response of this symptom to high doses of vitamin B12 parenterally has been quite as inconsistent as has been the response of other symptoms of multiple sclerosis. Peripheral alcohol block of the involved trigeminal division as a temporary measure followed by eventual trigeminal root section has been resorted to when pain was persistent and recurrent. Why this should be helpful is unclear. The complication of acute pulmonary infection is treated in the usual way. In the far advanced patient, aspiration pneumonia or hypostatic pneumonia may be terminal events regardless of therapy. ¬© 1960.},

abstract={This paper describes the basic entomological study necessary in an investigation of the effectiveness of Chrysomela gemellata Rossi and C. hyperici Forst. as controls of St. John‚Äôs wort, Hypericum perforatum L. var. angustifolium DC, in the Bright district, Victoria. The investigation has shown that the conditions prevailing in the Bright district during the study period must have been generally near the limit of tolerance of both C. gemellata and C. hyperici, parts being a little above and parts definitely below this limit. Furthermore, largely because of certain behaviour responses, neither insect has been able to colonize the timbered areas infested by Hypericum. The total area favouring the multiplication of the insects forms only a small part of the area colonized successfully by Hypericum. Within the zone favourable to the beetles, they have failed to control Hypericum effectively except in small, treeless areas adjoining densely timbered country infested by the weed (in such places the timbered area has acted as a damping factor to population fluctuation, enabling the insects to persist in moderate numbers). Although adverse conditions have played an important part in limiting the effectiveness of the insects, their failure has been due primarily to their own characteristics. Both species have poor powers of dispersal and a relatively poor ability to multiply. In the most favourable sites, both species are able to multiply within a few years to a density high enough to cause complete defoliation of the host plant, which usually dies out. By destroying their food and reducing their protective cover, both species suffer very heavy losses and greatly limit their own numbers. Although many individuals succumb to starvation, a large proportion of the mortality is caused by density-independent factors, e.g. frost and predation, which are allowed to operate in an intensified manner by removal of the protective cover provided by the foliage of the host plant. After completing the defoliation of the weed, the surviving beetles migrate elsewhere in search of more food. Their desertion of the site gives the host plant a chance to recover by regeneration from seed. Numerous environmental factors unfavourable to the insects, combined with their poor mobility and slow rate of increase, frequently allow the plant to recover almost completely before beetle numbers become sufficiently high to defoliate it again. Where other wort-controlling agencies are lacking, the insects have caused their host plant to fluctuate violently in density in both space and time without producing a great overall reduction in quantity. By destroying stands of Hypericum in areas in which the soils are capable of growing a dense pasture, the insects have paved the way for successful wort control by other factors, e.g. shade-producing herbage and grazing animals. Such areas virtually cease to provide habitats for the insects after the original stand of Hypericum is destroyed. ¬© 1952 CSIRO. All rights reserved.},
