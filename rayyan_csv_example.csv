Objective: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of two different light doses when treating AKs with ALA-PDT on the face/scalp. Methods: Thirty-eight patients with two histologically confirmed AKs were enrolled in the within-patient comparison study. ALA-PDT was performed twice with two weeks interval for each AK. Patients were randomized to receive a light dose of 70 or 100 J/cm(2) as their first split face/scalp treatment. Follow-up examinations were carried out at months 3 and 6. Efficacy end point included clinical/histological AK clearance rate. Results: No significant difference in therapeutic efficacy and adverse events of ALA-PDT was found between the two light doses at both follow-up visits. At months 3 and 6 after PDT the rate of complete remission were respectively 100% and 92.1% for 70 J/cm(2), 92.1% and 84.2% for 100 J/cm(2). The adverse events of the treatment were rosacea 5/76 (6.58%), hyperpigmentation 4/76 (5.26%), hypopigmentation 4/76 (5.26%), transient milia 3/76 (3.95%). Conclusions: The topical ALA-PDT with the red light dose of 70 J/cm(2) is an effective treatment for mild and moderate AKs on the face/scalp with expected adverse events of pigmentation changes, rosacea and transient milia"
